								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an incredible time for knowledge management tools. Just a couple of years ago I was pulling my hair out trying to get a local wiki to feel like a native app, and now we have a dozen great options to choose from.I started using Obsidian when it came out last year, and it instantly clicked for me. I immediately migrated 20 years of notes to it.What differentiates Obsidian from all of the other tools in this area, is that they have made extensibility a top priority. The sheer breadth of plugins, themes, and other community-driven tools that have been generated in 18 months is spectacular. It makes it easy to recommend Obsidian because you can shape it into whatever you want.There are a handful of plugins like Dataview, QuickAdd, Kanban and Periodic Notes that make Obsidian an incredibly powerful environment for thought.I made a theme for Obsidian called Minimal that attempts to make the app feel more native, especially on Mac:
https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal...and published a couple of my own plugins and a Web Clipper bookmarklet: https://gist.github.com/kepano/90c05f162c37cf730abb8ff027987...The Obsidian community is just so fun, friendly, and collaborative, that you can&#39;t help but get involved and work on making the ecosystem better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I built a simple journal solution for myself two years ago. It sends an email every day and I can reply to it, and the response is stored in an SQLite database, in plain text. The db is on a remote server but copied to Dropbox every day (and in any case all the emails also exist in my sent folder).It is surprisingly effective at storing not just what I did with my day, but random thoughts and ideas, solutions to bugs, etc. All I have to do is type something every day.In 2 years I have typed around 150k words. For reading he whole thing is just one plain html page, searchable in the browser.I&#39;m currently experimenting with documenting my reading, while the book is being read (instead of a summary at the end). We typically forget what we expect while we read, and only remember the final impression. Taking notes at the end of each reading session, not just about what I just read, but also about what I think will happen next, and revisiting that later, is surprisingly interesting."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"IPFS needs to decide what it wants to be. Is it about being a decentralized caching layer? Is it about permanently storing content? Is it about replacing my web server? Is it about replacing DNS? Is it about censorship resistance?Right now it does none of those things well. The client chews through CPU and memory when seemingly doing nothing. If I try to download content, it is far slower than BitTorrent unless I go through a centralized gateway. If I add content it takes ages to propagate, making it utterly unsuitable as a replacement for a web server. There is no system to keep content alive so links will still die. The name system is byzantine and I don&#39;t think anyone uses it.Unfortunately, they are now unable to pivot because they did that asinine ICO. The right thing to do is to give up on the FileCoin nonsense and build a system that solves a problem better than anything else, but that is no longer allowed because they already sold something else to their &#34;investors&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like IPFS, I really do, but whenever I try to use it, it&#39;s either too slow to become usable or sometimes it plain doesn&#39;t work. I pinned a whole bunch of files on IPFS a while back to experiment with it and the system seems to work, but every time I try to fetch those resources from a location that hasn&#39;t cached the content yet, it takes several seconds to show me the HTML/JSON/PNG files.HTTP may be inefficient for document storage, but IPFS is inefficient for almost everything else.I like the concepts behind IPFS but it&#39;s simply not practical to use the system in its current form. I hope my issues will get resolved at some point but I can&#39;t shake the thought that it&#39;ll die a silent death like so many attempts to replace the internet before it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pretty interesting. A lot of people here are focusing on permanence, but for me the main difference on addressing by content vs by host name is the loss of authorship it opens up for the web. Since a research paper of essay is referred to by its hash, the owner effectively gives away all control of the work when it&#39;s first published. There will be no editing, no taking down unwanted work, and no real way to build an interactive website that allows dynamic linking to other materials by the author.It&#39;s interesting how the same people promoting the &#34;creator economy&#34; also tend to promote the cryptocurrency space and IPFS without an ounce of self-awareness. IPFS sounds awful for creators of all kinds in the same way as BitTorrent was awful for artists. I can definitely see a use case for IPFS as a file storage for trustless systems such as smart contracts, which are designed as immutable, trustless systems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Incidental and subjective opinion; but I do think that The Restaurant at the End of The Universe is the best book in the series.The commentary is deeper, the jokes are funnier and the story arc feels a lot less random whilst still being surreal. The scenes at the end of the book with the Golfrinchans is a masterclass in humourous writing with a truly nasty vein of bleakness.It also features the ultimate question, of course."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was 9 when he published Hitchhiker&#39;s guide. I&#39;d just started reading and would go on to spend my teens reading ANYTHING I managed to lay my hands on. And throughout my teens everyone went on and on about Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide, and it just didn&#39;t... push me to read it. I eventually read it after being consrcipted. And it left me feeling as ambivalent as I felt before reading it.As the comments here evidence, people read much into it, and the number 42. This is great. I felt books like The Ugly American [0], Honey Badger (Robert Ruark) and King Rat [1] had more to offer. My opinion hasn&#39;t much changed - but I feel the problem lies with me, in that depth and meaning are what I value.Is humour the entirety of the draw for Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide, or  (probably more likely) have I missed something?[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ugly_American[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Rat_(Clavell_novel)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Schopenhauer used an equation with the answer of 42 to make a metaphysical point in “The World as Will and Idea.” I suspect this is the meaning Adams had in mind:As time has only one dimension, counting is the only arithmetical operation, to which all others may be reduced; and yet counting is just intuition or perception a priori, to which there is no hesitation in appealing here, and through which alone everything else, every sum and every equation, is ultimately proved. We prove, for example, not that (7 + 9 × 8 - 2)/3 = 42; but we refer to the pure perception in time, counting thus makes each individual problem an axiom. Instead of the demonstrations that fill geometry, the whole content of arithmetic and algebra is thus simply a method of abbreviating counting. We mentioned above that our immediate perception of numbers in time extends only to about ten. Beyond this an abstract concept of the numbers, fixed by a word, must take the place of the perception; which does not therefore actually occur any longer, but is only indicated in a thoroughly definite manner. Yet even so, by the important assistance of the system of figures which enables us to represent all larger numbers by the same small ones, intuitive or perceptive evidence of every sum is made possible, even where we make such use of abstraction that not only the numbers, but indefinite quantities and whole operations are thought only in the abstract and indicated as so thought, as [sqrt](r^b) so that we do not perform them, but merely symbolise them.I tried to add this on Wikipedia a while ago, but was overruled by an editor.Source: https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/38427/pg38427-images.htmlMore on Schopenhauer: https://www.locserendipity.com/TitleSearch.html?q=Schopen"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I interviewed Arthur Whitney in 2009[0], Roger came up again and again. (He only appears in the transcript once, but Arthur spoke of him several times, always with great fondness.)  Roger clearly had an outsized influence on Arthur -- in addition to his particularly close relationship with computer science pioneer Ken Iverson.  Condolences to his family -- and to his close friends like Arthur, who I know must be grieving this loss.[0] https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1531242"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of his memorable blog posts was on generating permutations in array languages[1]. In his spoiler explanation he comments about generating permutations of 0..4 starting from permutations of 0..3 and a &#34;magical matrix&#34; to do that, and then discusses:&#34;What is the “best” perm function I can write in APL? This “best” is a benchmark not only on my own understanding but also on advancements in APL over the years.&#34; and then shows one he wrote in 1981, one from 1987, then &#34;I worked on perm from time to time in this period [1990-2007] but in J rather than in APL&#34;, then one from 2008, and one from 2015, and where future improvements might be found. In a video talk on it he says &#34;some of these sub-expressions can be improved, but the APL language cannot yet express the thought that I have&#34;[2]. I just like that pattern of returning to the same problems and polishing both the language and solution over multiple decades.[1] https://www.dyalog.com/blog/2015/07/permutations/[2] https://youtu.be/e0rywC7-i0U?t=2254[3] talk is taken from his writing here, I think: https://www.jsoftware.com/papers/50/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I suspect the dissenters and Dan are not as far apart as one would expect. What I see in the dissent is a rejection of the specific brand of Silicon Valley rah rah productivity cult. There&#39;s a lot of mysticism in SV style productivity, whether it&#39;s the new hottest app or the latest lifestyle craze. It&#39;s also almost always directed at squeezing more work out of someone who&#39;s already working far too much. What Dan&#39;s proposing is a much more concrete, much more grounded sense of productivity. It&#39;s the difference between trying to get an overworked line cook to fulfill the job of 3 regular workers and watching a master chef work with no extra movements, no wasted energy.I&#39;m sympathetic to the analogy of practice. Too many people are extremely static in their assessment of their skills. They make overarching claims like &#34;oh I&#39;m just not good at cooking&#34; or &#34;I just can&#39;t type very fast&#34;, when they can remedy these issues with practice. Of course they aren&#39;t obligated to do so, but it&#39;s a useful mindset to see weaknesses as potential places of improvement instead of permanent failings. It&#39;s also true that if you&#39;re racing against someone who doesn&#39;t see it as a race, you&#39;ll win. Granted they probably won&#39;t care, but sometimes people get to the end, realize they did care about the race, and were just never clued into the fact that it was a race."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem I have with discussions about “productivity” (including 10x engineer chest-beating) is that no one ever defines what they mean by the word. Is it lots of lines of code? Is it clean design and architecture that’s easy to maintain and extend? Responding quickly to business needs? Making a lot of money in a short time?Too often, people arbitrarily choose what they’re good at, or what someone else they admire is good at, call that “productivity,” and then come up with a post-hoc rationalization of why that’s good.Note: I only skimmed the article, so consider this a comment on productivity discussions in general rather than the specific article.(Oh, and a pet peeve: the agile concept of “velocity” originally introduced by Extreme Programming is absolutely not a measure of productivity. It’s a way of predicting your capacity for the next iteration. I’ve taken to calling it “capacity” instead of velocity for that reason.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who also tracks time in some amount of detail (to bill clients for it), communication, and _written_ communication in particular takes a surprising amount of time. All those Slack threads you might not even think twice of engaging in can easily destroy half your working day, even if you ignore the cost of context switching. Emails take longer than you think. Design docs take _much_ longer than you think. Code reviews take longer than you think also.For me at least coding seems to take less time objectively than subjectively, but it&#39;s also quite obvious that most of my time is not spent on coding, sadly. A good chunk of it is completely unproductive bullshit that simply has to happen because that&#39;s how the company chooses to operate. I tell them it&#39;s not the only way to do things, but they insist on wasting ~1.5 person days a week on &#34;standups&#34; and &#34;scrum&#34; (the team is 12 people, excluding me). They could _easily_ move 50% faster if they shed that bullshit and just gave people sizable tasks and some degree of autonomy and personal responsibility. Instead it&#39;s down to who can _appear_ the busiest during standup."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Going to give a guess as to more pragmatic reason this came about: they don&#39;t have a requirement or test for it.Some engineer was asked to make a feature. That feature happened to break 3rd party seeking. It probably wasn&#39;t intentional, just incidental.Because they have no internal requirement to support this, nor anyone/anything testing for it, it silently broke.It was probably not malicious, even if it feels like a step backwards to this extension developer.Whether it _should_ be fixed of course, is a different matter, but when I see statements like &#34;DRM vendors REALLY want you to buy a smart TV&#34;[1] I frown, as it is contains an assumption of intent that I suspect isn&#39;t there.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28896614Edit: The title of the article (and original title here) is &#34;Netflix&#39;s new player is an open web nightmare&#34;. My response is written in response to this sort of inflammatory language."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sorry, a little off topic gripe about the article itself. I have gigabit internet and still noticed the two images for this article loading line by line, top to bottom. Upon inspection I see they are using massive (5.67mb &amp; 3.6mb) .png images with a resolution of 2832x1838. However, the maximum size they are ever displayed is 836x546.It took me less than 1 minute to do a quick and dirty optimization bringing them down to less than 100kb each. Here you go author:https://i.imgur.com/WGk8dBS.jpg

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The boolean tracking appears to be something like an asset state machine / tracking running in the virtual player. Manually seeking the video tag is likely an unexpected change triggering an exceptional transition in the logic.The thing to keep in mind here is that the seeking timeline of a video tag element does not need to represent the actual media timeline when you are using MSE. It can represent any time the virtual player running in JavaScript wants to maintain and is usually more related to the buffer timeline and ensuring pts continuity across segment appends. Netflix has historically had relatively simple streams which may have allowed this to be the actual seek time, but looks like some deeper streaming changes are landing. For a more complicated example take a look at how multi-asset vod and live streams in a single video tag surface times.I don&#39;t work for Netflix, but do work in the field and since it&#39;s relatively small know some of the folks over at Netflix. They definitely aren&#39;t out to break things purposely, it&#39;s more likely not a case they exercise and broken by a change like someone else has said. If you want to patch the functionality it may be worth exploring the dispatch of mouse clicks on the seek bar. That probably does a translate to time and then calls the virtual player seek API which would be the new hook point you want."</p>

The idea is very entrenched in the rust gamedev community, but for a turn based tile based game there&#39;s extremely little benefit and a lot of added complexity. Bob Nystrom has an excellent talk on roguelike architecture [0] and rust as a language itself doesn&#39;t prevent any of these approaches.

It is hard to talk both about rust alongside video game design techniques.I put it down after reading 1/4th of it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"1. S3 Standby/suspend support.If your laptop supports that, you can close the lid and it will power ~everything except the RAM down (sometimes a USB port still charges). In &#39;new&#39; laptops, including almost everything Tiger lake and Intel, S3 is being phased out for Microsoft&#39;s &#34;Modern Standby&#34;, known as S0ix (or sometimes InstantGo). This is much more like a mobile phone, where it stays on but attempts to use as little battery as possible.So, peripherals might shut down, but you might still be able to get critical Windows Updates or receive an important notification -- all while your laptop is unplugged, lid closed, in your bag overnight. This is pretty bad for heat, battery, and often not what you might expect. My new laptop uses about 15% battery overnight, just doing nothing.In the future, perhaps this mode will work as well as S3 used to for battery life, but finding your laptop fans on while it&#39;s closed inside your bag and getting really hot is not fun. This applies to lots of laptops currently.2. A good screen. Brightness that goes high enough to be seen outside (400, or more) - and it&#39;ll usually auto turn down the rest of the time to save battery. Hard to go wrong on a Mac, but really variable screen quality across other brands and models. You&#39;ll spend a lot of time looking at the screen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"0. Linux compatibility, I am not super picky about getting everything to work perfectly but I should be able to trust that the software I prefer to use will run and my laptop will connect to wifi and play audio properly and so on.1. IPS screen (mostly a given nowadays, but this wasn&#39;t always so)2. Trackpoint, I hate trackpads. Pretty rare option so I could possibly be convinced otherwise if the trackpad is particularly good.3. Decent keyboard, any laptop will always be primarily a text processing machine for me.
 (tablet version)
4. User serviceability, with battery and RAM being highest priority but expandable storage is nice too, and all other replaceable parts are a nice bonus.5. General ruggedness, the whole point of a laptop is being able to travel with it and it&#39;s the kind of tech I expect to last me for years.6. Battery life, though I am not super picky about this.7. Everything else including performance, higher resolutions than 768p, thinness, appearance, touchscreen (roughly listed in order of preference).Posted from my trusty Thinkpad X230t which is the only laptop I&#39;m aware of that ticks nearly all my boxes. It&#39;s bulky and makes a vacuum cleaner noise when compiling and the battery only lasts 4-5 hours of normal use, though. Still, good enough for web browsing, various forms of text processing, watching videos, listening to music and the vast majority of what you might use a computer for.I did look into the Framework laptop recently but while it&#39;s probably the closet things in a long time the keyboard doesn&#39;t look good and there&#39;s no trackpoint (nor even physical mouse buttons)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; if I&#39;m missing on any new developments since 2015Yes, you missed something huge.Apple Silicon M1 or nothing.  It&#39;s just too good.  Low power consumption allows the laptop to actually be used as a laptop.  The power use-to-performance ratio is unmatched by anything on the market. Apple is breaking us free from decades of stagnation on the hardware front.Nothing else on the market comes close. I expect this to change in the future. Will happily switch to a linux laptop once an energy efficient alternative to x86 becomes mainstream for linux.  There&#39;s just no way I can go back to x86 after tasting the sweet nectar of M1."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked in Python for years and while I suppose I&#39;m glad for any improvement, I have never understood the obsession with true multi-threading. Languages are about trade-offs and Python, again and again, chooses flexibility over performance. It&#39;s a good choice! You can see it in how widely Python is used and the diversity of its applications.Performance doesn&#39;t come from any one quality, but from the holistic goals at each level of the language. I think some of the most frustrating aspects from the history of Python have been when the team lost focus on why and how people used the language (i.e. the 2 -&gt; 3 transition, though I have always loved 3). I hope that this is a sensible optimization and not an over-extension."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder how many folks think they&#39;re writing thread safe software with ease, and are unaware that they are leaning on the GIL?Could be that the impact of this change is far broader than just a few key libraries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; These changes are major enough that a fair number of existing Python libraries that work directly with Python’s internals (e.g., Cython) would need to be rewritten. But the cadence of Python’s release schedule just means such breaking changes would need to be made in a major point release instead of a minor one.Maybe time to rethink? https://www.techrepublic.com/article/programming-languages-w...If this is as promising as it sounds, it seems Python 4 now has its &#34;thing&#34; and is on the horizon. Or at least may become a serious thing to talk about"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"For  some reason I enabled the ‘auto refill’ on my new canon printer because that is what our office did (somehow).Don’t do that: it kept making purchases because it didn’t receive the ink as fast as it expected due to supply chain issues. It took a long time for Canon to cancel the orders that had never left the factory and give our hundreds of dollars back.It’s a fun story at least!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Last month, my friend&#39;s HP Laserjet Pro printer started flashing &#34;SUPPLY PROBLEM&#34; error message and wouldn&#39;t print anything. Apparently, all he did was update the firmware after a message popped up on the printer urging him to do so.Well, that firmware update included new DRM checks for non-HP toners. The printer would just refuse to work with 3rd party toner cartridges.I had to help him and had to find an old firmware and downgrade to an older one which didn&#39;t contain the DRM. The firmware didn&#39;t come from HP&#39;s website because they deleted all old versions so I downloaded the version off someone&#39;s Google Drive. Who knows if that FW contains something malicious. Also, I had to install Windows because old firmware update is a Windows program. You&#39;re SOL if you use macOS or Linux.This incident didn&#39;t make my friend go and buy $200+ worth of original toners like HP intended. All it did was make him anxious of updating anything and of using HP products and has wasted a lot of his and my time. He said he won&#39;t buy another HP printer again.If you want to learn more, search for &#34;HP supply problem&#34; with your fav search engine. Or see this link on HP support forums [1]. And don&#39;t update your printer&#39;s firmware if it&#39;s working fine... because who knows when they&#39;ll disable FW downgrade option and you&#39;ll be stuck with a DRMed printer.Edit: Just in case you found this comment through a search engine or this has affected you, I recommend downloading FW from this page [2]. It also has a list of affected HP Color LaserJet Pro printers (there&#39;s quite a few models.. the page lists 11 models). That blog also has a full saga of HP&#39;s shenanigans and their attempts to block aftermarket cartridges [3].[1] https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Printing-Errors-or-Lights-Stuc...[2] https://borncity.com/win/2021/02/02/firmware-downgrade-for-h...[3] https://borncity.com/win/2020/11/08/hp-firmware-update-for-i..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Would be great if Spotify had* &#34;good fit&#34;/&#34;bad fit&#34; button — I like a wide variety of music, but it needs to be appropriate to context. If I start a radio from a song, I&#39;d like to teach it to tailor the suggested songs better but that doesn&#39;t mean I dislike the songs it _is_ suggesting.* Ability to give the social context — a band playing at a music festival will lean more towards hits in their back catalogue. At their own gig they may play some obscure stuff that die hard fans will really like. Similarly, what I&#39;m listening to will be different if I&#39;m having a party, friends over for dinner or on my own. On a family account, you should also be able to say who is listening &amp; it should tailor to music that you might all enjoy.* I get that they don&#39;t want to block artists/songs completely but they _should_ allow limiting how many times they suggest it per day. If I&#39;ve listened to Everywhere by Fleetwood Mac on one playlist I probably don&#39;t want to hear it again an hour later on another playlist"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m apparently in the minority, but I long for a return of the 5-star ranking.  I really miss that about itunes, being able to rank each song, and set up smart playlists based on genre and how much variety (how deep in the star rankings) I wanted.I&#39;d have to think an intelligent recommendation engine could do a ton more with star rankings than a simple up/down too.  5=love, 4=like, 3=ok, 2=dislike, 1=hate.  It could even be optional; they could just treat like and dislike as 4 and 2 or something, and let people who want more precision use them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A dislike button would be handy. There is that feature on some of the generated playlists, but I don&#39;t think they do anything. My two biggest issues with Spotify right now are:
1. Release Radar filled with re-releases and remixes, often from artists who have long since passed away. I want new music as in released for the first time.
2. Name collisions. I&#39;m surprised this is an issue, but I will often get songs from different artists with the same name. And then I&#39;m unsure if selecting &#34;I don&#39;t like this song&#34; or &#34;I don&#39;t like this artist&#34; will affect the actually intended artist.I&#39;ve also reached a tipping point where I no longer find new music through algorithmic recommendations. To be fair it&#39;s taken about 5 years to reach this point. Now the good music I find comes from searching for curated playlists. It&#39;s come full circle as before streaming I got my music recommendations from blogs and friends."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a good example of making the mistake of conflating implementation details and user interface design.Firefox always had two boxes: URL bar and search. One of the big changes Chrome made when it was born was to have the Omnibar, being of course one bar that does both.If you think about this as an engineer, Firefox&#39;s design decision makes sense. You don&#39;t want to accidentally leak things to a search engine. URLs and search bars are just different. There are also corner cases where you&#39;re not sure if something is a URL or a search term, mostly to do with intranets (eg &#34;go/foo&#34; can be a URL internally).But users don&#39;t care about any of that. Users don&#39;t have the mental model to differentiate search terms and a URL. Chrome&#39;s decision was correct. It&#39;s surprising how long Firefox stuck with their bad (IMHO) design.Here&#39;s another example of this: IIRC one of the most frequently searched terms on Google is &#34;facebook&#34;. Tech-savvy people will just type &#34;facebook.com&#34; but users will just search for &#34;facebook&#34; and click on the (hopefully) first result. That happens a ton.So the lesson is don&#39;t leak technical and implementation details into interface design. Your users don&#39;t care about any of that.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"serde is one of the best things about Rust in practice.It is more convenient to use serde to serialize/deserialize to some standard format like JSON or YAML than it is to write your own half-baked format and serialization/deserialization code --- even for the simplest tasks --- so you just stop doing the latter. This is a fundamental shift, and very good for your software.&#34;Convenience&#34; here actually covers a lot of ground. The APIs are convenient. Boilerplate code is minimal (#[derive(Serialize)]). serde&#39;s attributes give you lots of control over the serialization/deserialization, while still being convenient to use. cargo makes importing serde into your project effortless. All of these are necessary to achieve that shift away from custom formats.Before Rust I used to write a lot of one-off half-baked formats. Pernosco uses Rust and serde and it uses no half-baked formats. Everything&#39;s JSON, or YAML if it needs to be more human-editable, or bincode if it needs to be fast and compact and not human-readable or extensible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Whilst not classical de/serialization I wrote serde_v8 (https://github.com/denoland/serde_v8), an expressive and ~maximally efficient bijection between v8 &amp; rust.It has powered Deno&#39;s op-layer since 1.9 (https://deno.com/blog/v1.9#faster-calls-into-rust-with-serde...) and has enabled significant improvements in opcall overhead (close to 100x) whilst also simplifying said op-layer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me, Serde is one of the killer features of Rust. Once you realize how much of programming is (for better or worse) shuttling data between different representations, it&#39;s hard for me to program in a language where I don&#39;t have a tool like Serde.A big part of its flexibility is how modular it is. Most common Rust libraries support serde serialization (at least as an optional feature), so if you use crates that do, you can plug any backend in and serialize those data structures to it. It doesn&#39;t even have to be string-based; I&#39;ve been using Serde to store arbitrary data structures as objects on Google Cloud Firestore."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Trust busting can seem like it’s anti free market, but when a company has a monopoly on a network it stops functioning as a company and basically becomes a government. The problem with Facebook/Amazon/Google is that they have a monopoly on a specific information network, for Facebook the social graph, internet discoverability for Google, and online shopping for Amazon. It’s similar to if a single company owned the road systems or the internet, since the structure of these networks means that competitors can’t exist, there can only be one network for it to have value, so the first company to build it will have a monopoly and be able to indefinitely milk it for a profit.The same thing happened with railroad barons in the 1800s and also in other areas of the economy, and the trust busting response the government took seems to have worked well to bring back a fair market. Government should keep the information networks predictable and accessible.This is a core theme in George Gilder’s controversial but imho extremely insightful book Knowledge and Power: The Information Theory of Capitalism and How it is Revolutionizing our World: https://www.amazon.com/Knowledge-Power-Information-Capitalis..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sigh, another day, another blame of Facebook for destroying Snap.Fundamentally, products are always gonna get copied. Google tried to do it to Facebook, back when FB was the size that Snap was at the time, how well did that work?Fundamentally, while competing with a megacorp sucks monkey balls, Snap shot themselves in the foot with their boneheaded product strategy.They literally didn&#39;t invest in their Android app because they wanted to be exclusive. Given that the vast majority of countries are majority Android, this gave FB the space to clone their product and put it in front of hundreds of millions of users who&#39;d never seen the concept before.Ultimately, while I do agree with most of the articles points (breaking up the internet behemoths would probably be a good idea), I really dislike the Snap analogy, as they could easily have beaten FB to the punch if they&#39;d had an effective growth strategy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As Wu and others have rightly pointed out, the straightforward Chicago School standard overlooks, among other things, the stifling effect monopolies can have on innovation. As a case in point: when AT&amp;T was broken up in 1984, a torrent of new products came on the market, everything from the first answering machines to early ISPs.This is a oversimplification and wrong.  
AT&amp;T was controlled by the government until 1984 and only because of this we were able to got technical innovations like UNIX, The C Programming Language and reusable open-source software. This formed not only the foundation of Linux and C but also later the Internet. And all of this happened because AT&amp;T was actually controlled instead of split up. They were not allowed to enter new markets and therefore we benefit all. What happened next? UNIX-Wars, Lawsuits and disastrous situation which enabled especially Microsoft.The lesson learned here is that - just mere splitting up - doesn&#39;t fix anything. The government subsequently did actually nothing against Microsoft and it&#39;s contracts with PC-Manufacturers. What I cannot say is whether the government still doesn&#39;t understand what software is and it&#39;s influence?Especially mass gravitation through user. Or if just no market regulation happens since the 1980ies.I wonder how Personal-Computers and the handling of source-code would&#39;ve been evolved if BSD and SysV were have been better friends? The appreciation of source code availability? And maybe an simple option at the store which sold that IBM-PCs with the 386 processors. If you got that &#34;UNIX&#34; thing on our PC with the source - you would probably wondered a lot that the spreadsheet application doesn&#39;t came with the source...especially when you pay for it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The view I share with a majority of Germans: Costs of nuclear energy are very much a burden that future generations will have to carry. A hundered thousand years of safe storage is not part of the calculation of the energy price. It is also clear now that the the companies running the plants will not pay for the deconstruction of the plants after they reached their end of life. Tax payers have to pay for this, and a large part of the remains will need to be stored safely for millenia as well. This is the opposite of sustainability and fairness towards future generations. Worldwide there still exists only a single final storage solution for nuclear waste - in Finland for the finish waste. In densly populated Germany the search for a storage site has been going on since the late 1950s, so far without success. All this on top of the risk of a system failure that would devastate huge territories. In a country where, as we&#39;ve recently seen, simple emergency warning systems are basically non-existent and fax is still the main communication tool for the authorities..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s worth noting that nuclear is really expensive when factoring in insurance and disposable, a lot more so than wind and solar.&gt;The cost of generating solar power ranges from $36 to $44 per megawatt hour (MWh), the WNISR said, while onshore wind power comes in at $29–$56 per MWh. Nuclear energy costs between $112 and $189.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-energy-nuclearpower/nucle..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One generally underappreciated aspect to nuclear energy opposition is the intrinsic link to nuclear weapons.  Some of it is scientifically illiterate nonsense (a lot of people seem to think power reactors can have a nuclear explosion).  And some of it is just historical association.  But some of it is a lot harder to dismiss.A world without nuclear reactors or enrichment facilities is a world without nuclear weapons.  Any medium or large industrialized country with power reactors could build nukes very quickly.  It&#39;s bad enough half a dozen already have.  This notion keeps some people up at night, I think.  If you consider nuclear weapons to be an existential threat to the species -- perhaps worse than climate change -- then building infrastructure that would allow their more easy construction might seem like madness."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Most important paragraph, IMO:&gt; Conducted Oct. 8 to 10, the online poll surveyed 1,545 Canadians and cannot be assigned a margin of error because internet-based polls are not considered random samples.It&#39;s a pretty good sample-size, but we don&#39;t get error bars. I don&#39;t remember if there was anything FB-critical happening that week (when did the study about teen mental health come out?), but the timeframe could also affect the survey."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to think, untill recently, that Facebook was just a tool and all this hatred was overblown. After all, I modulated my use of it just fine. My usage is sparse, and I use messenger to talk with people I know, it kept us together. I can see how community and bringing old friends together is precious.But, recently, I realized someone I used to be very close has mental problems. Undiagnosed, but there is no other way I can explain his behaviour to myself. Obsessive behaviour, can only talk about his conspiratorial obsession, erratic, spends most of his time &#34;learning&#34; about a specific conspiracy. And I see how Facebook is exacerbating this. I see how these things are poisoning his mind, fantasies weaved by other mentally ill people. It&#39;s just sad, when I thought about it and dawned on me  most of those _wild_ conspiracy theories are people that need help feeding each other&#39;s sickness.And then I look on my dad&#39;s wall, and saw the same hatred and resentment growing, and it scared me, the possibility he might drift even more this way.Now I changed my mind. I think it is harmful and it does induce bad states in people that would otherwise be better, or at least... Surrounded by better support systems. But I still think it&#39;s not _just_ Facebook. It&#39;s a confluence of factors."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a side note, I&#39;m a little saddened when I see friends apologize for their posts. There&#39;s such a reaction to &#34;influencer culture&#34; that people feel like foodgrams and humblebrags are a terrible thing, and in excess they certainly can be, but I think from most people it&#39;s a billion times better than strawman political arguments and manipulative media that is far worse for our mental health than just comparing ourselves to someone&#39;s good day.I had a friend post a picture of food made from ingredients they had made in their own garden, and it made them feel so good to eat it because they had had a rough year and it was a good personal win, so they apologetically posted a photo of it.Forget the rest of the trash on Facebook - seeing a friend I haven&#39;t seen in a while experience something good and being able to share that with them is something we need more of in the world. I&#39;d trade away all the &#34;only geniuses can remember the order of operations for this future scam page&#34; or &#34;you won&#39;t believe how this person misrepresents their opponents views and tears that misrepresentation apart!&#34; and keep stuff like this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Despite its reputation, Kubernetes is actually quite easy to master for simple use cases. And affordable enough for more complex ones.The fundamental abstractions are as simple as they can be, representing concepts that you&#39;d already be familiar with in a datacenter environment. A cluster has nodes (machines), and you can run multiple pods (which is the smallest deployable unit on the cluster) on each node. A pod runs various types of workloads such as web services, daemons, jobs and recurring jobs which are made available (to the cluster) as docker/container images. You can attach various types of storage to pods, front your services with load-balancers etc.All of the nouns in the previous paragraph are available as building blocks in Kubernetes. You build your complex system declaratively from these simpler parts.When I look at Nomad&#39;s documentation, I see complexity. It mixes these basic blocks with those from HashiCorp&#39;s product suite."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been running a production-grade Nomad cluster on Hetzner for the past 1 1/2 years and it&#39;s fantastic. It was amazingly easy to set up compared to Kubernetes (which I also did), the UI is awesome, updates haven&#39;t broken anything yet (as long as you follow the changelog) and it&#39;s stable. I really like the separation of concerns the HashiStack offers. You can start out just using Consul for your service meshing, and then add Nomad + Vault to get a similar experience to Kubernetes.Yes, it doesn&#39;t cover as many features as Kubernetes, but it should be good enough for most software and you can still make the switch later. I would never go back.You can read more on our blog if you&#39;re interested: https://pirsch.io/blog/techstack/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It has a Quectel EG25-G modem.I&#39;ve not used this particular device, but I have used Quectel GNSS modules, and they&#39;ve been a surprisingly helpful company to work with. I&#39;m a nobody, and working with Sony, Trimble, or ublox has been an exercise in frustration; you have to convince a salesperson that you&#39;re a big company and you can sell thousands of devices in order to just read the datasheet.  This one does have some of the documents locked behind an access request, but in my experience, they&#39;ve been very generous with those grants.The modem supports the following bands:    LTE-FDD: B1/B2/B3/B4/B5/B7/B8/B12/B13/B18/B19/B20/B25/B26/B28

which is pretty good. Americans will want 4G bands B2, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14, 17, 20, 25, 26, 29, 30, 41, 66, and 71; this implements 9/15, it&#39;s missing bands 14, 17, 29, 30, 66, and 71. Those missing bands are either subsets or supersets of other bands (which could be interesting from a firmware perspective - will a tower with a band 66 antenna give this modem some of the central band 4 subset, or will it try to negotiate a channel that this can&#39;t access?), little-used ATT bands, or the 600 MHz T-mobile band 71, which has a wide rollout but poor device support."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I received a Pinephone in the latest shipment, about three weeks ago. I also got the convergence dock to be able to attach a monitor, keyboard and mouse. I am extremely motivated to get off Android on my phone, and yet my Pinephone has already been discarded (and I never even put a SIM card in it).There are far too many out-of-the-box bugs and glitches to consider this a usable product. For example, the convergence dock will not display on a monitor. Firefox browser displays too wide for the phone screen, so unusable. A dozen other issues on first day.Even a development board should work better than this, have documentation of the known problems, and have some support mechanism that works.I don&#39;t think better/more expensive hardware is the problem. It&#39;s software, caused by lack of users, lack of investment, and too many &#34;competing&#34; distributions of Linux."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While I don&#39;t have any sympathy for this pilot, I also find the FAA&#39;s excuses here to be less than convincing. Basically, their position is &#34;Well, we trusted this Boeing employee to tell us the truth about the new flight controls, and he didn&#39;t.&#34; But if the regulators had actually done their job and independently evaluated the new flight controls, they wouldn&#39;t have had to take the word of any Boeing employees. I realize that that&#39;s the way the FAA does things now, but this whole debacle should be a warning to everyone that that method of regulation is not acceptable. The whole point of independent regulation is to not allow obvious conflicts of interest to harm the public."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Internal Boeing e-mails between various Chief Technical Pilots and other Boeing staff are available at [1]. It shows that there was an overarching requirement for the program to to ensure that 737 pilots could fly the 737 MAX with minimal &#34;Level B&#34; training (e.g. no need for hours of simulator training).Per [2], MCAS was poorly designed and exhibited a failure mode (e.g. AOA sensor failure) that required immediate pilot action to avert disaster. For pilots that were aware of the MCAS failure mode and how to respond, simulation showed they could respond and avert disaster within typically 4 seconds. A delay of 10 seconds from a pilot to respond correctly to the failure event would be catastrophic.A Boeing staffer wrote to the Chief Technical Pilot now indicted[^][1] regarding the pilot action required in those critical few seconds:  &#34;I fear that skill is not very intuitive any more with the younger pilots and those who have become too reliant on automation&#34;

The Chief Technical Pilot now indicted[^] responds:  &#34;This is the path with least risk to Level B. We need to sell this as very intuitive basic pilot skill&#34;.

Boeing it appears then opted for updating Non-Normal Checklists (NNCs) for pilots instead of:* Fixing the MCAS flaw to remove the failure mode altogether* Ensuring pilots were trained to handle an MCAS failure in a simulator* Otherwise ensuring that pilots were aware of the non-intuitive nature of MCAS and the particular failure mode requiring immediate &lt;10sec response from pilotsIf the failure mode with MCAS did occur, pilots didn&#39;t even have 10 seconds to find the NNC and go through the checklist steps before catastrophe was set to occur. They were not aware of MCAS being present on the aircraft and per the Boeing staffer raising the concern, &#34;that skill is not very intuitive&#34; in relation to acting on the failure mode should it have occurred.[1] https://transportation.house.gov/imo/media/doc/Compressed%20...[2] https://www.incose.org/docs/default-source/enchantment/21031...[^] Assumed from job titles in the e-mails, as names are redacted."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not a solo founder, but I do a lot of ops professionally. Unless you have a specific reason, I say it’s best to avoid complicated tooling until later.k8s, ci, etc are all really useful and solve a lot of hard problems, but god are they a bitch to set up and then monitor, fix when something weird happens, secure from nasty people outside, patch when some update becomes necessary, resist the urge to “improve”, etc. This doesn’t include the time it takes to work these tools into your project, like k8s for example really requires you grok its model of how stuff it runs is supposed to look. There’s a reason entire companies exist that simply offer managed versions of these services!If you’re using fewer than like 10 boxes and don’t work with many people, you can get away with spooky arcane oldhat sysadmin deploy techniques (scp release to prod hosts, run deploy script, service or cron to keep running) and honestly it’s pretty fun to just run a command and poof you’re deployed. Then you can just wait until it starts making sense to use fancier tooling (more load, more sites/DCs, more services, more people/teams, etc). Monitoring is always good to start with, for other stuff a  good litmus test is that price points for hosted k8s &amp; ops stuff will start to make sense, you’ll be paying in time in any case. Who knows, maybe when that happens something new will pop up that makes even more sense. Until then, reducing the amount of stuff you need to worry about is always a good strategy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots and lots of best practice exists specifically to help teams, and especially teams with some normal amount of turnover.The problems of a solo dev are very different than a dev on a team. Knowledge silos don&#39;t exist. Distributed expertise doesn&#39;t exist. There&#39;s no one to mentor, no shared vision to maintain, no intertia to combat.I consult on big complicated team projects. I also manage multiple solo projects.On solo projects, deployment is a script I run from my dev machine. I&#39;m the only person who deploys; anything else would be solving a problem I don&#39;t have.The only &#34;CI&#34; is running the tests before I run the deployment script. I&#39;m the only one who needs to see the outcome of the tests. Anything more would be solving a problem I don&#39;t have.Architecture is whatever makes the most sense to me personally -- which is often miles away from what I would recommend to a client, who needs something any new hire will recognize and be able to work with.I pay a service to manage backups so I can walk away from a solo project for months and know it&#39;s ticking away.The point is: solve problems you actually have. Don&#39;t try to run a &#34;professional&#34; operation by doing what big teams do all by yourself. Big teams have different problems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have no idea why there&#39;s nothing here saying &#34;don&#39;t&#34;. Go and get a Heroku account, hook it up to your Github repository&#39;s master branch for deploys, use Github Actions for CI, and then get on with life.Yes, you&#39;ll pay more for a Heroku Postgres instance than you would for a VPS on Digital Ocean with Postgres running on it, likewise you&#39;ll pay more for Heroku Dynos than another VPS to run your application server. On the other side though, your backup, rollback, deploy, and scaling strategies can all be &#34;Heroku does that&#34;, and you can focus on the much more valuable job of building a business."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When developing a webapp these days, I use a local proxy.This allows me to type a staging/production URL into Chrome, and get the frontend and the backend from either my local machine or staging/prod. I can mix and match any combination by checking/unchecking a box in Proxyman.This means there is no need to whitelist localhost for CORS, and other hoops. Another advantage is that you&#39;re experiencing the app with SSL, so you may notice bugs that you would miss if you&#39;re used to work with HTTP locally. I&#39;ve had these bugs which &#34;only happen on production&#34; in the past, and it&#39;s a nasty thing to deal with because it will be in a rush, since it happens as a surprise, and impacts users immediately. It can also bypass QA if the QA environment is also using workarounds and not a prod-like setup with SSL and the likes.I recommend giving it a try. It&#39;s a workflow I haven&#39;t seen promoted anywhere before."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can tell you how to lose at CORS in Chrome. If your browser caches a response, and sometime later you mutate the request by adding the &#34;Origin&#34; header it (e.g, add attribute crossorigin=&#34;anonymous&#34; to a &lt;script&gt; tag), Chrome won&#39;t make a new request. What it will do is use the cached response, which is missing the ACAO response header, and thus the browser rejects a file from its own cache via draconian security policy.There are many ways to lose at CORS and this one is my story."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bonus fact: I wanted the &#39;app&#39; (https://jakearchibald.com/2021/cors/playground/) to allow the HTTP method to be set to anything, which meant I needed a server that could accept anything.I usually use NodeJS, but it turns out the HTTP library they use turns the HTTP method into an enum, so only a subset is supported (https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/d798de1c653efa5ec0015d44...). This restriction only exists in their HTTP/1 library, their HTTP/2 library supports any method.Anyway, I couldn&#39;t use that, so I used Deno via Deno Deploy. Their HTTP library supports any method, and the APIs they use are very similar to web APIs, so it was really easy to get started. Here&#39;s the server code: https://github.com/jakearchibald/cors-playground/blob/main/i...."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"After the Affordable Care Act went into effect I signed our company up for our state&#39;s marketplace. While browsing our plan options, I noticed the url used a scheme like marketplace.org/employers/341/plans.aspx. Of course, I tried changing the number in the url to 342 to see what happened. To my astonishment, it loaded up the next company&#39;s plans, including a list of employee names, ages, plan cost, and SSNs.After I shopped a few other companies to see how our plans compared, I notified the marketplace operator via the only link on the website for customer service. Within about an hour, someone from their IT department rang me on the phone and started grilling me about how many other plans I browsed, and insisted that I clear my cache and browsing history, and notified me that they would be watching to make sure nobody at our IP address didn&#39;t access any other plans while the issue was being fixed.I was pretty surprised at his response, and assumed they would be more grateful for exposing a pretty basic flaw, but I guess a natural human tendency in these situations is to try to externalize the blame. Perhaps it&#39;s more difficult to hold yourself accountable than it is to assume that others who&#39;ve found your shoddy work are malicious actors."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Quote from the St Louis Post Dispatch article is even more groan-worthy:&#34;In the letter to teachers, Education Commissioner Margie Vandeven said “an individual took the records of at least three educators, unencrypted the source code from the webpage, and viewed the social security number (SSN) of those specific educators.”I guess webpages are kinda like encryption for idiots."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the article, it sounds like nothing even remotely questionable was done by the reporter who found the flaw:&gt; &#34;According to the Post-Dispatch, one of its reporters discovered the flaw in a web application allowing the public to search teacher certifications and credentials. No private information was publicly visible, but teacher Social Security numbers were contained in HTML source code of the pages.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Often overlooked things when discussing esbuild here:1. It&#39;s not just a faster replacement for a single %tool_name% in your build chain: for the vast majority of cases, it&#39;s the whole &#34;chain&#34; in a single cli command if you&#39;re doing it right.That is, you don&#39;t just stick it inside, say, webpack as a faster replacement for babel (although you can). No, you look carefully through your webpack configs and its myriad of plugins, ask yourself whether you really need to inline css in jsx in png while simultaneously optimizing it for IE 4.0, realize you don&#39;t, through out the whole thing, and use esbuild instead.I have two 50K+ LOC projects using esbuild, and I would use it even if it was slower than webpack/babel/tsc simply not to worry about the build chain breaking due to an update to some obscure dependency or plugin.2. It is fast because it&#39;s written from scratch to do a set of particular things and do it fast, not just because it&#39;s Go and parallelized.If you look at the commit log you will notice a lot of performance tweaks. If you look into the issues, you will find a lot of requests for additional features rejected, often due to possible negative performance impact.3. The most impressive part about esbuild development is not just that it&#39;s one guy writing it: it is the level of support and documentation he manages to provide alongside.The release notes alone are a good course into nitty-gritty details of the web ecosystem: all the addressed edge cases are explained in detail. To top it all off--all opened issues, no matter how uninformed they seem, find a courteous response."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Work on esbuild started at the start of 2020. It is primarily authored and maintained by Evan Wallace, who, in addition to making this tremendous contribution to the JavaScript ecosystem, is the CTO and co-founder of Figma. Incredible output."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bun [1] is a JS bundler based on esbuild’s source, but written in Zig. And it is about 3x faster than esbuild. I think its author Jarred is on HN as well.Probably worth a submission on its own but I am just waiting till it is fully open source.Edit: ( Deleted those Stats, since it may not be a fair comparison and it was probably not meant to be a fair benchmark in the first place. The details are still in the linked tweets. I do not know the author or am I in anyway affiliate with Bun. )I am also wondering how much of those optimisation could be used on ESbuild. Since Rails 7 and Phoenix 1.6 will be using esbuild and not Webpack.[1] https://twitter.com/jarredsumner/status/1390084458724741121"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Syncthing works brilliantly! The web UI is excellent, warns you when you&#39;re about to do something ill-advised, and stuff like QR codes makes adding clients and folders fairly easy. The separation between folders and devices is handled well. You can easily have half a dozen shared folders between several computers with any mix-and-match combination including which one is &#39;authoritative&#39; and so on.I used to use it on Android to keep my &#39;camera roll&#39; synced to my desktop. I preferred setting the ignore file to exclude android&#39;s thumbnails directory, but otherwise it worked great. I&#39;d take a photo with my phone and almost before I could open the shortcut on the desktop, boom, the photo was there, since the android client detects changes in the filesystem.I also used it to sync my password database, and a cross-platform notebook app&#39;s database. Worked flawlessly for all of them.Ditto for a folder shared between my MacOS laptop and Windows desktop.Lots of controls, especially in the forked android client. Don&#39;t want the sync client to run on any network other than your home network? Done. Don&#39;t want your syncthing clients to try and do NAT transversal / discovery outside whatever network it&#39;s on? No problem.The biggest bummer is that there&#39;s no iOS client. Had to switch to Nextcloud, which so far has been working OK, but the number of people that have problems with the iOS client is quite high (problems such as syncs being so slow it takes days to sync a camera roll), and it&#39;s generally sluggish and doesn&#39;t work in the background (yes, I know, Apple&#39;s fault.) However, Nextcloud does allow me to sync contacts and calendars (I think. I haven&#39;t tried to set it up yet.)One warning: Sycnthing really does not like it when you delete the dotfile folder inside the shared folder(s). Don&#39;t do that :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have switched from Nextcloud to Syncthing. The former was a resource hog that was eating up too much everything on my modest VPS.I share the files on my local network at home between phone, laptop and desktop. My only issues so far:- I need to manually start Syncthing on the devices, whereas Nextcloud was always running on boot. Not sure if I should start it every time, especially on the Android phone which cannot sync while away from home. I do not want to empty the battery while outside of my LAN, + the persistent notification &#34;Syncthing is running&#34; is annoying.- I need to power up at least the laptop or desktop to backup my phone data. One solution that I will try is to install a headless Syncthing instance on my NAS. This way the phone can always sync to the NAS every time, and then laptop/desktop can sync from NAS when needed.The joys of peer2peer! At least, I am sure that my moderately sensitive files are not leaving my local network to be stored on my VPS, which can be hacked someday.I also need to figure out how to install Wireguard on my router to allow to access my NAS from my phone while on a trip, but that&#39;s another story."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been wanting to use PCVR for a long time, especially for virtual desktop scenarios, not even just for gaming.  But the reality is I will never buy anything that puts money in Facebook&#39;s pocket.  End of story.  I really appreciate the work the developer did on this, but philosophically I see things like this that attempt to break the walled garden as a net-benefit to a bad actor (Facebook) rather than a net-benefit to consumers and users.  It&#39;s actually better for the world and better for users if they have to make a hard choice about the ethics of their purchases, rather than feeling like they have an &#34;out&#34;.  So I commend the work, but Oculus is a no-go for anyone who gives any care at all about ethics for SO MANY reasons, Facebook owning it just being the largest (read the origin story for more)."</p>

We were deploying database changes to facilitate the new product.  This was a long time ago, and the organization still deployed things by hand, so there was no tooling for us to automate the deployment.  Part of the deployment process involved pasting some SQL to create the tables and populate the initial data into a JIRA ticket for an administrator to run in production.Said administrator was a fan of the cloud-to-butt plugin, and dutifully copied and pasted the SQL that they saw, like we instructed.  When our code failed, an inspection of the production database revealed the culprit.  Fortunately, &#39;cloud&#39; and &#39;butt&#39; are close to each other, alphabetically, so we didn&#39;t need to search very long.We never let that admin live that down."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice article! I used similar techniques to find solutions for a game called “DStar”… including the choice to write the solver in Rust. You can play the game and see the optimal solutions on the web (not tested on mobile):https://www.moria.us/games/dstar/playA state in this game is:  enum Active {
    Ball,
    Block,
  }

  struct State {
    coins: u32,     // bitmask of which coins remain
    active: Active, // which player is active
    ball: Point,    // location of ball
    block: Point,   // location of block
  }

I thought about writing an A* solver for this, but a simple BFS found all the solutions quickly enough. With a single-threaded solver, each level could be solved in 40s or less. The longest solutions are around 100 moves long, and the entire set of 25 levels is solved with 2.5 minutes of CPU time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Generally I&#39;d say product reviews are one of those ideas like passwords that work but don&#39;t survive introduction to the general public and mass use. The problems of authenticity are obvious, but I&#39;ve also noticed that people who rely on word of mouth from their friends and colleagues are generally happier. And why wouldn&#39;t they be? A colleague tells you this e.g. monitor is perfect for your line of work so you get it and find it also good. No fuss, nothing nerve wracking, no time wasted. Compared with reading through dozens of reviews that even when authentic raise good points that are maybe entirely irrelevant to you.I try to buy stuff in shops now. It&#39;s more expensive only if my time spent on reading reviews is free. And these days it&#39;s not even more expensive to buy in real shops anyway."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a small side project (a Google Docs plugin) that makes a trickle of money. One of my competitors launched one day and somehow they had 10 5-star reviews already, but the gSuite marketplace said they had only 3 users. One of those users had the same name as the author, but wrote their review as if they&#39;d just stumbled upon it that day. Another literally had the name &#34;Fiverr User&#34; on their Google account next to their review.I think this has become so common that many people assume it&#39;s a necessity of doing business. Maybe it is. Since I don&#39;t depend on my project to survive, I choose not to do these things, or even to give discounts to incentivize reviews. Many platforms don&#39;t care at all, and don&#39;t even try to combat fake reviews.EDIT: Another thing worth mentioning: the natural review rate for these plugins is really low. Maybe half a percent of users leave any kind of review, at least in my experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a rule, I always check the four, three, and two star reviews since they have the least propensity for a scammer to create and waste time.  1 and 5 star reviews usually are an inane mix of &#34;They&#39;re TERRIBLE&#34; or &#34;FANTASTIC&#34; with no additional information, whereas the 2,3, and 4 star reviews will normally go into specifics that warranted the stars being removed.  Not only that, but they are normally much fewer in number meaning that a sufficiently popular location with real reviewers will have enough 2, 3, and 4 star reviews to give me a relatively transparent view of the good and the bad that I can read quickly.  Mixed into this analysis is to scan for made points rather than worry about the star rating."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In Germany Amazon pressured third-party sellers to use their fulfillment/warehousing service, which would reveal to them where those sellers source their goods from. They then just went to those sources and offered them a better deal, cutting out the third-party seller. So basically third-party sellers are doing free market research for Amazon: They take on the entrepreneurial risk and if they&#39;re successful Amazon will know exactly how many goods they sell to which customers and from who they get those goods. They can then use that information in their own product strategy and simply take over the business of their most profitable sellers. Really clever strategy IMHO, albeit not very fair."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The grocery stores I visit do the same in the Netherlands, maybe even worse, especially the biggest one here, Albert Hein (Ahold), is very skilled at it. They copy the most popular products, sell them slightly cheaper, similar designs as the most popular brand, then go on and display their products at eye height and move the big brands down. Yet every court case against them they&#39;ve won. And the sentiment is far less negative about them than Amazon. They have a similar significant market share (35% of grocery market) as Amazon here. Maybe in the end, it&#39;s slightly more ethical since their strategy is mostly at the cost of the big corporates (Unilever) who can handle and fight them and not the smaller companies; and arguably, the consumer wins in the end."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is this shocking to anyone? I don&#39;t mean to sound cynical but I thought we already knew this. It is fairly obvious if you search anything and the first product is a Amazon Basic product that they are toying with the results. There is no way a Amazon Basic product is the #1 in every category there is one. Just search &#34;batteries&#34; in Amazon Canada, Duracell has 30k reviews and 5/5, the only reason it is &#34;above&#34; Amazon Basic is because they pay (sponsored). A regular search shows two Amazon Basic listings (AA and AAA) both have less rating (4.8/5 versus 5/5) and reviews then the Duracell equivalents. Quiet clearly rigged."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"APT&#39;s progress bar does have issues though. When you shrink the terminal when the progress bar is visible, you&#39;re going to have gibberish in the terminal. That&#39;s because the terminal commands to move the cursor by lines work on visual lines, not semantic lines, so they aren&#39;t invariant under the operation of resizing the terminal window. That&#39;s a really rough area of Linux terminals: when you resize a window, the terminal is going to rewrap the lines according to semantic lines (based on line feed characters), so it&#39;s clear that all major terminals understand this distinction, but the terminal API doesn&#39;t give applications access to moving by semantic lines, so we&#39;re left with bugs like these.I think PowerShell has the concept of progress reporting specially recognized? That sounds like a good idea. It could be used to render a GUI progress bar and leave the pipeline alone, for the objects. That&#39;s just my vague idea, since I didn&#39;t spend much time with PowerShell."</p>

But, y’know what ol’ Billy Ma’s performance marketers couldn’t then do: prove their value to their bosses.&gt; [picture of that search term and williams sonoma ads with shopping links]The main problem here is that if Williams Sonoma was not advertising on that search term, Lodge and Food52 etc etc would, and then those companies would be above the Williams Sonoma organic placements.The spend is necessary in a defensive way because Google creates a bidding war even for the hyper relevant.edit: I just checked and if you search &#34;williams sonoma skillet&#34;, if WS was not paying for [green] then the very first &#34;result&#34; (ad) would be Food52 [red] https://imgur.com/a/9Nnxs6hI just tried &#34;airbnb paris&#34; and the first result is, somewhat predictably, an ad that is not airbnb. But the second one is also an ad, this time from airbnb.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are so many holes in these arguments that you could drive a truck through it. Which is so infuriating, because a big part of my professional career consisted of watching all of Rand&#39;s SEO videos and really appreciating them. I really thought he was a genius. But then over the past few years, he started sharing more general views on entrepreneurship, and those takeaways just didn&#39;t really make much sense. Basically, his own VC-funded company turned into a shit show and suddenly he started advocating against VC in general (as opposed to taking an honest look at the mistakes that his company made). So in the past few years, I tried to reconcile in my head: how can a genius make such imperfect conclusions? My initial takeaway was that he&#39;s blinded by his own mistakes and shifting the blame, which seems perfectly reasonable and understandable. Frankly, I would probably feel and act the same way.But after reading this article, it finally dawned on me. He makes imperfect conclusions in everything he touches, it&#39;s just that in some fields those conclusions can be more easily proved to be wrong than in others. SEO is the perfect field where a polished presenter can get away with imperfect conclusions for years - trust me, I know, I made a living for years in this field, and I am very familiar with the nature of this work. Most of the time, you have no idea what the black box really does, and instead you&#39;re just trying to guess what might have happened. Most importantly, there are many ways to skin a cat in SEO, and just because your approach is net positive doesn&#39;t mean that you truly are delivering the global maximum (or that the net positive gain was ROI positive). In short, it&#39;s impossible to know who&#39;s right and who&#39;s wrong, and Rand&#39;s videos convinced me that he&#39;s right, but I am no longer sure. I just rewatched one of them, and can easily see how his conclusions are just... opinions.While we may or may never find out if his SEO opinions were the global maximum, we can quantifiably demonstrate that his opinions on content marketing are not solid. This whole essay he wrote can be replaced with &#34;hey performance marketers, don&#39;t trust the platform numbers and instead do your incrementality studies.&#34; Platforms like Facebook will give you those for free if you reach a certain spend level, and you can also get them from 3rd party providers like measured.com. In other words, if you&#39;re a performance marketer and you&#39;re not conducting incrementality studies, then you&#39;re very early in your career and are not following the best practices. Simple as that - no need to extrapolate from there and reach all sorts of additional conclusions (which is obviously a pattern in Rand&#39;s behavior) - calling into question a perfectly investable marketing channel, conflating the needs of a public company with everyone else&#39;s needs, using words like scam, etc.I am really disappointed to have to write this, but you would have been better off not reading this article. If Rand is really advocating that the majority of entrepreneurs should follow his advice and focus on PR instead of performance marketing, then perhaps an honest thing to ask would be - how is that working out for his own company? AFAIK, SparkToro is nowhere close to replicating the growth of his previous company, which is honestly disappointing for someone with such a huge reach and name recognition."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was at one company several years ago and made two big changes to digital advertising:#1 - Eliminated all paid search other than some limited branded search terms and shifted all the money to affiliates who were way better at making profits on the keywords we were competing on#2 - Eliminated all display advertising after running numerous experiments showing it provided almost not incremental conversions, even though the platforms happily took credit for them.Those two things drove our blended CAC down substantially and by building better affiliate relationships, sales actually increased.The lesson here is that you need to try a lot of things out and you should be continuously questioning what you&#39;re doing and running specific experiments to gut check effectiveness of any ad platform that is slapping cookies on wide groups of users and claiming conversions.My suspicion is that this is near impossible at any large organization, even one as new as Airbnb. I can just imagine someone walking into a team of 20+ performance marketers and suggesting they need to experiment to determine if any of it is remotely effective. COVID forced them into this but it&#39;s something that they should have already been doing.I also suspect that the top line focus/obsession of most VC-backed companies make this type of exercise seem almost counterintuitive. Don&#39;t mess with or question the momentum."</p>

The capstone project was implementing from scratch a multi-pipeline RISC CPU (including the ALU and a very basic L1 cache) in Verilog that we flashed to FPGAs that we then programmed to play checkers using hand-compiled C. The FPGA was easier to flash and debug than the Spartan-6 mentioned in TFA but was significantly more expensive as well.It was a brutal class, but it totally demystified computers and the whole industry in a way that made me feel like I really could understand the &#34;whole&#34; stack. Nothing scares me any more, and I no longer fear &#34;magic&#34; in software or hardware."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The best cold starts are those which aren&#39;t noticed by the user. For my blog search (which runs on Lambda), I found a nice way of achieving that [1]: as soon as a user puts the focus to the input field for the search text, this will already submit a &#34;ping&#34; request to Lambda. Then, when they submit the actual query itself, they will hit the already running Lambda most of the times.And, as others said, assigning more RAM to your Lambda than it actually may need itself, will also help with cold start times, as this increases the assigned CPU shares, too.[1] https://www.morling.dev/blog/how-i-built-a-serverless-search..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My experience with cold starts in Azure Functions Serverless is pretty awful. Like most other Azure services, their affordable consumer grade offerings are designed from the ground up not to be good enough for &#34;serious&#34; use.Cold start times compared to Lambda are worse, and in addition, we would get random 404s which do not appear in any logs; inspecting these 404s indicated they were emitted by nginx, leading me to believe that the ultimate container endpoint was killed for whatever reason but that fact didn&#39;t make it back to the router, which attempted and failed to reach the function.Of course the cold start and 404 are mitigated if you pay for the premium serverless or just host their middleware on their own App Service plans (basically VMs)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At my last job we built an entire API on top of serverless. One of the things we had to figure out was this cold start time. If a user were to hit an endpoint for the first time, it would take 2x as long as it normally would at first. To combat this we wrote a &#34;runWarm&#34; function that kept the API alive at all times.Sure kind of defeats the purpose of serverless but hey, enterprise software."</p>

Balena manage all the complicated stuff around rolling out updates, keeping the OS up to date, logging etc, and give some nice debug tooling. The other nice thing about the platform is that it&#39;s almost all open source - so if Balena the organisation goes bust or changes strategy, Balena the IoT management service could be self hosted."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Working in IT/tech for school district is the worst. My experience from many years ago - around 2002, I think:1. First day on the job, email to boss: &#34;Hey, the computer lab at Springfield High has a ton of known security flaws that are begging to be exploited.&#34;2. Reply, 1 week later: &#34;Sorry, we don&#39;t have any money for that. Just keep everything up-and-running.&#34;3. 3 weeks later the computer lab at Springfield High got &#34;hacked&#34;. All the computers displayed a popup window that said, &#34;Miss Krabappel is a dyke!&#34; (sorry for the offensive language)4. Next day, email from boss: &#34;The computer lab at Springfield High was hacked! Figure out how to fix this and make sure it doesn&#39;t happen again!&#34;5. A few days later Miss Krabappel filed to sue the school district. The local newspaper picked up the story.6. Email from boss, in full panic mode: &#34;I need you to figure out who hacked the computer lab at Springfield High so we can report him to the police!&#34;7. A week later an independent consulting firm was brought in to help identify the person behind the &#34;hack&#34;. I heard they were paid $50K and found nothing. However, the kid got ratted out when he told all his friends. (It wasn&#39;t Bart Simpson! ;) )8. Several weeks later: meeting to discuss working with a consulting firm that&#39;s gonna fix all the security issues because the current staff (me and my team) lacks the skills.9. About 6 months later, I quit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds of me my school leaving prank. I rewrote the whole internet on my school&#39;s computers. Google&#39;s logo became &#34;Leavers &#39;08&#34;, Facebook became &#34;Hatebook&#34; and was red, YouTube only played videos of cats, amongst other things.These were the days when nothing had SSL, so you could just intercept and rewrite traffic!My only requirement was: do no actual damageIt was implemented as a Debian live CD that you could drop into any school computer. It would boot up, then Ettercap would MITM the whole network by spoofing the router. It routed all HTTP traffic via Squid and a custom ICAP server that did the actual rewriting. If you removed the live CDs, the network just went back to normal within a couple of minutes.Routing the whole school&#39;s network through one old Pentium machine wouldn&#39;t work though, so I figured out a way of doing distributed load balancing: it would do the ARP spoofing slowly and randomly. So, as you added more machines, it would just magically balance between them.It worked great for about an hour then whole network mysteriously stopped working for the rest of the day. I left all the live CDs in the computers as a calling card.Sorry, school network admins."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Three things are remarkable about this, and make it a happy story.First, that the pranksters were so egregiously responsible in the way they went about it. They avoided disrupting any actual educational activities; it was meant to be harmless fun, not vandalism. No harm came to anything here.Second, that they documented their findings to the administration as part of the action, including recommendations for improvements.Third, the administration took this as exactly that: a harmless prank by smart, ethical kids who ALSO did them a favor by pointing out the vulnerabilities. If the admin had a panicked fit about this, they could have made it an ugly situation.My educational experience was populated far more by &#34;freak out and yell&#34; types than this school district, which was a shame."</p>

					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28835690">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Dropping by to express healthy interest in this project.Rancher have a pretty good track record so far:  - the Rancher platform itself (https://rancher.com/) is a really powerful and user friendly way to manage container clusters of all sorts, giving you a self-hosted dashboard for both your cloud and on prem clusters, for a variety of Kubernetes distributions; you can even manage the available drivers and also create deployments graphically
  - the K3s distribution (https://k3s.io/) is in my eyes one of the best ways to run Kubernetes yourself, both in development environments and production ones. I benchmarked K3s alongside Docker Swarm as a part of my Master&#39;s thesis and it was surprising to see that its overhead was actually very close to that of Docker Swarm (a more lightweight orchestrator that&#39;s included with Docker and uses the Docker Compose format), only exceeding it by a few hundred MB with similar deployments being active, making K3s passable for small nodes

As for this particular project, it&#39;s very positive to see that it supports all of the big OSes, even though the 0.6.0 version tag would still advise caution for a while, even though it can definitely be considered as a replacement for Docker Desktop.Admittedly, it&#39;s also nice to see that Docker and the ecosystem around it is still supported and is alive and kicking, since for many projects out there it&#39;s a perfectly serviceable stack with tools that a lot of people will be familiar with, as opposed to having to migrate to podman, while it&#39;s still becoming more and more stable, yet isn&#39;t quite there yet. Now, that may be a controversial take, and Docker Inc also have their fair share of challenges, about which there was a very nice writeup here: https://www.infoworld.com/article/3632142/how-docker-broke-i..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let me say it; I love to see it. There&#39;s just something that strikes me as harmfully greedy about the idea of &#34;Docker, a gajillion dollar company.&#34;  There&#39;s just no way that THAT kind of service could be tweaked to return that much to stakeholders without seriously screwing up the experience for people who need it to just work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was amazed by the news at first, but seeing it again, it doesn&#39;t seem to be a direct replacement of Docker Desktop. It makes use of K3s under the hood, which is lighter than a full-blown Kubernetes, but still quite heavy. My nearly empty K3s cluster is consistently consuming ~10% CPU time on my local machine. This is not acceptable to me, so a proper replacement of Docker Desktop should be more lightweight."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m so happy powerful type systems are more popular now. TypeScript bringing a great type system to a language as popular as JS is fantastic. Rust is also a great way to get a great type system while staying in a systems programming and procedural environment. Hell, even python type annotations support union types.I never knew the depth of type systems until the last year when I took a type theory course and a compiler course taught by a man who loved his types. So much power - I can&#39;t wait to see the future of type systems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s another. Instead of returning Sometype|undefined from a function which may or may not have a value to return (such as searchCustomer), return Sometype|null.That forces the function to return a value that&#39;s explicitly intended rather than defaulting from a missed out if-else codepath. This is useful since JS is often imperative style code."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh, this is just laser fusion. One pulse of power. That&#39;s not a power source, even potentially. It&#39;s a lab-sized H-bomb experiment. This isn&#39;t one of the magnetic containment systems achieving ignition and sustaining the reaction. Now that would be an achievement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Meta-question about fusion energy -something I don&#39;t understand about the movement. I spent a few years as CTO of a company providing heat-to-electricity plants. We financed and built them off high-heat plants like natural gas turbines. The &#34;fuel&#34; was heat going up the stack - so it was essentially free. We still couldn&#39;t compete with conventional electricity plants, even with a $30/tonne price on carbon in Canada.Geothermal energy is the same: sustainable, long-life electricity with no &#34;fuel&#34; costs, but it costs 2-3x as much to build a geothermal plant (in most areas, depends on geology) as e.g. a natural gas turbine powered plant, so the overall cost of electricity is much higher and you can&#39;t get financing.How is fusion different? The fuel will be free and unlimited, but the &#34;levelized cost of electricity&#34;, dominated by the capital cost of the plant, will still be much higher than other sources of electricity. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a world -- even one where the onerous regulations go away and a  market price on carbon is available -- where the LCOE of fusion power is less than that from natural gas, or even close."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Fusion ignition is the point at which a nuclear fusion reaction becomes self-sustaining. This occurs when the energy being given off by the fusion reactions heats the fuel mass more rapidly than various loss mechanisms cool it.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_ignition"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article is discussing the media and government being intentionally vague or even misinformative because they don&#39;t trust the public, but it backfires and causes more distrust. The flip side that wasn&#39;t discussed is the belittling and censoring of voices that were skeptical of the narratives, which engendered even more distrust. Their strategy of information control backfired, and they doubled down. Now we&#39;ve got a huge swath of US citizens that will never take the vaccine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How about the biggest dishonesty - lack of admission that not everyone is at the same risk and that lockdowns have significant irreversible costs for low risk individuals and for society? Young children are not getting critical development years back. Healthy 20 somethings only have limited time to date, party and have fun before being saddled with adult responsibilities forever. Most of shattered local businesses are not coming back. While pandemic was not the only reason for BLM and Jan 6 riots, all the young men not being kept busy and receiving stimulus checks to support unproductive activities was certainly a contributing factor - and the fallout permanently damaged trust we have in each other. What of all the deaths of despair - suicides and drug overdoses? Mixed cancer diagnoses because people were scared to go to see doctor? Plummeting birth rates?All of this adds up to the fact that optimum precautions for an obese 70 year old guy is not a same as for a healthy 19 year old woman, and individuals should have a role in deciding what&#39;s right for them. While vast majority should take a vaccine, there may be a small group for whom it&#39;s a reasonable choice to hold off. Say you are a 19 year old healthy make and your risk from serious vaccine side effects is largest while your risk from COVID-19 is smallest. Plus, you already recovered from COVID during the time Delta variant was common. Are you really bonkers for making a decision either way?Above all, society must not sacrifice its young for those of us who had a chance to live for quite a bit already."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author is completely right in that the government at least in the US attempting to downplay, mislead or &#39;avoid panic&#39; absolutely destroyed any credibility and is still suffering from it. Most people are not stupid, if provided with all available information as well as clear statements regarding the reliability of that information and just a clear message saying &#34;hey this is new and we have no idea, we are making our best guess&#34; people will make decent choices. Unfortunately the US decided to torpedo its credibility, and all sides decided to turn it into a political issue which a pandemic should very much not be. All politics all the time and the US is now crippling itself. In the absence of real honest leadership people turned to the loudest voices of the media. Once the people distrust the government and think they are lying its very hard to appeal to their logic again. I am very much not a fan of Bush II but he did it right after 9/11. What he did after though is a topic for another day."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A distinction needs to be made clear here with regards to the data being transmitted to Google by LineageOS in this study.In the cited paper (https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Doug.Leith/Android_privacy_report.pd...), the device used to test LineageOS was a Google Pixel 2 running LineageOS 17.1 which also included an installation of OpenGapps 10.0 nano.It&#39;s not the OS that is transmitting the data over to Google, but rather OpenGapps (ie. Google Play). OpenGapps is software that can be optionally installed after the initial installation of LineageOS (but before first boot). A user can still use LineageOS without OpenGapps, though they just won&#39;t have the benefits (and drawbacks) that come with it (such as being able to use apps that require GSF). The user can instead opt for an app manager like F-droid or possibly Aurora Store.In addition, there exists an alternative to OpenGapps called MicroG. This is like Google Play but allows users the option to anonymize themselves. One can find custom LineageOS builds that include MicroG from the MicroG website (as the members of the LineageOS project do not advocate for its use, instead giving preference to OpenGapps). Keep in mind, however, that there are fewer devices supported by those builds."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use GraphineOS and LineageOS without Google Play Services. They are great and are suitable replacements for Apple and Google.- Osmand(FOSS) for maps (supports being fully offline!)- Signal and Discord for messaging (Discord is sandboxed)- Newpipe(FOSS) for Youtube- F-droid(FOSS) for my FOSS appstore- APKmirror for the few non-free apps I need- Libretorrent(FOSS) and VLC(FOSS) for watching movies- Firefox(FOSS) and Vanadium(FOSS) for browser- K9 Mail(FOSS) for email- Infinity(FOSS) for Reddit- Secur(FOSS) for 2FA- Taskkeeper(FOSS) for remindersAlmost everything you need is in the F-droid FOSS app repository. It all works, and it works well. You can buy a used Pixel 3a for around $80 on Ebay and have a better experience in every category than iOS, hardware and software.The only limitation is push notifications, which isn&#39;t a problem because FOSS apps like Signal bundle their own notification system that does not use Google Play Services. Discord however, does not get push notifications (which I wouldn&#39;t want anyway)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can understand if a product has limitations, or odd edge cases, but Microsoft MFA is purposefully designed to be user-hostile.Some examples that came up recently in &#34;not corner case&#34; scenarios:1) For tenant-to-tenant guest access, each user must re-register MFA for each tenant they&#39;ve been invited to. So if you already have the Authenticator app installed and configured, it doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;ll prompt you to create a new entry each time. I have dozens already and clocking up.2) When logging in to Azure, Microsoft has purposefully added &#34;dark patterns&#34; to hide options related to other, non-Microsoft-Authenticator technologies. They&#39;re available, but they&#39;re always tiny, tiny links squirrelled away so that you&#39;re inexorably lead towards using the Authenticator app. Someone at Redmond really wanted their KPIs met at Yubikey&#39;s expense.3) If you get a new iPhone, unlike everything else on the phone, the Authenticator app will not transfer your MFA registrations. Apple IOS will securely transfer your accounts, passwords, etc... but Authenticator is special. You need to first configure a consumer account(!) to back up your enterprise MFA settings, and then restore them manually. At which point... none of them will work, and you get partial instructions that you can&#39;t follow. If you&#39;ve wiped your old phone (e.g.: trade-in or repair), you are now locked out.All of the above were designed, architected, and developed on purpose. None of these are oversights, bugs, or missing features."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everything about Microsoft cloud and its ecosystem is broken. I recently signed up for onedrive (microsoft business basic, actually), and I didn&#39;t even know which domain to navigate to. They have a gazillion different URLs, and each of them is different from the other. Here&#39;s a (partial!) list:azure.com onedrive.live.com admin.microsoft.com microsoftonline.com office.com office365.com onedrive.com onmicrosoft.com sharepoint.com windowsazure.comEach one of those portals take you to SOME view of your account with a gazillion settings. Many of them are repeated, and changing it on one portal doesn&#39;t necessarily reflect in others. For example, I enabled 2FA somewhere (and it worked), but going to admin.microsoft.com showed 2FA disabled.Even payments, which every other website seems to have figured out, is broken. There was a recent change in regulations in India for subscriptions on credit cards that allow the customer to control the period of subscription, enabling/disabling, etc. Microsoft of course, hasn&#39;t implemented the changes (despite the regulations being notified in August 2019), and because of that, transactions are being declined.So can I go and make that payment online? Well, no. Your subscription shows up as &#34;expired&#34; because it couldn&#39;t charge your account, and the only option it gives is for you to &#34;reactivate&#34; the account. Great, so I&#39;ll just reactivate. But no, it doesn&#39;t allow you to pay when you reactivate - it&#39;s going to try and charge your credit card again, itself, as a subscription, sometime. And of course, that&#39;s going to fail again. Loop!Addendum:So somehow, with the help of Microsoft support, I manage to sign-up for another subscription with the same licenses for the same cost, and they disable the old one. Great. So this time, it tries to charge my card, fails, but then allows me to &#34;settle&#34; the &#34;overdue&#34; amount manually. I do that, and my account is &#34;active&#34; again!Do they send me a mail saying they&#39;ve received the amount? Nope. Does my Microsoft account billing page show that I&#39;ve made any payment to Microsoft? Nope. The only indication that I&#39;ve made a payment is that my account is active with an expiration date in the future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So this freaked me out! A week ago I went passwordless with my Microsoft account; which required setting up Microsoft Authenticator. While I was there, I re-evaluated my entire MFA setup:* I had already setup Authy OTP codes, which I was actively using. So I left that alone.* I had already setup an external email. So I left that alone.* I setup Microsoft Authenticator for the first time.* I added a pair of FIDO U2F YubiKeys.* I generated and backed up an account recovery code.* I REMOVED my cell phone number because SMS is not secure.* I did NOT look at my aliases because I wasn&#39;t aware that was even a thing. It&#39;s not part of the Security Dashboard.Here&#39;s what worked: I&#39;ve been able to sign in with Microsoft Authenticator on my phone, the YubiKeys on supported browsers, and receive codes at my external email if neither of aforementioned devices are available. I have noticed that, even though the Authy OTP code is still listed on my Security Dashboard, I can&#39;t trigger a prompt for that code. This isn&#39;t a huge deal, since both Authy and Microsoft Authenticator are on my phone.In reaction to your post, I went and checked out my aliases. My phone number was NOT in there. The only alias I have is my primary Microsoft email. I don&#39;t know if my phone number ever was in there. Perhaps it was, and when I deleted my number from the Security Dashboard it also deleted from the aliases? I don&#39;t know. I do know that there is no phone number listed under my Account Info or Security Dashboard.Thanks for this post. It reminds me just how vested we are on certain accounts; accounts that can disappear in an instant. I hope you get your issues resolved!"</p>

It&#39;s an interesting project at the intersection of philanthropic eco-hippies and mechanical engineers which doesn&#39;t seem very common to me.Of course, being older and wiser now I&#39;m less excited about the fantasy of using my brains and grit to rebuild society after the coming apocalypse. And if you are a villager of some description trying to use machinery to improve your prospects you&#39;re probably better off buying something old and used, or cheap and Chinese. Over the last 10 years the number of (mostly Chinese) companies making okay-quality cheap industrial equipment of all types has grown massively, and I&#39;ve seen this equipment being used more and more in the developing world. Cheap is relative, of course, and many places do not make it easy to buy anything due to payment infrastructure, shipping, and customs costs.So on the one hand it&#39;s a bit silly for some guy in Missouri to even consider designing his own bakery oven when you can get them on Alibaba for $500. On the other, it&#39;s very cool and interesting, there&#39;s a lot to learn from the attempt, and there&#39;s a lot of actually useful designs already for certain situations.

If we mean to say this tractor is all-electric, keep in mind most small farms arent equipped to charge anything more advanced than a cordless drill or flashlight.Cab frame has no safety glass or panels, so the operator enjoys every rock and every tree branch :(.  a shade canopy is a nice add as well.no lights.  this is a nonstarter for every farmer that wakes up at 4 am.quick hoses are nice, but I cant find a PTO knuckle so its restricted to things like lifting and towing (and maybe ripping).  this is okay, but for an un-weatherized vehicle ill need to use barn real-estate to store, its certainly lacking."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The sheer simplicity of this idea - a 1-bit grid, which you can interact with in real-time - echoes that of Pico-8 [1], a fantasy console with strict limits such that you&#39;re not overwhelmed with ideas, but instead given bounds to play with. Its limits keep it realistic: you can do immensely wondrous things with the console, but its graphic and music style are limited, and as such it provides much more of an incentive to make a game - it&#39;s far less overwhelming, and you can concentrate on fun. But also, it offers a challenge! As you begin to hit the limits, you come up with clever tricks to save space, and because the computer isn&#39;t blisteringly fast, you&#39;re pushing yourself as much as you are the computer.[1]: https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.phpBut this checkbox playground would be, in my eyes, an even better virtual console - reduced to the bare minimum of what you could make into a game that can be enjoyed. Provide a nice interface such that the user only has to write the game code, provide events to hook into - start(), frame() and click(x, y) - and this would be an immensely satisfying console to immediately get to work on, as rather than worry about graphics and audio, you&#39;re free to get right into making it fun....also, it&#39;d be an excellent framework for teaching kids how to code! :D"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, on reading this I imagine that this is purely for &#34;mature&#34; process nodes, and not definitely for cutting-edge nodes, plus the fact that some of the semiconductor infrastructure is already there, so 7 billion US dollars might be in the correct ballpark.Well, at least Japanese manufacturers (probably more of automobile suppliers like Denso rather than Sony&#39;s mobile division) will have a domestic source."</p>

Maybe we can all aim a little lower (or higher depending on how you see it) now.Thank you Jorg.Our condolences to your loved ones."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"First of all, compassion and condolences for Schilling’s family.Second of all, I had a very recent positive interaction with him.  I recently was in contact with Mr. Schilling to report a bug in CDR tools.  Even though he was (looking back) dying, he was very prompt in replying to me and discussing the bug with me over email.  However, even though I gave him a fix, he was unable to apply it, probably because of his poor health.Thirdly, there is a really serious bug in CDR tools: It will start creating bad timestamps in 2028.  That’s not a typo: 2028 (not 2038).  Because of how ISO 9660 filesystems store timestamps (8-bit number, 0 is 1900), on 2038 (1900 + 128), unless the 8-bit number is explicitly made an unsigned number (assumed with other ISO 9660 implementations), there will be issues with timestamps. [1]A full bug report, complete with a bugfix is here: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=990468A fork of cdrtools with this bug fixed is on GitHub: https://github.com/samboy/iso9660Again, prayers for Schilling’s family, and he was very professional in his interactions with me, even in his final days.[1] The issue is with how Schilling’s CDR tools calculates timezones; the time zone becomes an invalid number starting in 2028."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know as well as anybody that he was a man with strong opinions and a willingness to share them, but he also had a willingness to laugh at himself and his work.

  Cdrecord has even more options than ls."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I quit Amazon 3 weeks ago after nearly a decade. Work from home was one of the biggest reasons.In my view, the personality traits that are conducive to promotion up the Amazon leadership ladder are strongly aligned with loving work-from-office. Most people L10 and higher not only don&#39;t understand the desire for permanent work from home, I think maybe they cannot understand it. It&#39;s just too foreign to many of them.The first announcement was &#34;We can&#39;t wait to be back in the office, and we know you can&#39;t either&#34;. Senior engineers started quitting. Then it was &#34;Okay, okay, you can work from home 2-3 days per week, but only with your L10&#39;s approval&#34;. The exodus continued.Now it&#39;s &#34;Fine, you can work from home with your L8&#39;s approval, but you better be ready to show up on 24 hour notice if we say so!&#34;. The biggest benefit of work from home is not needing to commute, and lower cost of living by leaving the HCOL cities.They don&#39;t get it. Other companies do. And anyone who has spent 5 or more years working for Amazon is well-trained enough to get a better paying job with a company that understands the cultural shift that just happened to the developer world.Edit: I know not all developers are anti-office. But for those of us who are, working for people who don&#39;t understand us, who make policies based on what works best for them, is a problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I live in Seattle and thus a notable percentage of my social circle works at Amazon.The folks I know who work there were almost entirely all prepared to quit if the company forced their initial &#34;everyone back in the office&#34; requirement, especially in this current job market.It feels rare to see Amazon ever make a change to such a publicly stated policy like this, I can only imagine that the groundswell of feedback from employees was quite startling in how much of a problem their retention would be with such a hard rule."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone on the inside: the title is mostly BS.They are pushing the decision from the L10+ level to the L7/L8 level. But we all know behind the scenes, L7/L8 will be pushed to behave a certain way. If it was truly their choice, those with a strict policy would bleed engineers to the directors with more lax policies, Amazon would not accidentally create a free market within their own company.This is a deflection of blame, and nothing else."</p>

Our operation and our frontline employees have endured continuous and unending disruptions since the first time our airline made headlines in early June due to widespread IT failures. Our Pilots are tired and frustrated because our operation is running on empty due to a lack of support from the Company.https://www.swapa.org/news/2021/swa-in-the-news/"</p>

Can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever really seen anything like this, and it genuinely freaks me out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seeing stories like this makes me wonder if we&#39;ll ever see a company actually go bust based purely on the instability of its decades-old, duct-taped architecture.I have a relative who works for a large credit card processor running on mainframe systems and I hear over and over again that they&#39;re all retiring and unable to fill the newly opened roles. This problem is compounded by the fact that their offshore contracting firms are cutting back on providing COBOL resources because there&#39;s a lot more money in supplying java/.net/etc. devs. The work culture there sounds so unsustainable and yet they&#39;re one of the largest payment processors in the country. If they were have widespread stability issues like this, things could get interesting."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a neat article, but it does have some errors.One subtle point that the post gets wrong:&gt; So where does that come from? The answer is that Python stores everything inside dictionaries associated with each local scope. Which means that every piece of code has its own defined “local scope” which is accessed using locals() inside that code, that contains the values corresponding to each variable name.The dictionary returned by `locals()` is not literally a function&#39;s local namespace, it&#39;s a copy of that namespace. The actual local namespace is an array that is part of the frame object; in this way, references to local variables may happen much more quickly than would be the case if it had to look each variable up in a dictionary every time.One consequence of this is that you can&#39;t mutate the dict returned by `locals()` in order to change the value of a function-local variable.Another, less-subtle error in the post is this:&gt; int is another widely-used, fundamental primitive data type. It’s also the lowest common denominator of 2 other data types: , float and complex. complex is a supertype of float, which, in turn, is a supertype of int.&gt; What this means is that all ints are valid as a float as well as a complex, but not the other way around. Similarly, all floats are also valid as a complex.Oh, no no no. Python integers are arbitrary-precision integers. Floats are IEEE 754 double-precision binary floating-point values, and as such only support full integer precision up to 2^53. The int type can represent values beyond that range which the float type cannot.And while it is true that the complex type is just two floats stuck together, I would very much not call it a supertype. It performs distinct operations.&gt; Accessing an attribute with obj.x calls the __getattr__ method underneath. Similarly setting a new attribute and deleting an attribute calls __setattr__ and __detattr__ respectively.Attribute lookup in Python is way more complex than this. It&#39;s an enormous tar pit, too much so to detail in this comment, but __getattr__ is most often not involved, and the `object` type doesn&#39;t even have a __getattr__ method."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cute fact about __debug__: it is one of the only ways to get compile-time conditionals in Python. Performing a comparison with `if __debug__:` will output byte code for the ensuing statement if and only if the interpreter is in debug mode - notably, in `-O` mode, it will not even generate a load of __debug__ and a conditional jump, and acts as if the statement didn’t exist at all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In addition to this, I highly recommend just reading the codebase. I haven&#39;t written C since college and it&#39;s remarkably readable.I once tried to catalogue all the stdlib operations which release the GIL, meaning if you use only those (well, only those &#34;heavy&#34; bits, you can still use other small blocking glue bits), you can do &#34;real&#34; multithreading.It was a fun exercise!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"How do we neuter the power of Twitter mobs?

Their demands are usually to fire, boycott, or boot people with opinions that run afoul of the mob.Not a healthy precedent to set. We will regret this later if we continue down this path."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Actually it&#39;s not different. University lecturers have been protested or cancelled for decades for reasons unrelated to their topic, usually due to political beliefs or corporate interests that clashed with students&#39; ideals. &#34;Cancel culture&#34; is specifically about &#34;personal&#34; societal reforms, which is what makes it different than the older complaints about general politics.Back in the day it was &#34;edgy&#34; to protest or cancel a speaker due to their support of the Vietnam war. People were just as angry (or more so!) at Vietnam protesters as people are today about &#34;cancel culture&#34; protesters, and vice versa. At the time, it was those young freaks with the long hair who were clearly nuts and extremists and going to erode the country&#39;s moral decency. Counter-culture folk in the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s were a tiny but vocal minority of young people who were largely put down for their radical views about war and the environment. It&#39;s only in hindsight that protesting the Vietnam war seems socially acceptable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; John Carlson LectureAs a disclaimer I am against any censorship of academia and think that even Charles Murray should be allowed to speak at a university (assuming he is invited by an academic department or student group) and that the university should never have veto power.However, I think the example in the Atlantic is actually more mild than past cases: the John Carlson Lecture is a general audience talk that the university holds to boost its public image.It’s not an academic talk discussing new research or a political perspective, but rather summarizes ideas for the public. If MIT wants to decide who should give such talks I don’t care.In contrast, if a department or student group wants to invite a specific speaker for a specialized talk about politics, science, math, then the university censoring such discourse is what is truly dangerous.In this light, the cancellation of Milo Yiannopoulos who was invited by the College Republican club is much worse. Even though personally I do not think Yiannopoulos is anything but a provocateur, if someone (group/department) wants to invite him the university should not block him from speaking."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If i were to describe the Assange case in a word, it would be myopic.once again the US has decided this is the hill it will die on.  instead of reforming intelligence agencies, challenging the doctrine of mass surveillance, revisiting the manifest destiny of imperialist foreign policy, or even considering the cost to do nothing at all, the US has arrived at the conclusion that a witch hunt is the best hunt.prosecuting and jailing Assange does absolutely nothing to stop Wikileaks or wilileaks-&gt;next().  Whatever effort the US spent to slander and discredit Assange does nothing to stop people inspired by him, or motivated by US foreign policy in countries that do not enjoy its favour.  The US seems completely oblivious to the fact that whatever happens to Assange the journalist, it simply isnt enough to curtail the overwhelming cacophony of demand for free and open journalism across the internet.Just let the guy go and focus the money, time, and effort on preventing this in the future.  nearly every major news outlet and journalist all see Assange as a journalist, not a hacker.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I cannot comment on the long term effect of blue light, but at the very least i experience very significant discomfort when turning off any piece of software that makes the screen a more warm color (for example, f.lux on Windows https://justgetflux.com/ and something like Redshift https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Redshift on *nix), to the point where it makes me avert my gaze.Due to me working primarily as a developer, i don&#39;t always need good color accuracy, so my current settings of screen color warmth are the following:  Day: 4300K
  Sunset: 3000K
  Night: 2550K

In addition to that, i have a few smart lightbulbs that change to a more red color as the night approaches and gently dim more and more when i don&#39;t need to do any reading and just have to walk around the house. Subjectively, i&#39;d say that it&#39;s better for me being able to fall asleep and experience a bit less eye strain (though admittedly, using a computer late into the night is never a good idea).Perhaps the discomfort is just because of eyes having a hard time adjusting to noticeably different lighting conditions, but maybe there&#39;s more to it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recall that a paper published by Oxford in a journal related to gerontology claimed that blue light accelerated aging of the retina. If I understand correctly, this article doesn&#39;t counter that claim outright, it just didn&#39;t find that risk with the low intensity of blue light coming from a typical monitor.Tangentially related, that same Oxford paper (sorry I don&#39;t have a link and no longer have access to the paper) did however claim that light generated by red LEDs with sufficient intensity to leave a significant persistence effect after 3 minutes of exposure can reverse aging and damage in subjects over 40 years old although the sample size was just a few dozen people IIRC. It does so because somehow the retina&#39;s mitochondrial function is improved by light in the 650nm to 1000nm range.Continuing on this tangent, I am 50 and have been exposing my eyes to red light for 3 minutes a day for many months and feel like my night vision has been restored. If I wake up in the middle of the night I used to see gray noise and now I can see darker black with better contrast. But I may be kidding myself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On a note related to eye strain, but unrelated to blue light: the best solution I&#39;ve found for eye strain is to wear reading glasses (or if you are near-sighted, glasses with an additional diopter or two) even if you don&#39;t need them. With the correct SPH value, the screen will be at optical infinity and your eyes will be fully relaxed.Another pro-tip unrelated to the article: if you like to read at night in bed but find LCDs/OLEDs bothersome, I recommend trying red-on-black text. Particularly nice for glasses wearers who are bothered by chromatic aberration.---On the subject of this article: does anyone have a translation of the study itself? While I&#39;m not at all surprised that there is no retinal damage, I&#39;m very surprised that they found sleep was unaffected. Blue light does more strongly activate ipGRCs, after all.[0] And that clearly suppresses melatonin.I&#39;d also like to know if by blue-light blocking lenses the article means the ones that block &#34;high-frequency blue&#34; light (Zenni brands these as &#34;Blokz Blue Blockers&#34;) which are probably useless because the violet/UV light they block aren&#39;t actually produced by most displays, or if they mean the orange-tinted glasses that obviously cut into blue light.[0]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsically_photosensitive_r..."</p>

				</div>
				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28812486">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi all, I work on the VS Code team. This came up the other day in stand up and the initial plan was to deprecate and eventually remove the old setting. Several of us pushed back and said while we may deprecate the setting in favor of something else, the old setting should always be respected due to the sensitivity around telemetry.If there&#39;s any confusion around this messaging it&#39;s because this discussion literally happened 2 days ago. I&#39;ll reopen https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/134660 to make sure we clear up confusion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Microsoft has really been pushing the telemetry lately. Edge phones home far more than any other browser. Windows itself has no way to fully disable data collection (only the option to send &#34;basic&#34; or &#34;full&#34; data, including which websites you visit--oof). If you use Pro and you are enough of a power user to feel comfortable editing registry settings, that&#39;s what is now required to turn telemetry off, and even then it&#39;s hard to know you did it correctly. And this type of tracking is pervasive across the entire Microsoft ecosystem, including within Xbox, Minecraft, Teams, and now VSCode. It&#39;s disappointing to say the least."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who&#39;s worked on multiple power-user GUIs professionally, telemetry can be genuinely useful for improving the product. You can discover features that are never used and should be removed so attention can be focused elsewhere, and others that are used frequently and deserve more attention, and others that users may frequently have trouble with and should be fixed or improved.I&#39;m not saying this justifies dark patterns, and I have no firsthand knowledge of whether Microsoft is exclusively using this data for legitimate purposes. If it were me I&#39;d enable it by default but make it clear and easy to disable for those who care. That said: I don&#39;t think the knee-jerk assumption that this is a wholly evil thing is justified."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you&#39;re looking at going even deeper into SSH tunneling and port redirection, I recently made The Cyber Plumber&#39;s Handbook free: https://github.com/opsdisk/the_cyber_plumbers_handbookI made it free to the HN community a few years back [1].  There is a paid interactive lab portion (details in the repo) if you are looking for hands-on experience.Book OverviewThis book is packed with practical and real world examples of SSH tunneling and port redirection in multiple realistic scenarios. It walks you through the basics of SSH tunneling (both local and remote port forwards), SOCKS proxies, port redirection, and how to utilize them with other tools like proxychains, nmap, Metasploit, and web browsers.Advanced topics included SSHing through 4 jump boxes, throwing exploits through SSH tunnels, scanning assets using proxychains and Metasploit&#39;s Meterpreter, browsing the Internet through a SOCKS proxy, utilizing proxychains and nmap to scan targets, and leveraging Metasploit&#39;s Meterpreter portfwd command.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19946941"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can also change/add them after the ssh session has started.This uses the escape mechanism. For help on that, hit return, type &#34;~?&#34; and hit return again.From there you will see that &#34;~#&#34; will list them. And &#34;~C&#34; takes you to a line-oriented command prompt where you can add them.For example, type return &#34;~C&#34;, then at the prompt type &#34;-L1234:localhost:22&#34;. Then in another window, type &#34;telnet localhost 1234&#34;. Then back in the ssh window, type return &#34;~#&#34; and you will see the tunnel being used.Another trick: if you don&#39;t need a shell and only want to forward ports, run &#34;ssh -N&#34; instead of &#34;ssh&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have read far too many ssh tunneling articles and all of them either forget about the bind address or just pretend that the only host that can be tunneled is localhost.The fact is that ssh tunnels are bound to an interface on one side and the other can be any (reachable) host:port.  So if example.com:1234 isn’t reachable from your host network, you can do a local port forward to example.com:1234 from an intermediary host that can reach example.com:1234"</p>

Article 5(1) of the Directive says:&gt; [certain acts] shall not require authorization by the rightholder where they are necessary for the use of the computer program by the lawful acquirer in accordance with its intended purpose, including for error correction.Essentially, they have ruled that other Articles in the Directive do not supersede this Article, and that reverse engineering to correct an error can be necessary.This court, the CJEU, has good form on sensible decisions regarding computing. For example, SAS vs World Programming (C‑406/10) allowed reverse engineering for interoperability. That case, also, was the court upholding the clear intention of the statute.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My take on this is that Ireland is now willing to come into compliance because post-Brexit, they now have a monopoly on &#34;urban core that could sustain an HQ for multinationals in a natively-English-speaking country in the EU.&#34;In other words, they relied on tax advantages as a differentiator for companies to choose Dublin over London for their EU HQ.  But now, what would you choose if not Dublin?  Obviously Paris and Berlin are candidates but if you&#39;re a straightforward multinational, or certainly a company that is actually based/headquartered in the US, you&#39;re going to experience a lot less of a shock in a natively-English-speaking country.So it seems to be that Dublin wins now, tax advantage or no tax advantage.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"With Hollywood Accounting[1], you make taxable profits transform into untaxable expenses that you pay to yourself for services you rendered to yourself, and Ireland has been a common destination for this sort of money to flow.  Hollywood accounting can take several forms. In one form,
  a subsidiary is formed to perform a given activity and the
  parent entity will extract money out of the film&#39;s revenue
  in the form of charges for certain &#34;services&#34;. For example,
  a film studio has a distribution arm as a sub-entity, which
  will then charge the studio a &#34;distribution fee&#34; — essentially,
  the studio charging itself a sum it has total control over and
  hence control the profitability report of a project.

[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_accountingEssentially, Apple USA makes billions selling iPhones in the USA, then pays those billions to Apple Ireland for the right to put little Apple logos on iPhones. Likewise, Google USA pays billions in US ad sales profits to Google Ireland for the right to use Google tech for Google search.When the Irish loophole closes I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll think up another &#34;One Weird Trick&#34; to make taxable profits mystically transmute into untaxable expenses."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve always been baffled as to how this is seen as a multi-national issue.

Just because you&#39;re only paying 3%[1] profit[3] tax in Bermuda doesn&#39;t mean you can necessarily skate around the remaining 12% when doing business in the US - the US could just pocket that additional 12% if nobody else wanted it.  Implement a policy like that and the competitive tax advantage of havens disappears overnight and all this BS disappears.We[2] have tax loopholes because we want to continue to have tax loopholes.1.

For many no access to Facebook means loosing connection to everything including services essential for their offline life. Even in a very developed EU country I already happen to face cases when something is only available via Facebook because some companies don&#39;t bother having their own websites/emails/phones (often on purpose - to improve their Facebook rank).This is a very serious problem - hyper-centalization in hands of one corporation which can fail you intentionally or not. Facebook is becoming sort of the Chinese system (AFAIK standard WWW is almost nonexistent in China, they mostly use apps within social networks which are easier for the government to control) for the whole world.Looking more broadly it&#39;s another layer of the malicious trend to wrap the things in more and more layers.First we had native desktop apps (which always could communicate data to network servers). Then we have wrapped the apps in the browser (which essentially is an OS on an OS) but we had our pages on independent servers. Then we invented &#34;social networks&#34; and are putting everything in there.We could just improve desktop apps tech (including discoverability, delivery, interoperability, portability and UI design flexibility) but we chose the browsers.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Software is becoming less and less of a tech industry and more and more commoditized. Very little innovation in the past 5-10 years. Very few successful companies during that time have come about by having incredibly innovative and novel technology - almost all are simply using run of the mill, commoditized technology to solve business problems that they have large domain knowledge of. Given this, it makes total sense that having detailed esoteric technical knowledge is no longer the path to success in 2021, and ultimately, hacker news has always been predominately about one thing - how to get rich. The best methods have simply shifted over the last 15 years from being a tech genius to being technically-proficient domain knowledge expert"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps this goes against most commenters here, but I find HN to be an appropriate mix of both that has not changed much with time. Reading that link of Hacker News from 15 years ago feels little different from what it is today. This contrasts dramatically with the Reddit of 10-15 years ago vs what it is like today.Discussion here is also still very high quality. I find it remarkable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; If the bee is placed under federal protection, farmers or developers who harm the insects could face up to $13,000 in fines each time one is killed, Live Science reports.Note that the article identifies systemic causes (use of neonicotinoids, habitat loss) as causes, and correlational evidence (&#34;States with the most significant dip in bee numbers have the largest increase in the use of pesticides like neonicotinoids, insecticides, and fungicides&#34;), but the enforcement mechanism they mention is centered around individual actors after specific killed insects where it&#39;s presumed that attribution is clear. Does this make any kind of sense?1. Would we know when bees are killed? The evidence that we know how to gather, so far as I can tell, is mostly counting live bees, not finding dead ones. Are there examples of small, highly mobile insects with ESA protection where we&#39;re actively seeking out and finding dead individuals?2. Is it typically possible to attribute bee deaths to single actors? If a bumblebee is found at location X, we might guess that it would have ranged over an area with radius r around that (but we&#39;re not sure what its actual territory would have been) which includes N properties, N_d of which have been developed and N_p of which use pesticides, who is responsible?3. And if the best scientific understanding is about broad practices (habitat destruction, pesticide use, ...) am I correct in my belief that we don&#39;t have any real mechanism of holding a class of individuals (e.g. Maine farmers who used neonicotinoids during a given time period) responsible for an impact to a bee population (e.g. it&#39;s estimated by experts to decline 5% in a given year) in the absence of a specific pile of dead bees?With this, as with a number of other large issues, I think we need new concepts around group responsibility. We have a concept of class action lawsuits, where a large group identified by a criteria (e.g. people whose data was exposed by Equifax) can be plaintiffs, because individuals meeting that criteria can elect (or not) to be represented in that group. We do _not_ have a concept of a large group of people identified by a criteria (farms using particular pesticides, developers of properties in the urban-wildland interface) being held responsible for harms that proceed from that criteria."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I paid money to cross the Pacific Ocean on a Maersk line, 300 meter cargo ship (us_en here). Many people asked me if I worked to be on board, and the answer was &#34;no&#34;, Maersk did not allow it.  The officers were mostly East Germans who needed a job, while the strictly segregated, &#34;A-Bs&#34; were almost all Pacific Islanders of some kind. The conditions were clean and professional, but I got the feeling soon that this was not a desirable job. The officers would spend at least 60 days on duty, often more.. without a vacation day, but had a weekly day &#34;off&#34; or two, except the Captain who is technically working at all times.I enjoyed the travel and had a good voyage, with many small things to say about it at another time. As I learn about &#34;business&#34; and the world, I understand more about labor abuses, even with &#34;respectable&#34; companies. And, your outrage does nothing, because people who mistreat others professionally are quite used to the complaining, including yours.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The ocean is a different place in so many ways.My cousin is a Merchant Marine Engineer. Some big ships can&#39;t leave port without one, yet they are in short supply. So he&#39;s paid a lot per voyage. Two or three multi-week voyages and he&#39;d done working for the year.Early on in his career, an officer would request his passport. To make things go faster in port, all the passports could be presented at once for quicker clearing of customs etc.Of course he learned immediately, this meant he could not leave the ship in foreign port. And the officer sandbagged when he requested his passport back. The result was, he was essentially held captive for several months aboard ship, several times longer than he was contracted for. And the ship could count on having an Engineer for every leg of the journey.Now he knows better, keeps his passport on his person at all times."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Like many here, I can attribute where I am in life today largely to TI calculator programming. I made many friends on Cemetech with whom I still keep in touch, including a few named in this article.I racked up thousands of posts on the Cemetech and United TI forums and spent countless hours hanging out in the game Blockland which was also popular among those folks in the mid 2000s.To me, one of the most impressive folks in this list is calc84maniac, who joined the scene a year or two after me, but quickly surpassed me in skill, becoming a z80 ASM whiz at the age of ~13 or so, whereas some of the other (very talented) folks were at least STEM university students.I know a few people in this article such as SirCmpwn are on HN, too, so hopefully they chime in this thread.Some of the most memorable things about programming in BASIC on these calculators were the absurd constraints. Your whole program was limited to a few kilobytes. You only had 27 floating point variables, a few lists of floats with a maximum length of 999, no real functions or stack or anything, etc. You’d shave bytes by taking advantage of syntactical quirks that the interpreter happened to accept, like not closing parentheses at the end of a line.I don’t have much of value to add other than expressing some serious nostalgia."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since we&#39;re swapping TI calculator stories...In 8th grade Geometry class circa 2007, I had an awesome teacher and loved the subject. I found an extra TI-83+ laying around the house from my brothers. I found a guide online and started building simple programs.A few weeks later, there was a quiz. I asked the teacher if it was permissible to use calculator programs on the quiz. He thought a moment and said it was fine as long as I wrote them myself.So I wrote a very simple program that probably did little more than guide which formula to use in a basic decision tree.It was the hardest quiz of the year, it was just difficult content. My class has 1 A, 1 B, 1 C, and about 23 F&#39;s. I was the B.After that, graphing calculators weren&#39;t allowed.Mad respect for Mr. Gass. He had two Apple IIe&#39;s and had programmed Wheel of Fortune and Jeopard! for review days ahead of tests. He had a couple TV&#39;s around the classroom so everyone could see the game well, and would turn on Bill Cosby during some working sessions because at the time, he was a well respected man.Mrs. Gass was also a math teacher. Some students who had both teachers made shirts which advertised &#34;I passed Gass twice&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ohh, TI stories! Here we go!&#34;Hey, distantaidenn, I wanna talk to you after class.&#34; These were the words of my then high school math teacher. I wasn&#39;t worried, I was a good student. Little did I know, this would shape my career for the next 20 years. When after class came, my teacher handed me a brand spanking new TI-83. &#34;We&#39;re gonna be using these in class from now on. Take this home for the weekend, learn how to use it, and teach the rest of the class.&#34; I held in my excitement, and took the device, along with its 1-inch thick manual.I pored over the manual. Before I knew it, I had mathematical functions dancing across the screen. All of our current math equations set up to accept variables and spit out answers. I didn&#39;t know it at the time, but I was &#34;programming.&#34; I began to dabble in TI-Basic -- I had no idea what it was, but apparently, it was the language this giant calculator used, and I&#39;d have to learn that language to make this machine do my bidding. So I learned it. The next year in school, I signed up for an elective Programming class, and lo and behold, it was in Basic -- I thought to myself, this looks familiar, I know this! I finally made the connection that I had been &#34;programming&#34; the whole time. From then I was hooked.Fast forward to university, I gained a degree that was as far from programming as possible, but I always had my scripts. I was the guy that could talk to computers. I was at home on the command line. And I knew enough html and JS to make a shitty web page, if necessary.And here I am now, still engineering and managing, and making (I&#39;d like to think) not so shitty products for a living."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been thinking about the difference between human users and computational agents. There is a widespread pattern of enforcing that only human users may interact with a service, not computational agents. Running a user-installed extension is one example; additional examples are CAPTCHAs, account verification by phone number, or services which refuse to provide API access such as banks.Sometimes the reason is to protect users (e.g. banks), sometimes to protect the service from abuse. But often the reason is to ensure value can be extracted from users (e.g. serving ad impressions) or the power that can be exerted over users. Regardless, I believe this comes down to power: computer scientists understand that acting through a computational agent is fundamentally more powerful than acting directly as a human user. Computational agents can operate at scale, they provide virtualization (e.g. throwaway identities), and thereby conserve the ultimate scarce resource: our attention. Many systems seem to have computational power asymmetry as their fundamental principle: as little human contact on the system&#39;s side as possible; as much human contact on the user&#39;s side as possible.If there&#39;s any path ahead that avoids a totalitarian nightmare resulting from asymptotic concentration of power, it depends on cultivating a more widespread understanding of computational power and developing new social norms and policies. As a CS educator, this is one of my top priorities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I manually unfollowed almost every friend and every page I followed a couple years ago. My feed is now a very limited selection of gaming and media posts that I  enjoy immensely. No politics at all and almost nothing in my feed from actual individuals that I know. I ended up enjoying Facebook again, even if in a very different way.It was a tedious process and a tool like this could help a lot of people find their own value in the platform by getting a fresh start. Sadly, FB has no interest in that and would rather corral us in ways as to maximize their own benefit, not ours."</p>

What&#39;s the use of making a great income if you can&#39;t get the time off to enjoy it?The culture about the use of PTO varies wildly between companies.  A friend of mine worked somewhere that supposedly gave 20 days PTO per year, but trying to actually use more than a single day at a time was always met with denials, and even if you did take a Friday off, you were expected to work 10 hours/day the other 4 days of that week to make up for it.So yeah, when I&#39;m interviewing, I want to know how much time people are taking off, but I don&#39;t want the interviewer to think I&#39;m lazy and will be trying to avoid work as much as possible."</p>

Some programmers will do in 1 day what you wont achieve in a life time. And not understanding that makes you a bad programmer by my book simply because this is the foundation of the job.So let me give one advice: you are not producing code, you are engineering code. Some will find solutions that the others will not find. Thats where the 10x programmer thing come from. The guy who wrote bittorrent said something like the following: &#34;I&#39;ve written bittorrent in a way you would never have thought about&#34;.You think John Carmack was the only one trying to make 3d games when Doom came out? Thousands of programmers where trying to. Does that make him a 10x programmer in your opinion? Or more like a 1000x?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"LOL !&#34;The chief financial officer is Giancarlo Devasini, a former plastic surgeon from Italy who was once described on Tether’s website as the founder of a successful electronics business.The only reference to him that turned up in a search of Italian newspapers showed he was once fined for selling counterfeit Microsoft software.Elsewhere on the website, there’s a letter from an accounting firm stating that Tether has the reserves to back its coins, along with a pie chart showing that about $30 billion of its dollar holdings are invested in commercial paper—short-term loans to corporations. That would make Tether the seventh-largest holder of such debt, right up there with Charles Schwab and Vanguard Group.To fact-check this claim, a few colleagues and I canvassed Wall Street traders to see if any had seen Tether buying anything. No one had. “It’s a small market with a lot of people who know each other,” said Deborah Cunningham, chief investment officer of global money markets at Federated Hermes, an asset management company in Pittsburgh. “If there
 were a new entrant, it would be usually very obvious.”&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-07/crypto-my..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t understand how Tether has survived this long. Bitfinex and Tether sure look transparently like a fraud, all the way back to the &#34;no really we have $1 in the bank for every Tether but you can&#39;t audit us&#34; days. And yet it continues to occupy its role as the underpinning of most cryptocurrency markets. Why hasn&#39;t it blown up yet? My best guess is that it&#39;s useful to everyone taking in money from new retail investors. Also there&#39;s no clear financial incentive for blowing it up; there&#39;s no way to easily short Tether, for instance.This article talks about the way Tether is loaning out what reserves they have. The Economist looked at this phenomenon and found Tether has a 383-to-1 leverage. That&#39;s going to be a complete disaster the moment there&#39;s a major blip in the economy. Say, a major Chinese real estate company going broke. Or interest rates in the West finally going up and causing a market correction. Maybe that&#39;s what will blow it up.The good news is the Economist also thinks the inevitable cryptocurrency disaster will be bad but won&#39;t destroy world economies. &#34; its holders would lose hundreds of billions of dollars but that the fallout would be manageable.&#34; I sure hope that happens before this tower of unregulated investments gets so big that when it falls over it crushes the real economy.But don&#39;t worry folks, this is all good for Bitcoin.https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/08/07/why-regulators-..."</p>

Or what is the relationship between the projects and Microsoft/.NET Foundation?Reading the &#34;apology&#34; on github, it seems that .NET Foundation/Microsoft thinks those projects are essentially theirs, and they are free to put them under their enterprise account to &#34;simplify billing&#34;https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/Home/discussions/39But reading this article, and the one below, the maintainers think otherwise?https://www.glennwatson.net/posts/dnf-problems-solutionsThere are also some notes about copyright that I don&#39;t understand. Who owns the copyright? Microsoft or the maintainers?edit: From the github &#34;apology&#34;:&gt; Projects might not fully understand what joining the .NET Foundation means. We share a checklist with project maintainers on project changes they accept as part of becoming part of the .NET Foundation. That’s obviously not sufficient. We will post a new document that describes what you can expect when your project joins the .NET Foundation. This will include changes (observable or legal) and new benefits. It will also include changes that could occur later.....ok? That seems scary, coming from Microsoft"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anyone here old enough to remember when SourceForge was The Place(tm) to stick OSS code and then how it fell from grace?I’m curious in what ways the MicroSoft take over of GitHub is and is not starting to feel like that.For me, one is just the difference in scale. GitHub is vast in both content as well as tooling compared to SourceForge at it’s highest points. And a commercial entity orders of magnitude smaller than MicroSoft took over SF. The rate of descent into Not Good(tm) territory also seems slower and more ponderous.But while the magnitudes differ, the vectors look similar. Not exactly the same, because history rhymes with itself before it repeats itself.Curious what other similarities and dissimilarities other old timers see."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The official reason is because of housing:&#34;To be clear we will be continuing to expand our activities in California,&#34; Musk said. &#34;Our intention is to increase output from Fremont and Giga Nevada by 50%. If you go to our Fremont factory it&#39;s jammed.&#34;But, he added, &#34;It&#39;s tough for people to afford houses, and people have to come in from far away....There&#39;s a limit to how big you can scale in the Bay Area.&#34;https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/tesla-moves-headqu..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When CEOs move, they often move their headquarters closer to where they live. Somehow Tesla managed to survive all the problems of California until shortly after Musk moved to Texas. Folks talking about the advantages and disadvantages of California vs Texas may be overthinking this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">" Whenever I read news like this I can never figure out what moving a company&#39;s headquarters actually means. Musk has already been living in Texas for a while. Tesla already has sizable operations there (both offices and factories). The company is registered in Delaware, so legally this change means nothing. They aren&#39;t going to fire employees in California or force them to move (in fact Musk said that they will continue to expand their Bay Area staff). They will continue to pay (or not pay) taxes exactly the same as before. So, besides a press release what is the change exactly?It&#39;s also funny that Tesla still can&#39;t sell their cars directly to customers in Texas."</p>

That has happened for much sillier and vain reasons. But I doubt there’s much to gain via the courts in the current state of things.

We&#39;ve reached out to Cloudflare to get them to take it down but nothing has been done. You also have a Cloudflare account to file a complaint, which I found to be odd. We&#39;re a Cloudflare customer too...but still that shouldn&#39;t be a hoop you have to jump through. Now there is this identical phishing site out there that Cloudflare reverse proxies and we can&#39;t see who registered the domain or who hosts the site (since Cloudflare masks the IPs.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The aspect of this case that stands out to me is that copyright is claimed in clothing and fashions:  &#34;counterfeit retailers that sell knock-off dresses using the plaintiffs&#39; copyrighted images&#34;, a claim traditionally well outside copyright, and at best quite grey.  Copyright covers works of original authorship but not either ideas or functional aspects of design.See the strong-IP case from the Copyright Alliance, who can at best muster an &#34;it depends&#34;:There are some mixed messages out there about whether fashion designs are eligible for copyright protection. Some experts would say “no,” others would say “yes,” and they’re both right it depends.https://copyrightalliance.org/education/qa-headlines/copyrig...In the US, such protections are still only at the &#34;being considered&#34; stage as best I can tell:The major amendment, of course, would be the extension of design protection to fashion designs, by amending § 1301(a) to provide that “A fashion design is subject to protection under this chapter” and by amending § 1302(b) to include “an article of apparel” in the definition of “useful articles” subject to protection.https://www.copyright.gov/docs/regstat072706.htmlAs the Copyright office&#39;s discussion notes, there are non-expressive protections in the specific case of ship hull designs (also in chip masks).  But fashion itself has remained largely a copyright-free zone.The proposed language did not enter into US law as evideced at Cornell&#39;s USC server:https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1301Cloudflare has secured this round without challenging the copyrightability of the alleged infinged works themselves, but probably also has that arrow in their quivver should they need to invoke it.   The court&#39;s decision here is actually a broader protection for Cloudflare (it would apply against any infringement claim), though it doesn&#39;t invalidate the plaintiff&#39;s IMO questionable fashion-based copyright claims."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Personally I find Backblaze B2 more compelling.... Ok, after writing that, I realized that I should probably look up R2&#39;s offering first. And then my jaw hit the floor at &#34;free egress bandwidth&#34;.Free egress bandwidth? Yes please.I will instantly convert.Then I was worried about price per GB. $0.015/GB is incredibly competitive.Good lord, where do I get early access to this thing? I&#39;d transition all our infra today."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO, the best feature Cloudflare added to R2 was the automatic migration. This makes sense for a CDN to offer, but if R2 works, this makes it pretty simple to migrate.&#34;After specifying an existing storage bucket, R2 will serve requests for objects from the existing bucket,&#34;I&#39;ve Beene evaluating R2, but this migration path makes it dead simple to use. I just point my code to read/write from/to R2 instead of S3, and I&#39;ll get egress fees from AWS during the migration, but then that&#39;s it?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article touches on the one major unanswered question I have about R2:  CloudFlare&#39;s CDN ToS make it clear CF is meant to host websites and APIs, not content downloads [1].  Does R2 have similar ToS?  It&#39;s reasonable that CF doesn&#39;t want R2 customers that use 500MB of paid storage and 500TB of free bandwidth, so what is acceptable use?[1] The Services are offered primarily as a platform to cache and serve web pages and websites.
