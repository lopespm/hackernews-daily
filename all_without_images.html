There must be more. Perhaps he also deployed it? That would be a different story. The article is quite murky in that regard. Perhaps they don&#39;t know yet.In there is an interesting paragraph explaining what Tornado Cash is:… The (criminal) origin of the cryptocurrencies is often not or hardly checked by such mixing services. Users of a mixing service mostly do this to increase their anonymity.Note how they sneaked &#34;criminal&#34; in there. There are of course legitimate reasons to desire anonymity for financial transactions! It&#39;s one of the reasons people like to pay cash.Satoshi Nakamoto is wise to remain anonymous."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of the apologists for this are making arguments along the lines of &#34;being decentralized doesn&#39;t make you exempt from the rules&#34; or &#34;imagine if a bank laundered this much money&#34;.The problem is it doesn&#39;t make sense to treat protocols like companies. And it definitely doesn&#39;t make sense to treat protocol devs as if they were the executives of those companies. The CEO of a bank and the lead dev of a protocol have very very different powers and responsibilities, and we can&#39;t just throw our hands up in the air and say &#34;the law&#39;s the law, and you gotta follow it&#34; (even when it&#39;s literally impossible given the decentralized and autonomous nature of the protocol).Analogously when joint-stock corporations first entered the scene it required the development of whole new branches of Western law. That law had to be tailored to reflect the realities and nature of joint-stock corporations. What would have been very dumb is simply to pretend like nothing changed and say &#34;same rules apply&#34; and make individual shareholders liable for the action of the corporate entity the same way we&#39;re trying to make software devs liable for the action of the decentralized protocol."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The effect of all of this nonsense will to drive developers into pseudonymity. It won&#39;t solve the &#34;problem&#34; of developers building privacy tools. It won&#39;t stop experimentation with shitcoins. But it will eliminate the phenomenon of the Buterin-style project lead and &#34;core developer&#34;.The bullseye has been painted. And now those who have reaped the benefits of fame will come to know why Satoshi concluded that it was a trap to be avoided. The legal pressure that will be brought to bear on the Ethereum foundation to enact various changes will be enormous and never-ending.It doesn&#39;t matter whether or not this case flies. That will take many years to sort out. In the meantime, rational actors will do the rational thing. Everyone else will receive summons and indictments."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Story time - My dad asked the local school which had a goat if he can borrow it for a weekend. It was to tame his backyard. As the backyard was enclosed with no chance of the goat escaping, we left it by itself. The goat was be extremely hungry and ate everything insight including the roots, leaves and bark. By Monday, the backyard is barren and took months recover.Moral of the story - keep an eye on the goat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My sister has a small farm and in addition to cows and horses she also has rabbits. Every spring, parents show up to buy a rabbit to have at home. When the deal is done my sister takes the parents aside and tell them that if they plan or feel by the end of the summer that they want to let the rabbit loose, they can return it for free.What she does not tell is that our brother-in-law is a chef and happily makes rabbit stew of the returned rabbits. If there was ever a win-win situation, this is it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another story from a fellow hacker with a backyard goat - It actually starts in a very subtle way. Goats have different tastes and moods, and it&#39;s not like they eat everything right away unless the density of a goat per backyard m2 is too high. I started giving mine some free &#34;roaming&#34; time with the chickens every day before the sunset. It looked very innocent - first few days she ate just some weeds, nettle and some low hanging branches of pear trees. No worries, I was planning to cut those anyways. After few weeks of not paying that much attention in the evenings, bottom third of all our ~12 trees were gone, she got into salads, potatoes, zucchini, pumpkins, peppers and cucumbers, all nettle was done, and she started checking out tomatoes (which seemed that she is really really not into at first). I am building a new goat house with it&#39;s own separate &#34;backyard&#34; with weeds that she won&#39;t be able to escape. :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The study didn’t actually find anything related to cookware. Modern Teflon in the US doesn’t expose people to PFOA/PFOS like old version did due to new regulations. The chemicals could also be entering peoples body’s through drinking water or bioaccumulation in meat or plants.You should throw away nonstick cookware from before 2013, but new nonstick cookware sold in the US does not have PFOA. I believe the EU followed suite recently.Edit: After doing more research based on many comments here, I realized I was wrong. The brand Teflon replaced PFOA with GenX, a different fluorosurfactant that&#39;s probably worse than PFOA. From what I can tell, fluorosurfactants are more or less required to make PTFE and it seems quite likely that all fluorosurfactants are toxic. Personally I choose to use Teflon for eggs and stainless or cast iron for everything else. That feels like a decent trade off to me comparing years of life lost from liver cancer to time spent scraping scrambled eggs off of pans.I want to add that a lot of cool startups are working on PFAS remediation. One I know of is Cyclopure, they make a Brita filter replacement that filters out PFAS (it&#39;s very expensive at the moment, though). Probably worth it if you live near a chemical plant, airport, or US military facility (airports and military bases both use PFAS fire-extinguishing foams which they typically fail to contain)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They&#39;re finding PFAS in everything now.https://www.consumerreports.org/bottled-water/pfas-in-bottle...https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7gban/rainwater-everywhere-...https://www.dcourier.com/news/2022/aug/11/prescott-valley-sh..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There isn&#39;t a human alive today whose blood is free from PFOA and/or PFOS. The question to answer is what are the major routes by which this is happening.There is a lot of discussion in this thread about cookware. The problem is that these chemicals are now found throughout the environment and used in countless products. The stuff is found increasingly in drinking water and foods. Maybe cookware is a major contributor, but the truth is nobody knows yet.Nor does this effect appear limited to liver cancer. The paper notes:&gt; Studies examining associations of PFAS exposure with risk of other cancers, such as kidney cancer, in the general population have found similar associations to those reported here. For example, in the only existing nested case-control study examining the prospective association between PFAS levels and risk of renal cell carcinoma, PFOS levels &gt;50 μg/L were associated with more than two-fold increased risk of developing renal cell carcinoma (OR=2.51; 95% CI: 1.28-4.92), and similar associations were reported for PFOA and PFHxS [[52]]. These findings are notable due to the similarity in PFOS concentrations associated with risk of HCC in our study. ...https://www.jhep-reports.eu/article/S2589-5559(22)00122-7/fu...For its part, the paper never mentions the word &#34;cookware&#34; and is instead focused on the link between blood concentrations and cancer.Edit: Wikipedia has the following paragraph on the topic of cookware:&gt; Despite DuPont&#39;s asserting that &#34;cookware coated with DuPont Teflon non-stick coatings does not contain PFOA&#34;,[91] residual PFOA was also detected in finished PTFE products including PTFE cookware (4–75 parts per billion).[87] However, PFOA levels ranged from undetectable (&lt;1.5) to 4.3 parts per billion in a more recent study.[48] Also, non-stick cookware is heated—which should volatilize PFOA; PTFE products that are not heated, such as PTFE sealant tape, had higher (1800 parts per billion) levels detected.[92] Overall, PTFE cookware is considered an insignificant exposure pathway to PFOA.[93][94]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfluorooctanoic_acid"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The one thing that drives me crazy about Excel is that function names are localized.

I&#39;d love to talk to the person who made the decision that this was a good idea.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"If their mind is blown by named ranges, they are going to faint when learning about the nice structure a proper table (Insert -&gt; Table) gives!It&#39;s so handy typing   =SUM(tbl_Sales_Transactions[Total])

And knowing you don&#39;t have to adjust the range of the named area as long as the table is the correct length. Far nicer than SUM(F:F) or SUM(F2:F1000) which can cause performance issues and could be exceeded when pulling in new data respectively.Within the table, you can do this syntax to use items on the same row of data.    =[@[Price]*[@[Tax Rate]]"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"See this is why I get annoyed at a body evolved for caloric scarcity. We shouldn&#39;t get tired, we should get hungry! Oh, pollutants build up in the brain? Burn more energy to get rid of them!

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know which is more tiresome, 3-4 hours of focused programming and thinking, or 8 hours attending two children below 5.They are both tiring, but differently. Intensive programming is like working hard at the gym. Tiring, but content. Attending children is low intensity in attention, but constantly vigilant. And you are expected to pay that kind of attention for another maybe 4 years. Very different kind of tiring indeed, both makes you unable to focus afterwards.  So while thinking hard makes us tired, not thinking hard can also makes us tired."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe it&#39;s just me, but I find meetings to be way more mentally fatiguing than, say, coding. Even if I&#39;m just listening in.A 1.5hr meeting cooks me. After a showcase, which can go for 2 hours, I&#39;m done for the day.However what works for me isn&#39;t having a rest, or flicking through YT for some quick mental rewards. A good walk, or doing some gardening, mowing the lawns - basically anything physical - helps me regenerate. Especially being outside.That&#39;s been a big benefit of working from home. Yesterday at lunchtime I just went out back with a skillsaw and cut a whole bunch of wood for an hour (not random cutting, I need it for a project haha). Came back in feeling great!"</p>

They said, and I quote, &#34;due to RBI regulations, we can&#39;t&#34;. Naturally, I asked &#34;which regulation document? do you have a number?&#34;. The other person did not have an answer and escalated my call. They said they would get back to me and in the meantime, I read all the regulations there were. The regulations clearly stated that issuers shall give an option to close the account at any time. There was no such option in the app.I pressed again to close the account to prevent misuse and/or fraud. The person on the other end of the call asked me (beratingly) to logout and delete the app. Because it was the same as deleting the account. I argued that it is not the same thing. To which his tone was more or less like, [my words, this is how it sounded] &#34;you blithering idiot, you blasphemous imbecile, do you know how miniscule you are in the grand scheme of things.

What could I have done if things had been different?Next I start to resent how society scores us on things that can contribute to the economy, or things that look particularly cool, and things that we accomplished at a young age.And then I start to imagine the difficulties that this young inventor will have. &#34;Oh yes&#34;, I think, &#34;He&#39;ll find out soon enough what the REAL world is like.&#34;And these thoughts are not who I want to be. But I can reflect and learn something about myself from them. And I can choose to go another way.I can decide that, if a 17 year old kid with the right resources and a crazy idea can make something really cool, then I, as an adult with more experience and resources can make something at least as cool if I want to. And I&#39;m going to. It&#39;s not like my life is over because I&#39;m older than 17.And if this article is making you spiral with insecurity, I hope you make a similar decision. A decision to be inspired instead of intimidated."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few years ago we played this for a few weeks at the office over Christmas break when things were otherwise slow.  We had maybe a dozen players, and played in Survival mode which I believe is infinite with difficulty ramping up.We split into four teams, with one providing power, one providing ammo, one building defenses, and the rest just running around trying to help out where we needed it the most.There was a ton of potential.  I had to keep adjusting the difficulty as the match went on to keep us alive and then to finish us off when we were running out of time.I&#39;d love a multiplayer coop game like this but with the potential to have fifty or a hundred players.  Right now the office plays CS:GO once a week, with the settings changed to allow max players, but it still caps at thirty.  CS:GO is hard for new employees to get in to so I&#39;d love something where everyone has fun.  We also did TF2 for a while, which was better because the newbies could be medics and still feel like they were contributing, but the hard-core player base loved the challenge of CS:GO."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really like Mindustry.One place where Mindustry is clearly better than factorio is the feel of trying to build things quickly. It&#39;s very satisfying to lay something down fast. A stumble there is that the keyboard combinations are chorded but not overlap-free. So you hit like 1-3 for one thing and 3-1 for another, which means if you change your mind you can&#39;t abort a chord by starting another. Quite frustrating in the moment.Another &#34;so close to greatness&#34; problem is that the campaign doesn&#39;t allow you to trust your friends to run separate parts of the planet. You all have to be on the same map at the same time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It looks like Twitter is using SFSafariViewController for their in-app browser. This is the system-recommended way of creating an in-app browser. It prevents the embedding app (Twitter in this case) from reading website data and injecting JavaScript into the view. You can also break out of the session into Safari pretty trivially by hitting the Safari button in the lower right corner.Apps that implement a custom web browser using WKWebView (e.g. IG) are much worse and can do those nefarious things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really like the simplicity of this proposal, and how Adrian compares it to X-Frame-Options: DENY which has been in place for a decade now and has solved the problem of clickjacking and unauthorized framing for regular websites.My hunch is that having X-Frame-Options: DENY start applying to native mobile apps wouldn&#39;t be feasible because it would break too much existing stuff that didn&#39;t intend to opt-out of native embedding, but having different syntax (X-Frame-App-Options: DENY for example) would solve this need very effectively.It&#39;s interesting to note that Google have already taken steps in this direction: Google sign-in now detects if it is running in an in-app embedded browser and shows you an error telling you to use the native browser instead: https://developers.googleblog.com/2021/06/upcoming-security-..."</p>

This is framing, merely in app form. But this time, the framed website has no way to framebust.Click the safari button. It opens it in your normal browser. Better behaved apps (shout out to Apollo) will let you set a config that sends off links to safari directly.
The only apps I know of that don’t have this button are Facebook messenger and TikTok, to nobodies surprise, 2 reasonably badly behaved apps. I think Instagram still does as well, but that’s not a surprise.
You can still escape the app context via the sharing menu though, although that is somewhat more involved."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think a few more concrete use cases would help.First, a key limitation that every architect should pay attention.  Redis reaches the limits of what you can do in well-written single-threaded C.  One of those limits is that you really, really, *really* don&#39;t want to go outside of RAM.  Think about what is stored, and be sure not to waste space.  (It is surprisingly easy to leak memory.)Second, another use case.  Replication in Redis is cheap.  If your data is small and latency is a concern (eg happened to me with an adserver), then you can locate read-only Redis replicas everywhere.  The speed of querying off of your local machine is not to be underestimated.And third, it is worth spending time mastering Redis data structures.  For example suppose you have a dynamic leaderboard for an active game.  A Redis sorted set will happily let you instantly display any page of that leaderboard, live, with 10 million players and tens of thousands of updates per second.  There are a lot of features like that which will be just perfect for the right scenario."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;  it was difficult to find images where the entire llama fit within the frameI had the same trouble. In my experiment I wanted to generate a Porco Rosso style seaplane. illustration. Sadly none of the generated pictured had the whole of the airplane in them. The wingtips or the tail always got left off.I found this method to be a reliable workaround: I have downloaded the image I liked the most. Used an image editing software to extend the image in the direction I wanted it to be extended and filled the new area with a solid colour. Cropped a 1024x1024 size rectangle such that it had about 40% generated image, and 60% solid colour. Uploaded the new image and asked DALL-E to infill the solid area while leaving the previously generated area unchanged. Selected from the generated extensions the one I liked the best, downloaded it and merged it with the rest of the picture. Repeated the process as required.You need a generous amount of overlap so the network can figure out which parts is already there and how best to fit the rest. It&#39;s a good idea to look at the image segment you need to be infilled. If you as a human can&#39;t figure out what it is you are seeing, then the machine won&#39;t be able to figure it out either. It will generate something, but it will look out of context once merged.The other trick I found: I wanted to make my picture a canvas print, and thus I needed a higher resolution image. Higher even then what I can reasonably hope with the above extension trick. What I did is that I have upscaled the image (used bigjpg.com, but there might be better solutions out there.) After that I had a big image, but of course there weren&#39;t many small scale details now on it. So I have sliced it up to 1024x1024 rectangles, uploaded the rectangles to DALL-E and asked it to keep the borders intact but redraw the interior of them. This second trick worked particularly well on an area of the picture which shown a city under the airplane. It has added nice small details like windows and doors and roofs with texture without disturbing the overall composition.What I did:"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; [TikTok]&#39;s addiction-based advertising machine is probably close to the theoretical maximum of how many advertisements one can pour down somebody’s throat.Well put. It&#39;s interesting that we pivoted in my adult lifetime from:1. Myspace&#39;s emphasis on sharing things on your own webpage, essentially a hosted blog
2. Facebook&#39;s evolution from &#34;hosted blog&#34; to &#34;friend update aggregator&#34; to &#34;chat client&#34; to &#34;friend update &amp; ad aggregator&#34;
3. Instagram&#39;s callback to simple update sharing (with pictures) and a chronological ad-free news feed
4. Snap&#39;s emphemeral sharing
5. Facebook&#39;s slow agglomeration and bastardization of all of the features that made Instagram and Snap distinct.
6. TikTok&#39;s addictive advertising machine that barely includes any friend connections at all.Initially I was concerned that this would mean the death of real social media, just like the article initially suggests. But I really like the conclusion the article ultimately comes to: we basically don&#39;t have social media right now, we have advertising engines masquerading as social media. Better that Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat show their true colors and become disgusting advertising machines just like TikTok.If we&#39;re lucky, that means a federated, open, mostly-ad-and-suggestion-free open source social media experience can fill the power vacuum for intimate, interpersonal, high-latency communication over the internet. microblog seems promising, but I think even mastodon could provide the experience I&#39;m looking for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the &#34;social&#34; part of social networks just moved to group chats. All my friends share updates of their family events, kids&#39; stuff etc.. over Whatsapp and Telegram. Strangers gather over topics that interest them and want to talk about it seem to have moved to discord, slack etc.The whole &#34;broadcast yourself to the world&#34; part of social networks just moved to Tiktok, Twitter, Instagram etc.. I think."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"TikTok is winning because it is video first. The more immersive the media, the more profitable the ads. Facebook is having trouble pivoting it&#39;s products to video. Facebook is betting big that the next more-immersive medium after video will be VR. That&#39;s basically the whole story.Notice I didn&#39;t use the word &#34;algorithm&#34; or &#34;social&#34;? These takes are tired and naive, TikTok isn&#39;t addictive in any operationally useful sense of the word, people just like it and use it. You may as well write a blog post saying &#34;TV is addictive and it&#39;s dying because of commercials&#34;. It&#39;s just not an accurate conceptualization if the landscape."</p>

And the legacy providers are clearly sitting on their monopoly position in a way that makes their pathetic alternative so starkly unattractive.But isn&#39;t it also true that once his network grows above a certain customer base (and gets into the maintenance phase), he will start to see all the effects that eat into being able to do this cheaply?Namely:-- customers who don&#39;t behave as well or kindly as before-- customers who need 24 hour customer service-- maintenance that can&#39;t be done himself, and he has to employ people-- customers and vendors who sue you for breach of contract, or other simply nuisance lawsuits-- upgrading the network to the next technology requirement, or when he&#39;s unable to get 2nd-hand parts so cheaply, etc.-- or a natural disaster that unexpectedly forces replacement of (and charging for) equipment that wasn&#39;t anticipated in the original subscriber priceMaybe none of this rises to the level of making it fundamentally different or unsustainable?  But it seems to me the honeymoon phase doesn&#39;t last long, and it&#39;s got to hit some unavoidable realities soon.   At least, if you think you can replicate this, it requires finding people and neighbors who are willing to do actual work and investment/concern to make something like this possible, and not simply pay a vendor a premium to phone it in.

That sounds about right. I paid $18 per feet to have a private fiber optic line of 1000 feet installed at one of my houses (in the US), going down a very long driveway, with 3 patch panels, 2 at each end and one in the middle at a gate. That was just for my LAN, not internet access. I needed the link to hook up intercoms and security cameras. I absolutely wanted 100% reliability of the network link, so wireless solutions wouldn&#39;t have been adequate.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was super confused by this since to the best of my knowledge SFSafariViewController blocks anything like this, you, as a developer, cannot inject anything or peak into the view it creates. Then I got to the bottom and realized I was correct, but FB/Meta/IG/etc aren&#39;t using SFSafariViewController and instead using the older ways to embed a web view.Honestly I thought all other methods had been deprecated and had no idea apps could still make use of the less secure (for the user) options. Trust me, as a developer I&#39;ve wanted to reach inside a SFSafariViewController many times to make my life easier but in the end I&#39;ve just grumbled and assumed it&#39;s not possible and worked around it.I wish there was a privacy-safe way to get the best of both worlds but due to bad actors I doubt that will be possible. I need to look more into App-bound domains but I don&#39;t think even that will give me what I really wish for (a way for the page loaded in SFSafariViewController to tell my app something). Something like postMessage support for SFSafariViewController would be amazing and be safe privacy-wise I think since the contained page would need to support sending/receiving messages instead of just having code injected against their will."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Only Instagram? Every app maker who makes an in app browser can see what you do, that’s the point of embedding it. And why not? You arrive there because of a link in the container app you clicked on. They want to see what you do with the link they gave you. Otherwise only Google/Apple can see what you do with it. Someone can see what you do with the link no matter what."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a consultant, I come around a bit.I have seen many companies with very poor productivity, and in zero of those cases was it laziness of the employees. In fact they usually would have loved to be more productive. Nobody wants to spend their life being dead weight.But as companies grow they install more and more rules and regulations that end up making sure nothing ever gets done. It is not unusual to meet &#34;developers&#34; whose company calendar is 80% filled with meetings. Well no wonder they don&#39;t get anything done!Also remember that this is only half the problem. The other half is that agile makes you iterate through pseudo productivity before you actually understood the problem, accumulating cruft that you need to maintain and extend as you go on. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if of the productivity that is left, more than half gets wasted on crufty software structures and writing code before you understood the problem.And then nobody wants to throw code away that turned out to be not what we need. Wasting yet more productivity on working around bad decisions from before we knew what we are actually building."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"By the end of my employment at Google I was not working very hard.  Probably a few hours a day, mostly doing whatever I felt like doing.  My managers consistently gave me &#34;meets expectations&#34; regardless of how much I achieved or how hard I worked.  However, any time there was an emergency related to my function, I had everything required to jump in, fix serious problems, and then get out of the way during the cleanup then contributing my bit to the postmortem.  
I could tell there were very few (fewer all the time) people who truly understand google prod, and in that sense, the company seems to be OK with paying top salaries to people who can prevent the company losing lots of money, or other critical prod issues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe it’s not the employees fault, but the management who hired them… or maybe it’s the fact that it takes forever to get anything done at FAANG nowadays.Or maybe, just maybe, interviewing based on esoteric computer science problems isn’t the best way to identify high performing builders.. but a great way of identifying people who can hack a process to secure maximal reward.Look, if I can ‘crack the coding interview’, then I can certainly crack ‘how to do as little work as possible and stack paper to the ceiling while my stock vests’.I wonder when the last time was that Mark or Sundar actually wrote any code they pushed to prod."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m looking at https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/ and I still can&#39;t tell what&#39;s interesting and unique about this as compared to other options in this space.I acknowledge that this might be a PEBKAC situation, but I&#39;d love to hear thoughts from people who used Next.js, Remix, or whatever and found Astro to be a revelation.It seems like Astro&#39;s creators believe &#34;content-focused&#34; is a differentiator, but I find that confusing since content-focused sites are a popular use case for web frameworks that are also suitable for more complex apps."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used Astro recently to rebuild my personal website/portfolio, and I really enjoyed it. I&#39;m not a frontend dev and I quickly get overwhelmed by all of the choices and the breakneck speed that the web ecosystem changes at. Astro was exactly what I needed. It&#39;s optimized for spending most of your time writing content in markdown, but it gives you complete freedom to seamlessly add web code of any complexity you like. MDX is just markdown plus custom components, and Astro lets you drop in stuff from React, Vue or Angular, so you&#39;re not restricted to whatever components you can find for the single framework that you choose at the beginning of your project. Everything possible is made static. I found it to be pretty intuitive and I don&#39;t feel boxed in by it. This is how I want to make (frontend-only) websites in the future.My biggest issues using it (admittedly in the beta state) were 1) wrong line numbers printed for errors due to extensive rewriting and transpilation without source mappings and 2) no built-in image optimization (there is a third-party tool that works well enough, but for a content-first framework this doesn&#39;t seem good enough to me).[Edit]: Ah, I see in the 1.0 they have built-in image optimization :) I&#39;ll have to try that out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sometimes all the frameworks that re-invent MVC (but in a detached fashion) and tout &#34;server side rendering&#34; just feel like we&#39;ve come full circle where we&#39;re just serving a static view cache that was generated from models and data using a controller.The big difference here (as with other JavaScript-based renderers) is of course the &#34;use one tool/language for everything&#34; aspect which to me is a bit of a &#39;meh&#39;-benefit.At this point, while all the renderers get better and simpler, we&#39;re still in a situation where complexity or writing code hasn&#39;t really gone away, it just shifted around to new places. Perhaps at some point we get to the HTML + WebComponents stage again (kinda like MDX and React mixing), and classic Apache Server-Side Includes become the new hot thing again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Someone reading this may disagree with abortion. But if we can separate the controversy of the topic at hand from the fact a state government requested data from a private company for what is not universally considered a crime it could lead to a pragmatic discussion into data requests and privacy (i.e questionable practice of &#39;emergency data requests&#39; that function outside the normal process of a subpoena[1])[1]: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/hackers-gaining-power-of..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The real issue I have is that Facebook keeps an unencrypted copy of everyone&#39;s DMs stored and just waiting to be handed to the government. I understand it&#39;s how they make money, and that they&#39;ve done it forever, but man, I guess using Signal has spoiled me. It&#39;s so weird to me that most people are completely unaware or unworried that their &#34;private&#34; conversations aren&#39;t private in the slightest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This story leaves out some details: https://nypost.com/2022/08/09/nebraska-mom-and-daughter-char...&gt; When an investigator interviewed the teen, she allegedly confirmed that she had a miscarriage after midnight on April 22, and said that she and her mother placed the fetus in a bag in the back of their van, according to the court papers.&gt; Jessica and Celeste also said that Barnhill, whose relationship to the two women has not been revealed, later helped them bury the fetus on his property.&gt; Police were led to the makeshift gravesite and unearthed the corpse, which was found to show signs of “thermal injuries,” the documents stated.&gt; Barnhill reportedly confirmed to the investigators that the mother and daughter had attempted to burn the fetus before putting it in the ground.My opinion might be a bit contrarian, but I was always taught that Roe v Wade was because abortions had become so unsafe without a proper place to do them. I imagine in this case we&#39;re missing some details, because the actual abortion involved sourcing some pills that are specifically used for abortion. I don&#39;t imagine sourcing those was quick. My read on this set of circumstances is that if you put arbitrary blockers on something that someone really wants to do, it course corrects them into a very unhealthy path. In this case, the details are shocking, but not incongruent with what I have been told was the reasoning for Roe v Wade and true to other harm reduction logic.It&#39;s awful easy to argue post-facto that she could just have given birth, but I think that ignores a lot of changes and sacrifices a woman at 17-18 years old will have to endure."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32409811">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have noticed that a lot of/majority of  &#34;regular people&#34; tend to coast along on the back of others as a way of life. If &#34;smart people&#34; are perceived by friends and family as being problem solvers, many will route their problems to a &#34;smart friend&#34;, someone who seems to have their life somewhat in order or always have the answer to everything. I used to get an endless stream of requests for everything from technical help, legal/financial advice, help planning vacation, help making decisions on purchases, career advice and help fixing their &#34;failed to launch&#34; kids, really often far exceeding simply asking for an opinion, folks effectively transfer ownership of their problems to you for you to fix.Of course they may praise you for this and perhaps you get addicted to this positive feedback, but it comes at a high cost, especially as you can end up spending so much effort on &#34;friends&#34; that you neglect to solve or even recognize your own problems.I have come to realize recently that I don&#39;t actually have any friends, only dependents. Declining to take ownership of people&#39;s problems caused basically all of them to more or less cut off contact with me (maybe I get a text once a year or something), but I am so much happier now that I ever was before."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not especially smart, or happy, but, personally, I don&#39;t know how to be it, or what it feels like. I know pleasure, but being in a constant pleasurable state is not what is meant by happiness as far as I know.Slavoj Žižek (someone who does seem to be especially smart):“Happiness was never important. The problem is that we don&#39;t know what we really want. What makes us happy is not to get what we want. But to dream about it. Happiness is for opportunists. So I think that the only life of deep satisfaction is a life of eternal struggle, especially struggle with oneself. If you want to remain happy, just remain stupid. Authentic masters are never happy; happiness is a category of slaves.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many people conflate hedonistic pleasure with happiness. This is a big mistake that leads to addiction, selfishness and inevitable dissatisfaction. Even happiness as a sustainable state may be an unrealistic or unattainable goal. For me the answer to this puzzle is a finely tuned balance between self growth and contentment with perhaps a heavier emphasis on contentment. Regular and consistent periods of reflection and appreciation for what you have (no matter how small) is the recipe for promoting states of contentment. Pleasure is ephemeral, happiness comes and goes but contentment can be reliably and directly cultivated."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Most businesses, consumers, and developers universally continue to ignore the primary reason that iMessage is a closed platform, rather than an app on every platform as iTunes is:Apple is using device serial numbers for anti-spam, supported by a fully-authenticated hardware and software stack that does not allow user modification. This permits Apple to simply “console ban” any Apple device that spams on iMessage. This makes it prohibitively expensive to send spam over iMessage. They have been doing so since iMessage was launched.Android offers no such attestation that I’m aware of. Windows, on Pluton, could offer this attestation securely — and that is a key deliverable of Pluton.It’s easy, then, to predict what Apple’s first non-Apple platform will be: Microsoft Windows 12, only if secure-booted, with Pluton-signed attestation that the kernel is unmodified. And it’s easy to predict how Apple will implement anti-spam: by applying “console” bans to specific Pluton chips by their serial number.If Android wants to join the party, then Android phone builders need to implement secure boot with hardware-signed attestation of non-rooted-ness, in the style of Apple T2 + macOS or Microsoft Pluton + Secure Boot. Until then, Apple iMessage will remain single platform.(I recognize that this is extremely unpalatable to device hackers, but the same freedom to modify an OS kernel that hackers desire is also the freedom to spam all users, as we have seen repeatedly with all messaging software platforms operated without hardware-backed attestation for the past thirty years — including email, Jabber, and HN itself.)(No, I do not work at Apple.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can understand Google&#39;s frustration but they have no one to blame but themselves.Everyone is familiar with their graveyard of failed messaging applications (along with their graveyard of products generally).When I had an android phone, I tried RCS with someone else on Android. It never worked. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s improved, but as the common theme of this story goes, Google blew their chance.I also don&#39;t trust google to abide by the &#34;standard&#34; they&#39;ve created. Their track record is abysmal. I don&#39;t want to use yet another messaging service that they&#39;ve built. I don&#39;t trust it to exist in the future, receive support and updates, and for it to be maintained. If google abandons it that means the telecoms are stuck holding the bag and when we demand even more from the next iteration of messaging apps, RCS will go the way SMS has today.This is nothing more than Google reaping the results of their own failures. It&#39;s a shame they squandered the opportunity over the last 15 years to develop a cohesive messaging app strategy across their products, but its their shame and now they have to pay the price.In a last ditch effort they&#39;re trying to throw all the blame on Apple who was able to innovate and launch a successful messaging service years ago. Apple recognized that SMS could be improved, and they improved it. They didn&#39;t wait for anyone and they recognize the importance of continued support - a quality Google does not seem to foster.Google had their chance over and over again but they blew it over and over again. I don&#39;t care about the little things RCS adds, message bubbles, delivery confirmation etc. These may be nice additions but they truly don&#39;t make a large difference. If an Android phone wants to send a high quality image, video etc they can share a link. That&#39;s good enough for me.Google failed, miserably and publicly. This latest campaign is just embarrassing for them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t love RCS[0], but Apple implementing it (including the E2EE extensions) would strike a huge blow to messaging fragmentation immediately, at least in the US.Hell, Apple doesn&#39;t have to ditch iMessage; they just have to support RCS for messaging with Android users, or group messaging with mixed Android/iOS devices.I would also (grudgingly) accept an opening of the iMessage protocol so Google could implement it in the Android Messages app.  Not ideal by any measure, and I figure Apple would never do this (and I suspect Google would hypocritically not want to do this anyway), but it would at least improve things.The thing that&#39;s sad overall is that the current state of affairs is just a result of an anti-consumer corporate pissing match.  The only losers here are the users, both on iOS and Android.  And meanwhile both Apple and Google get to tout the benefits of their preferred solution as if they&#39;re both the good guys, fighting for their users.  When in reality they&#39;re merely fighting for their own market dominance.[0] Tying messaging to your carrier is just a continuation of the crappy SMS &#34;portability&#34; experience.  Sure, most RCS backend implementations are currently provided by Google, but one thing I&#39;d like to see would be the ability to select your RCS provider.  Maybe others would crop up if this were an option, and if RCS were actually popular."</p>

I don&#39;t know how to reconcile the latter when the only difference was the kid&#39;s last name, or skin color, or religion. Every good thing can be abused. Sometimes the scale of abuse calls for the abolition of the &#34;good thing&#34;. Sometimes it is better to tolerate some abuse because of the scale of good that comes from the good thing.For me, this train of thought always breaks down to reasoning that good-ol&#39;-boy-ism is good when the ol&#39;-boys are good and bad when the ol&#39;-boys are bad. But that&#39;s obviously broken when &#39;good&#39; or &#39;bad&#39; is left to the decision of the ol&#39;-boys.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, so much negativity.I think this is great advice. The key is being genuine and appreciative. Take care of your neediness in other ways. If you don&#39;t know how to listen, writing lots of notes can be just another way of monopolizing the conversation. Use the note as a way to  maintain the intimacy you already have.Ps my marriage lasted happily for 37 years until the untimely death of my beloved wife."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have had an opposite experience. Daily notes makes no difference. I was in a relationship for 2 years and have written a poem every day for 400 days straight to her. But it failed nevertheless. In fact, I was told by her that these notes put her in guilt. Weird.Gestures like these amplify whatever the relationship there is to start with.If there&#39;s a lot of love, they amplify it.If there&#39;s a lot of lack of commitment, they amplify it.They do not change lack of commitment into love magically.Sorry for being the party pooper. I understand where the OP is coming from and I truly respect that. Just wanted to add a bit of more context."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My wife and I write an annual letter to one another. They are truly magical and they are great to read back, often bringing us to tears and capturing the struggles of raising children, moving continents etc. They unleash memories when read.
We have ten years of them and they are truly amazing and I recommend it as a slightly less involved shared (two way) ritual ."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Personal vehicles will be getting both bigger and smaller.  What&#39;s different from the past is that electric motors scale much better than IC engines. Both the world&#39;s smallest vehicles (kid&#39;s toys) and the largest vehicles (huge mining trucks) are both electric.First the small.  Cities will soon start to ban all but electric vehicles in their downtown cores  (already happening in some Chinese cities).  The primary reason being electric vehicles don&#39;t emit the poisonous gases that IC vehicles do.  The next phase will be only EV&#39;s that are half the width of a normal car lane will be allowed in the downtown core.  Most vehicles in the downtown core now are single occupancy, a city can double its downtown vehicle infrastructure for free by restricting most EV vehicles to taking up just half a lane.  These vehicles will be much cheaper too, probably less than $10k.Now the big.  IC RV&#39;s are a bit of a pain but an all electric RV will be much better all around.  That&#39;s because all of the required functions will be electric and run off the huge battery.  Hot water, TVs, heat, refrigeration, very little maintenance just like a normal house, but smaller.  Tesla vehicles already have &#34;camp mode&#34; and people love it.  Image when Tesla builds an EV RV.  This will become young people&#39;s &#39;First home&#39;.  Buy it for $70k and live in it for much less than rent.  When you finish Uni, you own an asset rather than peeing your money away on rent.  Oh and for weekend trips to the lake or the ski mountain and all that, couldn&#39;t be more convenient.Remember, you read it here first.EDIT ... a few typos"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Energy? I feel like it&#39;s been talked about a lot but maybe not?Solar panels are dropping in cost at an exponential rate [0]. As of this writing, consumer &#34;new&#34; panels are $0.75/W and used are at around $0.30/W right now (I won&#39;t give a link as a Google search will do).Battery technology is also dropping at an exponential rate. I believe, with a little effort, one can purchase batteries at about $0.08/Wh.Taken together, one can purchase a 30KWh (daily) solar panel and battery storage system for about $4,200 (not including labor and extra hardware/electronics), which puts the return on investment (ROI) at about 3.5 years if we consider the average house spends around $1200 (in the USA).Dropping costs will quickly put that in the 2 year ROI range which, in my opinion, is the inflection point where it effectively becomes too good to pass up for the average consumer.The dropping price of energy comes with all sorts of side effects, like a potentially decentralized energy grid, use cases for excess energy (eg bitcoin mining, carbon capture, hydrogen production, etc.), novel power storage systems etc., which is maybe the &#34;novel&#34; part that I haven&#39;t heard too much talk about.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swanson%27s_law"</p>

The home security implications are amazing, and things like automatic fall detection for the elderly would be a literal lifesaver.  Small business could gain great insight into customer behavior.On the other hand, it&#39;s just creepy.  How do you prevent the next apartment over from spying through your walls?  Is the hotel wifi going to recognize and catalog physical activity between two people?Anyway, Plume already makes a home security system that utilizes the tech.https://support.plume.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043364893"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So, the RPC-4000 version of blackjack seems lost, but the LGP-30 version exists (and can be run on simh). I&#39;ve disassembled and partly annotated it, and found that it too has a sort of cheat switch.The LGP-30 has no source of randomness to use as a seed. From loading the program, if the player plays optimally, the games will all be the same. Over the first few dozen games, the player ends up in the hole (IIRC, noticeably more than the long-run house edge).The LGP-30 has one conditional branch instruction, that tests the sign bit of the accumulator. But if the sign bit on the instruction is set, and the TRANSFER CONTROL switch on the front panel is set, then the branch is always taken. This appears once in the program. On startup, if the switch is set, it marks two of the aces as already dealt. This perturbs the sequence enough so that, over the first few dozen games, the player has the advantage."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The commenters saying be reasonable, they were sanctioned, GitHub had to do this, should look into the last time code was made illegal or similar turmoil and what the developer community did in response…It was not accepting sanctions or govt failures to understand code as “well that’s that.”- Phil Zimmerman (PGP) was under  criminal investigation for arms exports by releasing the code for consumer encryption. The case escalated and was eventually dropped, included POTUS attention.- Aaron Swartz passed away via suicide in 2013 under threat of 35 years in prison and a lot else  for downloading from JSTOR programmatically- Clifford Stole spent several years being ignored by every govt agency under the Sun, except for CIA, for finding, attributing and then exposing a widespread KGB hack of govt systems in the 80s- L0pht testified in front of congress to expose significant  internet security risks that were otherwise ignored.I’m not saying Tornado Cash and related devs were doing a purely moral action. But the automatic siding with the heavy hand of govt sanctions on code the govt doesn’t really understand is pretty shameful for a nuanced technical audience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People on Twitter are either wilfully dumb or simply ignorant.GitHub had to do this. It was required of them by law. Tornado was sanctioned.&gt; These prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any blocked person and the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.This is, unambiguously, directed toward entities such as GitHub providing them service.I&#39;m not a fan of GH these days but they did the only thing they could do in this situation. You can be upset about it, but you can&#39;t be upset at GitHub about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honest question: was GitHub legally obligated to delete the accounts of anyone who had contributed to the repos?I get that contributing to the repos would be a violation of the sanctions, but it&#39;s not clear to me when the project was sanctioned and whether all the contributors were aware that they were contributing to a sanctioned project. Would it have been enough for GitHub just to remove the projects?I ask as someone who has a lot of developer friends from Cuba who run into problems with accounts on platforms being deleted all the time. IIRC there was an episode awhile ago when accounts were being deleted simply for logging in from Cuba.It seems like the legal obligation would be to block logins from Cuba (and/or Cuban people), but deletion of accounts seems more like a CYA move than a strict obligation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, i almost forgot about Firebug.From my point of view it was really a game changer. The first time debugging and understanding web-applications became accessible. Probably all browser dev tools were inspired by this tool"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An interesting convention that ~started with Firebug was the use of angle brackets in the DOM/Elements view. (eg a DIV element is shown as `&lt;div&gt;`). HTML, as a text format, uses angle brackets to denote tags. But DOM is an in-memory object model; it doesn&#39;t have tags, but elements, and those have nothing do with angle brackets (other than getting el.innerHTML will serialize back).From a usability POV, it&#39;s entirely defendable: make the DOM visually look like the HTML you authored. But Firebug and our current browser devtools only add them for aesthetics and familiarity.It rarely causes problems, but it&#39;ll explain why you&#39;ll see `&lt;tbody&gt;` in DevTools even if your HTML doesn&#39;t have it.  Still, I think dropping the HTML-y representation of DOM elements could be a win — removing end tags in particular would improve the information density.Bonus: A Firebug Cheatsheet I made in 2007, 4 years before I was working on Chrome DevTools: https://imgur.com/I2KbZWm"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Firebug was some truly excellent work - but I think it&#39;s worth also mentionining its precursor Venkman - which in turn built upon the js/jsd low-level debugging APIs inside the mozilla suite.https://www-archive.mozilla.org/projects/venkman/edit: there&#39;s a nice write-up of how firebug got started here https://flailingmonkey.com/the-history-of-firebug"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Source: I work in the field.This is a current limitation, and an artifact of the data+method but not something that should be relied upon.If we do some adversary modelling, we can find two ways to work around this:1) actively generate and search for such data; perhaps expensive for small actors but not well equipped malicious ones.2) wait for deep learning to catch up, e.g. by extending NERFs (neural radiance fields) to faces; matter of time.Now, if your company/government is on the bleeding edge of ML-based deception, they can have such policy, and they will update it 12-18-24 months (or whenever (1) or (2) materialises). However, I don&#39;t know one organisation that doesn&#39;t have some outdated security guideline that they cling to, e.g. old school password rules and rotations.Will &#34;turning sideways to spot a deepfake&#34; be a valid test in 5 years? Prolly no, so don&#39;t base your secops around this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Slightly more robust method...Ask the caller to move out of the frame and then back in again.You will see a noticable &#39;step&#39; as the face that is partially in the frame suddenly gets detected as a face and the deepfake is applied.The only way around this is to crop the input video quite heavily - by at least one face diameter, which is a lot if the user is near the camera."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a constant cat-and-mouse game. When I worked in this space (2019-2021), the best defense against deep fakes was looking at the microfacial behavior/kinematics of the &#34;puppetmaster&#34; and comparing against known standards of the deepfake subject. Works even if the fake is pixel-perfect (since it looks at the facial &#34;wireframe&#34; rather than the image itself). The obvious downside is you need sample data of the subject (and usually tons of it). I wonder if that general approach can be optimized. E.g. Deep fakes tend to struggle with certain fine movement/detail, if you had a reflection of the subject, the algorithm would have to not just replicate the main face and the mirror, but also be completely optically consistent.Was a fun project, but the cat-and-mouse feeling was inescapable. 
For those curious, look up the DARPA MediFor project. Siwei Lyu (in the article) did a bunch of work in this space. Also see Hany Farid and Shruti Agarwal. They&#39;ve worked specifically with deep fake detection.https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14491"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Jonathan Haidt speaks about something similar in The Happiness Hypothesis. Epiphanies can only take you so far, before their novelty wears off and they lose the power to change your behaviour. This is why self-help book readers tend to keep reading self-help books. 4 weeks after finishing one they need another hit of epiphanies.Even the lamest examples listed in the OP article can probably give someone a boost in productivity for a while, as long as that epiphanic rush lasts.I&#39;ve felt this in myself over the years. I&#39;d hit a low point and try to hoist myself out of it, with some sombre new ethical code for creating a work ethic; some new note taking system; or epiphany gleaned from Shakespeare or Nietzsche.You can see it in the Jordan Peterson clips that haunt my YouTube shorts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Out of the 3 &#34;Insight Porn&#34; examples linked in the article, I think the Paul Graham essay seems out of place. I know I know, this is hacker news. Yet another person sticking up for pg. But I just don&#39;t think this essay (or others) is really trying to boil some dream/goal into steps. In fact, in the &#34;How to get startup ideas&#34; referenced in this post, pg says:&#34;So if you can&#39;t predict whether there&#39;s a path out of an idea, how do you choose between ideas? The truth is disappointing but interesting: if you&#39;re the right sort of person, you have the right sort of hunches. If you&#39;re at the leading edge of a field that&#39;s changing fast, when you have a hunch that something is worth doing, you&#39;re more likely to be right.&#34;To me, he is doing the opposite of insight porn. Basically saying this might not even be for you. He doesn&#39;t even suggest that you go become an expert in something. Rather, he just throws his hands up. He tries to spare you from the disappointment of hearing this by calling it &#34;interesting&#34;. That contrasts _a lot_ with what most of the insight porn is trying to convince you of. They rarely try to disappoint you and mostly just hype/pump you up."</p>

    If you want this to work, don&#39;t touch anything. It&#39;s a steaming hot
    rats nest of crypto mess which works. It&#39;s quite performant.
    Resist the urge to refactor. :)
    Avoid +=, -=, ^= etc operators in Garble: they don&#39;t account for overflow.
    &#34;&#34;&#34;

before going into lovely detail, containing lines (e.g. in a method appropriately called Garble) such as    buffer1[15] = ((3 * (((buffer1[72] &gt;&gt; (buffer4[buffer1[190] % 21] &amp; 7)) ^ (buffer1[72] &lt;&lt; ((7 - (buffer4[buffer1[190] % 21] - 1) &amp; 7)))) - (3 * buffer4[buffer1[126] % 21]))) ^ buffer1[15]) &amp; 0xff
        print(f&#39;buffer1[15]:{hex(buffer1[15])}&#39;)

Really, really hats off to whoever worked this out. I have no idea where you&#39;d start."</p>

Right now the best I can do is to pipe an icecast stream to one which adds seconds of latency. That would allow my older S1 Sonos gear (which I spent thousands on) to have basically unlimited life."</p>

Even though I knew it’s unlikely to be as performant in JS, it never occurred to me that it would actually be slow, until I did a deep dive into low level JS optimization.Related: Matt Godbolt’s talk on emulating 6502 in JS.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Whether it’s because I was wrong, or failed to make the argument [for HTTP trailers support], I strongly suspect organizational boundaries had a substantial effect. The Area Tech Leads of Cloud also failed to convince their peers in Chrome, and as a result, trailers were ripped out [from the WHATWG fetch specification].FWIW, I personally think it&#39;s a good thing that other teams within Google don&#39;t have too much of an &#34;advantage&#34; for getting features into Chrome, compared to other web developers, however, I also think it&#39;s very unfortunate that a single Chrome engineer gets to decide not only that it shouldn&#39;t be implemented in Chromium, but that that also has the effect of it being removed from the specification. (The linked issue [1] was also opened by a Google employee.)Of course, you might reasonably argue that, without consensus among the browsers to implement a feature, having it in the spec is useless. But nevertheless, with Chromium being an open source project, I think it would be better if it had a more democratic process of deciding which features should be supported (without, of course, requiring Google specifically to implement them, but also without, ideally, giving Google the power to veto them).[1]: https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/772"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had never heard of HTTP trailers. So FYI&gt; The Trailer response header allows the sender to include additional fields at the end of chunked messages in order to supply metadata that might be dynamically generated while the message body is sent, such as a message integrity check, digital signature, or post-processing status.https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Tr..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few years ago I worked on a service that had to stream data out using protobuf messages, in a single request that could potentially transfer several gigabytes of data. At the HTTP level it was chunked, but above that I used a protobuf message that contained data plus a checksum of that data, with the last message of the stream containing no data but a checksum of the entire dataset (a flag was included to differentiate between the message types).This simple design led us to find several bugs in clients of this API (e.g. messages dropped or processed twice), and gave us a way to avoid some of the issues mentioned in this article. Even if you don&#39;t use HTTP trailers, you can still use them one layer above and benefit from similar guarantees."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is kind of stunning.  They appear to have discovered something like 30 novel (previously unknown) immune cell receptor interactions (Fig 1).  Then they built a quantitive model, looked into where these interactions are localized in the body, and lots more beside.  A truly ridiculous amount of information for a single paper. This seems to be the &#39;what&#39;s it all about&#39; paragraph in the paper:&gt; &#34;The immune system is distinctive for being a distributed system. It is not fixed to a single localized organ in the body, but rather is made up of numerous specialized cell types that must adaptably organize their intercellular connections to respond to pathogens and other threats wherever they may appear. We provide a systematic and quantitative view of the cell-surface proteins that enable immune cells to dynamically wire their interactions. The receptor interactions that we report in our network each merit further individualized study to characterize their full roles in health and disease.&#34;For those interested in computational modeling (basically they simulate immune cells circulating freely within the body and interacting based on their receptor types), here&#39;s the supplementary description link (pdf), which is enough for a whole paper on its own.https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs415..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who struggles with some vague immune system issues with more questions than answers, I was shocked at how much knowledge of the immune system is presented here. I was immediately curious about how I can apply this knowledge to help me understand my own immune issues. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t know enough about biology and chemistry to understand much of this. But I found this bit near the end encouraging, and a helpful summary of what is presented here:&gt; More broadly, the integrated approaches that we pioneered here for disentangling the immune system provide a framework for future systematic investigations ... Our analysis and the methods that we developed provide a template for future studies looking at physical cell wiring networks in detail. From these combined approaches, we may finally begin to disentangle cellular circuits in immunity and beyond, bridging from individual protein molecules to multicellular behaviour.This seems to be a comprehensive model on a level that has never been seen before, so in that sense, I&#39;m very excited about it. I just hope it doesn&#39;t take decades to trickle down into providers&#39; hands who can actually do something to help patients."</p>

I trust a handful of companies to vet their supply chain so I&#39;m confident of authentic cells like Murata VT6, etc .. but its less than ideal. I don&#39;t think my mom would be able to just find a authentic 18650, and this has to pass the mom test* Easy way to recycle these cells.

For example, engineers tune the individual per-cylinder exhaust distance - this way, the exhaust fumes from each individual cylinder align nicely once the exhaust from each cylinder merge into the final exhaust pipe. Otherwise, if, for example, the firing pattern is 1-5-..., then the air from cylinder 1 might arrive to the exhaust pipe at the same time as air from cylinder 5, given high RPMs and limited speed of sound.And the fluid dynamics of the cylinders are something that is extremely critical to modern cars, too.

Turns out the website is offering prerecorded sounds instead, not really cancelling anything. Still though, surely someone has tried my idea?

That means there are now two apps called &#34;Google Meet.&#34; Google has a help article detailing this extremely confusing situation, calling the two Meet apps &#34;Google Meet (original): The updated Meet app&#34; and &#34;Google Meet: The updated Duo app.&#34; The &#34;Google Meet (original)&#34; app will someday be put out to pasture; it&#39;s just sticking around while Google rebuilds the meeting functionality on top of Google Duo. Did everyone follow that?I&#39;m in stitches; dying of laughter over here. Folding together apps to reduce the number of chat apps if probably a good thing, but renaming them to an existing name while the old app is still around? Even Microsoft had the decency to tack on &#34;for business&#34; when they were butchering Skype&#39;s branding!On a more serious note, I&#39;ll be interested to see how this affects the business side of things; will Google Workspace keep Meet, and what Meet will it be?EDIT: Reading through the linked help article, they talk about Google Workspace under the section for the new &#34;Meet&#34; nee Duo and not under the section for &#34;Google Meet (original)&#34;, so I guess they have or will transition it.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Haxe is really unusual and interesting, and I don&#39;t think it gets talked about enough.&gt; Haxe can build cross-platform applications targeting JavaScript, C++, C#, Java, JVM, Python, Lua, PHP, Flash, and allows access to each platform&#39;s native capabilities. Haxe has its own VMs (HashLink and NekoVM) but can also run in interpreted mode.Compiling from one language to another isnt particularly unusual, but compiling from one language to so many is very unusual. On first impression it sounds unserious—real compilers output machine code—it&#39;s tempting to denigrate it by calling it a transpiler. But there are a lot of advantages that come with this approach. You always have access to the full capabilities of your target platforms. From a single language you can write code that is massively portable while also targeting specific platforms with just an if statement.The &#34;real&#34; compiler authors spend months working on linkage, calling conventions, runtimes, symbol mangling, allocators, and debuginfo trying to get their native code to link properly to the objective-c frameworks on iOS—and it never feels quite right. If you instead compile to objective-c, a lot of things get easier. It&#39;s a very pragmatic approach."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The biggest problem with graphql is that you have to do a lot of non-obvious work to harden your system against DOS attacks or people that want to fly by and download your whole database. It&#39;s easy to construct a query which puts unreasonable load on your system.The more fine-grained nature of boring REST calls makes it more easy to control client impact on the system.If you want to see the kind of work you actually need to put in to make a graphql API, look at Shopify. They have rate limits based on quantity of data returned. Cursors and pagination. The schema is a huge ugly mess with extra layers that never show up in the pretty examples of GraphQL on the internet.Note that even if you use graphql for a private api to your web client, folks will reverse engineer it and use it for their own purposes. There are no private apis on the web.I&#39;m not a fan of graphql for anything that the public could see. It&#39;s somewhat akin to exposing a SQL interface; it opens up too many avenues of trouble. Keep public communication channels as dumb as possible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having worked in big tech and small startups, I think GraphQL is a brilliant way to solve an organizational problem that massive tech companies have.It&#39;s that the team maintaining the API is different from the team that needs changes to the API. Due to the scale of the organization the latter doesn&#39;t have the access or know-how to easily add fields to that API themselves, so they have to wait for the maintainers to add the work to their roadmap and get back to it in a few quarters. Relevant Krazam: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8OnoxKotPQAt a small start-up, if the GET /foo/:fooId/bar/ endpoint is missing a field baz you need, you can usually just add it yourself and move on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Whether it was the intention or not, I find GraphQL solved a fascinating problem: it let front end developers move faster by greatly decoupling their data needs from the backend developers.Backend developers describe the data model, expose it via graphql. Front end developers, often ones who never met those backend developers, can see the data model and just use it. They can change what they&#39;re querying on the fly, get more or less as they see fit.It lets everyone move faster.But as a backend developer, I actually fucking hate it, myself."</p>

The &#39;other&#39; stem, the rest of the instrumentation, keeps a fair bit of the percussion and there&#39;s bleed from the vocal melody.The backing vocals seem to have disappeared for the most part, and are only audible in the vocals stem when the lead vocal is present (like they&#39;re reverse-ducked? Been a while since I did any production, the terms have escaped me...).Not much use with complex arrangements to be honest, I was hoping to get things like the strings section separated from the rest of the arrangement.Original: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWX3El-slpYOutput: https://file.io/etpOQt57ziKe"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Old Norse word for Saturday, laugardagr, literally means &#34;washing day&#34;. This custom still survives here in countryside Eastern Europe where many people routinely go to sauna (banya) every Saturday (or Sunday like my family). Before the 20th century,  a lot of Eastern Europe (especially Russia) still lived like they lived in the middle ages: 95% of the country were serfs on feudal property living in traditional wooden houses with no modern benefits of civilization, and the bathing culture was pervasive: there were saunas (banyas) everywhere, and most villages were close to a river so water access was not a problem. Saunas were also a place where people gave birth. I find it hard to believe that Russian peasants were living the same lifestyle for centuries and only recently decided to start bathing. My family comes from Old Believers, a religous group which rejected church reforms of the 1600&#39;s and went into hiding in taiga, they preserved pretty ancient customs and their bathing culture was pretty intricate: for example, there always must be a separate towel/bucket of water for head, body, feet - this wouldn&#39;t have developed without a rich bathing culture before. Those villagers who could not afford their own sauna bathed in... ovens (inside the house). It&#39;s one of the older customs still preserved in some places. The traditional oven was pretty large and a whole person could fit in it. My mother was bathed like that when she was a child in their Old Believer village. However, I don&#39;t know if this was specific to Eastern/Northern Europe or common in Western Europe, too. I remember reading that due to overpopulation and deforestation it was harder for West Europeans to have frequent bathing every week. But here, population wasn&#39;t dense and forests were abundant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Its funny that western history distorts the history of the rest of the world.I hear western kids saying no one used to bathe in the ancient times.As an Indian, it was practically mandatory for each and every individual to take a bath at-least two times a day. Additionally the following customs were very prevalent till recent times.  1. Washing legs after coming home from outside.
  2. Washing hands, face and legs before sitting to eat food.
  3. Washing whole body after sex.
  4. Washing legs before entering others homes.
  5. Leaving footwear outside the *gate* of any home before entering it.
  6. A full bath in a river / lake / house tank *before* sunrise and once *before* sunset.

Also, body was supposed to be massaged with oil of sesame seeds (once a week), and greengram flour was rubbed on every part of the body. After sitting in the sun like this for a few minutes, the flour was scrubbed off by hand, and then a hot water bath taken.For shampoo, two traditional herbs are recommended. Kunkudukai and shikakai. Both are used as it is without any processing. Kunkudukai would be crushed and mixed with water to form a liquid and then applied on head. Amazingly, it would form a lather when rubbed on the head. I remember doing this type of head bath every sunday, until about 2005. Any shampoo was forbidden in our home. The items were dead cheap too.[Edit]Kinkudukai is also called soapnut.https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/benefits-of-soapnuts-for...The above site tends to exaggerate the benifits a bit, but it is believed that kunkudukai inhibhits dandruff and is anti-fungal and anti-bacterial.By personal experience, it tastes absolutely vomit inducing bitter and will burn your eyes to high hell if as much as a diluted drop enters it.Its a natural, safe and environmentally friendly way of taking a head bath."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"ughh I dislike when pop history takes this smarmy tone and is also not particularly accurate.&gt; In fact soap is a motherfucking medieval invention. Yes. It is. The Romans – whomst I don’t see a bunch of basics going around accusing of being filthy –  did not, in fact have soap, in contrast. They usually washed using oil. Medieval people? Oh you better believe that they had soap.Wait a minute, what about Aleppo soap? I thought the Romans knew of it and Wikipedia alleges the same in their article:&gt; Although it has been claimed that soap-making was introduced to the West from the Levant after the First Crusades, in fact, soap was known to the Romans in the first century AD and Zosimos of Panopolis described soap and soapmaking in c. 300 AD.Citation: https://www.google.com/books/edition/A_History_of_Greek_Fire...Then the OP author goes on to say:&gt; It was first introduced from the East, like most good stuff was at the time, but it took off rather quickly.This contradicts their claim that soap was a medieval invention! It wasn&#39;t a medieval invention. It was adopted technology.That&#39;s not a big deal I guess, but if you&#39;re going to make a rant about historical accuracies, what else isn&#39;t exactly accurate here? It seems the effort is put into the berating imaginary enemies rather than the writing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Super informative article, with a lot of little insights, claims, and customer blames.  Some are exceedingly fair, others are shirking responsibility on the seller&#39;s side.  Still a great read!1. &gt; If an item is in good shape or really is new and just unwanted, the packaging is almost always damaged beyond what could be considered a new item, so at best we might be able to sell it in a damaged package sale, which we do twice per year.It&#39;s generally difficult to open products without damaging the packaging.This is an intentional design with consumer packaged goods, likely for a variety of valid reasons.Doesn&#39;t seem like the customer&#39;s fault (and shouldn&#39;t be the customer&#39;s problem), as long as the customer is being honest and not pulling a fraudulent return.2. &gt; but the Pista has two little screws that you have to remove take the thing apart and when we looked, all of these returned pumps have had those screws unthreaded which you can see as deformation in the screw head, whereas a new in box pump has only had them installed.Does this suggest the manufacturer is using sub-par zinc screws instead of stainless steel?  So many products have cheap screws that basically can&#39;t be removed without stripping or deforming the head, it makes the product unserviceable and dooms it to eventually land in a landfill, prematurely.  Seems unacceptable to call a product top-notch with these kinds of components inside.Fraudulent returns are still bad, as are shoddy products falsely marketed and sold as top-notch gems.3. &gt; Folks think they’re pulling one over on Jeff Bezos but don’t understand Amazon doesn’t own that inventory, it belongs to companies and when you think you’re screwing Amazon you’re actually screwing directly with some smaller company behind the product.This is 100% on Amazon, due to marketing things as &#34;Amazon Prime&#34; and &#34;Sold and Fulfilled by Amazon&#34;.  Nasty, because the customer signals get to be ignored by Amazon as they reap the profits and offload the problem downstream onto Little Companies."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember MySpace being described as &#34;an easy personal website&#34; back in high school.Unfortunately, it&#39;s not easy to make an easy personal website today. Personal sites take so much work to design, and most feel stale because they don&#39;t have dynamic content like posts. About.me used to be great, but it didn&#39;t get maintained.I&#39;m working on a project to make personal websites as easy to set up as a social profile. No designs to pick - just a photo and profile photo. Not static - you have a mailing list and the latest post is shown on the homepage. And, people can &#34;follow&#34; with their emails.Facebook used to be pitched as &#34;the place everybody is&#34;, but that&#39;s no longer true - social networks are getting dis-aggregated. So, I expect personal sites to become a way for people to gain more control over their audiences, and to help move an audience from one platform to another (via a &#34;link in bio&#34; to their personal sites)If you&#39;re interested in trying out my project for your own site:https://postcard.page(Will trade free access for feedback!)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When social networks started taking off, in the spirit of the late 00s there was a push to create standards for distributed social networks so that personal websites could replicate a lot of what social networks did. DiSo is one that comes to mind [1].The fact was...people didn&#39;t care. It made building harder...not easier.I think it&#39;s inevitable. Over time, adoption trends towards easy UX, and open standards almost by their nature lag behind silos in their ability to optimize experience.[1] https://diso-project.org/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am using freebsd since version 8 for all my server needs (was using linux, but got repelled by its chaos which I dont care about on my laptop, but it pisses me off on server).Some more points:- bhyve, developed by netapp, they ditched all old technologies support and it works faster on my i5 server than kvm on my i7 laptop. Snapshoting using ZFS is not a feature to discard either.- FIBs, absolute miracle routing tables that you can apply to whatever software, define the routes as fib 1 (lets say it is openvpn) and then use them as simply as `setfib 1 bash` to use them in all child processes- backward compatibility, this is where linux is really horrible, there was an article about compiling binary on freebsd 2 and running it on freebsd 10. Try this on linux, binaries are not compatible even on minor versions.- jails... docker? Really? Jails are 15+ years old implementation, kernel supported, that stood test of time, actually being a security feature. It runs circles around the docker in everything except how much it was adapted by community. I never understood why people rather used an inferior solution like docker.- not to mention all the chaos in linux ecosystem, in next sub-version, the commands can have completely different switches,...I will never understand on what technical merits people are using linux for servers except the support-ability of hardware. Due to the whole show that linux is getting we would prosper as a humanity by ditching the linux. Unfortunately, marketing is worth more than anything.(I do understand that people will not agree due to their preference, but try to use it.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have tried learning FreeBSD occasionally, mostly for nostalgia because I learned Unix on BSD 4.3 (or 4.4?) on MicroVaxes many years ago. But I get stuck on some very basic things:- My wifi card doesn&#39;t work. The installer recognizes it, but the driver doesn&#39;t work.- The console terminal defaults to 80x25, I don&#39;t know how to resize it.- I can&#39;t figure out how to start X Windows.- If I run it in a VM (e.g. VirtualBox), the network bridging doesn&#39;t work so my FreeBSD instance has no internet access.It&#39;s probably my fault, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s in the docs somewhere. But it probably means that I&#39;m not the target audience for FreeBSD, since I don&#39;t have the time and patience to figure out the most basic things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One application where FreeBSD especially shines is as a fileserver to Windows clients: Unlike on Linux, NFSv4 ACLs are supported natively!The NT ACLs used in Windows and SMB are much more expressive than Linux&#39;s POSIX draft ACLs. When a Windows client writes a file to a Linux Samba server, it cannot necessarily express the file&#39;s ACL as a POSIX ACL losslessly. To work around this, Samba&#39;s vfs_acl_xattr saves the &#34;real&#34; ACL as an extended attribute: https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/vfs_acl_xa...This means the ACLs set by clients won&#39;t be enforced for local users on the file server, and that you need special tools to view and edit those ACLs.In contrast, FreeBSD supports NFSv4 ACLs on ZFS, and those are a superset of NT ACLs. Samba saves the NT ACL as an NFSv4 ACL, and this can be viewed or edited using getfacl and setfacl as with any other file on the server."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This one: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19584921 And it wasn&#39;t even my post!A long time ago I found myself teaching Computer Graphics at my alma mater. Over the following years my approach to the subject evolved, and I really got the hang of it. After I stopped teaching, I took my notes, handouts and slides, and made them into a series of articles that I put on my website, where they remained in relative obscurity. Hacker News managed to find it every once in a while, and it was generally well received, but nothing came out of this. Until April 2019, when that post made the HN front page again, except this time it caught the attention of an editor in No Starch Press.Long story short, my materials are now a book, Computer Graphics from Scratch, sold by No Starch Press [0], and also available for free on my website [1].This genuinely wouldn’t have happened without your support. THANK YOU, HN community :)[0] https://nostarch.com/computer-graphics-scratch[1] http://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seven years ago, I started a blog called The Pragmatic Engineer. For three months, I wrote a post every two-three weeks. But no one really read them. So I took a short break, which break turned into a month, then another, another… and I did not have motivation to write. Barely anyone read it, after all.A few months after starting the blog, I saw a small traffic spike - maybe 30 visitors - from this site called Hacker News after a submission [1]. I never heard about HN before but it looked interesting so I started to visit it, and eventually registered to upvote stories I like.Then, another few months later - when I had not published anything for 3-4 months - as I was checking out HN, I could not believe what I saw: a months-old post of mine was on the front page titled “Move Fast Without Breaking Things”. Traffic was so high, my site could barely keep up on shared hosting with MediaTemple, my blog running Wordpress.There were 50+ comments discussing my post, versus the 2 that were on the blog itself (it had a commenting system). The comments were more insightful than I’ve ever seen for any of my blog posts. This was the HN post [2].Now, this post did not “make me money”. But it WAS a turning point where I got validation that strangers on the internet find what I wrote interesting. And it gave me a motivation to write when no one read it, knowing that just because people are not interested in what I wrote today, people might find it interesting months or years later.I kept writing my blog for years. Eventually, this blog served as the basis of The Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter which I launched a year ago, and which is my new fulltime job and one of the most popular technology newsletters with over 120,000 people reading it. More than enough people chose to pay for it to make this a a viable fulltime career on the long run.Thank you, Hacker News, for those first two submissions, all the comments, and the motivation it gave to keep writing. It was a turning point. I still remember how I could barely believe in March 2016 that so many people I never met can be interested in reading thoughts I put in writing.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10692734[2] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11374221"</p>

One of my favorite places in the world is Koh Lanta, Thailand. When traveling, I’m always on the lookout for places that give off the Koh Lanta vibe. What does that mean? Hard to say, exactly, but having tourist amenities without being touristy. Charming, slow, cheap. I don’t know exactly; if I did, it’d be easier to find. Anyway, forgetting that Google is bad at long tails, I search for what is the koh lanta of croatia? and get:This is a near impossible query for human beings, let alone for computer given the state of the AI at this point in time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; What I dream of is Google circa 2006. A time where a search engine searched what you asked for. A time before aggressive SEO. A time before social media, when the only people on the internet had a reason to be there. A time before sticky headers and full-screen modal pop-ups asking you to subscribe to a newsletter before reading the article. A time before click-bait and subscription-only websites which tease you with a paragraph before blurring out the rest of the content.Well, I built sort of exactly this: https://search.marginalia.nu/It&#39;s not great, but it sure has its moments.Should be noted, regarding Koh Lanta, that travel is one of the most aggressively SEO-spammed topics, along with pharma and online casinos. It&#39;s extremely difficult to cut through the noise and reach any sort of signal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I may believe almost all of this is overblown and silly, as like a matter of cryptographic research, but I&#39;ll say that Matt Topic and Merrick Wayne are the real deal, legit the lawyers you want working on something like this, and if they&#39;re involved, presumably some good will come out of the whole thing.Matt Topic is probably best known as the FOIA attorney who got the Laquan McDonald videos released in Chicago; I&#39;ve been peripherally involved in some work he and Merrick Wayne did for a friend, in a pretty technical case that got fierce resistance from CPD, and those two were on point. Whatever else you&#39;d say about Bernstein here, he knows how to pick a FOIA lawyer.A maybe more useful way to say the same thing is: if Matt Topic and Merrick Wayne are filing this complaint, you should probably put your money on them having NIST dead-to-rights with the FOIA process stuff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Near the end of the post – after 50 years of axe grinding – djb does eventually get to the point wrt pqcrypto. I find the below excerpt particularly damning. Why not wrap nascent pqcrypto in classical crypto? Suspect!--The general view today is that of course post-quantum cryptography should be an extra layer on top of well-established pre-quantum cryptography. As the French government cybersecurity agency (Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d&#39;information, ANSSI) put it at the end of 2021:Acknowledging the immaturity of PQC is important: ANSSI will not endorse any direct drop-in replacement of currently used algorithms in the short/medium term. However, this immaturity should not serve as an argument for postponing the first deployments. ANSSI encourages all industries to progress towards an initiation of a gradual overlap transition in order to progressively increase trust on the post-quantum algorithms and their implementations while ensuring no security regression as far as classical (pre-quantum) security is concerned. ...Given that most post-quantum algorithms involve message sizes much larger than the current pre-quantum schemes, the extra performance cost of an hybrid scheme remains low in comparison with the cost of the underlying post-quantum scheme. ANSSI believes that this is a reasonable price to pay for guaranteeing an additional pre-quantum security at least equivalent to the one provided by current pre-quantum standardized algorithms.But NSA has a different position: it says that it &#34;does not expect to approve&#34; hybrids. Publicly, NSA justifies this by- pointing to a fringe case where a careless effort to add an extra security layer damaged security, and- expressing &#34;confidence in the NIST PQC process&#34;.Does that mean the original NISTPQC process, or the current NISTPQC process in which NIST, evidently surprised by attacks, announced plans to call for new submissions?Of course, if NSA/IDA have secretly developed an attack that works for a particular type of post-quantum cryptosystem, then it makes sense that they&#39;d want people to start using that type of cryptosystem and turn off the existing pre-quantum cryptosystem."</p>

Here&#39;s the summary of the five counterclaims:* Twitter committed fraud by lying to the SEC about the mDAU numbers with the intent of inducing Musk to buy Twitter at an inflated price. No, really, this is the allegation (see paragraphs 202-206).* Count 2 is that Twitter committed [Texas fraud statute] by lying when it offered its shares. It&#39;s shotgun-pled, so I don&#39;t know which specific statements are supposed to be wrong, but I&#39;m imagining it&#39;s basically the previous count recast under a different statute.* Count 3 says that Twitter broke the contract by failing to provide information.* Count 4 says that Twitter broke the contract by instituting a hiring freeze. [not gonna fly, especially when Musk admitted that Twitter gave him warning of what it was doing and Musk didn&#39;t respond. Did I mention that Musk&#39;s answer admits far more than I would have expected?]* Count 5 is pretty please declare that Twitter lying about mDAUs is a materially adverse event that is cause to break the contract.I still can&#39;t get over the banana-pants insanity of the first count... arguing that Twitter lied about its numbers for years specifically so that someone would buy it at an inflated price?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;To the contrary, Musk forwent all due diligence—giving Twitter twenty-four hours to accept his take-it-or-leave-it offer before he would present it directly to Twitter&#39;s stockholders,&#34; Twitter wrote.Bot/spam account analysis is just trying to do PR spin. Musk has no legal standing to use any of that to back out of the merger.&gt; The five-day trial is now scheduled to begin on October 17So we will see about 2 more months of PR campaigns from Musk and Twitter about the case."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find it rather ridiculous and in bad faith that Musk is harping on the bot issue for 2 reasons.First, it wouldn&#39;t matter anyway. He signed away any and all rights to due diligence in the agreement.And secondly, it&#39;s completely impossible for any outside analysis to determine the number of active users on Twitter because most active Twitter users don&#39;t tweet or interact in anyway.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m not terribly surprised. In my experience the calls for more housing from the wealthy and business class are disingenuous; more often really a call for more apartments to be built exclusively in neighbourhoods dominated by the poor and working class and a continued ban of apartments in the low density single family home areas that the wealthy business owning class live in.Often this is called the &#34;Grand Bargain,&#34; that new housing can be allowed, but only if it is constrained to a tiny area (which becomes increasingly dense), while the bulk of single family homes are left untouched.The challenge for voters is to discern between those that are calling for more housing that are genuine YIMBYs, that want to build more housing for everyone more equitably, everywhere in all neighbourhoods, and those like Andreessen, which merely want to continue on with Grand Bargain thinking, and want to continue the status quo by which the poors live as far as possible away from him."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve served on a city Planning Commission, and I can say categorically that you never truly know who someone is until the city tries to re-zone the property around their house.Being fair to Andreessen and his family, they likely bought their house knowing that the property was zoned single-family residential, as was the entire neighborhood, and that it&#39;s relatively difficult to change land use policy. That is, until the Legislature of the State of California decided it knew better than every incorporated city, and wrote a housing density law that superseded local zoning regulations.I&#39;ve always been surprised that tech billionaires don&#39;t spend money influencing State Senate/Assembly races. Maybe that will change."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Roomba / iRobot is years behind the Chinese companies. We just got an Ecovacs X1 Omni - a mopping vacuum bot with actual rotating mop scrubbers, AI vision obstacle avoidance, LIDAR mapping, and most importantly fully automated water fill &amp; mop pad cleaning at the base station. We fill a clean water tank &amp; empty the dirty one about once a week. Floors are spotless - huge difference from static cloth mopping bots.Meanwhile, iRobot still hadn’t figured out how to make an effective stand-alone mop bot, much less an auto fill station or combined bot that actually works. Roborock and Ecovacs products launch in China 6-12 months before their US launch. By the time Roomba has a decent mop bot, the X2 or X3 will probably be out offering integration with home plumbing to avoid any manual intervention for months at a time.EDIT: commenters are asking what works offline from Roborock / Ecovacs. For the self-cleaning-mop generation like the X1 Omni:- Roborock obstacle avoidance is local, but works better with cloud.- Roborock can be controlled by a local home automation server without internet access.- Ecovacs obstacle avoidance requires cloud.- Ecovacs control requires cloud.I remembered these stats from a Youtube video that I can&#39;t find; probably in my partner&#39;s history since we watched reviews on the TV together.I picked the X1 Omni over the Roborock because it has superior mopping performance on tile floors, but I think both would be good options. It seems like Roborock is more privacy compatible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I mean not trying to start a flame war, but everyone is
praising how great roborock is but the reality is, most of  Xiaomi/Roborock technology is stolen/reversed engineered from Neato. Chinese robot vacuum would not even be close to their current capabilities if it wasn’t for the LiDAR on the XV11.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had a feeling this was gonna be about 3D Touch just from seeing the title.It was definitely one of my favorite features, and Force Touch isn&#39;t a drop-in replacement.With 3D Touch anywhere on the keyboard, you could apply pressure to start moving the caret (text cursor) around, but what was even more useful was being able to apply a little bit more pressure to start selecting text with incredible precision.With Force Touch, you can long press on the space bar till you get haptic feedback, then you can move the caret around freely. However, if you want to select text, you need to use a second finger on the keyboard after you start moving the caret around, but honestly it&#39;s an absolute mess to use; try it out, I can guarantee you won&#39;t be able to select what you were planning on.However, as much as I miss it every time I fail to accurately select text on iOS, I don&#39;t mourn its loss. Force Touch is adequate. It&#39;s just not a replacement, and seems a shame it was probably removed to reduce costs and hardware complexity, all at the cost of regression."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yeah, missing this 3D Touch.The input experience (or AI supported typing) is getting worse and worse for me on the iPhone. Especially, if your are using different languages in parallel. For me it is my mother tongue German and my most second language English and sometimes using Spanish. In an (for me) unpredictable way, there are words replaced to &#34;correct&#34; typos. But, independent of the used keyboard language, which is completely ignored for this auto-correct, it replaces it with German word, when I write English and sometimes with English words when I type German. Then this forced touch was helpful to select the letters/word to re-write it correctly to make the sentence meaningful. But now, this whole selection process is completely broken (for me). Since the removal of force touch, when I try to go to a specific spot, it selects parts of the sentence in a completely (for me) unpredictable way. Then I have no chance to un-select anymore, so I have to replace the whole. The experience is getting worse and worse.I think peak iOS was in the past."</p>

Push on the screen? Why what’s that gonna do..” people saying pushing hard on the screen is intuitive seemed to live in a different bubble of people than I interacted with.."</p>

If you&#39;re interested in the technical details currently available, check out the about page[0] on the official MoonRay site, or this presentation from SIGGRAPH 2017[1]. I&#39;m particularly excited for the HeatMap render pass, seems like a really practical way to identify what&#39;s bogging your scene down. Not to mention the gorgeous volumetric rendering this engine is capable of (see How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden Realm[2]).Really impressed that Dreamworks is making this move. They&#39;ve made some of my favorite films of all time (the Dragons franchise genuinely changed my life and is a major part of why I love filmmaking, film scores, and 3D rendering) and I&#39;m glad to see they&#39;re doing this. I can&#39;t wait to try MoonRay in Blender once a community integration exists![0]https://openmoonray.org/about[1]https://jo.dreggn.org/path-tracing-in-production/2017/Moonra...[2]https://www.awn.com/animationworld/how-moonray-became-hidden...EDIT: I&#39;ve also come across this excellent blog post written by an engineer who worked on MoonRay for 4 years: http://rendering-memo.blogspot.com/2019/And this paper recommended by erichocean in their reply below: http://www.tabellion.org/et/paper17/MoonRay.pdf"</p>

Calling one of the officials, they asked for a solution. They told them to ship everything first to the UK.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love the idea of this, and I disagree with others about the price being too high. If you&#39;re in the US/Canada/UK and planning to spend even a couple of hours per month using this to further your skills and career, then the value of your time investment will exceed your cash outlay on the subscription.That being said, I wonder whether you&#39;ve considered offering a student discount for bona fide students? You could do this via sites like Unidays or StudentBeans. You can rely on their process for verifying students, instead of just accepting anyone with an edu email address (which are sometimes available to alumni).I&#39;m sure some of the folks doing online CS degrees at WGU and Georgia Tech would be interested in this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Price point I feel is too high for specifically what it is offering.A general point I would make.In education: cost is a barrier of entry - a smaller ask might yield far more results from people in disadvantaged situations able to scrabble up ladder. A rising tide raises all ships.You are doing work creating the material and course work - I&#39;m not saying release stuff for free. but $80/mo is something to bat an eye at for a lot of people that would otherwise be interested in this.I would price it at $40-60, with maybe an intro month at $20. the $60 price point is a video game: which fits in my mind as roughly the value you seem to be offering per month. but I don&#39;t actually know how much time each course takes - thus the range from $40-60.that&#39;s just my two cents."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks very promising, I think it could be a great resource for companies that want to invest in training their developers, but don&#39;t have the resources to build a curriculum themselves.&gt; What new courses should we add?The courses you have already are good, but are quite low-level. To broaden the applicability perhaps you could also try something like &#34;build a REST API that matches this OpenAPI schema&#34; (getting persistence working properly could be an interesting challenge). Going further, I wonder if it&#39;s possible to do a course like &#34;build a web app that does X&#34; (Realworld or TODOMVC are possible values of X), using browser automation to test. This is probably very hard without manual review. (Scoped broadly enough, this could be solved with a server-rendered framework or a client-side framework.) Common engineering/craftsmanship problems here are authentication, persistence, navigation, performance tuning, perhaps log-wiring, etc.More generally, I&#39;m wondering if there is a good open-source option as a competitor / baseline comparison? As others have noted, Leetcode is one common source of study exercises, but it&#39;s quite annoying to work with as you need to submit code in the browser rather than using your IDE. I&#39;d love to see a repo with exhaustive test cases for the things you&#39;re building; for example low-level algorithmic exercises like &#34;exhaustive tests for binary search tree&#34; or higher-level &#34;build a git client&#34; like CodeCrafters offers. Being able to step-debug through failing test cases is always going to be more realistic training than the Leetcode workflow."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s annoying for sure. I deal with abuse at a large scale.I&#39;d recommend:- Rate-limit everything, absolutely everything. Set sane limits.- Rate-limit POST requests harder. Preferably dynamically based on geoip.- Rate-limit login and comment POST requests even harder. Ban IPs that exceed the amount.- Require TLS. Drop TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1. Bots certainly break.- Require SNI. Do not reply without SNI (nginx has 444 return code for that). Ban IP&#39;s on first hit that connect without. There&#39;s no legitimate use and you&#39;ll also disappear from places like Shodan.- If you can, require HTTP/2.0. Bots break.- Ban IP&#39;s listed on StopForumSpam, ban destination e-mail addresses listed there. If possible also contribute back to SFS and AbuseIPDB.- Collect JA3 hashes, figure out malicious ones, ban IPs that use those hashes. This blocks a lot of shit trivially because targeting tools instead of behaviour is accurate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;  They&#39;re a major part in killing off web forums, and a significant wet blanket on any sort of fun internet creativity or experimentation.&gt; The only ones that can survive the robot apocalypse is large web services. Your reddits, and facebooks, and twitters, and SaaS-comment fields, and discords. They have the economies of scale to develop viable countermeasures, to hire teams of people to work on the problem full time and maybe at least keep up with the ever evolving bots.This is not true at all.  There are web forums that are not &#34;web-scale&#34; and don&#39;t spend all day fighting bot spam.  The solution is real simple: it costs 10 bux to register an account, if you&#39;re a nuisance your account is banned and you pay 10bux to get back on.Even the sites that don&#39;t require payment for explicit registration - often succeed by gating functionality or content behind paywalls.  Requiring a &#34;premium membership&#34; to post in the classifieds forum is an extremely extremely common thing on small interest-based web-boards (photrio, pentaxforums, homebrewtalk, etc).  That income supports the site and supports the anti-bot efforts as a whole.  The customer isn&#39;t advertisers - it&#39;s the community itself, and you&#39;re providing the service of high-quality content and access to people with similar interests.You need to bootstrap a community first, of course, but it doesn&#39;t need to be a large community, just a high-value one.The twitters and facebooks of the world just don&#39;t like that solution because they value growth above all other considerations.  They&#39;d rather be kings of a billion user website with 200 million bots than a 1k-100k user forum with 100% organic membership and content.  And they value engagement over content quality, which is the entire reason comment-tree/vote-based systems have been pushed heavily over web-1.0 threaded forum discussions as well.This botpocalypse is the inevitable outcome of the systems that social-media giants have created, not inherent outcomes of the internet as a whole."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really glad to see someone finally talking about this.Does anyone know what&#39;s going on with that &#34;Duke de Montosier&#34; spam botnet? It accounts for more than half of the botspam attacks on my sites, and I can&#39;t find anyone talking about it online anywhere, except one tweet dating back to mid-2021. It&#39;s identifiable by several short phrases that it posts:Duke de Montosierfor Countess Louise of SavoyTestaru. Best knownAnd cryptic short posts that can assemble into creepy sequences:Europe, and in Ancient RussiaCentury to a kind of destruction:Western Europe also formedand was erased, and on cleanedonly a few survivednumber of surviving European55 thousand Greek, 30 thousand ArmenianMany of the IPs involved seemed to be in Russia, China and Hong Kong, though they&#39;re coming from all over (eg European &amp; US VPNs, Tor exit nodes). From tracking the IPs on AbuseIPDB, the weird spam posts seem to be just one layer, while behind the scenes it also attempts SMTP Auth and IMAP attacks on the server.I&#39;m eager to know more if anyone knows, and especially if anyone is trying to shut this thing down. But I can&#39;t find anyone even talking about it. (Maybe there&#39;s a reason for that?)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sorry for your loss and everyone else who is sharing.About 10 years ago, my mom came down with cancer and was in hospice care for some time. I had the opportunity to sit with her and hold hands and talk. She was a person of faith, I am not. She asked me to light the yahrzeit for her which I of course agreed to do, and did, although I had to consult the internet to figure out how.She asked me if I would reconsider my rejection of faith, I had to be honest with her and said that I was sorry that I could not do that. She said if she got up there, into heaven, and could get me a message, would I change my mind. I said sure Ma. We came up with a goofy pass phrase, that only her and I knew, and pinky swore never to tell anyone. No, I have not received the message, but I do the candle. It is coming up on the 10th the web site says."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sorry for your loss.The thing I noticed is that I have my own life - my grandparents passed some stories to me as well as my parents and they are part of my life. I have photos from like 1900&#39;s passed to me as family heirloom.But I came to realization that I am unable to understand even 15% of any other persons life. Even my SO life will be maybe tops 40% that I can grasp or share as we spend really a lot of time together.Maybe that is me but I feel that we are really isolated and our communications with words is really limited. Even being together in the same moment - each person feels/reacts a bit different.I paint it as tragic in a sense but it is also beautiful that we really are unique snowflakes in the end.So in the end I don&#39;t feel like it is even important for me to make some kind of interview - important part is to remember that they were alive and their life was their own and only their own as I cannot touch it I cannot grasp it - hence all life being special and to be celebrated, because there is not going to be second one that is identical with its struggles and with its dreams."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminded me of a project from long ago. When I was growing up, I was not particularly good about expressing gratitude to my family. I recognized this in myself and in college and wanted to make up for lost time.I went around and interviewed my extended family and some of my mom&#39;s friends over the course of about 6 months. I asked each person for any fun or touching stories they had. There were a lot. I edited down many hours of footage into a 45 minute video that basically said, &#34;thanks for the last 22 years&#34;.Days before I moved across country to start my job after graduation, I got the family together and had a viewing party. Unbeknownst to my mom this wasn&#39;t a going away party for me, it was an appreciation party for her. It was a wonderful moment.Two people who I interviewed as part of this project have since passed away. So I dug up and digitized all of the unedited footage so that I can easily pull it up on my computer. There are some wonderful memories from my grandma and my father at a happier/healthier time in their lives. In their final years they were not really able to speak at all, so this footage really captures them at their relative best. It has been a helpful way for me and my family to deal with grief.OP: Thank you for sharing your story. Sorry for your loss."</p>

Where you go through a bunch of hoops and captchas, only to have some step fail or reach a dead end. They really seem like they&#39;re just set up to intentionally waste people&#39;s time.For example, Steam has a system where if you enter too many invalid passwords, it will present you with a captcha which you can never actually solve. It&#39;s a lot more annoying than just saying &#34;you have been locked out of trying to log in for X hours&#34;.But this, this is fine.

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32333565">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a theory - tree based models require minimal feature engineering. They are capable of handling categorical data in principled ways, they can handle the most skewed/multimodal/heteroskedastic continuous numeric data just as easily as a 0-1 scaled normal distribution, and they are easy to regularize compared to a DL model (which could have untold millions of possible parameter combinations, let alone getting the thing to train to a global optimum).I think if you spent months getting your data and model structure to a good place, you could certainly get a DL model to out-perform a gradient boosted tree. But why do that, when the GBT will be done today?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Results show that tree-based models remain state-of-the-art on medium-sized data (∼10K samples) even without accounting for their superior speed.Is that really &#34;medium&#34;? That seems very small to me. MNIST has 60,000 samples and ImageNet has millions.I think the title overstates the findings. I&#39;d be interested to hear how these methods compare on much larger datasets. Is there a threshold at which deep learning outperforms tree-based models?Edit: They touch on this in the appendix:&gt; A.2.2 Large-sized datasets&gt; We extend our benchmark to large-scale datasets: in Figures 9, 10, 11 and 12, we compare the results
of our models on the same set of datasets, in large-size (train set truncated to 50,000 samples) and
medium-size (train set truncated to 10,000 samples) settings.&gt; We only keep datasets with more than 50,000 samples and restrict the train set size to 50,000 samples
(vs 10,000 samples for the medium-sized benchmark). Unfortunately, this excludes a lot of datasets,
which makes the comparison less clear. However, it seems that, in most cases, increasing the train set
size reduces the gap between neural networks and tree-based models. We leave a rigorous study of
this trend to future work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s baffling to me how little research attention there has been to improving tree-based methods, considering their effectiveness.For example, LightGBM and XGBoost allow some regularization terms, but the variance/bias is still mostly controlled by globally setting the max depth and max node count (and then parameter searching to find good settings).Surely there must be more powerful and sophisticated ways of deciding when to stop building each tree than counting the number of nodes?  If this was neural nets there would be a hundred competing papers proposing different methods and arguing over their strengths and weaknesses.I&#39;m not sure whether the problem is that neural nets are just fundamentally more sexy, or that in order to make SOTA improvements in GBMs you need to dive into some gnarly C++.  Probably both."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Re: the age of &#34;That&#39;s what she said&#34;:I thumbed through The Frogs (Aristophanes) at a used book store once.  This play was written circa 400 BC.  In the prologue, one character is offering to entertain the audience with a few jokes, and another character says, &#34;Yes, but not &#39;That&#39;s what she said.&#39;&#34;  The joke was too over-used.I was astounded to think that the joke was that old!  But it&#39;s actually not.  The old jokes of ancient Athenians were a little too obscure, I guess, so the translator picked a modern example.  Still, that translation of The Frogs is from the 1950s, so the joke was old at least that far back.  (Here is the translation: https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.65406/2015.6540...)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These remind me of a category of &#34;joke&#34; that some of my middle-school peers and I engaged in: the non-joke. The only one I can remember went something like: a man walks into a bakery and asks for two baguettes. The baker looks at him, thinks for a moment and says &#34;It&#39;s OK, you can leave your bike outside&#34;.Looking back, I think this idea was somehow rooted in the idea that jokes have delivery and that if you use that delivery (rythmn, emphasis, body language) maybe you could say anything and be funny. There was also the peer effect - if you had an audience &#34;plant&#34; in the school yard that would start the laughter, sometimes it would catch even for these non-jokes.Decades later, the idea I described above seems both obviously false, but also true, in the sense that a lot of modern stand up is based on &#34;say anything the right way and people laugh&#34;. However, &#34;the right way&#34; for standup is very different than the &#34;telling a joke&#34; structure.On the other hand, it does feel to me at this point that this is the crux of the contemporary poetry slam: read an arbitrary text in the right way, and while it may not win any prizes, it will feel like poetry, because that&#39;s what make it poetry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m surprised noone has brought up what I recall being told was the oldest known joke. Not sure about the specifics, but IIRC it’s from a mesopotamian cuneiform tablet and goes something like “Name something that never happened — A wife has never farted in her husband’s lap”. Supposedly a reference to the common knowledge at the time that everyone involved (or maybe just the wife) would vehemently deny it if it did happen, or perhaps awkwardly pretend it didn’t happen, knowing well that everyone noticed and politely joins in the pretense.I don’t like it when people act as if these were objectively bad jokes. Many jokes are very dependent on a specific cultural moment as well as carefully crafted wording. Lots of current jokes fall can flat if you slightly change the phrasing, even if they aren’t word play. And then there’s delivery, pacing, knowing your audience…Surely widespread literacy and technology allow modern people to develop comparably sophisticated tastes just by the sheer wealth of entertainment we consume, but people 5000 years ago were still people and I’m sure they found humour in similar places as we do.edit: here’s a source: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-joke-odd-idUSKUA147851200... Again, I would take issue with the reduction to “toilet humour”. Clearly the comedy of manners aspect plays the larger role, even if farts are somehow eternally funny."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I know I&#39;m going to get downvoted for this, but the answer to your question depends on your analysis of the problem.If you&#39;re an ecomodernist, who believes we can stop and reverse the transgression of planetary boundaries (climate change, biodiversity loss, chemical pollution, ocean acidification, etc.) without any meaningful system changes, the sibling comment tips might help.If you are, like me, unconvinced by the ecomodernist argument – and have a grasp on all of the different ways the environment is being destroyed (not just &#34;climate&#34;), know Jevons paradox and rebound effects, are up to speed with the empirical knowledge of decoupling rates of both energy and material flows compared to &#34;safe&#34; limits – then &#34;working for climate&#34; almost exclusively means working to bring about a big political change.Unfortunately that limits quite a bit the income potential of the work, but for me that&#39;s what &#34;working for climate&#34; means."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wrote this summary of what emissions sources matter if you want to move the needle, and how reputable sources argue for resolving them: https://climate.davis-hansson.com/p/big-picture-2020/I used that as a basis to look for roles that - I imagined - actually would help make a dent. In the end, I took a job in the smart electric grid space, writing code to help the EU grid take on more cheap renewable generators at Tibber.There’s a lot of software in many of these spaces! Decarbonising the grid, electrifying transport, building heat and industry, reducing agricultural emissions and so on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was a variant of the question that I had when I left Stripe in 2019. After hearing someone say “We are the first generation to feel the impact of climate change and the last generation that can do something about it.”, I became fixated on the question of what can I, with my software skillset, do to have a meaningful impact on climate?.  The answer (in hindsight), is a ton.My particular approach was to start a company (Watershed[0]), but today there are lots of great options as a software engineer. There are already plenty of great examples in the thread of places to look for companies (MyClimateJourney community, climate job boards, etc). I think the most important thing is not to feel like you need to learn a ton before jumping into the fray. Most engineers that joined us had zero climate experience beforehand. All you need is to be curious, be an effective engineer and you can learn what you need on the job.My email is in my profile if you want to chat![0] We’re hiring (https://watershed.com/jobs)
 and engineering is absolutely our rate limiter in helping companies decarbonize. We’ve built a climate platform that’s powering the climate programs of some of the world’s leading companies (Block, Shopify, Doordash as a few examples). Our goal is to be responsible for reducing the world’s yearly carbon emissions by 500 megatonnes of carbon by 2030 (1% of global emissions)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I once took a critical thinking course and bought the textbook 2nd hand from the college bookstore.  A week or two in, I noticed half of a sentence written in the margin.  As the professor started teaching the topic from that page, he rhetorically asked a question, did not get an answer, and then answered himself with the sentence from the book.  I filliped ahead and found that the entire book was annotated with all of his answers, anecdotes, and various other helpful notes.  There was even a table that accurately listed his wardrobe choices!  The notes were in several different handwritings, and the book had been resold over a dozen times, so that professor must have been teaching the same class the exact same way for a decade or more.  I quickly became a star pupil as I always had an answer ready.  I added a few notes along the way and then sold it back to the bookstore at the end of the year.  I really wanted to keep it for posterity, but It just seemed wrong to take it out of circulation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my middle school German textbook, I found the following note (translation my own):Hi Katie, we should meet up over tea over these images. The first image should be a simple sketch of two dudes playing football, tell the guys in graphics that the one they gave me is waaa too complex. The second image should be a chick playing tennis.The note went on in this manner for a couple more sentences, describing all the images on the page. Because I was a blind student who used a screen reader, I had to get the PDF version from the publishing company, which I then put in a specialized ebook reading app for the blind. I strongly suspect that the editors of that book used some PDF tricks for hiding information to post notes to each other. Whether they were alt descriptions, white fonts on white background, regions shrunk to be 1px tall by 1px wide or something else entirely, I do not know. That file was intended for printing, not digital distribution, so I guess that they decided the notes didn&#39;t need removing as long as they weren&#39;t visible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; He looked around at the faces in the crowd and said, “I’m opening the bidding at one dollar.” I about shit myself. I bid the $1 immediately to get things rolling. Well, after I bid, he looked around and said, “Once, twice, sold that man there for $1.” I just laughed… and wondered how the Hell I was going to get this pallet home and what I was going to do with all those books.&gt; When I asked the auctioneer afterwards why he’d let it go so cheaply, he said, “Did you see anyone trampling you to get in a bid?” I said no, I didn’t. His reply, with a smirk on his face, was, “Gotta’ know your audience in this job.”&gt; Well, needless to say, I got the books home and spent a few years going through them and selling some, giving some away, etc. However, that’s not the point of this story. The point was finding things in books. So, with that in mind…Dude goes to an auction and finds books. Nobody bids on the books. Dude is amazed that the auctioneer is willing to sell him something nobody wants for a low price. Dude spends years going through those books.I&#39;m happy for this guy."</p>

Or the idea that we will be successful if we are overly productive.If you watch many of the people on social media who are &#34;productivity gurus&#34;, you will notice that their philosophy of how to stay productive will shift as the content gets stale and they need something more novel to talk about with their growing audience. Many of them are just like you and me and cover the latest bestseller book or popular tweet that has merit to it, but then gets discarded after we realize it doesn&#39;t work in our lives.In turn, they also become wildly successful by providing you surface level tips on how to be a little more productive each day.While I used to be obsessed about this topic or what others call &#34;hustle culture&#34;, I think you have to go through it before you realize how finite one&#39;s life really is. The overworking, the &#34;always on&#34;-ness, the comparison to others who happened to reach success earlier than us.It all doesn&#39;t matter at the end of the day. The simplistic perspective is that you can take common occasions and make them great and you&#39;ll find success or at least a better understanding of your definition of &#34;success&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just got access to the DALL-E 2 beta, and it&#39;s a ton of fun to make pictures out of everyday occurrences as prompts.Someone else here on HN observed that everyday people don&#39;t &#34;get&#34; how huge this all is. I experimented with asking random acquaintances at a local cafe for prompts and showed them the generated pictures. All but one person was totally unimpressed.If everything feels like magic, then what&#39;s one more piece of magic?This scared me more than the implications of DALL•E 2 itself specifically. People think of the technology in the world as mysterious black boxes that do inexplicable things, and they hence no longer understand relative complexity, progress, or change.My impression is that to most people DALL•E 2 is not &#34;substantially&#34; different to, say, Google Image search. Text in... image out. What&#39;s the big deal?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve spent just over 1 week with DALL•E 2.Over the past 7 days I’ve generated ~1000 images, 150 of which were good enough to save. I only saved images which made me audibly gasp.Witnessing your own novel idea spring to life is a magical experience. DALL•E provides an artistic tool on a comparable level to digital photography, and by extension Photoshop.At this stage it’s 100% clear to me that DALL•E has heralded in a revolutionary new age of design. Every day I worked with it, I grew more confident in my outlook.It might not necessarily be an OpenAI product which truly “integrates” with humanity — but DALL•E has shown me that it’s possible… and just a matter of time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Prompt crafting is quickly becoming an art. I just found out yesterday that there&#39;s actually market places for buying and selling prompts [0]. It can really make a big difference if you can tune the image by adding the right words. Midjourney [1] even allows things such as adjusting the weight of each keyword or how &#34;literal&#34; the AI should take your prompt.[0] https://promptbase.com/[1] https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/user-manual"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I love legacy codebases.&gt; A legacy codebase means that the product is performing well. It means that I can often make immediate and impactful improvements.Wow. This person must have worked on very different legacy codebases than me.Legacy Javascript code, to me, is something that I do not want to touch with a 10 foot pole, because every little piece of it can be intertwined with and used by many other hidden places. Plus, I&#39;ve never found a legacy JS codebase that has a robust test suite, so any refactoring I do can be hard to test and verify.From a practicality perspective, I get that the best programming language is the one you can use to build your product, but I tend to long for languages like C# or even Go when I&#39;m trying to deliver a product on a team with 10+ people. Static typing really helps when you&#39;re interfacing with someone elses code, and Typescript only aids this point.Maybe if your target audience is genuinely 10 year olds learning to code, fine. But also if you&#39;re building a serious product for a company, please don&#39;t choose a &#34;Janky programming language&#34; because I really don&#39;t want to have to debug it after you left before really thinking about sanitizing user input.I feel like, in the hands of a really talented programmer, they can be super productive in PHP or Javascript or really anything.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This really speaks to my heart. I learned programming as a young kid when my uncle taught my pascal. But I just couldn&#39;t see the point of console programs and never really got into it. Eventually I picked up late 90s HTML (hello geocities!) and php was a natural next step. I still remember going to the library to borrow the book PHP and MySQL web development. It was so empowering. I could make any kind of application I wanted and see the result in my browser, GUI and all (Win32 API was way beyond me at that age). I made my own forums, ebay clone, and a few web apps for an old Korean MMO.Fast forward a few decades, and things look very different. Tons of web app backends being written in go, nodeJS/TS, and I recently learned people write them in rust+webasm. It&#39;s just crazy to me. I&#39;ve worked on FOSS projects that are massively over-complicated because of their platform/language choice, when they would&#39;ve been very straightforward php choices. But php still has this weird stigma about it despite most of the old concerns having been addressed.I do have to say, though, that front end web development is way better than before with the advent of React and co, webpack, css libraries etc. Doing all that html/js/css by hand was always painful."</p>

Their product is simply inferior in every way, except for their library of master lessons, and all these GMs exclusively streaming through Chess.com.I figure all this spending on sponsorship and GM content is why the rest of their site is so inferior to Lichess. Lichess can spend all their time perfecting the platform, and it really shows."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Chess has always had this dichotomy over free/paid services. (a bit not unlike programming tools).I love lichess.org but make no mistake: without the dedication of one talented Scala programmer willing to underpay themselves that site would not exist.Commercial sites can provide more services and offer more opportunities to chess professionals simply due to the funding model.Disclaimer: I&#39;ve played over 100k online chess games since 1992. Starting with original ICS (client was on Xwindows) before ICS/FICS split drama, then chessbase.com, then chess.com and now lichess.org. I slightly prefer lichess but play on chess.com as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really like this trend of &#34;making the terminal great again&#34;. Between rich/textual in python and lipgloss/bubble tea for golang, this turns cmd from &#34;the default ugly stuff that is easy to produce&#34; into &#34;something fun and pretty&#34;.Also note that those projects have the (not anymore) secret goal to also produce a web app from the same code base automatically.I imagine native will follow, or wasm, or something. Nevertheless, having the terminal as the smallest denominator for UI makes a lot of sense for small utilities. You won&#39;t build the next Figma with it but a lot of scripts could benefit from that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The advice to use lru_cache is good.But there is an issue if lru_cache is used on methods, like in the example given in the article:1. When lru_cache is used on a method, `self` is used as a part of cache key. That&#39;s good, because there is a single cache for all instances, and using self as a part of the key allows not to share data between instances (it&#39;d be incorrect in most cases).2. But: because `self` is a part of a key, a reference to `self` is stored in the cache.3. If there is a reference to Python object, it can&#39;t be deallocated. So, an instance can&#39;t be deallocated until the cache is deallocated (or the entry is expired) - if a lru_cache&#39;d method is called at least once.4. Cache itself is never deallocated (well, at least until the class is destroyed, probably at Python shutdown). So, instances are kept in memory, unless the cache is over the size limit, and all entries for this instance are purged.I think there is a similar problem in the source code as well, e.g. https://github.com/Textualize/textual/blob/4d94df81e44b27fff... - a DirectoryTree instance won&#39;t be deallocated if its render_tree_label method is called, at least until new cache records push out all the references to this particular instance.It may be important or not, depending on a situation, but it&#39;s good to be aware of this caveat. lru_cache is not a good fit for methods unfortunately."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of my proudest moments during the development of &#34;Linux on the Web&#34; had to be the creation of a Terminal application (try it at https://lotw.site/shell) that can render its output with near-native efficiency. My initial attempt was based on placing character images, one-by-one, onto a canvas element, but it was horribly sluggish. Then I started playing around with a &#34;Virtual Dom&#34; (React-like) approach, wherein I convert the underlying data structure into an html string, and then set the innerHTML property of a div element, for every time the screen has to be redrawn. (Source code: https://github.com/linuxontheweb/LOTW/blob/main/root/code/ap..., the relevant code is the &#34;render&#34; function starting on line 569, and the innerHTML is set on line 940).I don&#39;t know how many years its been that I started working on the Terminal application, but it was only within the past week or so that I &#34;bit the bullet&#34; and figured out how to do finger pad/mouse wheel scrolling of the output buffer (See the &#39;main.onwheel&#39; function in the source code for that little tidbit!). Since I required fine-grained control over the rendering process, I could not rely on the &#34;naive&#34; way of doing scrolling on the web (which is to simply let the browser take care of the entire process)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have worked at both startups and tech companies 40+ years old, and the conclusion I&#39;ve come to from my anecdata is that every engineer at every company is swamped all the time.Feature requests and bug reports are easy. Writing features and fixing bugs is hard. Your todo list will always grow faster than you can tackle items. Once a senior engineer retired, and I inherited about a hundred of his bugs out of the 600 or so he left behind.It&#39;s a marathon, not a sprint. Working at a consistent pace is better than burning yourself out. The work is omnipresent. It will never stop growing. It will consume all if you let it.Unless you&#39;re at an early-stage startup, let your manager deal with your giant and ever-growing todo list. Let someone more plugged-in to the business side deal with prioritizing, and focus on technical excellence. Unless you aspire to management yourself, that&#39;s already plenty to do.Anyone who tells you every engineer needs to be in touch with every business concern either only works on early-stage projects or is part of a hustle culture that I don&#39;t ascribe to. I don&#39;t have the energy for technical excellence and knowing everything about the business."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just talked about this with my wife just yesterday about her peer. If you&#39;re always the hero to take on too much work and you never keep up, you invite various significant structural problems.You&#39;re too useful to remove, you may not get attention for corrective measures because of fear of the person leaving.You are often too swamped to effectively get work done smoothly and in an expedient manner.You become a single point of failure (bus factor 1) so that when you take a vacation / hit by a bus, the company suffers significantly.A common personality trait of these types of people seem to be self reliance / control seekers. When they own that authority of work, they are less likely to accept delegation to get them out of their woes.In general, these types of employees may end up being labeled super stars, but they&#39;re also potential albatrosses that could significantly wound a company if not properly managed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been on both sides. A lot of people say people who want to be swamped is a control problem but I&#39;ve found its more delicate than that. My circumstances require me to have decent insurance so my life will forever be tied to an employer. I don&#39;t really get an &#34;escape&#34; at least until obamacare becomes cheaper than $2800/mo. for what I need in order to try out the entrepreneur life.As a result I work very hard. I end up getting a lot of work done, and thus more work on my plate. This is often manageable and I use this as a gauge of my probability of being fired for any given reason. Someone knocking on the door of a PIP likely won&#39;t be getting as much work especially if it&#39;s reasonably complicated. It&#39;s been my experience as work starts to die down to a less-than-consistent level I&#39;m usually out the door (never fired, but often laid off in this industry).However, this burned me when I became staff-level because I&#39;d get so much work that despite trying to reduce the bus factor back to &#34;manageable chaos&#34; I was unable to and ended up leaving the job for another one because I became the smart guy in the room.But overall I aim to walk the razors edge between swamped and normal at all times because it&#39;s the only form of security I have. When I am in this condition I am now useful enough I have plenty of power over my employer and my position and for an employee this is an ideal situation to have. Especially when the alternative is extremely expensive &#34;between jobs&#34; insurance, or a less than ideal insurance package from another company."</p>
