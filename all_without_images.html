								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Code is my favorite technical book of all time [1]. Charles does an amazing job of building a computer up from basic principles &#34;two young boys who want to communicate after their parents tell them to go to bed at night&#34; all the way to modern (for 1999) computers. He layers abstraction on top of abstraction all the way to a working computer. My only (slight) disappointment in the book is that he tries to cover operating systems -&gt; object oriented programming in a couple of chapters at the end. That could have been a multi-volume series in its own right.It goes really well with Elements of Computing Systems (2nd ed) [2] which I kind of think of as a &#34;lab manual&#34; where you get to build a computer from first principles.[1] https://www.amazon.com/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Softw...[2] https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-second-Pri..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This book was absolutely essential when I was first sinking my teeth into software programming. Things that seemed either arbitrary or completely mysterious suddenly made sense now that I had a contextual understanding of how computers worked. Without having that knowledge, I think my career would have been vastly more difficult and frustrating.While I understand many “get started programming” books/tutorials put an emphasis on getting coding asap, I really had to stop and learn about computers before I could start coding in a well rounded way (and that’s coming from a WebDev, who doesn’t even have to deal with low-level stuff too often!).Thank you Mr. Petzold!!!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Programming Windows&#34; exposed the simplicity behind the Windows architecture.  If you had even a smattering of C experience, Petzold could get you writing Windows applications the same day you opened his book.  He triggered an explosion of software development.There are excellent books for novice Linux programmers, but unfortunately, nothing compared to Petzold&#39;s clear and direct presentation.."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Individual states’ pay transparency laws are already applying upwards pressure on salaries across the country.My company has multiple groups in different states including Colorado, and in anticipation of needing to post salary ranges for our open positions in Colorado, my group (with no positions in Colorado) preemptively bumped up everyone’s salaries to the midpoint of their pay bands to avoid anyone becoming frustrated if they learned they were in the bottom half. Despite the preemptive adjustments, a colleague of mine became angry and quit when they found out their salary wasn’t at the very top of their position’s pay range.So pay transparency laws are having a big impact—not only in the obvious cases of candidates negotiating salaries in the states that passed the pay transparency laws, but also for average employees in other states who didn’t even need to do anything except learn how much their labor was worth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Microsoft said it would disclose salary ranges in all internal and external U.S. job postings no later than January 2023. That date is when Washington state, where Microsoft’s headquarters are located, will start requiring employers with at least 15 employees to disclose salary ranges for each position.In other news, Microsoft to comply with a new law."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s incredible in these comments that so many of you who work in the industry on the employee side are arguing against having more transparency for the employee, and for having more leverage in the negotiating process for the employer instead. I want all the advantage as an employee that I can get. Any secret withheld from me is not to my advantage."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is funny, but the OpenSSL CLI is in large part just a series of utility/driver/diagnostic programs for library functionality that isn&#39;t expected to be used on a standalone basis. It&#39;s the industry standard for generating certificates, but that&#39;s because the industry doesn&#39;t understand certificates; most people should be using nothing but certbot and mkcert.What bugs me a little is the idea that you might want a well-designed version of what the OpenSSL CLI offers. Bad idea! You want tools designed to do one thing well, not one tool that offers a thin layer of getopt() over a low-level cryptography API."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Truly great GUI design is very challenging.  I&#39;ve used very few applications which I think have a truly great UI that beats the CLI in terms of the efficiency of presenting options in orthogonal and conditional ways (orthogonal: two features which don&#39;t interact at all can usually be programmed independently and appear in distinct locations, while conditional: options that are only valid if another option is set to a specific value).The best UI I&#39;ve worked with so far is Fusion 360.  Like most 3d modelling tools it has a fairly steep learning curve, but it does a fantastic job of making your life easier.  It has a bunch of UI dialogs for parameter setting (some of which are better than others) that do a good job with both orthogonality and conditionality.  I really wanted to like blender but just about everything in it feels rotated 90 degrees to how I&#39;d do it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That isn&#39;t a praise of GUIs, it is a damnation of OpenSSLThe exact opposite of *NIX philosophy. Don&#39;t do just one thing well, be Swiss Army knife, the largest one you have ever seen, with a lot of the blades poking part way out, so you may lacerate yourself at any moment."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author is here and ought to make it all clear but if you google the title of the article you can download the paper already despite everyone being coy about it and the ACM not having published it yet.  It&#39;s kind of ridiculous it&#39;s getting this kind of press before the paper is officially published and available.   If the paper was published and security experts were allowed to analyze it before the tech press went nuts the stories would probably have a different tone.This is interesting theoretically but the amount of access required is pretty high, this is hardly an exploitable zero day.Having read the paper, in a nutshell it requires:- Login to the Mac in question- Ability to install a custom kext to make the PACMAN Gadget work.   The exploit requires access to undocumented registers on the M1 that are apparently not accessible from user space, but this is a bit unclear.- Also need an exploitable kernel buffer overflow against Mac OS (they made a custom kext with a buffer overflow)- Run the bufferflow + Pacman Gadget together to do the final elevationIf someone can find a way to do this without installing kexts then it becomes way more serious.   As is it certainly is a super interesting paper and presents a bunch of work for chip designers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve posted this before, but you can achieve the same with uBlock Origin static filters alone without having to install any additional extensions. For example:To block results from specific domains on Google or DDG:    google.*##.g:has(a[href*=&#34;thetopsites.com&#34;])
    duckduckgo.*##.results &gt; div:has(a[href*=&#34;thetopsites.com&#34;])

And it&#39;s even possible to target an element&#39;s text content with a `:has-text(/regex/)` selector:    google.*##.g:has(*:has-text(/bye topic of noninterest/i))
    duckduckgo.*##.results &gt; div:has(*:has-text(/bye topic of noninterest/i))

As a bonus, here&#39;s how to get rid of Medium&#39;s obnoxious cookie notification across all domains:    *##body &gt; div &gt; div:has(*:has-text(/To make Medium work.*Privacy Policy.*Cookie Policy/i))"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Years ago, I made a FireFox addon for myself to do exactly this but everywhere on the internet. You specify a regular express to match attribute values and/or text, and the CSS to apply to the elements containing the matches. You can specify any CSS you want but if it&#39;s something like visibility: hidden or display: none it has this effect (and is the only thing I&#39;ve actually used it for). It even worked on FireFox for Android when that supported proper addons.It&#39;s really nice to never see a link to Facebook, Twitter, etc anywhere on the internet. It&#39;s almost like they don&#39;t exist. It causes a few oddities here and there (The text matching is problematic but it&#39;s optional, the attribute value matching works really well), but I&#39;ve never missed anything important. I feel like if everyone had this power everywhere, it would serve as incentive for sites to not suck.It took some fun javascript APIs I&#39;ve never had to use before (like MutationObserver and TreeWalker) to get it to work right and efficiently, especially on sites that load content via JS (like Google).Source: https://github.com/7w0/ssure (the interesting bits are in content.js)Addon: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ssure/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Initiatives like the Dot Collector and the Performance review system that has led to a toxic workplace cultureI was curious about that &#34;Dot Collector&#34;:Dot collector was an application invented by Ray Dalio’s hedge fund and Bridgewater Associates. The application has set its foot in Coinbase since the start of the year and has been in use by the HR and IT teams of the company. The user interface of the app is quite simple and efficient. It asks the user to rate the coworker or the manager on how well they demonstrate the 10 crore Values at coinbase. The values are not only limited to things like communications, but also include values like positive energy. The information about the co-worker can be shared by either giving a thumbs up or by giving a thumbs down. There is an option of giving neutral feedback for the co-workers in the application.Sounds like hell."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve become convinced that hiring more people is generally a warning sign. A team of between a few and about twenty people seems to produce all the good stuff. Anything beyond that, your value per employee drops drastically, and your cost per employee goes up as you need to offer higher and higher salaries to stay in competition. A company going on a hiring spree is now a negative indicator for me. I think FB, Goog, etc. could lay off thousands with no adverse effects and in fact an increase in velocity, quality, and quantity of new features/products. Sometimes one person can be much more productive than a whole team. This is obviously unscientific, just a feeling I’m getting lately."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My signals processing professor apparently knew one joke, and one joke only.&#34;A LOT (Polish airline) airplane is about to land in New York City; as they align for final approach, the first officer notifies the passengers that those seated on the right can now see the Statue of Liberty. A number of passengers get up from their seats left of the aisle and lean over the people seated on the right to get a glimpse of the statue. Plane promptly crashes.Why? There were too many Poles in the right half of the plane.I&#39;ll lead myself out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this article is trying to make a political statement, &#34;Our leaders have just done something that is going to cause a future problem, a crash&#34;.I have only read the linked article, I think the followup might be available, but I&#39;m not going to read it before posting this -- because this article was meant to be clickbait, to get you hooked and possibly mis-informed.The article as it stands (incomplete) contains some classic argument fallacies.It is an &#34;appeal to authority&#34;, by attempting to explain control theory. This person knows something.The examples all result in bad things, airplanes crashing, hard drives (crashing - perhaps a stretch). Bicycle at the edge of a cliff. Eating too much ice cream. Chernobyl. This is a possible &#34;appeal to emotion&#34;.The final issue is an &#34;incomplete comparison&#34;. The graph at the bottom of the article shows housing prices -- all of the previous examples have mathematical models which can explain the behavior. For the last graph no model (the equations) is presented. Without a model you cannot  use control theory to analyze the zeros and poles.The last graph wants you to believe in a continuing upward trend, the fallacious argument, implies that whatever the Canadian political change that has been made is going to make this trend to zero, despite the intention to keep it trending upwards.Background: A long time ago, as a mathematics undergraduate, I did take a course in control theory, it was run out of the engineering department. It was somewhat awkward as quite a few mathematical terms were not-quite-the-same. I get the same unease when reading this for poles, zeros and right-half-planes. Any engineering textbooks that use j for sqrt(-1) instead of i (because that is taken) is an indicator. Yup, this could be construed as an &#34;appeal to authority&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am not sure what to take from this. The title certainly makes sense from a engineers perspective. But from a layman&#39;s? I don&#39;t know.It seems, that he tries to explain an important concept in control theory but does not explain the meaning of &#34;plane&#34; at all. Even worse: He uses airplanes as an example.Isn&#39;t it terribly confusing for non-control-theory people? If I don&#39;t know control theory, then how on earth would I know that he means a 2D-plane? And what&#39;s this &#34;minimum-phase-system&#34; he mentions once? Is a pole a number? And what about RHP poles?I would be interested in how readers without a background in control theory and higher maths understood that article and what questions arose."</p>

In session 2, start the concurrent (re)index.
In session 3, monitor pg_stat_progress_create_index for session 2 to get to a &#39;waiting for ...&#39; phase.When you detect the (re)index session arrives in a waiting phase, start a REPEATABLE READ transaction in this session, and then halt (commit or rollback doesn&#39;t matter) the transaction in session 1.

Big companies want people who are smart enough to do the work, but obedient enough to put up with all the bullshit that comes with working at a big company. What person better matches that than someone who&#39;s able and willing to study for and pass a tech version of the SAT? Every anti-leetcode article I read is some version of &#34;leetcode is bad because it measures the wrong things.&#34; No, we all know it measures those things, and those are exactly the things the measurers want to measure.You might ask, so why do startups do leetcode too? I heard startups are supposed to be, uh, innovating, developing new technology, and working on hard, meaningful problems? Shouldn&#39;t they want brilliant, super effective people, instead of smart-enough, obedient workers? Apparently not. Apparently they want the same workers bigcos want. The implication of this is left as an exercise to the reader."</p>

You may have built the next generation X, but given an array of strings and a fixed width, can you format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully justified -- in the next 30 minutes?  Maybe you should have cultivated that skillset instead, because around here we value parlor tricks more than real world accomplishments."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my team we do technical interviews in three steps:- an algorithmic challenge. It&#39;s related to what we do day to day. I work in domain names so we ask to parse a domain name. There are oddities with domain names so we check multiple things: does the candidate know what basic string manipulation functions exist? do they ask questions to get more info? how do they react when we give additional info that break the code they did so far? What we don&#39;t check: whether the code compiles or actually works. We don&#39;t care. We explicitly tell the candidate they can write pseudo code or comments defining the steps of the algorithm. We&#39;re interested in their reflection.- an architecture challenge. We ask the candidate how they would scale an API worldwide. There&#39;s no code, it&#39;s an open discussion. They can talk about whatever they want: asynchronous, statelessness, load balancing, replication, anycast, whatever. We can also guide the candidate to know whether they know some specifics concepts (for example I can ask &#34;what would you do if you have a GET REST endpoint that returns the same thing every time&#34; and expect &#34;cache its result&#34;, even with this question I get different answers (which is great), some will talk about HTTP cache headers, others will talk about Redis or in memory caching, rarely do candidates talk about both)- a refactoring challenge. We work with tons of legacy code. So we show the candidate a crappy piece of code with performance issues and no tests and ask them for what their strategy would be. No writing code here, just thinking and discussion.So yeah, just a quick screening to check if the candidate can write basic code (you&#39;d be surprised of the results), and open discussions on our day to day problems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reminds me of an incident we had with Dropbox a decade ago.  They deleted some niche accounting software (custom developed by us) from our Dropbox account, plus their own log files covering those deletions.  Then played ignorant.We learned the lesson, and never again trusted Dropbox, for anything.(Best guess - a would-be client got pissed when software which they&#39;d never paid for lacked a feature, and told Dropbox a story.)EDIT:  Only executables &amp; related distribution files were on Dropbox, not any source code.  We lost nothing...except our trust in Dropbox.EDIT2:  Yes, as several others have kinda pointed out, this incident was a collision between (a) naive human expectations (of high-skill, high-touch, highly-invested customer service for such situations) and (b) the actual business model of any huge / cheap or free / convenient cloud provider of X (plus just &#34;internet reality&#34;).

For instance, the documentation at https://forum.blackmagicdesign.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=9927... seems to give just read-only access to a lot of things at the TimelineClip level. And https://github.com/pedrolabonia/pydavinci has exactly one contributor.By contrast, Shotcut seems to be built on, and by, https://mltframework.org/ with a close correspondence between the runtime API surface and the file system representation of a file, and it&#39;s fully open-source.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a problem I want to focus my life solving. I believe that software engineering can be made so simple and clear that it can be wielded by an extremely small team of engineers. I believe that there are finite and fundamental classes of problems, that underpin the vast majority of problems, that have a distinct visual representation, and that by representing these problems visually, you let your &#34;visual coprocessor&#34; assist in seeing the solutions. I believe there are well-known strategies (taken from the real world) for managing hierarchies of complexity that ease the cognitive load of exploring any problem. We just need to get these approaches into a programming &#34;langugage&#34;!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I will tell you this.It&#39;s based on my 20+ years, 50 different teams and many hundreds, perhaps thousands of  encounters with software developers.It&#39;s almost never the domain complexity that is high.Sending a rocket to Mars is complex. And perhaps complex every time.Dealing with people that has to work together can only be simplified when agreements are made and agreements are kept. Otherwise you cannot trust and have faith in people.It comes down to far and near organization leadership, mandate and empowerment in small teams with few communication links outwards, clear expectations from whomever is asking for something and process management.Writing code is rarely hard if you know the expectations and the boundaries of the task.Empowerment gives the team the possibility to act on what they discover and encounter.Don&#39;t look into the future. Because you cannot. And you are both naive and arrogant if you believe you can. Deal with what is known now!One thing is complexity in code. Another is complexity in business. Some things are not made for software to solve.Less experienced people are generally guided by their beliefs around their own ideas. If the mind is locked onto something it&#39;s hard not to thing it&#39;s a good idea. Usually in software there is simpler approach.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I appreciated this essay.Among other things, it suggests that there are some incentives for complexity: That engineers just enjoy complexity, and that making simple designs might not be good for the respect of your peers/bosses/career: &#34;A simple design might make it seem like you’re not really doing your job.&#34;While that&#39;s true, I think the essay isn&#39;t clear enough about the fact that simplicity is just plain hard.  Complexity is sort of the &#34;natural&#34; outcome of &#34;adding things&#34;.  It takes time, effort, and skill to create software that can do what is asked for it while maintaining an internal simplicity. Even if everyone involved really wants it.  I do not think software complexity comes only, or mainlly, from people not wanting it enough (explicitly or implicity), from incentives to complexity. It&#39;s just plain hard. It&#39;s a mistake to think just wanting it harder (or having the right incentives) is sufficient.It may be the key challenge in software engineering -- how do we make software that does everything that&#39;s asked for it (powerful, complex things), while maintaining an internal simplicity? You can not accomplish it by cargo-culting any &#34;design patterns&#34; or other approaches. It&#39;s still a skilled craft. That comes from years of experience with the intent of developing this skill (years of experience alone aren&#39;t enough), looking at other people&#39;s code who are also trying to do it, and just some aptitude. And domain knowledge, if you understand the nature of the problems you are working on better, you can design simple solutions for them better--contrary to some current practices treating developers as interchangeable.Yes, you need your organization to allow you to do it (including taking the more time it will take), but that&#39;s necessary but not sufficient for the outcome."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi, creator here.This is a demo of our recent work presented at Oakland (IEEE S&amp;P): https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/368. The server and client code are written in Rust and available here: https://github.com/menonsamir/spiral-rs. The general aim of our work is to show that homomorphic encryption is practical today for real-world applications. The server we use to serve this costs $35/month!A quick overview: the client uses homomorphic encryption to encrypt the article number that they would like to retrieve. The server processes the query and produces an encrypted result containing the desired article, and sends this back to the client, who can decrypt and obtain the article. A malicious server is unable to determine which article the client retrieved. All search and autocomplete is down locally. The technical details are in the paper, but the high level summary is that the client creates a large one-hot vector of encrypted bits (0’s except for the index of the desired article, where they place a 1) and then the server computes something like a ‘homomorphic dot product’ between the query and the plaintext articles.I’d like to caveat that this is an in-browser demo to show it is practical to use homomorphic encryption at this scale. As a real product, you’d probably want to distribute a signed client executable (or Electron app) since otherwise, a malicious server could simply deliver bad client JS on the fly.Happy to answer any questions!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting! But, it&#39;d be helpful to clarify further the strength of the following claim:&gt; This demo allows private access to 6 GB (~30%) of English Wikipedia. In theory, even if the server is malicious, it will be unable to learn which articles you request. All article title searches are performed locally, and no images are available.In this demo, the number of article-titles is relatively small – a few million – &amp; enumerable.If the server is truly malicious, and it issues itself requests for every known title, does it remain true that this &#34;Private Information Retrieval&#34; (PIR) scheme still gives it no hints that subsequent requests from others for individual articles retrieve particular data?(Presumably: every request touches every byte of the same full 6GB of data, and involves every such byte in constant-run-time calculations that vary per request, and thus have the effect of returning only what each request wanted – but not at all in any way correlatable with other requests for the exact same article, from the same or different clients?)"</p>

				</div>
				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31670065">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;I agree that it is unacceptable to have eighth grade Algebra I classes and gifted education programs that disproportionately exclude Black and brown children. But if equity is the goal, we should be mandating that every eighth grader takes Algebra I—and then structure the entire pre-K to seventh grade student experience to ensure this is a legitimate possibility for every child. Since when does equity mean everyone gets nothing?I don&#39;t know whether Algebra I is above or below what eighth graders can be expected to do, but raising the difficulty of every class to what the most advanced student is capable of is not the answer either. Everybody knows someone else that is better at math than they are, and someone who is not as good. It is universal common knowledge that the ease with which one takes to math is different for different people. Why can&#39;t we just admit it and quit trying to make people who are unique the same?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The gifted program helped me immensely in highschool, although the hour or two I actually spent in the gifted classroom was mostly wasted playing board games.  However being in that program gave me the ability to switch classes/teachers whenever one wasn&#39;t working for me, usually because some teachers could maintain a civil classroom and other teachers let the students run wild and taught nothing.  Because I was in the gifted program, the school permitted me to switch out of those classrooms into classes taught by competent/caring teachers.This suggests to me that the advantage of the program could be conferred to students who score low on IQ tests but are nevertheless behaved in class.  A better gifted program would be one that differentiates on the basis of civility, not IQ.  Of course, deferring measurement of IQ to some licensed professionals is easier than objectively quantifying a student&#39;s civility, so I don&#39;t know how this would actually be implemented."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Gifted programs are extremely important and the width of American gifted programs is a virtue.  Canada has a much higher standard for gifted, and in Ontario we generally admit roughly the top 1% of students (many American programs cater to the top 10%).There a number of large benefits to gifted, not the least of which is it changes the character of a program/school.  If you are surrounded by bright students with nerdy academic interests it&#39;s suddenly acceptable to nerd out on things. This single fact may be more valuable to the development of the student than the entire program itself.  Outside of gifted, schools have substantial challenges with creating environments where academic excellence is encouraged and rewarded not only by the schools grading system but also by social behaviour of peers. While bullying has gone down, and acceptability of geeky interests have improved in the past 30 years there is still nothing close to a gifted program from encouraging and accepting academic excellence.As someone who just barely missed the gifted cutoff, my schooling was much too easy and I basically never had to study for tests or exams.  I ended up developing poor academic habits that ultimately hurt me when the difficulty got hard enough that intellectual horsepower needed to be combined with hard work. I think being challenged early and often would have changed this behaviour substantially.  Even creating an environment where I wanted to be around other students enough to participate in more extra-curriculars could have helped. I worry that we are going to create a lot of bright but unmotivated students by offering years of programs that are too easy for them. There are consequences far beyond just having these students occasionally act out out of boredom and I think it&#39;s a very bad idea to create an educational culture that suggests bright people should be lazy. This is ultimately what the removal of gifted programs do because classroom teachers generally aren&#39;t given adequate prep time or other resources to properly offer enrichment.  I&#39;ve even known some principals who encouraged their teachers to not offer enrichment as it created problems in later grades when other teachers didn&#39;t offer similar enrichment and parents expected it."</p>

The numbers from the individual voting machines and the paper ballots have to match up; we had to stay an extra 2 hours after the polls closed last time I did this (in 2020) because of an equipment screwup that kept us from doing the final certified count/reconciliation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They make it sound so simple:Bribe the Judge of Elections who oversees everything. Dilute the vote tallies by using the voting machines to increment the votes for specific candidates. Certify that the fake results are correct. Lie if anybody asks.This person did this with 2 separate judges. Why is it so easy?"</p>

If you are sold on a company name then by all means, grab the domain but don&#39;t confuse &#34;buying a domain&#34; with &#34;making actual progress&#34;.When I was younger I used to snap up domain names for every little idea I had. I executed on less than 1% of those ideas and ended up letting the domain expire 1-2 years later when I could finally admit to myself I was never going to pursue it. Literally hundreds of dollars flushed down the toilet all to get a temporary rush.I know that I have issues with thinking &#34;spending money&#34; === &#34;making progress&#34; (be it on home improvement projects or web apps) and I know I&#39;m not alone.

Detective(s), judge, police, and American Airlines (everyone involved) should be severely punished for once.

I hope this blows up in a big way and everyone is aware of what happened here, and I hope Mr Lowe gets a big payday.&gt;&gt;&gt;&#34;After Lowe had been in jail for eight days, he was taken to a local judge. He still received no information about why he was there, he said. The judge told him his only options were to waive extradition — in which New Mexico would deliver him to Texas authorities — or wait for Texas authorities to pick him up. Lowe, unsure what the legal implications were of either option, waived extradition based on the court’s suggestion that he do so.&#34;This is such a perfect application of the term &#34;kafkaesque&#34;.Also, is it weird that he was brought before a judge without having any sort of legal representation first, and that the judge was able to give Mr Lowe advice as to what to do? Imagining myself in his shoes, I wouldn&#39;t say a single word to the judge or anyone really before I had spoken with a lawyer, I don&#39;t care how long that takes.

Unlike governments, companies tend to be very sensitive to bad press, and thus much more likely to yield to legal pressure.Therefore, your most promising tactic is to use the suit against the company to build a war chest and establish official records of fact that can then be drawn upon in the longer government campaign."</p>

It&#39;s not even lightweight.Then someone mentioned that Blender can do video editing. Can you believe that blender is only around 200mb? I downloaded it, followed a quick tutorial on YouTube to figure out keyframes and how to render. 10 minutes after and I&#39;m done.It&#39;s great to see even more features to the video sequencer in this update. Will probably use again for my next video editing needs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"iPadOS 16 and still no multiuser support :-( Why can’t we use one iPad inside a family, with each user having his/her own apps, settings, bookmarks and so on? (Ok I know, Apple needs to sell an iPad to each one of us :-) )"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Stage Manager follows the same pattern as the other features Apple took too long to realize were already figured out on the Mac: make it arbitrarily different to be able to call it new. Just like the “changing cursor” for trackpad support on the iPad. But hey, I&#39;ll take it I guess.Unfortunately, in previous cases, these &#34;justification&#34; tweaks have resulted in a strictly worse experience IMO. The transforming cursor on the iPad is distracting and it can be weird how it disappears over icons (resulting in me losing track of it sometimes). The iPad Keyboard is more awkward than a real keyboard, top-heavy, and sold separately of course. I wouldn’t be surprised if the same is true of Stage Manager, although at least it&#39;s on the Mac too so hopefully if it turns out to not be that great, it won&#39;t be excused as &#34;people not getting it&#34; like all the weirdo undiscoverable gestures on the iPad.The sad reality though is that it&#39;s taken 10 years for the iPad to finally mature into... an arbitrarily different take on OS X? Same chip as the Mac. Works with a keyboard and mouse. Better for drawing but worse for external monitor support. And now basically the same window management we&#39;ve always had with the Mac. I was always (and remain, theoretically) a big believer in the opportunity the iPad presented, and think it could have gotten to the same place sooner, but bolder, with the actual aim of replacing the Mac (the same way the iPhone replaced the iPod). Where it&#39;s at now kind of proves that&#39;s always been possible... it just chose to get here meekly instead, not stepping on any toes, always making sure there was an excuse to need to buy both devices.Universal Control to me is the epitome of that mentality: a supremely technically impressive, but ultimately completely over-engineered and absolutely ridiculous &#34;solution&#34; to a problem that wouldn&#39;t exist if the Mac simply had a touch screen. You wouldn&#39;t need WiFi and communication between two computers to move your mouse from screen A to screen B if the Mac just had a touch screen. The experience of having a touch Mac that you just... plugged into an external display would be strictly better than the weird world of Universal Control, where you drag an image from Adobe Photoshop for Mac over to Adobe Photoshop for iPad, or sometimes, you drag it from Adobe Photoshop for iPad running on the Mac using Catalyst to Adobe Photoshop for iPad running &#34;natively&#34; on the iPad.I think Apple truly squandered the opportunity in the last decade to get truly get ahead on &#34;big screen&#34; (aka, non-phone-based) computing. Instead, the field still remains wide open."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;     If a machine could accomplish the task just as well as a human, or the need for the task could be designed away, that task is toil. If human judgment is essential for the task, there’s a good chance it’s not toil.21It&#39;s fun the the engineering at Google is so great at recognizing things, while the product/&#34;human&#34; teams (like whoever came up with the account reviews and other parts) seems to suck so much.If YouTube applied the same view of what should/shouldn&#39;t be automated, they could solve the problem of peoples YouTube channels being locked in front of them, even if they don&#39;t break any ToS&#39;s."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You should probably not automate all toil. You should only automate toil when the toil cost/effect is more burdensome than the cost of automating it. All automation has a cost, and may or may not create value. Automation should have a positive and timely return on investment. If the ROI is 10 years down the road, you probably shouldn&#39;t automate it (yet). If there is a cheaper way to deal with the toil, explore that avenue first.Several times in my career I worked on projects to reduce toil. Sometimes the project would fail because the time it took to work on them went well past the cost saving estimation. Sometimes they would be completed, but the value created was far less than their cost. And sometimes automation wasn&#39;t even the solution, and we just needed to change our process or system, or do some other manual thing that reduced the toil cost. Sometimes we chose to automate toil because we were afraid to take on a larger project we knew would make the toil unnecessary, so we paid for the automation and then later for rebuilding everything. Or toil was used as an excuse to justify a project that didn&#39;t really have to do with toil.One of my biggest mistakes as an engineer was assumptions I made about my work that ended up creating more waste than value. Talk to an outsider about your plans and why you&#39;re doing it, take their advice seriously. And if your automation is optional, make sure you have buy-in before you start working on it; i&#39;ve sunk months on things that nobody ended up using.A great way to automate toil is incrementally. Typically you have a runbook with step-by-step instructions, and over time you automate one step, then another, etc. The investment is minimal and gradual, it can change over time, and you can target the costliest parts of the toil, optimizing value."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most of my work for SRE was the opposite; I did things manually because the automated systems were guaranteed to mess up some fraction of things.  At some point my managers wanted me to automate a hardware management process- I checked and it would take 6 months to deploy the code to prod.  Instead, I identified all the broken machines and filed tickets manually- getting things fixed far more quickly without a high rate of false positives and churn (google&#39;s hardware repair system churns a lot).Many of the automated systems at Google were developed by geniuses.  Others, not so much, and it ended up making a lot of work for other people."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"First, I’m so glad this turned out to be hypothetical, and you didn’t have to suffer through such a catastrophic loss. Second, if you had actually suffered such a loss, your digital life would hopefully be the last thing on your mind, and you’d just be glad to have your life and your family - the only real things that matter in this world.That said, planning a strategy for offsite data storage or a secondary authenticator is of course wise. A safety deposit box or other offsite location that you can frequently refresh and keep up to date would be a good investment. If you’re worried about keeping a master key to your life in a single place, you could separate your data and your authenticator. The how likely depends on your threat model, several people on this site may find it insufficient. To whatever degree you obfuscate or complicate your recovery path, you also increase the risk of losing access to it yourself.You might also consider it’s not necessarily the “thing you have” that might go MIA, but due to physical injury, age, or just forgetfulness, the “thing you know” could also be at risk. I realize this the older I get. Finding a secure way to store a master password in the event you cannot recall it, or perhaps in the event of your death, is something you may also consider. In this case, I would avoid a cipher or something else you’re likely to forget."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Two-factor authentication terrifies me.For my bank from my country of origin that I maintain, I get a battery-powered RSA token. From that I can generate a mobile 2FA token in an app that I can use to log in for day-to-day transaction. If I lose the devices with the 2FA token, I have to pray that that CR2032 is still alive or I lose access to that account until I spend thousands of dollars on international flights (replacing the battery resets the device)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This recently happened to me after my laptop and phone were stolen on vacation.  Everything is in 1Password.  I of course didn&#39;t have the recovery paper with me.  I recently changed my iCloud password to be more secure, and luckily I remembered it.  But I needed 2FA to log in still.I had to go to an AT&amp;T store, port my phone number to a different iPhone, restore from an iCloud backup using the SMS 2FA, and then I could finally log into 1Password for my passwords and MFA.If I didn&#39;t have a memorable iCloud password this would have been impossible without the 1Password recovery paper.Devices are often lost/stolen on vacation where the myriad layers of protection are extremely hard — if not impossible — to penetrate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A lot of people saying &#34;USB-C cables aren&#39;t even compatible with each other!&#34; (Nintendo switch etc.) Guess what: that&#39;s exactly the problem this regulation is intended to solve. Fake USB-C cables like Nintendo&#39;s that have the right shape but do not adhere to spec should gradually disappear along with lightning cables. The regulation actually says that cables can no longer be bundled with the devices themselves, so Nintendo would stop sending you that fake cable with your switch, and you would just buy a real one to work with all your devices.Other people saying &#34;what about innovation!?&#34; That&#39;s fine. Let&#39;s say the USB consortium releases USB-D with input from Apple, Google, and many other stakeholders. The EU can set another deadline for newly released devices to adhere to the new version instead of the old one. The transition will involve a period of time where older devices are still on C and newer ones on D, which is totally compatible with the regulation and is necessary with or without regulation. It&#39;s ludicrous to think companies won&#39;t be able to &#34;iterate&#34;: you would be crazy to go to market with any cable technology that isn&#39;t already very mature. Apple spent years designing lighting chargers because they knew that once they were released they&#39;d be around for a long time (and they have been!)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"By the way, that&#39;s also how Tesla and all other cars have the same electric plug in EU(not the USB mandate but the car plug standardisation mandate).Of course, the first thing that comes to mind is what happens if better solutions are found. Will EU block innovation?That question is addressed in the Q&amp;A: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_...In essence, they seem to believe that wired charging is mature enough for standardisation but further technologies can be implemented through &#34;Radio Equipment Directive&#34;. In the same time, it appears that the  wireless charging is unaffected because the tech is new and fast changing, therefore the manufacturers can include whatever wireless charging they see fit.It really boils down to &#34;No funny cables, why don&#39;t you try wireless charging of your liking if USB-C doesn&#39;t cut it for you?&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s just really not clear to me that regulators need to be mandating product design.I have no expectation, for example, that these same regulators will stay on top of this and revise it when USB-C stops being the preferred or best choice.Twenty years ago, we really DID have a snarl of competing and proprietary phone ports. It was a mess -- Blackberry chargers didn&#39;t work with Palm; most WinMo devices had their own ports; etc. It was ugly.Now, pretty much everything is either USB or Lightning. This is good!

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"hey, OP here, figured i&#39;d clarify some things about this project:1) yes, I realize this is going to be way harder than it seems, but I&#39;m actually going to do my best to hopefully get a good user experience out of this and I&#39;m easily preparing for this to be a multi-year effort, but I&#39;m not going to give up right at the gate2) Custom HALs were actually an option, up until very recently, since as of Windows 10, version 2004, the HAL is now statically linked into the kernel, meaning that if I wanted to use the AIC natively I&#39;d need to write a patch finder that runs before the Windows kernel loads (This is what EfiGuard does for example to disable PatchGuard)(Yes this is actually more tenable than it may seem, due to some undocumented policy files Windows is able to use, but I have already decided to hold off on this until after I get Windows working under the thin hypervisor)3) HAL Extensions (for those unaware they are tiny modules that allow you to extend the Windows HAL with functions for non standard hardware) are not tenable at the moment since they&#39;re limited in the APIs they use4) I am well aware that Windows is going to need a lot more help than just purely the interrupt controller, I&#39;m currently trying to bring up the vGIC first since the distributor and redistributors need to be emulated and I need to bring up Project Mu first5) as for the GPU, I&#39;m way too far away from that being a concern to figure out the approach lolif you have any feedback btw, please do feel free to comment it i&#39;ll try to address it as best as I canyes I&#39;ll update the website theme soon enough, thanks to the commenter who remarked about readability."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a bit shocked that it would even be possible for a third party to implement such a thing without rebuilding Windows itself. Is it a matter of implementing &#34;device drivers&#34;?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why would Apple want to make it hard to run aarch64 Windows on an M1 device?  Their support for Windows in Boot Camp drove a lot of sales of Mac hardware after the switch to Intel.  Seems Apple is limiting their hardware sales to not support Windows on M-series Macs.(Then again, if they are having supply/capacity issues then maybe it&#39;s a matter it being on the roadmap but they want their hardware running macOS until that demand is fully met?)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been working 4 day workweeks for well over a decade now, took the pay cut myself.As for the goal to maintain 100% productivity whilst cutting back on hours, I&#39;m confident that they will succeed. In fact, they&#39;ll succeed in this without requiring some kind of brilliant plan, as this recalibration happens automatically.When you start working one day less, nobody will reduce your workload by 20%. You&#39;ll have the exact same workload as before and now need to achieve it in less time.There&#39;s many ways to cross this gap. An obvious one is that a typical 5 day work week has moments of slack, depending on the culture. Friday after lunch is where productivity sinks in many offices. Wednesdays are also slower as it&#39;s typically the first moment in the week where things are running (planned, prepared, on track). In a 4 day work week you sacrifice this breathing room, the 4 days become more compressed.Another natural change is to take a more aggressive stand in rejecting non-sense. Excess meetings, unimportant emails, etc. This works very well and is extremely effective for the simple reason that you MUST. As such this time compression is a blessing, a cleansing mechanism for yourself and the organization.You&#39;ll be amazed at how much time you can win back. Let&#39;s say you do need to attend a meeting. It&#39;s a 1 hour meeting. You&#39;re needed in the meeting. Go in and say you only have 20 mins. As if by sheer magic, what needed to be discussed gets done in 20 mins. Without this forced &#34;budgeting&#34;, people would just fill the hour with bullshit.Counter intuitive, but by being rigid instead of elastic, you maximize value."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is part of a wider scheme in the UK whereby 60 firms and 3000 employees are piloting 4 day weeks.https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/04/thousands-o...From the article:Employees from a wide range of businesses and charities are expected to take part in the scheme, which will run initially from June to December, including the Royal Society of Biology, the London-based brewing company Pressure Drop, a Manchester-based medical devices firm, and a fish and chip shop in Norfolk.It comes as the push for companies to adopt a shorter working week – crucially with no loss of pay while aiming for higher productivity – gains momentum as a way of improving working conditions."</p>

The &#34;good management&#34; part is where most companies go pear-shaped.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a low-energy quantum physicist, I completely agree: Experimental high-energy physics has become primarily an industrial subsidy scheme[1], and if we want the highest chance of reaching a grand unified theory, it seems the money would be much better spent elsewhere (cosmology, space-based observatories, research positions for young physicists without publish-or-perish incentives to run for the latest fad).The short history of physics in TFA is spot on: Einstein and the quantum pioneers added abstractions to build physical theories with prediction power, whereas current high-energy physics theory seems to be mostly a mathematical exercise. This has been confirmed by numerous insiders, including by Hossenfelder as mentioned in the article, and Lee Smolin (&#34;The trouble with physics&#34;) who is also a theoretical physicist.Things have changed a lot since accelerators became a must-have for high-energy physics: Today we have detectors and computing power that let us observe the natural experiment of the universe with a precision and diligence that would be impossible when LHC was commissioned. I find it much more likely that we would learn new physics by giving 10-year grants to 1000 young physicist of revolutionary spirit, and let them use the tools they could build themselves, than by handing that money to the old guard which has produced nothing of significance for the last two generations.[1]: The industrial subsidy angle is not touched upon in TFA, but it is clear that there is a large number of people and companies making a good living from mega-physics, and  talking to colleagues in the field, I get the distinct impression that it is not always they physicist walking in the front when asking for more machines."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who did their PhD at CERN - I agree.The place is fantastic, you get to meet great people and life is cool.But what you are working on is completely useless for humanity. Knowing that there is a quantum foam is knowledge that brings us nowhere. If someone could answer to this &#34;and so what?&#34; in a meaningful way I would be glad to change my mind. For the time being, the energy scale we are making these discoveries is not useful.&#34;yes, but this is fundamental science...&#34; → yes it is, but where does this fundamental science helps in everyday problems? Have we had a case where the Higgs boson changed anything in our life?The quantum mechanics of the 1920&#39;s changed our everyday world. We could build a whole technology on it, and understand things that changes our everyday life. Is there a comparable impact on knowing that the Higgs boson is +/- 10^-9 (or whatever) aligned with the theoretical model?We have so many problems where physics is needed (energy production to start with, and then exploring biology), the money should go there instead. Even if it means having less particle physicists the same way we have less philosophes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminded me of another fun programming game called Elevator Saga (https://play.elevatorsaga.com). Essentially, you need to write the code for a system of elevators to transport the maximum number of people in a given time.It&#39;s a problem I&#39;ve thought about every so often, but never bothered to look up how it was commonly implemented. For example, If you have a large building with multiple elevators, is there an optimal way to arrange the elevators while they&#39;re idle to minimize transport time? Or what about accounting for time of day? (e.g. stacking the elevators on the bottom floor in the morning as people arrive at the office). Or what advantages do you gain mathematically from having Up/Down buttons vs. the touchpads where people select the exact floor? Seems like an interesting problem if you work on elevators installed in tall office buildings."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Excited to show off something that we&#39;ve been working on: the Bitcoin Note. The Bitcoin Note is a cash instrument that is backed by Bitcoin via multisig. Each note is printed with beautiful, currency-grade elements that use secure printing techniques typically reserved for government documents like microtext, raised print and foil. More importantly, each note includes a secure NFC chip which is where a multisig lives that allows you to claim the Bitcoin at any time.We were heavily inspired by OG Bitcoin physical money like Casascius coins, however, we wanted to created a design whereby (1) anyone can spend, gift and share the Bitcoin for years to come without having to worry a sophisticated attacker who extracts a private key from under a label or scratch off and (2) trust was minimized on that part of the printer (us).This lead us to the design we landed on for the Bitcoin Note1) An NFC chip readable by nearly all modern smartphones2) A two part multisig where (1) we write an encrypted private key to the note (and don&#39;t keep a copy and (2) you write a user key to the note in plaintext and then load the note3) We only release the decryption key when someone cuts the note and reports this via an authenticated and encrypted way to our server4) The multisig reverts to only your key after a printed expiration date on the note5) You can re-key the user key on the note you receive if you want to hold it for a long timeWe believe that the result of this design achieves the goal of Bitcoin that&#39;s incredibly easy to use - like cash - but still preserves the important quality of self-custody. Take a look at http://bitcoinnote.com/ to learn more and reserve a spot in line for our release later this summer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Am I missing something about how cutting notes works, or am I correct in saying that cutting notes relies on a centralized single-company-controlled server being both online and releasing a decryption key?This entire release seems a little bit light on technical details so it&#39;s not clear to me exactly what notes are doing when they&#39;re transferred, but it does seem like on first glance there are a lot of red flags here. I would love to see a more detailed technical breakdown on that website that isn&#39;t just promotional material.----Even ignoring the centralization angle, all of the verification advice I&#39;m seeing boils down to &#34;scan each note and cut it when you receive it.&#34; And if everyone is going to do that, what&#39;s the point of using a physical note instead of an app? The promo images and descriptions clearly expect that this is going to be used like cash so that technical burdens are lessened for people who aren&#39;t good with more traditional cryptocurrency transaction methods.But if non-technical users use it like cash, they&#39;re not going to scan anything. And if you think you can teach them to scan every bill in their wallet with a phone, then... why not just teach them to use the phone?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, it&#39;s paper money, but one that won&#39;t survive heat or strong electrical fields, and that you need to use with your phone. And will lose all value if the central repository goes under. And is not recyclable or efficiently burnable.Top work everyone, nailed it."</p>

Now I rarely have the chance to code for a few hours straight because if I have enough information to write code then all that’s left is the easy part. The hard part is coordinating, defining the problem, planning for the future, and communicating the current status of the problem. Not to mention onboarding newer devs who haven’t learned the technologies yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me, it was that I thought that being a good programmer was that I write clean code with enough abstraction and indirection to make it future proof.Boy I was wrong. Unless you’re doing the same thing you’ve done for years, you can’t tell the future. And just when your unnecessary abstraction is wrong, this the reason why we’re talking about tech debt in the first place. Because nobody wants to touch it.Unfortunately, I didn’t have anyone to tell me this for the longest time. It wasn’t until I had to fix a bug for something I wrote in the past, and I couldn’t figure out just what I wrote.Now I try to write dumb and simple (yet sensible) code until there’s a good reason for abstractions.

Even things that usually are not displayed in this fashion.When it comes to prime numbers, it always irked me, that one cannot easily look at them in a visual way. I always thought that they would probably look beautiful.One day, I had the idea to counter this by visualizing prime numbers in the complex plane. I then wrote a little script to colorize each number in the complex plane by how &#34;prime&#34; it is. And indeed, the result looks beautiful:https://www.gibney.org/does_anybody_know_this_fractalThen I went back to do more mundane things with x/y charts. The one that became most popular is Product Chart:https://www.productchart.comBut every once in a while, I still dream about the &#34;complex divisor fractal&#34; and what mysteries might be hidden inside of it."</p>

 the flight suit emergency oxygen, automatic parachute etc here).

								<p class="story__comment_others">"To those interested in the blackbird, the museum of flight had a series of panels on their youtube channel, including actuals sr71 pilots and mechanics [1]Lots of more minor annecdotes (including a brown pants one). One thing I learned is that the idea that the sr71 flew faster than anti-air missiles is a misconception. But the missiles at the time couldn&#39;t be reprogrammed once launched, so what made it safe is that because the sr71 flies so fast and so high, between the time the missile is launched and the time the missile reaches the expected sr71 position and altitude, the sr71 will have had time to change course and be far away.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbuOD6bgPc4https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1uq-qOzf5ohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54FEBBPCZ-Yhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiX_JPuir0"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Does anybody know of something similar, but written in a more elaborate book-like fashion?It&#39;s not about format, of course, it&#39;s just that all these model-zoo&#39;s are only half of the story — not useless, but rather incomplete. That is, if you learn a lot of them, one day you might remember something and find it useful — or you might not. This is a bit abstract, but I want to say you rarely ever need any special tools of thinking (or maybe even tools in general) — you want a technology. That is, a relatively broad (but precisely defined) instruction of how to identify and approach a set of problems in some domain. I.e., it is more about when to use a tool or technique, rather than being a exhibition of such tools. I mean, there is important difference — that&#39;s kinda the difference between going to college and going to a museum.For example, GTD is a technology (doesn&#39;t matter good or bad). It tells you when to use tools/techniques suggested (and a better book would have more showcases and exercises to internalize the idea, IMO). This site or coursera&#39;s famous &#34;Models Thinking&#34; course — aren&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it is telling that most of the tools on this website (and in similar collections I have seen) are diagrammatic in nature. Diagrams might have been the most important “tools for thought” since our ancestors invented lists, tables, calendars and maps, long before recent note-taking app startups used this expression for their marketing purposes (which is absolutely fair and I am always happy to see when thinking tools become more popular outside of business/science contexts).I think it has something to do with how intertwined structure is with diagrammatic representation. Models as well as systems are all about structure, which is why you often see them represented in diagrams (and if you don’t, you may still think about them in diagrammatic terms). And yet, historically diagrams have often been neglected in science until very recently.I believe digital tools are still missing a lot of their potential as thinking tools because of how text-centric they are. I don’t suggest that it could have been different, given technical constraints and demands, but maybe computers would aid our thinking much more if they would actually allow us to more freely and intelligently draw diagrams. Ivan Sutherlands Sketchpad was a great step in that direction (I am sure most of you have seen it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad) and more recently the work of Bret Victor (http://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/). But in many regards I believe that paper is still superior to what we have done so far."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s even more frustrating, because the game is good. I really enjoyed playing the first 30 levels or so. Good story, good controls, very satisfying gameplay. If I could pay $60 and just have a &#34;classic&#34; Diablo on my phone, I might. But I won&#39;t spend a cent on consumable in-app purchases.It is so sad that &#34;make good game, sell it&#34; model no longer works. It&#39;s all a wonky curve of &#34;free - couple of dollars - hundreds and thousands of dollars&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing is - is it necessary to have the best gear to enjoy the game?As a different example - I&#39;m sure it would cost tens of thousands of dollars to max out your characters and gear in Genshin Impact, but I&#39;ve played very enjoyable 100h+ and it&#39;s perfectly fine even if you don&#39;t have the max ascended characters and gear, I have a feeling those are there basically for the wales to spend money on but aren&#39;t necessary for gameplay in any way(well maybe for some crazy hardcore end game content, but as always, that seems to be something 0.0001% of the playerbase enjoys).My point is - the game can still be enjoyable and worth playing even if you can&#39;t get the endgame gear. Is that the case here? I don&#39;t know."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve watched a lot of discussions about this from twitch streamers and I&#39;m not sure where I stand.. On the one hand I&#39;m amazed at how good this game looks on mobile and if you&#39;re just the type to casually play a game not really caring about being the best at it you could have fun playing it for free or for very cheap. On the other hand this game is clearly exploitative and while other games like Hearthstone or Clash Royale have similar pay to win mechanics they also have ways for you to enjoy the game competitively without spending a whole lot of money.I know some countries banned games like this but I wonder, if these games get banned why not ban casinos too?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"IMHO, this was not cheating. This is a phenomenon called success.  If you are fortunate (?) to be around in the entrepreneurial world long enough, you will realize that intelligence, hard work, good time management etc are not adequate.  They just qualify as deserving.  There are serendipities that separate those who succeed from everybody else who was deserving. Survivor bias [1]. Calling Eli was your serendipity.  The opposite is also true:  killer asteroids hit the planets of otherwise deserving individuals and initiatives.  I was co-founder of a municipal fiber-to-the-home initiative in 1996.  We had both a winning technical recipe and also a financial engineering recipe. (Extremely rare even today)  We were then fortunate enough to acquire a customer that was a newly minted public company, representing a whopping 65% of our business.  Banker&#39;s dream, but in actuality a big mistake.  Then the double-whammy of fraud by that public company (wiping it out completely before our contract was realized) AND the dot-com crash.  Killer asteroids are real.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Qd3erAPI9w"</p>

Normally, I would be able to do this but I just got stuck and in a moment of panic, I StackOverflow&#39;d the question on a secondary device which provided me the exact answer. I typed it in with my own style and submitted the assessment.I got the job, stayed at the company for 4 years with great performance reviews and it shaped my experience as the programmer I am today.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My rule is: if I get a single notification that I find useless, I&#39;ll immediately disable that notification channel (I&#39;m on Android; I&#39;m not sure if iOS has a concept of channel-specific settings) for that app. Even if the channel can include useful notifications, as the article discusses.If the app doesn&#39;t bother to categorize its notifications into channels at all, I turn off its notifications entirely, and I won&#39;t turn it back on.If something is important enough, I can always manually check on it. My attention is too valuable to me to waste it on useless notifications.I do want more control over my notifications in general. I use Google Apps Script to automatically process/triage my email, and I want to do something similar with notifications. I can probably do so using Tasker, but I haven&#39;t gotten around to it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve noticed this in social networks as well.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a pretty good idea on how to fix this (and many similar) problems: &#34;hibernate app&#34; option. Its a new app state where app icon icon has some mark (like being semi-grayed out) and all the background app services are disabled (tracking, promotional popups, periodic wakeups, etc...). The app is only un-hibernated if user explicitly clicks on it, it cannot do it by itself. The app can be hibernated by long-press menu on app icon or notification.So the first time you get an ad notify, you click &#34;hibernate&#34; and you are good. And if it is time to make another order, app is woken up, so you cannot miss notifications by accident.Sure, it is not as good as having separate &#34;show ads&#34; toggle, but it requires no cooperation from app whatsoever,"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I believe submission title is inaccurate:&gt; This study shows that various mafic rock glasses almost certainly present on the surface of the Hadean Earth catalyze the formation of polyribonucleic acid in water starting from nucleoside triphosphates.&gt; Thus, the prebiotic relevance of this result very much depends on whether nucleoside triphosphates were present to Hadean impact fields.In other words, RNA spontaneously forms on basalt lava glass in the presence of nucleoside triphosphates. These are compounds for which there is no known prebiologic formation process - we only know of nucleoside triphosphates as compounds created by living organisms.Disclaimer: I am not an expert in this area, I just read the article."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the whole RNA thing is a bit over hyped. People like RNA because it looks somewhat like computer code, and our technology is just smitten with computers, these recent decades. And right along with that, it makes for such a painfully obvious way to implement inheritance and natural selection, a way to make genes.But I think our focus is too narrow, we should think bigger than just obvious solutions. Now, it&#39;s great if the early oceans were awash with RNA, but does RNA exploit energy gradients on its own? The idea of all this random RNA just sloshing around, using nothing more than entropy, behaving as genes and inventing all the rest of it, just seems a little cart-before-the-horse.What about metabolism-first? Is fire alive? It has many properties of life but, critically, lacks self regulation and heritability. Burns everything and goes out. Imagine though, a system of enzymes that can assimilate various specific kinds of molecules, and sustain production of those enzymes. Imagine this contained, compartmentalized in some way. Dynamically not much more complicated than simple fire, but crucially, the enzymes can be said to be inherited. These are not &#39;genes&#39; as such, these are the actual machinery. It should be possible for natural selection to act on &#39;life&#39; no more complicated than that. And that kind of system could then take find uses for RNA.(And yes, the enzymes I refer to could be realized as RNA, but acting as the enzymes directly, not merely describing them, and this would confer some major benefits)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a very interesting result. Does anyone know how likely ribonucleoside triphosphates are to be formed in young earth conditions? What is the state of the research on this topic?It seems like this is a pre-print but if it stands up to peer review this would appear to be a big step forward in our understanding of abiogenesis, and would seem to be good evidence for the RNA world hypothesis.I always kind of hoped abiogenesis happened multiple times on multiple worlds, rather than once and then spread through panspermia. This result seems to indicate it could have happened here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;d appreciate it if they could be more upfront about their language support and what this even does for me. Right now this is: &#34;A better gRPC for Go&#34;. And I don&#39;t know what&#39;s better about it without doing much more research. Apparently proto3 has support for json encoding by default. So they somehow give me a better schema validation. That&#39;s their claim but I don&#39;t see how exactly they do that without going much deeper into it. Meanwhile .proto files are obviously already a schema, so they might be parsing your golang server code to see if it still matches your .proto file. That sounds very brittle to me if true. 
I&#39;m not convinced at all from this post and I don&#39;t see how this works."</p>

It&#39;s incompatible with the rest of Go&#39;s HTTP ecosystem, so you can&#39;t cleanly serve gRPC requests alongside other HTTP traffic and can&#39;t use most third-party packages.Mostly because grpc-go&#39;s implementation is about 5-10x faster than net/http."</p>

It shares the same design priorities: it&#39;s idiomatic TypeScript all the way down, stays close to the browser&#39;s fetch API, fits neatly into React hooks, and supports both gRPC-Web and Connect&#39;s own protocol. It also produces tiny bundles. We&#39;ve already replaced grpc-web in the Buf Schema Registry frontend, and we&#39;re planning to release connect-web soon — stay tuned.i belive this will be huge. biggest blocker for grpc adoption is the really poor js and grpc-web implementations."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a big frustration of mine, too. The other is that Spotify is extremely biased towards playlist listening and makes browsing and listening to a library of albums really painful.The good news is that Spotify&#39;s SDK and API are actually powerful enough that you can build up an entire alternative interface, which is actually what I recently started doing: https://i.imgur.com/ar7VrYy.png.It&#39;s still work in progress but actually works perfectly well already. It&#39;s not ready for public use yet and also isn&#39;t open source yet though. If you want to follow development I guess the best place to do that is my twitter: https://twitter.com/tom_j_watson."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use Winamp for my MP3 collection that I downloaded of my T1 line at the office.When I turn that mother up on and my CRT monitor starts smoking because of the Winamp addons that spikes all kinds of shit whenever the tune is changing, then I know I have found the right track.Then I get cracking on the floor. Break dancing and caps flying around. The neighbors come jumping in the door and starts clapping and the music just keeps going.Everybody can understand a list of songs, even my grandma who&#39;s pushing 84. So we battle out songs on each of ours computers, but we don&#39;t use Spotify any more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Spotify&#39;s UI is a case study of the negative impact of assigning single screens to single teams, designers and managers. There is no cohesive vision. The useful functionality is all obscured by esthetics. I am perpetually annoyed at how poor spotify is at it&#39;s basic purpose. They have leaned way too far into recommendation systems and over designed layout. 99% of the time, I know what I want to listen to. Spotify&#39;s UX is designed for people to &#39;browse&#39; the app. That doesnt resonate with me, at all. I know what I want.My biggest gripe with spotify is it&#39;s inability to reliably answer the question of &#34;what playlist or source am I currently listening too?&#34;. A constant flow that spotify fails to deliver on is this: Search for a song, play the song, then the rest of the album, on repeat, without shuffle. It&#39;s annoying to have to load multiple slow UIs to navigate from search to album, visually search the album&#39;s track list and play the song your after.Itunes and Windows Media Player set the standard for how media should be navigated and Spotify should use some of those old standard concepts.EDIT:Try browsing Armin Van Buuren&#39;s massive discography on Spotify."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Losing confidence? No, I lost that years ago. For quite some time the vast majority of the listings have been drop-shipped AliExpress garbage. Many of them are obvious because of terrible photoshops, randomly named branding, and those strange bold brackets in the product description.But some can be harder to spot because of tricks that sellers use to essentially hijack listings for other products to carry all the positive reviews along. Or they may just go the route of putting completely fake reviews on the product. Some may even be from verified purchasers because they packed a card along with the product offering compensation for a 5 star review. Or they can get verified reviews in an even slimier way involving ordering from themselves and then shipping random crap to people who&#39;ve they&#39;ve sent stuff to before.And then there&#39;s the inventory that&#39;s poisoned with counterfeits. Thanks to inventory co-mingling counterfeit and legit products can end up getting mixed together. There&#39;s a chance that even buying from a fully legit listing will end up with you getting sent a counterfeit product.However, despite all of that I do still use Amazon. Their immense investment into logistics means that many things will make it to me next-day. And their return policies allow me to order with the confidence that if I get a fraudulent item (or just something I don&#39;t like) it will be fairly painless to get a replacement or my money back.That said, I have also been making more efforts over the years to not use Amazon. I tend to buy all my major electronics from Best Buy or direct from the manufacturer. And I would never buy any food or medicine from Amazon. I don&#39;t want to risk things that go into me being counterfeit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A seller offered me a gift certificate if I left a 5 star review.  Basically a little note in the box saying if I left a 5 star review, took a screenshot &amp; sent it to their email address, they&#39;d send me the gift certificate.It was not a 5 star product.  It was a 2 star product, at best.I tried to mention the fact they were paying for reviews in my review (to explain the other 5 stars).Amazon rejected my review.It&#39;s against Amazon policy to let others know that sellers are buying reviews."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like you&#39;re several years late to the party here. I think it&#39;s pretty common knowledge at this point that certain types of goods sold on Amazon have a huge chance of being counterfeit and everyone knows reviews are faked/not to be trusted blindly.At this point people seem to not care since Amazon will give a refund/exchange pretty much no questions asked. It&#39;s still extremely annoying and it&#39;s definitely not a good look for their business, but I assume the number crunchers have determined actually dealing with the fraud isn&#39;t yet worth it financially."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seems like an innocent enough mistake. Remind me of when I once helped organize a volunteer hackathon with people from different companies. We created a Slack organization just for the occasion. At the end of the event, I was supposed to ask all attendees to delete all the data we had given them before they went home. The message I posted to #general (the channel everyone in a Slack organization is required to be in) with @everyone tagged was something to the effect of:&#34;Thank you everyone for contributing to our shared mission. When you are done with your work today, please delete all the data from your machines. Hope we see each other again soon!&#34;Slack gave me a dire warning that my message would send notifications to so many people across so many time zones. This didn&#39;t surprise me because attendees came from various countries for the event. So I dismissed it.But I had accidentally sent it to my company&#39;s Slack organization instead of the hackathon-specific one. I didn&#39;t realize it until a co-worker sent me a private message asking why I had just tried to fire everyone at our company."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only notable thing here IMO is the lack of limits imposed by GitHub on notifications. Apparently a random tag of `@microsoft` in the comments was enough to notify 4000 people [1] as well.I have no idea why the user is even being mentioned in this headline. I haven&#39;t used GitHub in a while, and am unfamiliar with orgs and subgroups, but tagging a developer subgroup on a PR seems...a reasonable thing for a new contributor to do? How is it their fault that the developer subgroup has been hijacked by this organization to mean &#34;Anyone who has ever signed the Terms of Service To View Our Code&#34;?The correct thing for Epic Games to do here would be to rename the group to `@EpicGames/terms-of-service-signatories`, and restrict `@EpicGames/developers` to people who have requested access to open a PR. Assuming that people should magically know not to mention `@EpicGames/developers` in their PRs because Epic is doing some ToS shenanigans is preposterous.I guess I&#39;ll be looking carefully at mentions the next time I have to use this social network [2] masquerading poorly as a code review tool to submit a pull request.----------------------------------------[1] https://github.com/EpicGames/Signup/pull/24#issuecomment-114...[2] Looking at the profile of the contributor making the PR tells me that GitHub has apparently decided to let their users independently rediscover the experience of SuperWall on Facebook circa 2007."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Innocent mistake.The kid is barely 18. The emotion and stress resulting from mistakenly sending a notification to 400,000 is likely overwhelming. Now his real name is going to stay at the center of the internet for a while thanks to being 1st on HN. I would definitely not have coped well with that much internet attention at his age. Some Github replies are more immature than the initial action and I hope he does not receive any threat.I hope the Epic developers reach out to him nicely with constructive feedback and maybe a thanks for his well-meaning PR."</p>

Instead, there was a card that you filled in with your address, and the company would mail you some ants. My friend expressed surprise that you could get ants sent to you in the mail.I replied: “What’s really interesting is that these people will send a tube of live ants to anyone you tell them to.”&#39;"</p>

Bob will find out his crush’s public key, encrypt &#34;you are my crush&#34; message to it and post it with his own signature to public bulletin (blockchain can be good shelling point). When crush decrypts message they will see proper string, while everyone else will see gibberish.- to solve problems with key distribution we can use &#34;identity based encryption&#34;. it requires trusted third party (e.g. school administrators) but it solves problem for key generation of participants. With identity encryption bob can encrypt message to some canonical identity such as school email. Owner of that email can prove it’s identity to the third party and receive corresponding private key."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"That&#39;s a really awesome story with a great opening, middle, and especially the end, if one ignores the adolescent fraud. I think it really highlights the simple joy that technology that literally just works can bring. I&#39;m around the same age as the author, a little younger in fact, but there&#39;s just something about today&#39;s Internet and a lot of the overwhelming amount of technology that just isn&#39;t fun or memorable. From game consoles to land lines to various other things, there were pieces of technology that just worked and worked well. Of course, there was technology that didn&#39;t work well, but I think part of the tragedy is that a lot of technology that worked well has been replaced by &#34;better&#34; technology that doesn&#39;t work well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just last month I got the opportunity to assist with an art installation that involved a phonebooth, which meant I got to take one home and poke around its insides. It was some of the most delightfully 90s tech I&#39;ve seen in a while - 2-layer PCBs, all through-hole components, only a few well-known ICs... I ended up carefully removing all the &#34;brains&#34; and hooking up the insides to a raspberry pi, which could join a  Discord channel or answer an incoming call when you picked up the phone.Standing next to the phone talking to friends was strangely fun and nostalgic experience, despite the fact I had only used a payphone once in my life. I got a cellphone very quickly (perks of having a tech journalist in the family), so by the time I was old enough to be able to buy a phone card with my own money I no longer needed it. During the pandemic, all of the remaining phonebooths in the country were quietly shut down and dismantled.I know it&#39;s completely irrational, but I&#39;m still sad that I had to eventually return the one I worked on and that in the many years the system was still operational it never occurred to me to buy a card and call someone from a phone booth just for the fun of it.P.S.: If anyone from Slovenia or other ex-Yu countries has any ideas how I could get my hands on one of those Iskra payphones, drop me an email (address in bio). I have so many ideas for projects involving them, but it seems that I&#39;m a bit too late to stand behind the Telekom dumpster and snag a few before they&#39;re scrapped."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thanks for this article and the comments.
Reminds me of a trick we kids did in the early 60s (yeah, sorry) with the British &#39;phone box&#39; pay phones. We called it &#39;tapping the phone&#39;, but it wasn&#39;t spy style listening. Passed from kid to kid the amazing trick was you could dial the number by tapping the handset (10 taps for zero, 9 taps for 9, ..) and the phone would ring the number but you didn&#39;t then have to &#39;press button A&#39; to speak.. you simply made the call, spoke normally, hung up, and pressed button B to get your money back! Sadly, I never tried international calls...
When we moved to New Zealand around &#39;63-4, I discovered the phone dial was reversed, in the UK it was 1-9,0, in NZ it was 9-1,0. (So emergency calls were 111 not 999 as in the UK.) The trick still worked but, except for 0, you had to &#39;10s complement&#39; the taps. Maybe because of that none of the kids I knew at the time in NZ appeared to know the trick..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey folks, Geoff here from Gitpod. Very pleased to see there continues to be strong interest in open (and FOSS) software development tooling. VSCodium uses the OpenVSX registry (which Gitpod folks created) because the VS Market place is proprietary and can only be connected to from official  Visual Studio branded products.If you can&#39;t find an extension when using VSCodium then please send a pull-request to this repository https://github.com/open-vsx/publish-extensions with the identifier and that will help grow the ecosystem of open tooling.ICMYI - We blogged more about this over at:- https://www.gitpod.io/blog/cloud-ide-history- https://www.gitpod.io/blog/openvscode-server-launch- https://www.gitpod.io/blog/open-vsxIf you got any questions lemme know. &lt;3"</p>

This is usually remedied by just downloading the extension manually yourself or by asking the extension developers to cross-publish."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another data point: After writing / (re)writing 20K+ lines of code as a CLI side project in Rust (without touching async), I think I can say it&#39;s the best language for me after 20+ years of experience in other languages. I like the compiler, and I learn a lot from clippy.The &#34;hard&#34; part about Rust is you have to &#34;unlearn&#34; some of the basic mechanisms like scope and ownership that you bring from other languages. It doesn&#39;t allow you to build quick and easy solutions that allows you to lie to yourself (or your boss.) You have to spend more time upfront to compile and fix all warnings, but in my experience so far, fixing these at the right time (i.e. before compilation) is better than fixing them after someone writes a Github issue. I can&#39;t say it eliminates all bugs, but my trust level to my Rust code is around 10x more than my Python code for the same problem. (And I&#39;m writing Python since 2002.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish there was a Rust-like programming language that was just a little bit higher level than Rust. I like Rust&#39;s wide ecosystem with high quality packages, the nice type system, traits, the idea that my code generally runs pretty fast even if I&#39;m being lazy about writing good code, and my code usually working correctly if it compiles.I care about speed and correctness but Rust makes me also care about ownership and lifetimes even when I don&#39;t really want to care about that stuff. I&#39;ve written Rust for years now and this still occasionally can really slow me down. Rust is still a very nice language so I just deal with it :) no pain no gain.I would love a Rust-with-GC or something in that spirit that is similar to Rust but automatically figures out lifetimes as much as possible and GCs whatever it cannot figure out automatically. I&#39;ve looked at languages like Nim and read about research languages like Koka so I&#39;m optimistic something will emerge from this space I really like."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is rusts most loved status simply Stockholm syndrome? I&#39;ve really tried with rust, and we simply don&#39;t get on. I hear all the arguments about CVEs and wonder if rust will reduce the number of these problems simply by disabling the programmers that create them. I understand the draw, I want to love it, but i think I might not be smart enough."</p>

In high school, I was intrigued by the idea of a web-based, multitasking capable smartphone and begged my parents to buy me one.Ultimately I learned a ton and have great stories such as staying up all night re-architecting Weatherman (https://appcatalog.webosarchive.com/showMuseumDetails.php?&amp;a...) because of the popularity (and this was before it was on the WebOS store, at this time it was invite-only so I had to post it on a forum!). Weatherman was just a hack on top of a hack on top of a hack. There was no Canvas API on the device so I had to generate the weather images on a server and then send them to the device, for example.The highlight for me was winning one of the top spots in the Palm Hot Apps competition for the &#34;free apps&#34; category with Pixi Dust (https://appcatalog.webosarchive.com/showMuseumDetails.php?ca...). The physics weren&#39;t accurate by any means, but it was the first time I had seriously used C++ (I think it was, it was so long ago!).I miss having platforms like these with innovative ideas and small communities. I learned so much by having to hack my way around the limitations of the operating system, and really miss WebOS overall.

Should he be lanky? pudgy? Even simple decisions like obliviously Kermit in Wall-E is going to be a robot, it has to figure out what he looks like as a robot, what his mouth looks like, that his eyes should be enlarged.It gets a lot of things wrong, like I&#39;m not sure why kermit has a plastic texture in many of the pictures. If you showed me ten pictures of Kermit and ten frames of total recall, and for some reason 8 of your pictures had a plastic Kermit, and asked me to combine them in my head, I&#39;d probably imagine something on-par or worse than what Dalle has managed to do.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This really bums me out.I was a convicted felon at 18 years old, poor, living on the street.It wasn&#39;t any government re-integration program that helped me, it was a random person I met in highschool.I worked my way through everything -&gt; college -&gt; jobs -&gt; startups -&gt; lucky windfalls -&gt; owning my own company. I&#39;ve immigrated to Europe (3 times in the last 10 years technically), beating the legal issues each time.And finally, after 17 years, I&#39;m no longer a felon thanks to a pardon and expungement.I really wish something like 70MR would stay up. Not everyone can be as lucky as me. Is there some place I can donate?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I announced the launch of 70 Million Jobs on HN back in 2017, it proved to be one of the most widely read and discussed posts ever on the site. I was totally blown away. Once again, I am struck by the incredibly sensitive and supportive tenor of the reactions to my news here.For some context, besides having a criminal record, I was/am a solo founder who somehow talked his way into Y Comb. Perhaps most surprising is my age: I&#39;m 68. To my friends I grew up with, I&#39;m f&#39;-ing Steve Jobs. To you guys, you&#39;d no doubt see me as the bumbling great uncle at Thanksgiving that isn&#39;t allowed to touch the TV remote control.So it&#39;s all been pretty weird. (wanna see it get weirder? google me and check out my past)As you all know, doing a 2-sided marketplace is always tough. But imagine if neither side of your marketplace was convinced they wanted your product. Chances are you keep your distance from such an undertaking (&#34;Build something people want,&#34; my YC t-shirt says). I build something arguably no one wanted, but I knew they needed. Does that make me a schmuck? Probably.But to those who&#39;ve never gotten close to someone with as record--particularly someone with a different color than you, who was brought into an unfair world from Day One, someone who wanted the same things as you, but never quite figured out how to get there, I&#39;m here to say that some of these folks are the most honorable, humble, appreciate, hard-working people you could imagine. They just want a peaceful life, to take care of their family and get a good night sleep.So that&#39;s where the mission comes in, and that&#39;s when zealots are born. The truth is, I have nothing in my life other than my work. No wife, no kids, no home, nothing. But the satisfaction I got from helping these heroic folks, and the smiles I&#39;d see on their kids&#39; faces when they were reunited, meant/means the world to me. If you don&#39;t have something like this in your life, I urge you to find it. Your karma will thank you for it.I invite you all to ask your questions and continue to opine. If you have something to share that isn&#39;t merely an attempt to win an argument, I&#39;d appreciate your taking the time to email me. More importantly, if you&#39;re ever in a position to hire someone with a record, take the chance. Life is too short not to take chances.  Richard"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There seems to be some confusion here over my use of the expression, &#34;The Great Resignation.&#34; https://www.investopedia.com/the-great-resignation-5199074
This is a economic/workforce phenomenon that began amidst the pandemic and continues. (The NY Times reported today that there are 11.4 million unfilled jobs. That&#39;s historically off the charts.)My company operates/ed a job board and a staffing business. Both ran like traditional job boards (Indeed, Zip Recruiter, etc) and staffing companies (Kelly, Adecco, etc.), except being focused entirely on the formerly incarcerated. This is how large employers source many, many employees.The staffing business was much larger. In this model, we serve as the hirer-of-record, and essentially lease out the workers to our client employers, who cover all our costs (wages, unemployment insurance, taxes, etc.) plus our mark-up (profit). It&#39;s a high volume, low margin business.During the Great Resignation, we found it took 10x the time and effort to get someone placed, eroding our already thin margins. Plus, if a worker left (which they began doing at a great rate), we&#39;re obligated to replace them. All of this made it pretty much impossible for us to make money. (Again, we&#39;re a for-profit business).  I hope this clarifies things."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related, Washington Post previously published an anonymous open letter from Dalit women in 2020 in the wake of Cisco being sued for caste discrimination: https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/a-statement-on-caste-...One of the most interesting things that stood out to me from this letter and that lawsuit was the assertion by those affected that discrimination on the basis of caste was more impactful and more severe than discrimination suffered due to immigration status, race, and gender in US society, and the letter goes so far as to state &#34;We know that we thrive when we work under a non-Indian boss.  Our work is seen and evaluated on merit, and we are integrated rather than being excluded.&#34;It makes these discussions of castes even more important, especially as Indian immigration continues to rise and Indian culture begins to take precedence in the tech industry.  Being a white American from the Midwest, I had no awareness of caste or caste discrimination when I began my career, but as I got more experienced began to learn about it and unfortunately I have personally witnessed some incidents in the workplace during my career.  I wish that Google had allowed this talk to move forward, because I think ending workplace discrimination is a critical path to ensuring a merit-based free market open to all."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a well-written article with excellent explanations and I thoroughly enjoyed it.However, none of the variants using vmsplice (i.e., all but the slowest) are safe. When you gift [1] pages to the kernel there is no reliable general purpose way to know when the pages are safe to reuse again.This post (and the earlier FizzBuzz variant) try to get around this by assuming the pages are available again after &#34;pipe size&#34; bytes have been written after the gift, _but this is not true in general_. For example, the read side may also use splice-like calls to move the pages to another pipe or IO queue in zero-copy way so the lifetime of the page can extend beyond the original pipe.This will show up as race conditions and spontaneously changing data where a downstream consumer sees the page suddenly change as it it overwritten by the original process.The author of these splice methods, Jens Axboe, had proposed a mechanism which enabled you to determine when it was safe to reuse the page, but as far as I know nothing was ever merged. So the scenarios where you can use this are limited to those where you control both ends of the pipe and can be sure of the exact page lifetime.---[1] Specifically, using SPLICE_F_GIFT."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I once had to change my mental model for how fast some of these things were. I was using `seq` as an input for something else, and my thinking was along the lines that it is a small generator program running hot in the cpu and would be super quick. Specifically because it would only be writing things out to memory for the next program to consume, not reading anything in.But that was way off and `seq` turned out to be ridiculously slow. I dug down a little and made a faster version of `seq`, that kind of got me what I wanted. But then noticed at the end that the point was moot anyway, because just piping it to the next program over the command line was going to be the slow point, so it didn&#39;t matter anyway.https://github.com/tverniquet/hseq"</p>

  @elysium ~ % pv &lt; /dev/zero &gt; /dev/null

Not a valid comparison between the two machines because I don&#39;t know what the original machine is, but MacOS rarely comes out shining in this sort of comparison, and the simplistic approach here giving 8 GB/s rather than the author&#39;s 3.5 GB/s was better than I&#39;d expected, even given the machine I&#39;m using."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"That is just cool!  If the author releases an STL, I might actually buy a Gameboy camera just to try it out!  Lost my original one but I&#39;ve still got my Gameboy and other stuff.The thing I loved about Nintendo back then was how they did little things that overloaded the original intent of their devices.  The printer is probably the best example, but the camera is a great one too.  There was just something magical about that.  Same goes for initially owning a Nintendo 64 then getting the Rumble Pak, plugging it in, and suddenly adding a whole new dimension to the game.Those days are long gone, for better and for worse.  Nobody would want or even need such devices because they&#39;d either be built right in or just be a part of the household, as would be the case of a printer.  But even though everyone knew the Gameboy&#39; screen was really crappy for the purpose, there was just something novel about turning it into a camera.  It&#39;s an experience of its time that I&#39;m not sure will be recreated any time soon."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article takes an off-the-cuff comment from the CEO of Ford and reads too much into it IMO. He wasn’t saying dealerships are going away; he was actually saying the opposite. The point he was making was that Ford is going to adopt some of Tesla’s practices while using the dealership network to compete with them.Here’s the quote with more context:
“I believe for retail, we have to -- it&#39;s kind of like what happened between Amazon and Target. Target could have gone away, but they didn&#39;t. They bolted on an e-commerce platform and then they used their physical store to add groceries and return -- make returns really much easier than Amazon. They used their expertise as a physical retailer to their advantage, but they modernized the e-commerce piece. So it would be really easy to do business with them. It&#39;s exactly what we have to do on the retail side. We got to go to non-negotiated price. We&#39;ve got to go to a 100% online, the vehicle there is no inventory goes directly to the customer, 100% remote pickup and delivery, but then we have this opportunity to use our physical presence, they outperform them. Like, I believe some Mach-E and Lightning customers would love to have a Mustang for the weekend. Maybe they want a Super Duty. I can do that, they can&#39;t do that, unless they ran a Ford.”Source: https://seekingalpha.com/article/4515793-ford-motor-company-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot has been said about the dealership model in the last few years, and the almost universal consensus is that it is an unnecessary and predatory industry and all auto makers should just sell cars directly like Tesla does.That being said, is there any counterpoint to this view? Are there any benefits that dealerships offer today over direct sales? What would we lose if we got rid of every dealership? If there is truly little or no advantage, why has this obvious disruption never come up in the last ~100+ years of car sales in this country and all over the world?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This story makes me smile.Back in the late-2000&#39;s, I worked at CNN on a 12-month contract.  While there, I built a predecessor to the current &#34;Breaking News&#34; website banner.At least at the time, Turner did not allow contractors to extend beyond the 12-month mark.  So when my contract came up, they offered to convert me over to perm.  I declined, because my interests lay more on the backend side of the tech stack, and my role there had been far more frontend-focused than I wanted for the long term.Fast-forward 10 to 15 years, and I&#39;ve had a lot of experiences that I&#39;m very proud of.  I&#39;ve built concurrent systems that scaled to impressive levels of data.  I&#39;ve built event busses that moved hundreds of millions of dollars worth of financial transactions per year.  Etc.STILL, &#34;my son built the Breaking News banner on cnn.com!&#34; is the thing that my mom tells her friends.  It&#39;s the only thing that my wife ever understood about what I do for a living.There is such power in the visual, and in the consumer-side.  In a very real sense, this silly thing was the crowning achievement of my career... and it was about two days of work and a few hundred lines of HTML and jQuery."</p>

I imagine it could be very hard to pull this off after a ~decade of whatever CNN has been doing though.More context: Discovery and WarnerMedia (former CNN parent company) merged back in April.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve long been enamored with the idea of learning from analog computers to build the next generation of digital ones. In some perspective all our computers are analog, of a sort - today&#39;s computer chips are effectively leveraging electron flow through a carefully arranged metal/silicon substrate, with self-interference via electromagnetic fields used to construct transistors and build up higher order logic units. We&#39;re now working on photonic computers, presumably with some new property leading to self interference, and allowing transistors/logic above that.&#34;Wires&#34; are a useful convenience in the electron world, to build pathways that don&#39;t degrade with the passing of the elections themselves. But if we relax that constraint a bit, are there other ways we can build up arrangements of &#34;organized flow&#34; sufficient to have logic units arise? E.g. imagine pressure waves in a fluid -filled container, with mini barriers throughout defining the possible flow arrangement that allows for interesting self-reflections. Or way further out, could we use gravitational waves through some dense substance with carefully arranged holes, self-interfering via their effect on space-time, to do computations for us? And maybe before we get there, is there a way we could capitalize on the strong or weak nuclear force to &#34;arrange&#34; higher frequency logical computations to happen?Physics permits all sorts of interactions, and we only really use the simple/easy-to-conceptualize ones as yet, which I hope and believe leaves lots more for us to grow into yet :)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I bought it last night and played for about 5 hours and can&#39;t wait for my work day to end today to get back into it.Overall, I&#39;m pretty happy with it.  Factory building with a dash of colony sim mechanics.  My only criticism is that the tutorial is a bit lacking and basically info-dumps a lot of &#34;what&#34; without a lot of &#34;why&#34;.  If I didn&#39;t have experience with other factory building games, I&#39;d probably be completely lost.  It&#39;d be nice if the game guided you more through the first couple tech tiers.It was also a bit frustrating at first with how expensive conveyer belts are, but then I had a light-bulb moment where I accepted that this is not Factorio/DSP/Satisfactory, and that I don&#39;t NEED conveyer belts everywhere.  In the early game, trucks are cheap and can easily handle the load until I&#39;ve got steady production of Construction Parts II.The Recipe window is REALLY nice.  I love it!  It makes planning so easy!  My only request would be to make it so you can click on a product and have it take you to the recipes involving it.I also really like the design choice to not have to lay power lines everywhere.  In other factory games, it&#39;s such a chore and not at all a fun mechanic.Looking forward to seeing how the game evolves over time."</p>

How did you decide to use Unity for your game engine? Did you consider any others, and if so, what was the deciding factor?3. How did you organize your code in Unity, especially on a big, multi-year project like this? I find Unity scenes and prefabs get messy really fast. The only way around this I&#39;ve found is to avoid using the scene/prefab stuff as much as possible and just focus on doing stuff with code instead. But I&#39;d love to hear any strategies you have.4. (Probably most related to the art question) How did you decide to make the game 3d? It just seems a lot more difficult than 2d so it seems like indies tend to avoid 3d when possible. And it definitely seems possible for a top-dow-view strategy game."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m a sad. No Mac. :-(Looks really good. Congrats man. 84% overwhelmingly positive isn’t anything to sneeze at too. The experience must have been amazing. I learned more about computers in developing games that were 1% of what you’ve done. No matter the financial outcome you are winning at nerd life, which is the only life that matters (other than to your spouse your family and friends)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recently attended an automotive dealership conference where I was being pitched for a product that would let me know if my customers were at rival dealerships. I poked and prodded to understand if these were legitimate claims or just marketing hype. They revealed that they purchased location data from app developers. I was shocked and surprised -- I don&#39;t know why I was because this should have been expected. It really enlightened me on the exploitation and misuse of data by crappy apps."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those of you who don&#39;t know who/what &#34;Tim Horton&#39;s&#34; is allow me to educate and enlighten.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_HortonsIt&#39;s a &#39;fast food/coffee&#39; chain that really was made popular by a recurring skit on a TV show called:  Royal Canadian Air Farce (Sketch based usually heavy on the political satire)The skit had 3 people sitting around a table drinking coffee and cracking jokes about current-events and mostly political fiascos.  It was this lampooning of &#39;typical Canadian behaviour&#39; of art imitating life that caused more people to show up and start hanging out at the corner coffee shop.  In my small home town (40,000 people) there were maybe 3 shops (aka Timmies).  During this boom to it&#39;s popularity that number increased by atleast 10.  They made their doughnuts in-house every morning, and the coffee was tolerated as being acceptable.As the franchise grew in popularity it became something of a joke and expectation that a person could find a Timmies on nearly every block, and you would never need to drive more then 10 minutes to get to the closest one.Throughout it&#39;s financial hardships and ownership changes there has been a lot of complaints that &#34;The coffee isn&#39;t as good as it used to be.&#34; And rumours that McDonalds (with it&#39;s McCafee push) bought Timmies old supplier of beans.Now the food is no longer made in store, and my impression is that the coffee is worse.  There have been other cost-cutting measures like making the popular contest &#34;Roll up the Rim&#34; (where a person could unroll the lip of the cup of coffee to reveal a prize from free confections, to money and a car); becoming an APP-only prize (more like a lottery style jackpot then a winning cup).In total, I am not surprised.  Their quality has gone downhill, and the treatment of staff is horrendous."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I assume every app that has location permission does this. I can&#39;t imagine google doesn&#39;t, or the phone company. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right (and even less right that apparently google will provide this information to law enforcement). I just think the only practical thing to do is assume you are being tracked and don&#39;t install apps unless you&#39;re ok with the tradeoff.The flip side of this, is why would I ever install a Tim Hortons app, why do I think they are offering an app, and what possible meaningful benefit (even assuming I went there regularly) would I drive from having an app?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I increasingly believe that Facebook’s pivot to Meta will end up going down as one of the biggest misses in the history of business. The metaverse is a real idea yes - but strapping a phone to your face and walking through your coffee table isn’t it. Especially not with a mediocre centralized FB owned “virtual world” where they inflict heavy taxes and content moderation. Facebook has neglected its core businesses for years and seems to have real trouble shipping hardware with reasonable spending.Now they’re scrambling to ship an iPhone alternative to get out from under Apple policy, but it really seems like they’re on constant defense now and have a very tough lift to actually get something truly mass market. I would be shocked if Apple, Microsoft or Google were irrelevant in 2030, but it is really possible (if not yet necessarily probable) that Facebook/Meta might actually just not exist in the same kind of way anymore then.When they first announced the rebrand I actually thought it could be genius and that there’s no way they could have been doing it without a really well considered, heavily backstopped plan… but epic strategic miscalculation seems to be going around a lot this year."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks great, and I would have loved to see this when I was in the lab.When the software industry says to you: &#34;We will nearly triple your salary, you don&#39;t have to work weekends, and you also don&#39;t have to feed the mice on a Sunday night.&#34;You will 100% take this deal.I was a 10yr+ academic tool maker in biochemistry, built cutting edge microscopes, hardware, and image analysis software. My lab was successful in our field. I got some papers out of the deal. I also saw things that no human had seen before in a microscope. I worked with very interesting people from around the world. The work in academia is great. You&#39;re moving the needle, new data, new failures. These are the perks. It is also highly possible that you have complete creative control of your project. I did, and it was amazing. Custom designed UIs to streamline our experiments, derived from watching students use the system to do their work. A decathalon of software design.Some reality: Your PI and organization will never compensate you the way the software industry will. In pay, expectations, and benefits. When you&#39;re over 30, and you don&#39;t technically have a real 401k, you are still paying your student loans that you needed to get into this field, and you&#39;re still in the same shitty apartment, something has to give.Comparison is the thief of joy, and when you see your cohort of computer science graduates your joy will be stolen :). It&#39;s good, honest work. A short tour of duty would be useful, and can teach you the difference between splitting the atom and splitting the check.Academia, at least in bioscience, is still very much an ivory tower. You don&#39;t have enough letters after your name to matter, and you will likely be a pet instead of a peer.Don&#39;t stay underwater for too long. Life is short. :D"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well, then science needs to do more to create an environment where software engineers would want to be an RSE.From my experience &#34;science&#34; does not appreciate RSEs, the compensation is bad, the freedom is bad, and you get all of the big company bureaucracy from the University.It&#39;s just a bad environment and to top it off, even if you have a PhD many will see you as &#34;less than.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve worked at a top research university for the past 15 years as a research software engineer. Many of these comments have some truth but a lot are definitely not universally true.Poor compensation: Yup, I&#39;ll cop to that. I could be making way more in &#34;industry&#34; but I make enough to live and I don&#39;t build ad-ware and do take pride in my work.Being a PhD but little respect: I actually have the opposite experience. I&#39;m not a PhD, I don&#39;t even have a Masters. But I can write decent software and I get respect and recognition from my PIs and other top-tier faculty that we&#39;ve collaborated with. I feel like I&#39;ve gotten just as much respect with my humble BS in Comp Sci from a state school than if I got a MS/PhD.Micromanagement: I have the total opposite experience. I&#39;ve worked with the same group for a long time, maybe that changes things. We apply for and receive grants to work on projects. We make high-level assertions for what we will do during the course of the grant and our PI gives us lots of lee-way to meet the goals of the grant in whatever technical way gets results, is FAIR, and open. Granted, I may have just lucked out here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Kinda related, here&#39;s a few ffmpeg commands i&#39;ve probably spent many hours getting to work just right recently (and they might not even the right way to do these things), perhaps someone will find it helpful. All of these are on a macbook.- play facetime camera (or any avfoundation camera, like a capture card) to mpv  ffmpeg -f avfoundation -video_size 1920x1080  -framerate 30 -drop_late_frames true -i &#34;FaceTime HD Camera&#34; -c:v rawvideo -f matroska -r 30 - | mpv -profile=low-latency -untimed -

- play raw video stream from the usb camlink capture card  ffmpeg -f avfoundation -video_size 3840x2160 -framerate 23.98 -pixel_format uyvy422 -drop_late_frames true  -i &#34;Cam Link 4K&#34; -c:v rawvideo -f matroska - | mpv -profile=low-latency -untimed -

- Capture video, and do live HVEC hardware encoding on apple hardware and save result. Control quality with q variable. q=85 is around 250Mb/s:  ffmpeg -f avfoundation -video_size 3840x2160 -framerate 23.98 -i &#34;Cam Link 4K&#34; -c:v hevc_videotoolbox -q:v 85 -r 23.98 -tag:v hvc1 &lt;filename&gt;_x265.mp4

- Use named pipe with mkfifo to play a stream. Sometimes this produces less input lag than other methods.  mkfifo /tmp/fifo1
  cat /tmp/fifo1 | mpv -profile=low-latency -untimed -
  ffmpeg -f avfoundation -video_size 1920x1080  -framerate 30 -drop_late_frames true -i &#34;FaceTime HD Camera&#34; -c:v rawvideo -f matroska -r 30 - &gt; /tmp/fifo1"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"  &gt;   1) internal users: mainly developers by providing CI/CD
  &gt;   2) external users: end users
  &gt;
  &gt; Nowadays we call people that do 1) DevOps and people that do
  &gt; 2) SREs (so one could argue that the role of sys admins just
  &gt; got more specialized).

Both are called sysadmins.SRE is a specialized software engineering role -- you&#39;d hire SREs if you wanted to create something like Kubernetes in-house, or do extensive customization of an existing solution. If you hire an SRE to do sysadmin work, they&#39;ll be bored and you&#39;ll be drastically overpaying.DevOps is the idea that there shouldn&#39;t be separate &#34;dev&#34; and &#34;ops&#34; organizations, but instead that operational load of running in-house software should be borne primarily by the developers of that software. DevOps can be considered in the same category as Scrum or Agile, a way of organizing the distribution and prioritization of tasks between members of an engineering org.---With this in mind, the question could be reframed as: if projects such as Kubernetes are changing the nature of sysadmin work, why has that caused more sysadmin jobs to exist?I think a general answer is that it&#39;s reduced the cost associated with running distributed software, so there are more niches where hiring someone to babysit a few hundred VMs is profitable compared to a team of mainframe operators."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kubernetes is a Google scale solution.  Lots of teams said “hey if Google does it then it must be good!”…but forgot that they didn’t have the scale.  It caught on so much that for whatever reason it’s now the horrendous default.  I’ve worked on at least 3 consulting projects that incorporated K8s and it slowed everything down and took way too much time, and we got nothing in return - because those projects only needed several instances, and not dozens or hundreds.If you need less than 8 instances to do host your product, run far away anytime anyone mentions k8s"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Threads like the below are why DevOps jobs exist and why Kubernetes infrastructure skills pay so much and why there&#39;s such a large demand.Yes, it&#39;s quite complicated.No, an API to control a managed EKS/GCK cluster + terraform + Jenkins/Azure DevOps/etc. does not mean that magically the developer can &#39;just deploy&#39; and infrastructure jobs are obsoleted.  That&#39;s old AWS marketing nonsense predating Kubernetes.There&#39;s a whole maintenance of the CI/CD factory and its ever demanding new requirements around performance, around Infosec requirements, around scale, and around whatever unique business requirements throw a wrench in the operation.Sticking to ECS I guess is a valid point.  What Kubernetes gives you is a more sophisticated highly available environment built for integration (Helm charts and operators and setups that when they work give you more levers to control resources allocations, separations of app environments, etc.)And as an aside, I&#39;ve been doing this for 20 years and long before Kubernetes, before Docker, hell, before VMs were used widely in production, I observed the developer mindset: Oh but it&#39;s so easy, just do X.  Here, let me do it.  Fast forward a year of complexity later, you start hiring staff to manage the mess, the insane tech debt the developers made unwittingly, and you realize managing infrastructure is an art and a full time job.A story that is visible with many startups that suddenly need to make their first DevOps hire, who in turn inherit a vast amount of tech debt and security nightmares.Get out of here with, it&#39;s just API calls.  DevOps jobs aren&#39;t going away.  It&#39;s just the DevOps folks doing those API calls now."</p>

About half of these already have photos in the Wikipedia article that isn&#39;t linked to the Wikidata ID. Adding the image attribute to the Wikidata fixes it and the red dot disappears about 60 seconds later.So before you head out with your camera, perhaps do some linking first.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A word on Creative Common licenses:Wikipedia only considers CC0, CC-BY and CC-BY-SA licenses free enough for the image to be included without any issues. With these licenses, you could also add images to Wikipedia that are not your own, which would greatly speed up coverage.I&#39;m specifically mentioning this because some CC licenses seem permissive, but are not permissive enough for Wikipedia. A key example of this is iNaturalist, which contains millions of photos of all kinds of species that would be useful to add to Wikipedia articles.Their default license is CC-BY-NC. Most photographers on that platform just leave it to that default unaware or not interested in licensing in the first place. Some might be aware of this default license and think they&#39;re being permissive and generous, making possible exactly sharing across services like Wikipedia.Unfortunately, no. It&#39;s a painful mismatch as many of those photographers would likely be perfectly fine with the image being used in that context, but the Wikipedia license requirements prevent this.Similarly, even a license containing an attribution requirement (which is morally perfectly reasonable) is problematic. You find a photo from user &#34;anon2522&#34; on platform X that last posted 8 years ago. The attribution information is really soft and fragile, it doesn&#39;t really link to an actual person and the little information you have may disappear at any time.Bottom line, if you&#39;re truly creating an image &#34;for the good of the world&#34;, CC0 is highly recommended. You can still attribute yourself in EXIF or as a small stamp on the photo itself."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"FWIW I also had a recent experience with Cloudflare &#34;Trust &amp; Safety&#34; and it was my first negative Cloudflare experience, unfortunately.A client-of-a-client had their site reported to CF for malware distribution via Netcraft. I reviewed the site and found nothing unsual-looking. I dug out a month&#39;s worth of access logs for the site, carefully filtered them, and then eyeballed all of the tens of thousands of remaining lines, and again, nothing unusual. No sign whatsoever that the site had ever distributed any malware.There were signs that the site had been probed a number of times by one or a few bad actors, a bit more than just the usual background scanning. Best guess was that, having failed to take the site down through direct means, somebody filed some fraudulent reports against it.DigitalOcean also received a report on the site, and that&#39;s where the difference in handling the issue really became apparent. I sent essentially the same response to both DO and CF. DO sent back a quick, &#34;thanks for taking a look at it, we&#39;re not going to take any action at this time, have a nice day&#34; response.Cloudflare on the other hand pre-emptively took the site down and then took a while to reply at all. When they did, the reply was extremely opaque: &#34;this report has been processed&#34;. Like, okay... and?I had by that time already routed the site off of Cloudflare and had it back online, so the impact was minimal, but now that I know what it&#39;s like to deal with this category of issue at Cloudflare, I have to ensure that it&#39;s always easy to take anything off of Cloudflare.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Anyone saying &#34;Good riddance! Go enjoy your life without Facebook!&#34; is missing the point. Please read this bit from the article:&gt; Thing is I’m a Mum of two who has just moved to a new area. Facebook groups have offered me support and community, and Mums I’ve met in local playgrounds have added me as a friend so we can use messenger to plan playdates. Without these apps sadly my little social life becomes a lot lonelier, and harder.This is the pernicious effect of Facebook&#39;s dominance among social networks added to their policy of poor support. It&#39;s not really an &#34;optional&#34; social network if large swathes of your social circle have started using it for essential life functions, it&#39;s more like a utility and should be regulated like one. And no, telling all the mums at the playground about how Facebook&#39;s ban policies are bad and we should all use the Fediverse instead is not going to work for the average person. If anything, it&#39;s more likely to mark you down as one of those weird parents to avoid.It wouldn&#39;t be good for your power company to have the option of arbitrarily cutting you off as a customer, and never giving you a chance to get back your power. Similarly, we should regulate Facebook to the point where they are exposed to genuine regulatory consequences for disrupting people&#39;s lives."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not just hackers you need to worry about.I joined Facebook in 2020 - immediately secured, 2FA switched on and all the settings reviewed.I lost the account in 2021 after I made the world&#39;s dullest post about the 12V system in a Nissan Leaf. In a Leaf car group. An automatic system determined my post breached community standards and required me to verify my account to continue using it.Fiiine, OK, I upload my driving licence. And it won&#39;t accept the upload. I try JPEG, PNG, different sizes, different browsers, different computers. Nothing seems to stick and after a certain number of attempts it says I have to wait a week to try again. After as couple of rounds of this the expiry deadline passes and my account is gone.I created another without hassle (and still treat FB as the contact method of last resort), but was still surprised at how easily they nuked a genuine user doing ordinary things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Increasing we automate processes, have programs do the work humans once did.It&#39;s extremely helpful and productive, but it has a darker side. The processes are rigid because machines are rigid, and the designers cater to the 99% cases.But then the 1% happens, and you&#39;re left out in the cold.In the old world of humans and paper, as wasteful as it was, it was easy for exceptions to be made if the clerk was willing, and if they weren&#39;t you&#39;d find another clerk, or a clerks supervisor. The processes tended towards being flexible.But today, you increasingly don&#39;t interact with any humans, or if you do don&#39;t be surprised if, in your unusual case, they say &#34;the computer won&#39;t let me&#34;.As governments move more and more towards digitization, and embrace machine learning, I expect similar stories might unfold - only it won&#39;t be with an opt in social media website."</p>
