								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;To continue operating, it drew on a line of credit from six banks amounting to between $500 million and $600 million to meet higher margin, or lending, requirements from its central clearing facility for stock trades, known as the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation.&#34;Non-zero chance had they not haulted trading on those symbols they would&#39;ve been insolvent by close of trading today, depending on the size of their credit line.I watched the CEO on CNN tonight, and while I found him pretty difficult to watch, this is a very difficult position to be in. If you admit on TV that your company is experiencing liquidity issues -- even if temporary in nature such as with clearing custodianship requirements -- you run the risk of triggering a greater panic through customer withdrawals/redemptions.This could turn into a run on the brokerage pretty quickly, and probably already has in some measure, especially after a day of massively lost customer trust. He certainly didn&#39;t help it by going on TV and lying about their liquidity issues. They probably would&#39;ve been better off by issuing a statement and keeping him off TV."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t understand how all of a sudden the shift was made onto the insolvency of RH and that the discussion is less about the original conditions that led up to this.I just finished watching a video from Louis Rossmann [1] as well as one from Bruce Fenton [2]. In his video, Rossmann covers the technicalities and systems behind actually __making__ a trade with an app like RH. The videos were very informative and I learned quite a lot.With the exception of his recent interviews, it isn’t exactly clear what Robinhood was supposed to do differently. If my understanding is correct, clearing houses required more money up front to perform trades - RH didn’t have it so they stopped the trades unidirectionally. People got upset that they couldn’t buy but could sell which made it seem like RH wanted to manipulate the price - but isn’t it better than the alternative, the inability to both sell and buy would seem to me worse than what was done. Imagine them closing both and preventing people from selling if a crash occurs. The discussion would simply be « Robinhood stole our gains and wouldn’t let us move our funds ».Now, should it be the case that more money is required up front, intuitively it makes sense, I mean, who is supposed to front the bill on those 5000% returns? The hedge fund that just went bankrupt? Where exactly does this money come from?Isn’t RH just trying to play within the realities of the current system?Genuinely curious.[1]: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MAqxQe0l4g0&amp;feature=youtu.be[2]: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RQTC5f_VR9I&amp;feature=youtu.be"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Okay kids, story time.After the crash of 2008, I spent some time working with Dick Fuld. Yes, the former head of Lehman Brothers. Yes, the one people describe as “disgraced,” among other terms. Here’s the irony, though — Dick was one of the only people I encountered at that level of business/finance who wasn’t a scumbag. Unlike so many virtue-signaling Silicon Valley darlings, the guy behind the curtain was an honorable dude. And again, that’s a direct account from someone who has no vested interest or a book to sell or anything of that sort.Dick and I worked closely together, one on one. After enough time, after he trusted me, I finally got to ask him about what the hell actually happened. The man had a ton of PTSD — and probably still does — but eventually it became clear that the real story was completely, utterly, unbelievably stupid.Yes, Lehman was doing a bunch of stupid stuff, and the management under Dick were behaving like cowboys. But at the end of the day, that was the entire market at that time. What sunk Lehman was, in the end, a decision by all of the other big banks and the regulators that they’d let Lehman die because of something that might be best summarized as “lol idk sorry Dick but we’re just gonna let you go and let the Fed bail the rest of us out sorry bro lol.” Like really. That’s how it went behind those closed doors in the lairs of the lizards that control the universe. Lehman had already  suffered near-death in 1994 — the world has now forgotten that Dick was the hero that saved the firm back then — and now it was to be made a sacrificial lamb for everyone else’s benefit.Why am I telling you this story? What is the point? Well, what I am trying to say is that these supposed “adults in the room” who are so much smarter and better than the the “retail investors” are pretty much the same sort of immature, self-centered children as the other side. The difference is, they’ve got the regulators  and the politicians in their pockets. So when they say “lol oops” and literally blow up the global economy to save face, nothing happens to them. But for some reason when it’s the retail guys, a moral panic ensues.In my eyes, the Internet-connected retail investor is learning the power of what I call “massively multiplayer liquidity.” Yes, there’s some growing pains, but let’s not kill this wild new phenomenon before we learn what it can do. Because, from what I’ve seen from the other side of things, I doubt these self-styled “retards” will ever end up as depraved and corrupt as the people they’re disrupting.Play ball, kids. And as Dick always used to say, “don’t get left with nothing other than a ham sandwich.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There’s a long history of similar occurrences that follow along a common line: whatever appears to support individual investors will be the path taken by politicians and regulatory bodies.Right now it appears that the public wants to be able to trade on their terms because there is this narrative that the little guy is finally sticking it to the big bad hedge funds. In reality there is probably very little truth to this. However, support for the individual investor plays extremely well which is why you see politicians from both sides joining forces on this issue. A rumor makes it halfway around the world while the truth is still putting its pants on. Nobody is interested in the subtleties around these issues where there almost certainly should be regulations in place or at least warnings from those who do actually know better. But late in bull markets when speculation is running wild those who try to be the voice of reason are run over by the masses until they shut up and go away.Galbraith wrote about this in the 1950’s and if you read his account of the 1929 crash the parallels are eerily similar. Nobody wants to be told they aren’t making money due to skill but because they’re caught up in a dangerous bubble. In the aftermath of a crash when tremendous sums are lost, nobody blames the speculators, they always find another scapegoat- the regulators, the brokerages, the hedge funds- whomever. It doesn’t matter so long as the speculator is held up as a victim. I expect this to end no differently."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Dark patterns are everywhere and I&#39;m afraid not enough people are raising a ruckus about them. For example, the &#34;Google Pay&#34; app in India, which works via the UPI system, shows its own &#34;scanner code&#34; in the app as opposed to the standard UPI QR code. Furthermore, you can&#39;t discover where the UPI QR code is, if you want to pay using BHIM - an app that works directly with UPI payments. If you&#39;re using GPay too, then you can access the scanner code. If not, you used to be able to select the UPI QR code from a menu and scan that. However, later updates have hidden that - not eliminated it, mind you, deliberately hidden that. You have to &#34;swipe left&#34; when you see the GPay scanner code to get to the QR code - not at all a discoverble act. My wife discovered it by accident after we were puzzled a few times about where the QR code that used to be accessible went (both of us use BHIM). As a consequence, folks who use GPay do not know about UPI. This is, in my books, malicious design. Hanlon&#39;s razor would ask me to try &#34;stupidity&#34; first. But no. This isn&#39;t stupidity. It is downright malicious (the benign term being &#34;dark pattern&#34;) to do this .. at least at Google&#39;s level."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s also worth mentioning that the misconception of thinking UX as being solely related to aesthetics is getting dangerously more and more common, even among professionals referring to themselves as UX designers.Aesthetics is important, but, in some sorts of systems, it has much lower priority than other non-functional requirements, like overall speed, maintainability, testability and so on.I don&#39;t know if my experience is the same of most of you, but I&#39;ve seen more and more systems getting aesthetic pleasant but painfully slow and/or buggy these days. It&#39;s easy when you can simply quit using the software, but when your bank, your broker, your airline, your accountant, the company that operates the subway ticket machines, when those sorts of businesses start to embrace such vision, things start to get complicated.And, unfortunately, all those examples I mention here are real and this is not an exhaustive list.Besides, I&#39;m not sure those companies (at least the ones in my examples) do that as an attempt to exploit users. I believe they do that due to plain lack of competence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d actually argue otherwise - UX has gotten tremendously better in the last decade. Online products have been moulded perfectly towards improving the use case for their customers.The main issue though is that you aren&#39;t the customer anymore.Look at Facebook - they&#39;ve done an absolutely incredible job becoming a dream experience for advertisers. Youtube has catered to these advertisers as well and blocked controversial content that wouldn&#39;t look good next to their brand. It&#39;s a golden age to be at the head of a marketing team with a large ad budget. These companies have made golden escalators for getting sponsored content in front of the productized consumers.If you want UX to succeed and become something that benefits you as a user, then you should focus on platforms where you truly are the customer. Look at Square or Patreon - in both platforms you are truly the customer, and their UX is incredible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This has always been my pet peeve with jobs that won&#39;t hire people without &#39;5-7 years experience with X&#39; - the vast majority of these jobs do not need an EXPERT on language x, or framework y. If they do, the rest of this post does not apply.You can learn enough of a language to be dangerous in just a couple weeks. Enough to be productive in 2-3 months. However, there are 3 other things you have to learn:1. How the code for the project you are hired for works. How it&#39;s laid out. All the weird shit about it.2. How the framework/libraries used by the project works. Nothing to do with the project, but maybe you haven&#39;t used Angular, Swing, or Boost before.3. How the data is laid out, and how it gets in/out of your system. What database tables are there, what&#39;s the workflow.Those 3 things are the hard part and what take 6-12 months. Learning Javascript, Ruby, or whatever language is the least of your worries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Glamorous Toolkit (https://gtoolkit.com) by feenk, which embodies the thesis of this blog post, is in my opinion the most exciting working development environment in decades. I think in 5-10 years people will be pointing to it as having a huge impact on the industry.I implore anyone serious about changing how software development works to digest Andrei Chis&#39; thesis Moldable Tools: http://scg.unibe.ch/archive/phd/chis-phd.pdfOnce you understand the consequences of reducing the cost of specialised tool development by orders of magnitude, it becomes obvious that a qualitative change in experience follows, that brings us much closer to what people like Engelbart were searching for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some of us (me, for example :) have to spend multiple weeks a year to draw the design architecture of certain parts of the product. During engineering meetings everybody raised the same question: i commit to new area in product, how can I understand what are the components and how to do certain things? You can ask your colleagues but they might know it as well.So I decided to document main flows and designs in PlantUML diagrams. having these diagrams greatly improved onboarding process, cause you can quickly glance what component does what and what are the dependencies (the code base was in JS, so it is usually quite limited on refactoring/figuring out wtf is going on).But the problem with such approach is: diagram quickly gets out of date. Someone makes the change and the diagram makes no sense at all now. With what I saw in Gtoolkit, you can always query the real source code and build custom dev tools that always produce current and real overview of the system. I would love to have a starter kit for JS projects that you can drag and drop and start building your own tooling for your product."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"FWIW I ran a startup that provided you with a program (single binary) that allowed you to run natural language queries on your database across most schemas. It had a full semantics layers which translated your query into a mixed-lambda calculus-prolog query, which is then translated into SQL as needed - you can see a sample of the semantics layer here: https://youtu.be/fd4EPh2tYrk?t=92.It&#39;s deep learning based with a lot of augmentation. Going from the OP&#39;s article to actually being able to run queries on any schema is quite a bit more work. I&#39;d love to see GPT3 handle arbitrary schemas.p/s: the startup failed. deep research based startups need a lot of funds."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Woah. I never gave it my database schema but it assumes I have a table called &#34;users&#34; (which is accurate) and that there&#39;s a timestamp field called &#34;signup_time&#34; for when a user signed up.I am definitely impressed by the fact that it could get this close without knowledge of the schema, and that you can provide additional context about the schema.  Seems like there is a lot of potential for building a natural language query engine that is hooked up to a database.  I suppose there is always a risk that a user could generate a dangerous query but that could be mitigated.Not related to the article but what exactly is &#34;open&#34; about OpenAI?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a use case where AI-powered SQL is a solution in search of a problem, and introduces more issues than just doing boring SQL. For data analysis, it&#39;s much more important to be accurate than fast, and this article is unclear how many attempts each example query took. GPT-3 does not always output coherent output (even with good prompts), and since not 100% of the output is valid SQL the QA and risk tolerance of bad output affects the economics.OpenAI&#39;s GPT-3 API is expensive enough (especially with heavy prompt engineering) that the time saved may not outweigh the cost, particularly if the output is not 100% accurate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can someone help me understand Robinhood&#39;s POV?  This just seems so outrageous that there must be some sane rationale that I&#39;m not seeing.Why do Robinhood, Reddit, Discord, etc feel like they have to respond to this?  Whether the investments being made are responsible or not, it doesn&#39;t seem like it should be their place to intervene.If the hedge funds over-shorted GME and WSB recognized that and traded against that bad analysis, then that&#39;s great!  If the pendulum swung the other direction and WSB is trading into some momentum, how is that any different than the hedge funds doing the same with shorts?  Why should Robinhood pick a winner (siding against their own customers)?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If they were just blocking margin trading or trades with unlimited risk that would be one thing. But this smacks of either paternalism or trying to manipulate the market. I hope they lose a lot of customers (or product depending on your POV)."</p>

FOSS ideas, open culture ideas. What the world wide web actual is... It&#39;s not even that they disagree, they aren&#39;t even aware.We spent decades fiddling arguments with one another while  events just took their course. Politicians don&#39;t understand or care about any of these ideas. The public doesn&#39;t either. When &#34;something must be done&#34; about this or that... because digital culture progresses to some point, the deep well of ideas that dominated web culture have zero impact.Ultimately, the encryption argument is being had between spooks and tech monopolies. Politicians are bystanders. There is no &#34;freedom of speech&#34; equivalent, no idea of the current technological age to guide them. No flag for the public to rally to.The right to privacy is great, but we can&#39;t just keep arguing by analogy.

The difference this time is that the Council has taken a more subtle approach and avoided explicitly using words like ‘ban’ or ‘backdoor.’ But make no mistake, this is the intention. It’s important that steps are taken now to prevent these proposals going too far and keep European’s rights to privacy intact.”"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;a workable plan that enables more free speech, [...] That approach: build protocols, not platforms.  To be clear, this is an approach that would bring us back to the way the internet used to be. The early internet involved many different protocols—instructions and standards that anyone could then use to build a compatible interface. As I&#39;ve commented before[1][2], discussing protocols and advocating for them is a popular topic but it does not make progress.The real issue is funding and trying to make humans do what they don&#39;t want to do.If HN is overrepresented by vanguards of decentralization and free speech, why are a lot of us here on HN instead of running USENET nodes and posting to a newsgroup such as &#34;comp.programming.hackernews&#34; to avoid being moderated by dang?If most of HN knows how to set up git and stand up a web server, why do most of use Github instead of running Gitlab on a home pc/laptop/RaspberryPi or rent a Digital Ocean vps?It&#39;s because &#34;free &amp; open protocols&#34; weren&#39;t really the issue!A lot of us don&#39;t want to run a USENET node or manage our own git server to share code.[1] the so-called &#34;open&#34; internet of free protocols: 
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20231960[2] free &amp; royalty free protocol like Signal still doesn&#39;t solve the &#34;who pays for running the server&#34; problem:  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20232499"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;After a decade or so of the general sentiment being in favor of the internet and social media as a way to enable more speech and improve the marketplace of ideas, in the last few years the view has shifted dramatically—now it seems that almost no one is happy.&#34;10 or 15 years ago people looked at web 1.0, saw many good communities and valuable conversations and said &#34;we need to protect free speech&#34;.Today people looks at Twitter/Facebook/YouTube/Reddit, see mismanaged cesspools and declare that we need centralized speech control.This is understandable, but highly reactionary and irrational. Speech control is facilitated by big tech at their own discretion. Advocating for more of it means you&#39;re advocating for giving more power to the companies who fucked up the system in the first place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read, and re-read the article and I am yet to understand how a protocol will help what the author describes in the first few paragraphs. (BTW very nicely walked around that hot bowl of mess!)First, Usenet was just as much of a dumpster fire as Reddit et al. in some branches (alt. I am looking at you).  The rest (comp. soc. sci. etc) were heavily self moderated.Second, I am not sure the author is clear on what is the primary product of social media, as I see it. We, the users are the product.  By moving to a protocol, there is little to no opportunity to capture private information about the product. (Not complexity, too big, or filter bubble.)Why would a platform give up such income stream?Am I misunderstanding what the author means by protocol here?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation settles most listed securities transactions in America; in 2011, it did $1.7 quadrillion [1]. You&#39;ve never heard of it unless you&#39;re a professional trader, but it&#39;s actually quite fascinating to read up on.Trading looks instantaneous. But settlement takes a few days. In between are a series of credit agreements. From your broker to you. From the clearinghouse to the brokers. DTCC is the clearinghouse. Robinhood is the broker.There are rules and contracts between DTCC and its members, including Robinhood [2]. Those contracts ensure that when you buy shares through your broker from a Robinhood customer, if Robinhood falls down two days later, there is collateral sufficient to make you whole. Those collateral requirements change in reference to, amongst other things, the volatility of the security. (If a broker falls down, the clearinghouse liquidates their collateral and makes their counterparty whole. More volatility means more chance the collateral will be insufficient.)In this case, collateral requirements on GME went up. Because of its volatility. So while before Robinhood had to pony up collateral for a few shares of GME for every hundred it traded, it now had to, at close of business, pony up one hundred shares&#39; worth of collateral for every hundred it traded. That creates a cash crunch. One that exacerbates itself with every additional trade in the security. If Robinhood fails to satisfy those collateral calls, they go out of business overnight. Into receivership. Done.Most brokers have policies for these situations. Higher brokerage fees for securities on a schedule. Not making shares and cash from trades available until the trade settles, sort of like what banks do for large cheques. But I don&#39;t know if Robinhood is able to do that quickly. So instead they pulled the plug.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depository_Trust_%26_Clearing_...[2] https://www.dtcclearning.com/products-and-services/settlemen..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I suspect this will be lost in the hysterical clamour, but yes, it is in fact true that trading platforms have to worry about systemic risk and their ability to work with certain capital obligations. The idea that this just boils down to some good old boy phoning up RH and asking them to pump GME doesn&#39;t stand up to very much scrunity at all. But such is life- the baseless conspiracy is easier to believe if you don&#39;t spend time understanding how these companies work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The RH apologists are going on long winded explanations about clearing houses (and to some extent there’s elements of “it’s too complex for your little brain”). But even to the extent it’s true, if I put in 5k from my checkings into RH and buy stock, why does Rh need all this liquidity to get orders filled? I understand turning margin accounts off, but that’s it . Past that, at best robinhoods business model is highly flawed , at worst it’s fraudulent. Because ultimately, all the finance whiz bang talk doesn’t change common sense that only allowing trades in one direction is unfair, and is incredibly bad optics when that direct benefits a huge player filled with conflicts of interest. But honestly I think the “robinhood is committing fraud” is being underweighted amongst “serious “ discussion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s been a while since I did this, but last time I transferred shares from one brokerage to another, it took several days.It seems to me that if you are holding GME, the last possible thing you want is being stuck in a position for a while.For this particular case, it might be a better choice is to liquidate your position, cash out and just open another brokerage account. I know this is the total opposite of what the WSBs are looking for but the alternative is transferring a position with $50k and when you can trade again its only worth $500."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi guys, Alex Oshmyansky here, CEO of the Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company. Crazy to see our little project at the top of Hacker News!We&#39;re planning to introduce a lot more drugs with transparent prices later this year, cutting out monopolistic middlemen in the supply chain and alleviating pharma drug shortages, particularly for rare and orphan disease conditions.We are looking for a few devs (fullstack, frontend, and backend). If anybody is interested, drop me a line at alex@costplusdrugs.comIn the meantime, happy to answer questions if anyone is interested!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve wondered for a long time how much money could be saved if the non-trivial administrative overhead of insurance companies were removed from all but truly catastrophic cases (where claims start at $10k or more) and medical, dental, and drug costs were paid out of pocket (including via an HSA account).  There are numerous cases where cash-only medical clinics are able to offer up-front pricing for a fraction of what is billed to medical insurance companies.  If Cuban&#39;s idea is &#34;we don&#39;t do insurance but you&#39;re free to pay with an HSA card or seek reimbursement from your insurance company&#34; then this could be a huge winner."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with drug prices isn&#39;t because of the drug manufacturers, it&#39;s with the middle-men and private insurance companies. At least, that&#39;s what the manufacturers are sayingFor instance, with the manufacturers of insulin, none of them are American and they offer to sell the insulin to everyone at the same price.The problem is that the large insurance companies use just three middle-men drug buyers called Pharmacy Benefits Managers (PBM) who DEMAND growing discounts every year from drug manufacturers, so the drug manufactures have to raise the prices to the US market every year to keep making a profit.Novo Nordisk is willing to sell insulin much cheaper, but the drug buyers demand about a 75% discount off of the wholesale cost or they&#39;ll make the product not covered by the insurance companies they represent. To compensate, they raise the wholesale price in the US so after the forced discounts, they still make the same amount of money.The people who suffer are the ones who don&#39;t have insurance.The solution, at least in the case of insulin, isn&#39;t cheaper prices from the manufacturer, it&#39;s for the US to pass a law that prevents insurance companies from dropping a product based on the refusal to discount the product if it&#39;s under a certain price-per-month.This article seems to cover the finger-pointing between the manufacturers and PBM&#39;s and insurane companies very well: https://www.healthline.com/diabetesmine/pharmacy-benefit-man...?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; These points doubtless make me appear to be a complacent shill for the financial industry, talking down to the rubes. For the record, I’m still angry about the way workers were ripped off in Britain more than three decades ago, and about the way the little guy ended up bearing the brunt for the financial implosions of 2000 and 2008. But it looks horribly to me as though the same thing is going to happen again — and I don’t think the answer to today’s many ills is to empower poor people to bankrupt themselves with margin accounts and derivatives.Who is this hurting, exactly? The author is making it sound like messing up the short stock is somehow hurting &#34;the little guy&#34; in the long run, and I wouldn&#39;t see that happening unless:a) Gamestop is somehow in a bunch of mutual funds tied to employee pensions/401k&#39;sb) The &#34;little guy&#34; refers to the Reddit traders that are making a killing right now, with the expectation that eventually the stock price will crash again.As best I can figure, most of the /r/ guys are doing this as a form of trolling and aren&#39;t expecting to get rich off it or pour their live-savings into it. And again, as best I can figure, the only people this &#34;hurts&#34; are the ones who were originally shorting the stock. So if this comes down to guys on Reddit pissing in Wall Street&#39;s cornflakes, it&#39;s hard for me to feel sympathetic for Wall Street."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Somewhat related. IKEA is the largest owner of forests in Lithuania (around 33% of the total land area is forest):https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1104260/ikea-the-bi...At the time of this article (2019), they owned 66,000 acres of forest in the country."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s none of my business if Ikea wants to buy productive forest land and take it out of production.However, I don&#39;t understand how it is any kind of signal of virtue.Would it be virtuous to buy productive farm land and take it out of circulation?How is forest land any different?In a previous life, it would be broadly correct to say that I worked in the forest industry.  My body still hurts when I think about it.I worked for wood lot owners, felling trees, trimming off the branches, sectioning the logs, splitting the wood and then stacking it to be sold by the cord.  These woodlots had been in operation for over 150 years.  Same land, different trees.  They still operate now.I also worked as a tree planter, hired by small contractors working for &#39;big forest&#39;.  Us tree planters went in after the heavy equipment had ripped out the trees, tearing the land to shreds in the process.  It felt like what ground would have been like after a B-52 strike, an eerie hell scape, but with an explosion of small plants and flowers with new access to the sun, deer and other wildlife roaming free, wondering at the strange human interloper.  Sometimes wolves and bears, at which point it felt rather lonely, me with a Swiss Army knife (mostly for the fork) and my nearest crew mate being well outside shouting distance.The churned up land we were planting had been pulp forest itself for over a hundred years.  As I planted, others were taking soil and water samples.  To the forest company, the forest was a long term asset and that it thrived was in their interest.I didn&#39;t think about it much then, but others long dead had planted that ground before me.  Those foot long trees I planted have long been harvested and new trees planted in their place.Trees are like wheat, or corn, or quinoa.  Except instead of being a once a year crop, trees are once every twenty five years or so.Otherwise, what&#39;s the difference?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not implying that this is corporate propaganda to cater to the US public, but something similar happened to my country where saving the planet is not on the agenda of its citizens since there are other problems that need to be solved first. [1]&#34;IKEA’s goal is to purchase wood which is 100 per cent FSC-certified from these countries. At the same time there are many indications that forests with high conservation values are being logged by FSC-certified companies. FSC-certification is far from a guarantee for socially- and environmentally friendly forestry and FSC has received serious criticism from many environmental organizations, both in Sweden and internationally.  Several environmental organizations have left FSC in protest. &#34; [2]So practically, you have a situation where IKEA acts on some shady rules established by this FCS that are unreliable. Moreover, countries with corrupt officials will eventually end up in prison but too late, before the harm is done. Generally, if as a Romanian I go outside to protest against IKEA and corrupt politicians exploiting the Carpathians, I&#39;m told that I don&#39;t respect private property and that IKEA acts according to the laws of that country (created by corrupt policians with shady lobbies), in the end IKEA becomes the victim.[1] https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ikea-buys-83000-acre-fore...

People who choose to eschew these standard components very frequently end up with a site which is unusable for disabled people.Very few people have the skill to turn a div into an effective button, yet over and over I see web sites with rows of buttons which are in fact just divs with javascript behind them.Making your site accessible isn&#39;t just a good practice, in the US, it is the law.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Made me think of a time I didnt do adequate research before buying an expensive flight ticket: I was in Changi Airport and had a cheap return ticket to Malaysia, when I got back I was going to travel in the east coast of Australia for a few weeks as the end of my study abroad in Asia.
It dawned to me that I never actually checked the Visa rules for Australia, but just pressumed that they would be like any othet commonweath country I had previously visited. Turned out I was lucky and didnt need a paper visa, but could do with an e-visa. 
As my HTC Desire Android phone had died in the humiddity, I only had the cheapest nokia I could find, X-1 ... Armed with a 2011 public internet kiosk of internet explorer, I tabulated through the australian immigration forms and found the correct form, filled it out while my browsing session of the kiosk expired, after a few tries, I knew exactly the way around the static site, and was what some would call &#34;speedrunning&#34; through their website. After sumbitting I just had to hope for the best.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In graduate school, in my lab there was a grad student who was kind of an unlikely &#34;professor&#39;s pet&#34;.  He was tall and had surfer&#39;s long hair with a bit of a hippie aesthetic.  Anyways, he was also really completely clueless about how to do science correctly, but also, I guess, really good about playing politics (there was a time when he asked me to put some bacterial plasmid DNA on my mammalian cells.  I told him &#34;it doesn&#39;t work that way&#34;, but I did it anyways and handed over the cells, and he got the observation he was expecting).  On his main project he was teamed up with a super sketchy foreign postdoc that I was convinced would say anything to get high profile papers out.So they did a series of experiments and reported results that screamed &#34;artefact&#34;.  On one of them, for example, the postdoc got trained to use the electron microscope and they went through thousands and thousands of images to pick out the one that had &#34;just the right morphology&#34; (I am pretty sure they were snapping photos of salt crystals).  On another, they reported that their research subject protein was so fast at the process we were studying that everything occurred IN MIXING TIME.  That to me, screams &#34;you are not doing your experiments carefully&#34;.Meanwhile I was sweating balls working on a very careful preparation of similarly finicky proteins (you agitate them and they do bad things since they&#39;re metastable) and finally got it to produce reproducible results.  I suggested they adapt my preparation to their protein but they couldn&#39;t give a damn, they had already published their paper and had moved on to sexier proteins.But then an intern was put on the project, and she could not reproduce their results, after working on it for six months (she is careful and honest).  At the end, I felt so bad for her, I offered to train her on my technique, but she passed.  I think she was burned out on the project.  I asked if I could get a sample of the protein that she had prepped, and she agreed.I ran the protein through my preparatory technique and observed that there was a contamination that could have seeded the kinetics of their process.  Upon isolating an uncontaminated sample, I carefully but briskly rushed the sample over to the machine.  Nothing.  Curious, I jacked the temperature up to get it going faster.  Nothing.  I left it in the machine overnight.  Nothing.  Finally, convinced that I had likely done something wrong, I dropped the sample in a shaker at temperature, came back the next day and recorded amazingly high signal.  In short, the observation that it was &#34;super fast&#34; was entirely an artefact.As I, too, was trained on the Electron Microscope, I quickly spotted my sample onto an EM disc, reserved some time and hopped on the &#39;scope.  The first grid sector I looked at, there was literally TEXTBOOK morphology in front of my eyes.I stapled together my results, gave it to the grad student, and told him that the general gist of his paper was probably still correct, but that he should be careful about characterizing his protein as exceptional.  I then said it was in his hands to do the right thing.What do you think he did?  Nothing, of course.  He kept on the talks circuit, still talking about how exceptional his discovery was, and to date there have been no retractions.  He even won the NIH grad student of the year award.The epilog is that after a decade of floundering I realized that even though I am pretty good at science, I was no good at playing academic politics and quit the pursuit; I drove for lyft/uber for a bit, and now I&#39;m a backend dev.  I am certain that my experiences are not unique.  Amazingly the intern returned to our lab, and had her own three-year stint chasing ghosts that turned out to be overoptimistic interpretation of results reported by a postdoc.Oh.  What happened to the grad student?  He&#39;s a professor in the genomics department at UW."</p>

This is the first time netizens capitalize on hedge fund short favorites and it has been surprisingly easy to cause an absolute catastrophy in the order of billion losses for them. I heard Melvin Capital may even have gone bankrupt?And how to do it? You get people to invest in a stock that is expected by the industry to go belly up. Seriously. It&#39;s that easy. It&#39;s not illegal. It&#39;s so easy that even semiprofessionals can understand exactly which stock are hedge fund favorites. It&#39;s not hard information to come by. And, here&#39;s the kicker: There is a potential monetary reward if you enter and exit a stock at the right moment.So it&#39;s simple to discover and execute, and there is a financial incentive, and it&#39;s not against the law. This is a trifecta of properties that makes this very interesting to follow indeed.I just saw this article too: As hedge funds try to cover losses, the rings are now spreading over the market: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-26/hedge-fun...The author speculates that this might even ultimately trigger a market correction."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was addicted to Twitter in high school. I spent hours on it at night, getting no sleep. I spent so much time and mental bandwidth thinking of funny things to say or memes to make to get more likes. I was addicted to the likes and keeping up with everyone I knew.First semester of college, I stopped using Twitter. My sleep got better, I had more free time, and I was noticeably happier and freer. I no longer spent time in that dopamine cycle.I&#39;ve been weening off of Reddit and HN the past few months as well. YouTube is my next beast to conquer, and that might be the biggest one for me right now. I&#39;m trying to adapt to longer form content again, instead of only watching videos under a minute or reading 280 character tweets.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Aside: I&#39;ve heard about web platform tests, but I never realized that it could be a viable alternative to MDN for representing browser compatibility information. In this case they have a pretty good collection of tests [1] that give you a picture of overall WebRTC compatibility. Of course MDN is still the gold standard and we on web.dev will always link there as our default choice when they do a good job representing browser compatibility data, but in this case they don&#39;t seem to have a good table representing the state of WebRTC at large [2] (happy to update the article if it&#39;s just an oversight on my part and they do have a good browser compat table somewhere that I missed). Specifically, it seems like the WebRTC API page [3] should have a list of the browser compatibility of each of the interfaces that are mentioned on the page.[1] https://wpt.fyi/results/webrtc?label=experimental&amp;label=mast...[2] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API[3] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_APIDisclosure: I edited the web.dev announcement"</p>

And the fun of iOS background modes while getting an incoming call. Of course the Google examples were all broken in their own little devious way. And there is really jack shit on WebRTC on the web, seems like everybody that figured it out just said &#34;fuck it I&#39;m not giving away this for free&#34; after spending possibly months to get it working.Though some people here seem to complain about no audio or no video...I have to say once we got it working it kept working.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Even if you don’t find the tool useful, the implementation under the hood is very clever. The dependency graph between the jobs is stored as a bunch of live processes flock()ing on each other’s log files. Once the files are unlocked, the process execs the requested job. This makes the scheduling and error handling code much simpler. Also, right now the dependency graph is dense (a job depends on all previous jobs) but it would be straightforward to thin it out to allow parallel jobs.Overall, a clever trick I intend to steal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The AIX print spooler can be used as a generic queueing system - I remember setting up queues with shells as backends. Jobs sent to those queues would then be executed in sequence, and could be cancelled/reprioritized/etc like any print job.Can&#39;t claim any credit for the idea though, it was actually suggested in the documentation...It might be possible on other unix systems too, but I never had to try it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the opinion of a last semester CS student who has never written an application from scratch that needed more than a SQLite DB (so take me with a half grain of salt), it seems like premature optimization, while always talked about, is very common. I see people talking about using Kubernetes for internal applications and I just can&#39;t figure out why. If it&#39;s a hobby project and you want to learn Kubernetes, that&#39;s a different situation, but in the case of making a real application that people will use, it seems like a lot of us can get away with a single DB, a few workers of our app, and maybe a cache.I&#39;m speaking out of little experience though. I just think that a lot of us can get away with traditional vertical scaling and not think too much about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The assertion that PostgreSQL can handle dozens of TB of data needs to be qualified, as this is definitely not the case in some surprising and unexpected cases that are rarely talked about.PostgreSQL&#39;s statistics collection, which is used by the query planner, doesn&#39;t scale with storage size. For some ordinary data distributions at scale, the statistical model won&#39;t reflect any kind of reality and therefore can produce pathological query plans. It is quite difficult to get around this scaling behavior. Consequently, I&#39;ve moved away from using PostgreSQL for data models with distributions such that these query planner limitations will occur. These pathologies occur well before the &#34;dozens of TB&#34; range.The statistics collector is not a scalable design generally, but that is another matter. In its current state it does not degrade gracefully with scale."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The difficulty with this advice is that it assumes that you have many small transactions.Yes, of course, you should try to build your application so queries and transactions are very short. That solves a great many problems.But sometimes you can&#39;t. Sometimes you just have to do joins across large tables. There just isn&#39;t any other way. Your query is going to run for 5, 10, maybe 30 seconds. That&#39;s a huge burden on your server, and it will slow down the other tenants. In that case, the only answer is to distribute the queries across other boxes.I agree with the advice in general -- delay moving to a distributed system as long as possible -- but sometimes you just can&#39;t."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I appreciate the author&#39;s framing of &#34;transaction costs.&#34;  These costs are often hidden.It seems that as systems scale (in size) they tend to become inherently lower-trust. Consider a physician who makes house calls (not uncommon as recently as a few generations ago, and certainly not incompatible with modern medicine) and a large medical system such as Kaiser Permanente or NHS.The economic benefits of the larger-scale system are obvious, and are directly measured, but the economic detriment due to increased transaction costs (derived from decreased trust) are neither obvious nor readily measurable.Upsides of systems at scale can still outweigh downsides, and often do, but I suspect many industrial systems have a maximum scale above which efficiency gains lose out to, in this author&#39;s framing, transaction costs.This abuts certain natural &#34;borders&#34; for system growth, such as national (or in the case of EU, common market) boundaries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This applies to the workplace too, not just society at large. That&#39;s why if I&#39;m ever at a company where I feel like I am mistrusted, or I mistrust the people I work with, I do what I can to leave. Not only is it an unpleasant environment to work in, but it feels predictive of failure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve spent a lot of years overseas, in third-world or developing countries, often torn by tribal or civil war, or other natural and man-made disasters. I have come to realize how foundational trust is in a functioning economy and self-governing society.  We in G8 nations often don&#39;t see it, like fish not thinking about water.  I&#39;ve been extremely concerned with the efforts of sub-groups in our societies  attacking the foundations of trust.  It&#39;s like watching people, on a boat at sea, tear up the hull for firewood...  The irony is that the basic nature of people (the world over) really hasn&#39;t changed: people are msotly good and want to live in a healthy community.  But culture, context, and experience can overrule those tendencies."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The cost, however, is steep — the list, or wholesale, price is $3,960 a month, or more than $47,500 a year. The list price for the one-time initiation dose is $5,490.Median income in the US is ~$31K apparently. So even in a rich country, this is like 50% more than the income of a typical person.My understanding is the funding for the trials was partly from NIAID. This seems like yet another case where public funds are used for research, but a company ends up with the ability to dictate pricing.I&#39;m glad that this works and that there is another, more convenient and effective treatment option. But shouldn&#39;t we have some setup where if tax dollars pay for the research, the government should own a share of the IP commensurate with their funding level, and should then be able to have some say in pricing?Or, if you think that the government itself shouldn&#39;t own IP for a product on the market, can we create an independent non-profit which receives ownership, and whose charter aligns with actually treating as many people as possible?I&#39;m not saying that when real, innovative work happens, pharmaceutical companies shouldn&#39;t get some meaningful return on the money they put in. But when the public supports the work, we shouldn&#39;t get nothing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have always heard that Truvada (prep) was extremely effective at preventing HIV infection. These new injectables are reported by the article to be 89% and 66% more effective at preventing transmission.What is this based on? Was I misinformed about Truvada&#39;s effectiveness? Is this a decrease in an already very low chance of transmission? Or is this in comparison to people forgetting to take their daily pills vs a shot that a health care provider had record of administering?It&#39;s currently common in the gay community for sexually active, healthy people to take Truvada proactively to protect against HIV because it&#39;s understood to be even more effective than condoms. If there is a better option or if the current option is not as effective as widely believed then standard of care should change."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who is in this high-risk community: good news.(Well, except for that price tag.)People, to a first approximation, are just terrible at pill compliance. Doesn’t matter the demographics, people just aren’t perfect at taking a pill, every day, at the same time, forever and ever. Having that injection where you can set it and forget it? Nice advance. Not game-changing, but still a nice move forward.And I think it’ll be a bigger move forward for people who are at high risk of HIV, but also have not great access to medical care where they live. If you…oh boy, here I go, potentially getting into trouble. Non-white and/or non-affluent communities tend to come down much harder on homosexuality. It is much more discreet to get a periodic shot than heading to Walgreen’s and bringing home a bottle full of blue pills. It’s safer. It’s a bit more private."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This brings back the memories. Another true story to add to this one. I (like many Sun cohorts) loved the burritos at La Costeña market, and we had adopted the FAX trick from Adobe.Then along came the &#34;Distributed Objects Everywhere&#34; project (which invented CORBA) and they wanted an example application so they created &#34;BurritoTool&#34; which used CORBA to find the server that was connected to the fax line, and a nice WYSIWYG window to select your burrito condiments. Everyone loved it, it was a great tool and we all used it.Then one day we show up and they tell us they have turned off their fax machine. We asked why, and they show us faxes for burrito orders that started coming in at 6AM and went non-stop until they turned it off. Some seemed legit but many were clearly not from someone who knew the place.We go back to the office and do some snooping and see a bunch of requests to the burrito server in the wee hours before anyone is at work. We trace the IP address to a hotel in New York city. We call the Hotel and as it turns out Sun Sales is hosting an event and one of the things they are showing off at the &#34;pavilion&#34; is our cool distributed object technology. And using Burritotool! But CORBA has done its job and when it hadn&#39;t been told there was a local burrito server it sent packets back to HQ and found the one in the systems group lab. Starting at 9AM eastern and going all morning long, people had been making random burrito orders as part of the demo code!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related: Sun had a demo for NeWS (fancy desktop display system) called PizzaTool.  Don Hopkins did a writeup: https://medium.com/@donhopkins/the-story-of-sun-microsystems...(One question: that writeup says Solaris 2, but I think I might&#39;ve used PizzaTool under OpenWindows 2.0 on SunOS 4.1.1 on sun4c.)Inspired by PizzaTool at the time, but my employer having a gazillion dollars of workstations and servers, yet none with a fax card (and my group having daily ad hoc lunch outings), I wrote LunchTool for the Suns.  It was a GUI with a database of local lunch places, which someone could choose to decide on a lunch location and time and such, then print a fancy announcement sign to hang where everyone would see it.  (Not everyone checked email, and I liked typesetting and programming PostScript anyway.)  I was most proud of the bitmap burger icon.When Google first solicited third-party apps for Android (it might&#39;ve been a contest?), I almost stole the idea of PizzaTool, since it still seemed like a fun idea, as a gimmick or experience.  Not that one really needed to see composited pineapple bits, to know whether they wanted it on their real-world pizza, but I thought the visual made adding toppings fun, and not a bad early demo for Android."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"compare this nearly 30 year old script with the absolute red hot hell of trying to order anything at all through toast,caviar,grub hub,uber eats or postmates and you&#39;ll want to check out the latest RCS and build it on X86 before the end of the day.im serious.  compared to the relatively clean, coherent and transparent burrito script, the dumpster fire that constitutes modern online ordering is an unforgiveable travesty.again this is not delivery...no gig shit this is just simple pickup n go we&#39;re trying to do here but at the end of the byzantine transaction you make on a vendors website you&#39;ve opted into a dozen mailing lists and you&#39;re getting menus and direct mailers from any and every local and non-local restaurant and bar...complete with mailers from the goddamn platform itself shilling you to either get in your car and play delivery drone or sign up for endless datamining.and hell, you might not even be ordering from the restaurant itself.  most of these platforms set up the virtual equivalent of a pop up tent in front of the business.  If nothing else, this script has pushed me to reconsider email-to-fax orders to the handful of small local restaurants in the neighborhood."</p>

So I had to educate my customer employees how to log in to Play Store and install my app. The additional benefit was that people had security updates of Chrome and other apps.Two months ago my app was suspended after I made all necessary changes to support Android 10. The Gbot claims that background location updates aren&#39;t essential for my app. As you may guess I wrote appeal without success. My customers pay mainly for that time report feature but Gbot knows better what my paying customers want.And I just do not care about securing my customer devices and Play Store any longer. Now I distribute apk files again and train people how to install apk files from unknown sources."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Time to go back to distributing direct apk files and setting up self-hosted stores to manage updates.The Play Store was supposed to be only an interface for searching and installing packages, like aptitude or yum.Then it started taking arbitrary decisions &#34;for the benefit of the users&#34; (of course, Google always knows what&#39;s best for its users, even more than the users themselves).Then, like the guy who loves the smells of his own farts even when everybody around him disagrees, they decided that their process was indeed so good that it could have been completely automated, with almost no human touch and no possibility for developers and users to appeal.And now it ended up being this Kafka novel where you&#39;re stuck in the gears of the process and you don&#39;t know why, nor when a real human will actually take a look at your case.And, in the meantime, you lose traffic and users, but Google doesn&#39;t seem to care.Time to start boycotting the Play Store. There&#39;s plenty of alternative stores, it&#39;s easy to set up one yourself for your apps, and you can always distribute your apk files through your website."</p>

					<h3><a href="https://pgm.di.unipi.it/">PGM Indexes: Learned indexes that match B-tree performance with 83x less space</a></h3>
				</div>
				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25899286">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some context: A few years ago, there was a paper from Google (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3183713.3196909) that made learned data structures popular for a while. They started from the idea that indexes such as B-trees approximate an increasing function with one-sided error. By using that perspective and allowing two-sided error, they were able to make the index very small (and consequently quite fast).Many data structure researchers got interested in the idea and developed a number of improvements. The PGM-index is one of those. Its main idea is to use piecewise linear approximations (that can be built in a single quick pass over the data) instead of the machine learning black box the Google paper was using."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a major practical advance from the succinct data structure community.This community has produced so many brilliant results in the past years. But, they work in the shadows. Since the rise of interest in neural network methods, I&#39;ve often described their work as &#34;machine learning where epsilon goes to 0.&#34; It&#39;s not sexy, but it is extremely useful.For instance, Ferragina previously helped to develop the FM-index that enabled the sequence alignment algorithms used for the primary analysis of short genomic reads (100-250bp). These tools were simply transformative, because they reduced the amount of memory required to write genome mappers by orders of magnitude, allowing the construction of full-text indexes of the genome on what was then (~2009) commodity hardware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t get it. I&#39;ve implemented B-trees. The majority of space the used by a B-tree is the data itself. Each N-ary leaf of the tree is a basically a vector of data with maybe some bookkeeping at the ends. The leaves are more than half of the tree.Sure, you can compress the data. But that depends on the data, completely random data can&#39;t be compress. Other data can be. But a point blank 83x space claim seems bizarre - or it&#39;s comparing to a very inefficient implementation of a B-tree.Edit: It seems the 83x claim is a product of the HN submission. I could not find it on the page. But even the page should say something like &#34;a compressed index that allows full speed look-up&#34; (akin to succinct data structures) and then it would make sense."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ask yourself, how much brighter is it outside than inside (assuming a sunny day vs a brightly lit office)?Before looking into this, I would have guessed 2X or 3X, but would you believe it&#39;s actually over 100X!I bet most people&#39;s guess would also be off by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude.Even outdoors in the shade, it is over 50X brighter than indoors.(For specific numbers and comparisons, see: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6656201/ )Apparently, our eyes adjust so quickly to the difference that we have a very poor sense of the magnitude of light change between indoors and outdoors.I bring this up because one of the largest factors in myopia development appears to be outdoor light exposure in childhood.Genetics are likely a factor too, but light exposure seems to have a huge effect: 
&#34;The prevalence of myopia in 6- and 7-year-old children of Chinese ethnicity was significantly lower in Sydney (3.3%) than in Singapore (29.1%), while patterns of daily outdoor light exposure showed that children living in Singapore were exposed to significantly less daily outdoor light than Australian children.&#34; (from the same study linked above)The obvious takeaway for parents, schools, and governments: ensure your children have plenty of outdoor playtime. It will greatly reduce instances of myopia (not to mention the benefits from higher Vitamin D levels, exercise, etc)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Off on a complete tangent here, only remotely related.Yo, fellow four-eyed geeks.I noticed that when lying down and looking up in a room with a light source, with my glasses on, if there is a small droplet of water on the lens (say, due to having just cleaned the glasses and not wicked up every last drop), this droplet can bend the light in such a way that when it subsequently hits the cornea and pupa, a perfectly straight, parallel beam of light passes through the vitreous humor right to the retina.The consequence of this is that all the junk floating in your eye is rendered in &#34;4K clarity&#34; in a circle of light, regardless of whether it is next to the retina, or floating somewhere in the middle.Imperfections in your cornea or elsewhere are also rendered, making themselves evident."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ken White has been talking about the potential for this suit for a couple weeks now. He spends a lot of time talking about what isn&#39;t defamation --- people use defamation suits and threats thereof to chill free speech, and he&#39;s a 1st Amendment guy --- but the Dominion cases are apparently examples of very serious defamation cases.The core of defamation is (1) a false statement of purported fact that (2) causes damage (there are some exceptions to (2) that aren&#39;t relevant here). Most defamation cases you hear about fall apart on (1) - they target non-falsifiable statements of opinion, which can&#39;t be defamation because they don&#39;t purport to relate an objective fact. What makes Dominion&#39;s cases terrifying is that they are chock full of purported facts, all of which are batshit, and have so devastated Dominion&#39;s reputation, in a reputation-intensive business, that it had to hire private security to protect its employees from death threats.What makes the case challenging for Dominion is that they will almost certainly be treated as a public figure for the purposes of the case. The standard for defamation of a public figure is higher than that of a normal person; we add a condition (3): actual malice or negligence, meaning Dominion must show that Giuliani either intended to destroy Dominion&#39;s reputation by spreading facts he knew to be false, or that he was at least negligent, acting with reckless disregard for the truth.The problem is that it&#39;s not totally clear whether Giuliani believed any of his crazy-talk. It may actually be the case that Giuliani is just off his rocker. If he himself was sold by the (false) facts he received from others, he is a more difficult defamation target.Here&#39;s attorney Akiva Cohen analyzing the case a bit:https://twitter.com/AkivaMCohen/status/1353700596407283721"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a superb set of resources for anyone interested in the history of computing in the 80s and 90s. I&#39;d go so far as to say it&#39;s great even if you don&#39;t intend to watch the show (although you should!). I wish this had existed back when I was teaching history of technology.One of the best decisions the show made was to set the series at a series of fictitious minor companies and startups struggling down there in the trenches of the computer revolution without ever quite making it big. This avoids the trap of teleology and gives you a sense of how things could easily have turned out differently. It is why the show is so much better as both computing history and drama than all those films about Apple or Steve Jobs and the rest that tediously rehash the same stories of the winners. (Although one of the main characters, Joe Macmillan, has some Jobs-like character features. I do not mean this as a compliment.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve probably said this before, but I was a computer engineer in Texas in the 80s and this show captures that culture perfectly.* I first learned &#34;Halt and Catch Fire&#34; as an obscure illegal instruction on the 6800 processor that would lock it up. When I heard about this show my first reaction was &#34;How dare they title a show with a meme from an obscure part of my hindbrain! Guess I can&#39;t use that for a password any more.&#34;*Well almost perfectly. I don&#39;t remember many engineers or coders being as attractive as the actors on this show."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The strange thing is that the “instruction” Halt and Catch Fire originated in a joke System/360 “green card” (reference summary) from the 1960s, along with Rewind and Break Tape, Execute (or Punch) Operator, and many others I&#39;ve long since forgotten. Reference is sometimes made to an undocumented Motorola 6800 instruction, but the term is from the Big Iron era, and has nothing to do with personal computing. It&#39;s really from the &#34;Blinkenlichts&#34; era, when people commonly put up cartoons in the machine room showing a floating-point adder as a snake in a birdbath.By the way, Big Iron&#39;s abilities in the physical world were real. I occasionally operated a System/360 with 4 2311 disk drives, 7.5MB monsters with the form factor of washing machines. When running the IBM sort program, these clunkers were apt to move around the machine room."</p>

The aim is to stimulate demand to develop an industry. Large cities also banned motorbikes and scooters, with the same aim.This is no way market driven demand, BYD is a very interesting company to look into. It is my understanding that Warren buffet has a large share in this company.My believe is China sees oil dependence as a long term strategic weakness. In the event of a navel blockade it will be much harder for them to get the oil they need to run the economy. If a large part of the consumer sector is driven by electric powered by local sources (coal, hydro, nuclear) they can keep the logistic channels open. As a side benefit they get to fund a sector hoping to have the same success as they did with solar panels.The article might have pointed this out but it was paid past a certain point on my device."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been 100% remote and run remote teams since 2014 and I promise that it won&#39;t stick for the broader society. Here&#39;s why:1. Socializing is the primary activity that happens at work for the vast majority of workers. The gal or guy coming by your desk to &#34;check in&#34; or &#34;see how your weekend was&#34; etc... is literally where they find their social outlets and personal connections.2. Managers like to be able to watch their direct reports because it makes them feel more in control than they are3. The commuting routine, even if it&#39;s a nightmare, offers a sense of normalcy that most people have gotten used to and in a weird way rely on for grounding.4. For a huge swath of Americans at least, work is an escape from the drudgery of the home.To truly work from home 100% of the time you have to be a master at controlling yourself and your ability to be distracted. Most people don&#39;t have this control and need a framework to insert themselves into. Add to that the contextual dimension of an &#34;other&#34; place that is a world apart from your home life and you have something that allows for a depressurization for most people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a little disappointed at the percentage of comments which extrapolate personal anecdotes into societal behavior, and without addressing the data in this study - even to poke holes in the methodology, which is totally fair game (though IMO quite good, especially for what they had to work with).The whole point of a 15,000-person survey like this is so that we&#39;re not all stuck guessing based on our own experiences. Obviously one can argue that what employers were telling employees they would do post-COVID as of October 2020 is not what employers will actually do (and give reasons why!), but it&#39;s still likely to be more accurate than any individual&#39;s speculation (including mine!).In particular, the survey addressed 2 topics that a lot of comments seem to not incorporate:1. At population, employer, and individual level, it&#39;s not either/or. The paper title doesn&#39;t do a good job of conveying this. All 3 entities seem open to everything on the continuum, based on their employees, work type, and so on.Statements like &#34;I promise that it won&#39;t stick for the broader society&#34; imply a more binary outcome than the survey results predict (and maybe than anything predicts). The survey concludes that, of the roughly 50% of employees who can work from home, they&#39;ll average 2 days per week (or 23% of total hours worked). IOW, WFH doesn&#39;t need to move everyone all the time in order to have massive effects. Some people changing some of the time is enough.2. Employer plans vs. employee desires. Lots of commenters state their preferences and then try to generalize from that, but.. the survey captured that too. To just skim those results, scroll to page 60 for employee-desired vs. employer-planned % of working days. Gist: if WFH is roughly the same productivity, employers plan ~22% of days and employees desire ~45% of days to be WFH. In all productivity cases, employees preferred a higher % of days to be WFH than employers.Page 43 shows answers to the pay raise or cut employees would take in order to work from home 2-3 days per week.It also breaks down the change in perception about WFH by demographic cohort on page 55. For example, those with no children and those with children at home both had significant improvements in their perception of WFH. Those with children had more improvement in perception than those without children. As the study wrote: &#34;This 23 percent figure [post-COVID WFH as a % of full time days] is almost five times larger than in the pre-pandemic time use data, but still half as large as what workers want in a post-pandemic world.&#34;Of course, there&#39;s a place for speculation and anecdotes. This paper - and hopefully soon, more studies like it - should let us evolve from speculating based on only our personal experience to thinking about its methodology and results."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is ironic coming from Stanford, who is currently fucking up every single aspect of their handling of covid, as many Stanford students will attest to. Colleges are basically scammers at this point. The whole benefit of going to college is being able to meet like-minded smart, young people like yourself. Remote college isn&#39;t a thing and never will be. College is about people, as much as it is about learning. The unfortunate K-12 and college students are learning this the hard way.Personally, I don&#39;t think that remote is here to stay. I think working will be augmented by remote tools, but it cannot be replaced by remote. Humans just aren&#39;t robots and they need community, and work is the biggest source of community after college. To me, online college is a complete joke and is not what students after high school need. It&#39;s just not healthy.  Humans need interaction in person, and they do their best work when they are working with people who they see on a weekly basis, especially young 20-somethings.This whole thing is becoming evident as people are starting to really just not care for the lockdowns at this point. Parks in SF are a complete shitshow because people want to be out and about. You will never be able to force them to be purely remote, and after covid, if your company is purely remote, you will not attract the best young talent, period. You might attract older folks, but you know you want young talent.This whole thing makes no sense."</p>

They move towards the same area and shut down their phones.2. They look at suspect phone going dark anywhere around the time of the incident.3.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something particularly concerning about this incident is buried further down in the article.Under the heading &#34;Why Facebook Doesn&#39;t Ban Everyone&#34;, Lincoln explains how social network theory can identify individuals in networks that are influential. This isn&#39;t an exaggeration - basic graph heuristics (such as comparing in/out degree of an individual relative to other parts of the social graph) can easily identify such individuals. Censoring those individuals can have an amplified effect on the graph structure as a whole.For an example of how just a few individuals can make a big difference on graph structure, check out Watts &amp; Strogatz&#39;s 1998 paper, Collective dynamics of &#39;small-world&#39; networks [0][1]. I&#39;d highly recommend reading it - it&#39;s very short and easy to understand.Essentially, a small number of connectors connecting with random individuals can seriously reduce the average number of steps to connect any two individuals. If Facebook wanted to stop the spread of a narrative that they didn&#39;t like, censoring just these few individuals would make it much harder for information to flow through the graph as a whole, and hardly anyone would notice (since Facebook&#39;s only censoring a few people.)Scary.[0]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts–Strogatz_model[1]: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9623998/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think FB has a fundamental issue here, which is that:1) they don&#39;t feel they can NOT police content2) they are wayyyyy too big to police content manually3) any AI they train to police content, is not going to be able to state clearly why a given post/account was banned, and anyway...4) if you state objective, clear rules that are automated, it will be pretty easy to game them (e.g. using euphemisms or code words for objectionable content)I don&#39;t see how FB can get out of this situation.  Any social network that is as large as it is, which relies on advertising (and thus cannot be as content-neutral as e.g. phone companies are regarding what you talk about on the phone), is going to face the same situation.Of course, if FB ends up getting way smaller as a result, that would be fine by me.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Stress resilience is one of the most important things when it comes to knowledge work, also one of the most neglected aspect. Mindfulness, stoicism, exercise help, but nothing helps as much as a good night sleep. Also the other thing people usually fail to note is the vicious stress-sleep cycle (lack of sleep induced stress &lt;-&gt; stress induced lack of sleep). It took me years to realize that so much of my problems with bedtime revenge, burnout, non-clinical depression, permastress was basically just lack of quality sleep. FWIW, it helps to think of productivity in terms of sleep and stress when you are working in the knowledge economy. Just like sleep debt, you can also accumulate productivity debt due to lack of stress resilience, lack of sleep, which can eventually lead to things like burnout."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had great success picking up a consistent meditation habit with the greasing the groove-approach[1].. in essence, every time I would feel a bit foggy in the head, I would take a 3-15 minute meditation session. It usually results to 3-5 sessions per day. It&#39;s such a great mental reset, and I haven&#39;t since experienced the kind of complete depletion that you get from pushing yourself hard through the day.I bet some Zen master would reprimand me for this being the wrong approach, but I found it quite difficult to get into the habit of doing, say, a single 30-60 minute session per day. Now I can consistently drop into the meditation session with no urge for procrastination and have also successfully experimented with longer ones.[1] refers to the method of increasing your pull-up capability by installing a pull-up bar in your office / bedroom doorway and doing a set every time you pass through the doorway"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many of us are wearing devices with continuous optical heart rate monitors. Heart rate variability at rest is one of the best indicators of stress and these devices are pretty good at estimating sleep duration and sleep cycles.Regulators need to recognize that continuous tracking devices are a new tool for establishing a health baseline and they should not be expected to match the performance of single-test medical devices. Apple, Garmin, and Fitbit need to build standards to share this baseline data with medical professionals and offer analytics to determine when changes occur.Questionnaire based medicine seems backwards given the digital tools available."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"WhatsApp worldwide usage is estimated to be more than 2B+ users. Even if this article is accurate, it doesn’t really mean much. In the HN bubble lots of people have migrated to Signal with all of their contacts but outside of that bubble nothing much seems to be happening. Note that I’m not agreeing with these changes, I’m just observing reality.To put things into perspective, let’s assume that 25M users (as stated in the article) actually moved to Telegram - which I use and like by the way. Let’s assume they fully moved and stopped using WhatsApp (very unlikely). That means less than 1.25% users moved to another platform - and this means assuming many things that aren’t probably real.It reminds me a bit of the articles about DuckDuckGo vs Google where many people think big changes in usage are happening while ignoring that the average Joe will keep using whatever it’s using unless there’s way too much trouble to continue using it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I understand why FB needs to do this, but the execution was so out of touch it&#39;s bizarre. My elderly parents called me and were alarmed that WhatsApp is threatening with removing their account unless they agree to share their data. They wondered if FB will be able to track their transactions or perhaps even get into their bank accounts. After years in the tech industry, I&#39;ve learned that my parents&#39; feedback is a good predictor for how well my messaging will be perceived by the wider world. I would have assumed that at FB they would do something similar (or rather, that their testing is 100x more sophisticated), so it&#39;s bizarre that they would miss the mark with messaging and with their prediction of overall success when it came to something so strategically important and sensitive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not even a visible dent.Here, in India if you mention SMS you get weird looks even from people who crossed their youth using SMS. Communication is WhatsApp here.My physiotherapist, my doctor&#39;s nurse (who handles my appointment) they all function on WhatsApp, and no, they are even going to try Signal. Grocers, delivery people — it goes on. My bank and credit card relationship managers communicate with me on WhatsApp. They are never &#34;migrating to&#34; Signal.I am the only one among my contacts who will be moving away from WhatsApp — everyone else (among my people who are using Signal sparsely or actively as of now) have WhatsApp installed and will keep it.Most of my recent Signal convert contacts have already started replying on Signal after hours or days, some have uninstalled. Most of those people will soon uninstall it is what I expect. Unless Signal brings social features that makes these people experience FOMO of broadcasting their lives on one more network :)Penetration of Signal in real world is way too different from what it &#34;feels&#34; here on HN."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For any non-Brits, the SWP is the main left of Labour party in Britain. As a student in the 80s I remember them as an earnest, way too serious bunch of ideological zombies ranting into microphones at the Student&#39;s Union about the latest crimes against humanity perpetrated by &#39;Thatcher&#39;. They&#39;re the kind of people that come up to you in the street with leaflets about some atrocity in Africa and shout &#34;Would you murder children&#34; at you. I&#39;m not entirely sure they&#39;d recognise what an actual &#39;Worker&#39; was if they met one. I always found them quite comical.However they are a serious party, they&#39;re a highly motivated  and active movement with significant influence in the Labour Party grass roots. They&#39;re sort of our equivalent of Antifa in that they are a significant organising presence in lefty street protests, but much more politically active and spend a lot of time in conferences and action committees wondering what Capitalism ever did for us.Importantly, they are in no way shape or form a terrorist or criminal organisation. I would not be at all surprised if some ultra-violent or would-be Red Army Faction types joined or associated with them, but that&#39;s not at all who the SWP are as an organisation. They&#39;re the well meaning, impressionable white middle class girl next door with a class guilt complex and a side shave that&#39;s been going to BLM protests.If they are getting banned by Facebook something has gone horribly wrong. Quite possibly some of them got a bit excited and posted things they shouldn&#39;t, so I&#39;m not saying this is for sure Facebook&#39;s fault, but they&#39;re not about to murder any bobbies in Parliament Square."</p>

I don&#39;t know for sure, but I suspect they had millions of followers on Facebook. This isn&#39;t some fringe, extremist group by any sane interpretation of those terms.It seems we&#39;re now quickly moving on from just censoring those with extremist political views to simply censoring anyone who who dares express a non-establishment political view online."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a positive thing for these ejections to be across the political spectrum, because it makes the demand for distributed moderation come from across the political spectrum.I hope that demand congeals on support for an open blogging protocol, such that people can very easily post once and direct it to multiple platforms or any listener. If this becomes popular enough, and posts aren&#39;t owned by a particular platform, the big platforms lose their power to control the conversation."</p>

[1] It’s a rather brilliant indie documentary about the 1992 (Bill Clinton / HW Bush) election based on a fascinating technological element: back then, Satellite TV feeds would often just keep running during commercial breaks, or warmups.So the director recorded a TON of footage from these moments where the politicians and news anchors acted themselves, seemingly unaware that anyone was watching.The segments with Larry King are, um, memorable. Very candid moments.1: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(1995_film)"</p>

My fantasy would be to have SpaceX move it into the Lunar L1 Lagrange point which would keep it in use but it would have to deal with more cosmic rays, also station keeping would be an issue unless we could really get energized tether station keeping to work (lots of solar energy to provide power, but not a lot of mass to provide thrust, so tethers are energized conductors that push against the Earth&#39;s magnetic field)Parking it in L4 or L5 could keep it for future generations but it would be even more of a challenge to go visit."</p>

Every single bullet point, 10/10.Okay, okay, actually I have one qualm~&gt; Standups are actually useful for keeping an eye on the newbies.Unfair. Standups are useful for communication between a team in general, if kept brief. If senior engineer X is working on Y and other engineer M has already dealt with Y (unbeknowst to X), it&#39;s a great chance for X to say &#34;I&#39;m currently looking for a solution to Y&#34; and for M to say &#34;Oh I had to solve that same problem last month!&#34;Seniority has nothing to do with this. Communication/coordination/knowledge-sharing matter at all levels."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Designing scalable systems when you don&#39;t need to makes you a bad engineer.&gt; In general, RDBMS &gt; NoSqlThese two bullet points resonate with me so much right now. I&#39;m a consultant and a lot of my client absolutely insist on using DynamoDB for everything. I&#39;m building an internal facing app that will have users numbering in the hundreds, maybe. The hoops we are jumping through to break this app up into &#34;microservices&#34; are absolutely astounding. Who needs joins? Who needs relational integrity? Who needs flexible query patterns? &#34;It just has to scale&#34;!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Almost 20 years of professional experience here: I fully agree with this list. I even want to add a few things:&gt; Clever code isn&#39;t usually good code. Clarity trumps all other concerns.My measurement is &#34;simple and clean&#34; code. Is it simple and clean? No? make it so!&gt; After performing over 100 interviews: interviewing is thoroughly broken. I also have no idea how to actually make it better.If a good developer you know, recommends someone they worked with: It&#39;s almost an instant hire. But for the rest, yeah, it&#39;s incredibly tough.One last thing I like to remind myself: &#34;Good enough is always good enough&#34;. Sometimes &#34;good enough&#34; has a low bar, sometimes high. You always need to reach it, but never want to go too far above it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think this guy would enjoy seeing some of the very low end of the used computer market in places like Pakistan - where they receive 20&#39; container loads full of 5 year old Dell, HP office PCs and mix/match pieces into fully working systems that people can enjoy for more years to come. There&#39;s a whole street with at least ten different retail vendors/repair shops in Rawalpindi."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pretty neat. Definitely recycles a lot of electronics in a good way. On the GPIO pins I would definitely replace the connector! I can tell you from experience that even if the pins straighten out, some random plugging/unplugging later and the pin will break off and the next person will end up replacing the connector. This is much easier if you have a setup already for doing the work.This is also a really great way to &#34;pay yourself&#34; to learn to do rework. Buying 200 at £61 and selling the fully restored ones (which appears to &gt; 100) at £9 is at least £900 revenue from the experience. Granted, since you are &#34;learning&#34; that would be slow work at first, but later it would become fairly routine. So something someone in high school could easily do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I’m doing it for the blog content and the experience and to hopefully provide you guys with some very cheap Raspberry Pi’s for your projects!One other thing here that makes me happy is that these repaired Pis will not end up in a landfill, which I bet would have otherwise been the end result.  Yes, there are electronics recycling services, but who knows if the original owner would have gone that route, and I imagine there still ends up being quite a bit of unrecycleable waste, not to mention the energy required to do the recycling itself.Meanwhile, I have a thermoelectric wine fridge that died recently.  Looks like it&#39;s the logic board, but the manufacturer doesn&#39;t make them anymore (couldn&#39;t find anything on ebay etc. either).  I feel really awful that I&#39;ll likely have to have to toss the thing due to what is probably a really cheap and easy-to-replace dead part.  (I need to take another look at it to see if there&#39;s something obvious like a blown capacitor that I can replace.)&gt; Instead I will be donating the proceeds of the sales to the Raspberry Pi Foundation and they can decide what to do with the Money!This is just really awesome.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Regarding performance, I wrote a bit about this a few months ago in a post comparing different workload isolation techniques:https://fly.io/blog/sandboxing-and-workload-isolation/Two useful links from my Pinboard research for that post:A person at Red Hat optimizing QEMU boot time:http://oirase.annexia.org/tmp/paper.pdfAn Intel deck talking about qemu-lite:http://events17.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slide...(The other thing to follow up on if you&#39;re interested in the background on this stuff is kvmtool).In both cases, a big part of the answer seems to be eliminating BIOS overhead; getting rid of oproms appears to have been the single biggest win for Intel. But the Red Hat article also finds lots of overhead in QEMU itself, and both pieces talk about kernel config issues (for instance, scrubbing the kernel you boot of subsystems that have expensive initcalls).By comparison: Firecracker is purpose-built in Rust for this one task, provides no BIOS, and offers only network, block, keyboard, and serial device support --- with tiny drivers (the serial support is less than 300 lines of code)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another incredible blog post from Julia Evans.Julia if you&#39;re reading, I&#39;m a big fan.  One request:  could you add the date/time to the post, preferably near the title?I do see a `&lt;time&gt;` tag in the HTML, but it doesn&#39;t render any human readable text.  The datetime is also part of the URL which is &#34;good enough,&#34; but it always takes me a minute to remember that and Ctrl+F won&#39;t find it.I&#39;m a little ADD about knowing when things were published, so far from an average person.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The blog post doesn&#39;t mention it but Firecracker was originally based on crosvm [0] built at Google by the ChromeOS team for a WSL-like Linux sandbox on top of ChromeOS running debian-buster containers viz. penguin (afaik) in a gentoo-based VM viz. termina [1]. crosvm inturn is part of a much bigger crostini project [2], which I find to be super fascinating, as it supports UI workloads (over Wayland and X).If you&#39;re using ChromeOS to run any Linux app, you&#39;re using crostini which launches those apps in crosvm managed sandboxes (Container inside a VM) in seconds. In not so distant future, it looks like Android will sandbox platform workloads (running outside the Android framework?) managed by crosvm, to considerably improve security [3].I looked for but couldn&#39;t find ChromeOS GCP instances. I mean, ChromeOS might be a great platform to run multi-tenant server workloads at this point.[0] https://archive.is/T1ZNJ[1] One can run custom Linux containers (other than the debian-based penguin) but not VMs (other than termina) at this point: https://chromeos.dev/en/linux/linux-on-chromeos-faq[2] https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/c...[3] https://lwn.net/Articles/836693/"</p>

To buy Parler&#39;s contract claim, you&#39;d have to believe that Amazon&#39;s lawyers are so stupid that they set out a TOS for the world&#39;s largest hosting provider that didn&#39;t give AWS the right to boot customers, which is something AWS --- really, every hosting provider --- has to do all the time. You almost have to not know anything about the hosting business to think there could be a case here.But if you need to read a judge laughing Parler&#39;s claims off, well, now you can. Real &#34;based&#34; energy in excerpting the AWS AUP in their complaint and clipping it right before the clause that gives AWS the right to terminate service without notice to customers who violate their AUP. The judge, uh, noticed.(As the judge points out, among the many problems with Parler&#39;s restraint of trade argument, there&#39;s the fact that AWS doesn&#39;t host Twitter&#39;s feed.)"</p>

It doesn&#39;t take a genius to know that such a controversial website is going to get dropped, even if it&#39;s just because it makes the webhost look bad.Yes it&#39;s unfair that Twitter gets away with hosting way worse content, but life is unfair, that doesn&#39;t mean you stick your head in the sand and pretend the risk of de-platforming never existed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been trying to come to grips with the societal impact of echo chambers, &#34;hate&#34; speech, and the obligations vs. rights of sites and hosting providers.So far, my take is that websites have less obligation than hosting. It concerns me that AWS booted a site off their platform for speech issues - I am leaning more and more to the idea that colos, IaaS and ISPs should be considered common carriers, and that only a court order should get a site booted off the web entirely."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Adium (https://adium.im/) used to be the MacOSX native version (port) of Pidgin. It seems they still recommend it. However, Adium seems kind of dead? Last commit (https://github.com/adium/adium/) was in 2016.I build a MacOSX app bundle for the original Pidgin long time ago (https://sourceforge.net/projects/pidgin-macosx/). At that point in time, this was not so trivial, as the GTK support for native MacOSX was experimental (http://www.gtk-osx.org/). You could simply use the X11 GTK version but I rather wanted to have a native version. I have no idea what the current state is with GTK on MacOSX. This Pidgin build is obviously very outdated now (from 2009), and probably does not run on recent MacOSX versions (they are frequently breaking backward compatibility...)."</p>

I loved Digsby because it acted as a POP client too.I even worked for a company that forked Ignite Realtime Spark and tried adding Gtalk and MSN support.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; On one scuba diving excursion while in the compound having lunch, Brad engaged a couple from Germany in conversation. Brad asked about the fellow travelers occupation and discovered he was a computer programmer. Lifewise, Brad was asked about his life&#39;s work and stated I am also a computer programmer. &#34;What do you do?&#34; Brad was asked. I wrote Objective-C. Astonished, the gentlerman said, &#34;No, Brad Cox wrote that&#34;. &#34;Hi, I am Brad Cox&#34;, was the response and the introduction.Wonderful story. I wish his family all the best.I love Objective-C and consider it a beautiful language. Back in the day I re-discovered my love for programming when I started to learn this language. This was when I was still in the Java world.As a side project I tried to build a drone (unmanned navel vehicle) powered by objective-c. I have abandoned the effort but posted the code on GitHub - it was a joy to work with the language and the funnest side project I’ve worked with.These days I work with python and golang for job/hobby but I always am grateful to have spent time with objective-c. Reflecting back if I haven’t spent time with this language, today I would of not been a programmer.Thank you Brad Cox for your work and positive influence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am giving a talk in work soon around method swizzling in iOS and was delving into the history of Objective-C a bit and came across Alan Kay&#39;s talk about the power of simplicity and how we&#39;ve all screwed up OOP.In the talk, Alan talks about the ant who lives his life on a single plane of existence, the &#34;Gulley World&#34; or &#34;Reality&#34;.The ant goes to work, he finds stuff to eat, he lives his life in this Gulley World, which is depicted as a pink 2D plane. However some times on this pink plane there are little spots of blue. They represent thoughts that don&#39;t belong in the pink plane.Sometimes those blue spots turn into blue planes, and the ant we are following starts to move along that plane instead of the pink one. Everyone in the pink plane thinks he is wrong. Everyone can see the pink plane, in all its reality. It is not until you walk on the blue plane until you can see &#34;another way&#34;.The metaphor being that we developers built a world where we started to take the general idea of OOP and construct a lot of &#34;reality&#34; around it. A lot of process, a lot of formalization so we could build mechanical systems of gears that slotted together. I think Alan&#39;s idea of OOP was something more fluid, more organic than this. The world is messy and we often try to abstract the mess away in these overbearingly weighty and hierarchical programs that everyone agrees is the right way.I think Objective-C was the most widely used and successful walk on this blue plane. Millions of developers were exposed to the idea of message passing as a form of OOP, which is an astounding accomplishment. It really is a neat language, and I had a lot of fun learning it.Brad definitely walked on the blue plane. RIP."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I met him once in the late 1990s, when his travels took him to Zurich and he asked me whether I could book a talk for him at ETH Zurich, where I was a grad student.I did not quite share his confidence in my abilities in that area, but to my relief, Jürg Gutknecht agreed to sponsor the talk, and I got to spend lunch with Brad Cox, Niklaus Wirth, and Jürg Gutknecht. Given their highly divergent aesthetics in language syntax, I expected some fireworks, but the conversation was quite pleasant, even when they were discussing Perl.I was at the time the maintainer of the Mac port of Perl, and had taken some classes with Wirth, but the idea of discussing Perl with him struck me as akin to discussing masturbation with the Pope. However, Wirth conceded that in the area of text processing, general purpose languages tended to be somewhat clumsy, and there had always been a successful niche for languages like Snobol and now Perl.Brad Cox was a splendid conversationalist in many other areas as well. His talk focused on Superdistribution as the next evolution of the Software IC concept, and he very skillfully pitched this to a Swiss audience that a banking nation should be a natural superpower to take the lead in a micropayment world. He was very good at painting visions like this, but I&#39;m not sure how much of it ultimately came to pass:a) I don&#39;t think we&#39;re any closer to plug and play &#34;Software ICs&#34; than we were in the mid-1980s when he introduced the term. In the Objective C ecosystem, the closest there was to that was maybe Interface Builder with its Outlets and Actions, but I think that part did NOT originate with Cox (I may be mistaken, though).b) Likewise, I don&#39;t see any move to distributed micropayments. If anything, more and more of the software revenue seems to come from centrally billed cloud services, e.g. comparing the Microsoft Office revenue model 20 years ago and now."</p>

While I was technically aware of how powerful smallish servers have become, this article really crystallized that for me.64 cores and 24 NVME drives in a 2U spot on a rack is just insane compared to what we used to have to do to get a beefy database server.  And it&#39;s not some exotic thing, just a popular mainstream Dell SKU.If you price it out on Dell&#39;s site, you get a retail price north of $200k.  That is really what made it clear for me.  That you could fit $200k+ worth of DIMMS, Drives, CPUS into a 2U spot :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m thankful for their OpenZFS tuning doc which they developed as part of this server migration: https://github.com/letsencrypt/openzfs-nvme-databasesThe one thing that I get hung up on when it comes to RAID and SSDs is the wear pattern vs. HDDs. Take for example this quote from the README.md:We use RAID-1+0, in order to achieve the best possible performance without being vulnerable to a single-drive failure.Failure on SSDs is predictable and usually expressed with Terabytes Written (TBW). Failure on spinning disk HDDs is comparatively random. In my mind, it makes sense to mirror SSD-based vdevs only for performance reasons and not for data integrity. The reason is that the mirrors are expected to fail after the same amount of TBW, and thus the availability/redundancy guarantee of mirroring is relatively unreliable.Maybe someone with more experience in this area can change my mind, but if it were up to me, I would have configured the mirror drives as spares, and relied on a local HDD-based zpool for quick backup/restore capability. I imagine that would be a better solution, although it probably wouldn&#39;t have fit into tryingq&#39;s ideal 2U space."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is incredibly cool:&gt; Two novel techniques, atomic-resolution real-time video and conical carbon nanotube confinement, allow researchers to view never-before-seen details about crystal formation. The observations confirm theoretical predictions about how salt crystals form and could inform general theories about the way in which crystal formation produces different ordered structures from an otherwise disordered chemical mixture.&gt; To hold samples in place, we use atom-thick carbon nanohorns, one of our previous inventions. With the stunning videos Sakakibara captured, we immediately noticed the opportunity to study the structural and statistical aspects of crystal nucleation in unprecedented detail.Creating shaped nucleation sites using carbon nanotubes (nanohorns?) sounds like a fascinating technology. I don&#39;t have access to the paper unfortunately - I&#39;m curious what other types of crystals could theoretically be grown with this technology. The authors mention graphite - what about silicon? Could it be used to grow more regular crystals for use in electronics? With fewer defects, I&#39;d imagine we could reduce the failure rate in manufacturing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “Salt is just our first model substance to probe the fundamentals of nucleation events,” said University Professor Eiichi Nakamura. “Salt only crystallizes one way. But other molecules, such as carbon, can crystallize in multiple ways, leading to graphite or diamond. This is called polymorphism and no one has seen the early stages of the nucleation that leads to it. I hope our study provides the first step in understanding the mechanism of polymorphism.”I&#39;m amused that Chemists / Physicists also have the word &#34;Polymorphism&#34; and that it means something completely different from the programming term."</p>

I brought a bunch of them (132 so far) under one roof. I made them searchable (using typesense.org), and list out the license details and link back to the site or GitHub repo.I&#39;m not much of a designer, and it&#39;s just a first stab at the concept. It&#39;s been done, but I wanted to also build it API-first, since I know it would be useful to be able to search through them all for developers.I&#39;m always on the lookout for new icon libraries to include, and plan on making it easier to learn more about the designers themselves. If you have any ideas on icon sets or libraries to include please let me know in the comments :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has completed a regulation permitting low volume motor vehicle manufacturers to begin selling replica cars that resemble vehicles produced at least 25 years ago. Congress enacted a DeLorean Motor Company-backed bill backed by the Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) DeLorean Motor Company, and others into law in 2015, which streamlined requirements for small automakers, but implementation was delayed while awaiting the NHTSA regulations. Companies like DeLorean will now be able to apply for authorization to produce and sell vehicles under this program.I assume this means they waive certain modern safety regulations in order to allow companies to make new cars (in low volume) that resemble old cars?&gt; That said, with EV’s becoming more mainstream, we’ve been considering switching to an all-electric as the future. It certainly makes for an easier path through emissions maze which still looms large over any internal combustion engine.That makes sense.  If ever there was a car that looks like it should be an EV, it&#39;s the Delorean.  They could even do a stickshift EV if they wanted to, though most car companies seem to not think it&#39;s worth the complexity/maintenance, and I get the impression that electric motors are hard on transmissions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"TBH I’m surprised Musk hasn’t bought them out yet and “released” a limited edition Model 3 with a DeLorian body kit for like $500,000... if Cyan can release a Volvo P1800 for 500K and you usually need to provide the 50 year old P1800 for them to convert and tune there clearly is a market for these things."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; 700k paintingsThis figure immediately reminded me of a very interesting EconTalk episode[0] on the management of art museums. The premises from the discussion (as I recall):- Art museums have more than 10x the number of pieces in their archives as they do on display. Some of this art will never be seen by the pubic.- When art galleries charge admission, patrons feel the need to &#34;get their money&#39;s worth&#34; so they rush to see as much of the exhibits as possible, without taking time to thoroughly enjoy anything.- The purpose of art is to be enjoyed. The above two points make this goal much harder.The conclusions:- Museums should be free admission and funded by selling pieces from the archive (really interesting discussion on how this is taboo for curators)The second-order effects:- Patrons can sit and enjoy a very small section of the museum instead of rushing through, since they can simply come back for more later- More people get to see fine art- Second- and third-tier museums start to gain access to better art, since they can simply buy it instead of waiting for estate donations (which go to larger museums)I think it&#39;s worth a listen.[0]: https://www.econtalk.org/michael-ohare-on-art-museums/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People in the UK should know that the Tate Gallery, being a publicly-funded museum, are required to make any items in their collection available for you to see on request. When studying sculpture I was really interested in a 1972 piece by Marcel Broothaers called Tractatus Logico-Catalogicus and noticed that the Tate had it in their collection. I emailed them and set up a time to visit a warehouse in SE London, and they brought it out for me to look at it. It&#39;s so much better than seeing things in a packed gallery, let alone a packed Tate, and you get a real sense of what the work is like in the flesh, stripped of all the spectacle and didactic trash that generally surrounds works in somewhere like the Tate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I do not get why people are coming down on AWS here. Elastic made the software available under the Apache License. That gives AWS the right to offer this service. Maybe they did not have right to trademarks, there are courts to settle that.AWS contributes improvements to the project. This is just about Elastic and their business model. They could have not made it open source and it probably just would not have been widely used and successful. It is up to Elastic to come up with a business model that works, not blame others if it is not."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"AWS are the good guys here. Elastic built a popular product off the work of countless open source contributors. That&#39;s how they became a market leader in this product space. It&#39;s how open source works. The people who contributed to the product did so with no expectation of reward except that their efforts would remain open source.Elasticsearch got popular, and now Elastic wants to reap all the rewards and make money off the product. They&#39;re free to do that, and create restricted-license or closed-source versions for future enhancements. But the community doesn&#39;t have to buy into that and continue to contribute to what is no longer truly an open source product. AWS is forking it and continuing with the original, truly open source license.This is pretty much exactly what happened to MySQL, and now we have MariaDB, which is a better and truly open source product.AWS does plenty of things worth criticizing, and one can even criticize them in this particular instance for not working with Elastic to provide more support to whatever it was they were asking for. And Elastic may very well have a legitimate gripe about trademarks. But yanking the Apache license out and moving to a more-restrictive license is not the right solution, and is not what everyone who contributed to building the product signed up for.You can&#39;t create an open source project, wait for it to gain market dominance, decide to be less open source, and expect the community to continue contributing.Elastic shot themselves in the foot and now they can either revert their decision or get left behind as the community moves on to what will ultimately end up being the better product."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While it&#39;s great that AWS has indeed contributed fixes to upstream Elasticsearch, they link to 9 PRs that are generally on the trivial end of the scale. (Though I don&#39;t doubt the PR that adds a missing synchronized keyword might have been gnarly and time consuming to debug, and that diff size does not necessarily correlate to importance)For a project AWS was making hundreds of millions in revenue on four years ago (as per an ex AWS employee), patting your own shoulder for such a trivial amount of contributions is a bit disingenuous. They might have contributed more, but if there was something significant, they probably would have mentioned.Notable new features like &#34;ultrawarm&#34; they did not attempt to contribute upstream, nor open source at all: https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/05/aws-annou..."</p>

When I started writing the app, Apple was hands-down a better developer experience. Now, it&#39;s the exact opposite -- MacOS is increasingly painful, throwing up more and more roadblocks and constricting their platform ever more. And Visual Studio is better than Xcode IMO.Also, as a C++/Python dev - it&#39;s increasingly hard not to notice the awesome momentum Rust has garnered."</p>

I was going to use curses with python (batteries included!), only to find out it&#39;s not supported on windows.It almost feels like a strategy - be standard enough to bring people in, but idiosyncratic enough to lock them in.I&#39;ll be using gtk-rs thank you very much."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"(Not my joke)At a recent real-time Java conference, the participants were given an awkward question to answer:
&#34;If you had just boarded an airliner and discovered that your team of programmers had been responsible for the flight control software, how many of you would disembark immediately?&#34;
Among the forest of raised hands only one man sat motionless. When asked what he would do, he replied that he would be quite content to stay aboard. With his team&#39;s software, he said, the plane was unlikely to even taxi as far as the runway, let alone take off."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an oldie (I first heard it in the 80s) but is one of my all time favorites.  While it can be told about any two classes of people it really applies to a lot of code I encounter:  A physicist is showing a thermos to her friend, a programmer.

  &#34;It&#39;s amazing&#34;, she said.  &#34;You put a cold drink inside and regardless of how hot it is outside the drink stays cold&#34;.

  The programmer is suitably impressed.

  &#34;But that&#39;s not all&#34;, she continued.  &#34;You can put a *hot* drink inside and no matter how cold it is outside the drink stays hot&#34;.

  Now the programmer is perplexed.

  Plaintively he asks, &#34;But how does it know?&#34;


I think of this whenever I read code that contains a gratuitous state variable that explains the type or content of some data structure rather than make the data structure self-explaining.  Even more annoying when it&#39;s a class.Having to coordinate two variables is a recipe for bugs down the road.  Seems like it should be a beginner&#39;s mistake but I see it all the time in &#34;non beginner&#34; code."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an encouraging move.My secondhand understanding was that Intel was losing top talent due to pressure to pay closer to median industry compensation. Top engineers recognized they were underpaid and left the company.I&#39;ve been part of a similar downhill slide at a smaller company in the billion dollar revenue range. To be blunt, once the [mediocre] MBAs start realizing that the engineers are getting paid more than they are, the pressure to reduce engineering compensation is strong. Frankly, there are plenty of engineering candidates on the market who are happy with median compensation. Many of them are even great engineers and great employees.However, being a top company in a winner-take-all market requires the top engineers. The only way to attract and retain them at scale is to offer high compensation. I&#39;m hoping that&#39;s part of what&#39;s happening here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A bit off topic but I remember when Intel set up a special career fair presentation for my major.I forget the specific role the manager was hiring for, but it sounded like a quality/reliability engineer. Basically run a bunch of tests, identify and analyze errors on newly manufactured equipment.I immediately lost interest when the manager said the role would either work until 9 PM or start the next day at 4 AM due to an important (daily?) 7 AM meeting where the results would be presented. Ontop of that, it was required that you be on call during every weekend and most holidays. You would be required to do this for your first two years as an entry bachelor degree worker. Entering masters level students wouldn&#39;t need to be on call.After that, he mentioned this role would pay ~$65,000 USD. Bonus &lt; $5000. To live in the bay area. Then he bragged to us about the ability to buy intel stock at a 15% discount or something like that.The manager presented in a room with fully qualified people to work at any FANG/Graphics/Aerospace company.I sold all my intel stock the next day [late 2019], it made up most of my portfolio at the time. I just did not see how intel would attract talent if it over-worked and under-compensated entry level employees like that. Compared to the FANG employee getting free meals, game rooms, huge salary, etc."</p>

Some communities adjacent to SSC (and some near HN) have helped me find some amazingly smart and cool people, and I&#39;m very thankful that they exist (and that Scott can continue blogging as well), and if anything I hope we can encourage significantly more niche community building on the Internet, and with many more modalities than blogs, forums, and comments (which SSC indeed has).His notes about people being afraid to express themselves, have open discussions, be honest, and share with one another are pretty saddening however, and I hope that we can progress towards a better area here, even if progress sometimes seems slow or impossible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I got some hands-on time with the Pico and made a video for it [1], with a tiny project I decided to try out with MicroPython.It was the first time I&#39;d ever tried MicroPython, and I have to say I&#39;m a huge fan. As a dev who came from PHP/Javascript into Java and Python (heh, not quite the same thing but that&#39;s how life was), I find MicroPython a lot more intuitive than the Arduino language or raw C.I also learned that Adafruit maintains their own flavor, CircuitPython [2].Definitely worth trying out if you haven&#39;t, and know any Python![1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUCgYXF01Do[2] https://circuitpython.org"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some high level info on the Pico [1]:  - New RP2040 microcontroller with 2M Flash
  - Micro-USB B port for power and data (and for reprogramming the Flash)
  - 40 pin 21x51 &#39;DIP&#39; style 1mm thick PCB with 0.1&#34; through-hole pins also with edge castellations
   - Exposes 26 multi-function 3.3V General Purpose I/O (GPIO) 
   - 23 GPIO are digital-only and 3 are ADC capable
   - Can be surface mounted as a module
  - 3-pin ARM Serial Wire Debug (SWD) port
  - The power supply achitecture is pretty simple (you can power the unit from micro-USB, external supplies or batteries)
  - Buy price is $USD 4.00
  - MicroPython &amp; C++ SDK
  - Pinout Diagram: https://files.littlebird.com.au/Shared-Image-2021-01-21-17-39-47-GVzHd.png
  - When using MicroPython, the programming model is similar to other boards where you have to unplug and plug back in the board. I hope this is ok on the Micro-USB port.
  - The isn&#39;t currently a version with header pins, so you&#39;ll have to add your own, or get one from a Reseller who will mode them for you (like this one [2]).

The burried the lede is that Raspberry Pi have created their own silicon (just like that other fruit company).
They call their Microcontroller the &#34;RP2040&#34;:It boasts some impressive specs:  - Dual-core cortex M0+ at up to 133MHz
  - On-chip PLL allows variable core frequency
  - 264K multi-bank high performance SRAM
  - External Quad-SPI Flash with eXecute In Place (XIP)

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bet that future Raspberry Pi boards will have a RP2040 or successor chip onboard, to do the bit banging/realtime jobs on the I/O port.Or they will even integrate it into their SOC.Shame though, that they didn&#39;t make the IO ports 5V capable. It&#39;s nowadays pretty common for microcontrollers that are meant for industrial and automotive use to have a separate supply for the I/O ports, that can go up to 5V, independent from the core/peripheral voltage.The main use is to drive (logic-level) MOSFETs directly, interface to 5V buses like SENT, CAN, etc. without having to use level shifters."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; There is one thing that has been and is always going to be counterproductive, especially in such situations: blind actionism. Many people flooded the Internet (read: forums, Reddit, bug trackers of projects), inciting panic and suggesting to move to some other “free” hosted platform. This is clearly not a solution. Any hosting platform will sooner or later have to comply with such a request. It can become very expensive if you end up in court."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Regarding GitHub, it is sad that they took down the repository at all. It’s a well-known pattern: platforms rather comply with such requests than risking litigation, requiring projects to invest time and money to fund lawyers themselves (or hope for an association such as the EFF to pick up their case). The moment they published the request and took down the repositories, many experts immediately raised concerns that the request itself is illegal. It remains questionable why GitHub’s legal team didn’t recognize this.ok... am I crazy? I thought when someone sends a DMCA request to you, the platform, that you are required to take the content down and wait for a counter notice from that contents author. The legality of the message is not your problem. You receive the DMCA, you take the content down, if you get a counter claim, you put it back up, the two parties go to court.If that&#39;s correct, then can you really criticize github for following an odious law? Whether we like it or not, they are bound by these requirements."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is really clever. I&#39;ve been wanting to try the WASM version of SQLite for something - this is a really smart usage of it.My https://datasette.io/ project is built around a similar idea to this: the original inspiration for it was Zeit Now (now Vercel) and my realization that SQLite read-only workloads are an amazing fit for serverless providers, since you don&#39;t need to pay for an additional database server - you can literally bundle your data with the rest of your application code (the SQLite database is just a binary file).If you want to serve a SQLite API in an edge-closest-to-the-user manner for much larger database files (100MB+) I&#39;ve had some success running Datasette on https://fly.io/ - which runs Docker containers in a geo-load-balanced manner.

And the wasm init add at least 100ms to each request even when &#34;hot&#34; in cache.Also, out of a cost perspective, running a VM with SSD for cheap with SQlite will give much more requests than a CF worker for much less.Adding writes to this is also very limited due to the max 1sec write per KV key limit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As the developer of a pretty popular &#34;utility&#34; browser extension, I&#39;ve been shocked by the volume of email I get every week about it.On a daily basis, I will get requests to sell the extension. Once or twice a week, I will receive an offer to add &#34;a couple lines of code&#34; to my extension which are always generously described as &#34;allowed in the Chrome Web Store&#34; by little fly-by-night organizations that only even have a landing page half the time and usually have throwaway-looking gmail accounts. Out of curiosity, I&#39;ve asked a few what their code does and they never fully describe it, but it either collects analytics to ship home (my extension runs on all sites, so it&#39;s appetizing to them!) or places paid results at the top of any search results, for which I can make &#34;thousands of dollars a month based on the number of North American users I have&#34;.Here is an example email I received yesterday. It&#39;s a good example of how they call it &#34;an SDK&#34; and looks like one of the more legit ones (they registered a domain to send email from, at least).  We at [redacted] are considering purchasing the complete license and ownership of the extensions which have 50K+ active users, may I know if you would be interested in selling? If so, - what is your estimated price?

  Regarding the SDK monetization which we discussed earlier, as it is not distractive and is compatible with any other monetization. We have straightforward terms and provide support for your users agreement. Our partners generate 3-20 K USD monthly with our solution for the browser extensions.

  As a kind reminder, we are [redacted] — a reputable global peer-to-peer ethical proxy network. All our clients are big reputable companies, we authorize their business before providing any proxy plans. 

  Look forward to your further feedback and discussing further details of our financial proposal for your Software in a short Zoom call or here by emails.

Finally, I am also hounded by teams at Microsoft and Apple, who want me to port the extension to their new plugin ecosystems so it can be featured/showcased. I worked with Apple on one similar thing for an extension and it caused such a huge jump in support and feature requests from users that I was overwhelmed, so I am not keen to do it again until I have more free time. They can&#39;t understand why I don&#39;t want to grow by tens of thousands of users a week, but I&#39;m just one person and don&#39;t make money from it whatsoever."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I find interesting that GNOME Screensaver&#39;s security depends on it to not crash.Meanwhile, in KDE the lock screen is managed by KDE Session Management Server which ensures that lock screen cannot be bypassed by simply crashing its process.The way it works is follows: ksmserver draws a black rectangle over everything and spawns kscreenlocker. If kscreenlocker crashes, the black rectangle is still here, and ksmserver will spawn kscreenlocker again but this time with software rendering (just in case it crashed due to graphics driver issue). If kscreenlocker crashes four times then KDE Session Management Server gives up, stops respawning kscreenlocker and simply draws the following text on the screen.  The screen locker is broken and unlocking is not possible anymore.
  In order to unlock switch to a virtual terminal (e.g. Ctrl+Alt+F2),
  log in and execute the command:
  
  loginctl unlock-session %1
  
  Afterwards switch back to the running session (Ctrl+Alt+F%2).

If ksmserver itself crashes then the entire session closes.I&#39;m not sure why GNOME screensaver cannot do something like this. Lock screen crashing seems like something inevitable (especially considering buggy graphic card drivers and so on), and it makes sense to prepare for it so that crashes won&#39;t bypass the screen locker."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does anyone know why lockscreens in Linux have been such a joke? I remember trying Ubuntu couple years ago and when waking up my laptop it would show me my entire desktop with all the information displayed right there in the open for about 10-20 seconds before suddenly engaging the lockscreen. All you had to do was close the lid and open it again and you could just copy whatever was on the screen before the lock screen appeared. I guess it&#39;s because the lockscreen was a separate process that had to start up? Still, what an awful awful design."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Years ago I taught a high school typing class in a K-12 school.  The school didn&#39;t have the funds to get a commercial typing program so I wrote my own typing program.  It evolved over time with features to help me track the students&#39; progress etc.  One day we had a school open house where all the parents could come to school.  We had a bunch of different activities set up in different classrooms and I ended up getting assigned to the 3rd grade classroom to set up my typing program so anyone coming through could test their typing speed.  It was a DOS program and I didn&#39;t want people using anything other than my typing program, so I modified it so you couldn&#39;t quit the typing program.  Over the course of the day the 3rd graders were hanging out in their homeroom not really doing anything productive.  Of course the computer was a novel attraction and they were just smashing keys and exploring my program&#39;s UI.  Eventually at one point I noticed that they had somehow crashed my program with a segfault in what had otherwise become a pretty stable piece of software.  To this day I have absolutely no idea what the bug was."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While working on Pebble, we ran into a lot of issues as we tried to enable messaging from the watch. For example, we never figured out how to send an iMessage or WhatsApp reply. While digging around for a solution to that problem, I thought it was odd that no one had built a Adrium/Trillian/Meebo chat app for modern chat networks. I buried that thought for a while, until I learned about Matrix two years ago.Matrix is the holy grail of chat. It&#39;s end-to-end encrypted by default, federated and open source. The only problem is that not a single one of my friends or family was on it! Luckily the Matrix folks had already envisioned a solution to this problem - they built an API enabling &#39;bridges&#39; between Matrix and other chat networks. This struck a chord with me, maybe we could finally build a single app that I could use to chat with all my friends, regardless of which chat app they used. Through the Matrix community I met Tulir, the most prolific bridge developer and we started working together on what would become Beeper. I&#39;ve been using it as my primary chat client for almost 2 years now. I could not imagine going back to the hot mess of 12 different chat apps I had before!Beeper is a paid service because I think it aligns interests between us and our users. We make a featureful and secure app, in exchange you pay us money. For those who prefer to self-host, you can run the entire Beeper backend stack on your own server. The vast majority of the code we&#39;ve written for Beeper is open source on gitlab.com/nova. Our desktop client is closed source, but you can use Element (or any open source Matrix client) if you prefer. See our FAQ for more info or I&#39;d be happy to explain more."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We talk often on this forum of how innaccessible giants like Google and Amazon are for the little guy. I thus found this point particularly interesting:&gt;&#34;Attempts to contact the vendor through regular support channels were unsuccessful so we ended up searching LinkedIn and managed to find an engineer working on the core antivirus detection. They immediately understood the seriousness of the problem and took prompt action to get a fix shipped, thus preventing quite the disaster for the users of this product. It’s notable that without this last-ditch effort we would have been effectively blocked from releasing a native Apple Silicon version for an indefinite period.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The Apple Silicon chips are one of the first desktop chips that are a heterogeneous design with distinct performance and efficiency cores. We’re revising much of our core threading and thread pooling architecture to handle the distinction better, improve efficiency, and eventually be able to schedule less performance-critical tasks on the efficiency cores.I found this bit interesting.  Likely more prevalent in mobile apps, but perhaps shifting desktop code to Big.Little approach and using core affinity will result in a lot less wasted energy."</p>

The report is all speculation, not some credible source leak.And the original report was released on 01/12 before Intel appoints Pat Gelsinger as new CEO. So even if the report speculated correctly, which is unlikely, the circumstance already changed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Feels like we are quickly centralizing consumer chip fabrication into a single company. I guess the barrier for entry is so high and TSMC is just so far ahead."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thanks OP for sharing my website!Please be gentle with me. This is a project website that I built out of frustration a few years ago. I know there are things that need improving and a lot of things that could be adjusted. I work full time at Brave Software (brave.com) and simply don&#39;t have time to put a ton of effort into MuslceWiki.I do however have a big backlog of videos to add and I&#39;ve slowly been working on an app. We have also re-drawn the homepage images and my long term plan is to move away from gifs to webm or MP4.FWIW, for some reason I was unable to log into my HN account. I made a new one, but the posts seem to be limited. So looks like I&#39;ll be replying in the morning."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well done site.
I have a little mixed feelings about the target audience.
Working out for many years (gym and calisthenics) I know a lot of exercises. Beginners might be tempted to approach their fitness by asking that question:what muscle I want to grow today?That is not the way to go.
If you start out or especially during a pandemic where you need to work with everything you can get go for composite exercises that hit more muscles and are the opposite of isolation exercises you might be tempted to choose from a page like this.
Beginners: full body workouts.
Advanced: 2 to 3 day split.
Expert: you know your drill. and will do whatever works for you.So who should be using this site?
Beginners and advanced should use a plan that is preconfigured. Pros know what exercises they want to configure into their routines.Don’t get me wrong: It’s nice to have for reference but do yourself a favor and use some preconfigured workouts if  you’re starting out.You won’t get a sixpack by only working out abs. Train your whole body and reduce body fat. That’s the way to go."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Surprised that EXRX exercise database[1] has not been mentioned as a page with similar goals. They have been around since 1999, and the site is a gold mine for everything exercise relatedDarebee video library is good as well [2], and the site contains a lot of useful material. And the visual design is really good.[1] https://exrx.net/Lists/WtMale[2] https://darebee.com/video.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Blog post author here. Since this post, there&#39;s now an option available for DRM-enabled Electron. However, it&#39;s only available through a single vendor, castLabs [0].This is a closed source, downstream effort which means no modifications can be made to Electron itself. All changes must make it upstream to show up in this fork. When asked whether they would eventually merge it upstream, they didn&#39;t provide a clear answer [1].I also wrote a followup blog post with more detail on the current state of DRM options on the web [2]. Spoilers: it&#39;s not great.Regardless of all of these problems, I still hold an interest in browser development and have been working towards making Electron a viable option for building a browser [3].[0] https://github.com/castlabs/electron-releases[1] https://github.com/castlabs/electron-releases/discussions/24[2] https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/posts/the-end-of-indie-web-br...[3] https://github.com/samuelmaddock/electron-browser-shell"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Isn&#39;t this just how DRM works? It&#39;s precisely why so many were concerned about EME being adopted into web standards, and why so many are passionate about DRM-Free media. DRM is designed to put restrictions on where, when, and how media is played, including what software it&#39;s used with.This doesn&#39;t invalidate any of the author&#39;s points, and they&#39;re right to be upset. But the problem isn&#39;t Chrome per se, it&#39;s DRM-encumbered media.And that&#39;s why I buy audiobooks from Libro.fm†, games from GOG†, and (out of necessity) movies and TV shows from iTunes—which are still DRM&#39;d by default but are at least relatively easy to decrypt.----------† Among others, I don&#39;t use any one source."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not sure if this is covered under Widevine, but Google also blocks anything that is not a major browser from logging into any of its services.https://security.googleblog.com/2019/04/better-protection-ag..."</p>
