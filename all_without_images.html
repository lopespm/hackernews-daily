								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;&gt; The G7 group of advanced economies has reached a &#34;historic&#34; deal to make multinational companies pay more taxNo, it hasn&#39;t. Some finance ministers met and talked:&#34;Finance ministers meeting in London agreed to battle tax avoidance by making companies pay more in the countries where they do business. They also agreed in principle to a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% to avoid countries undercutting each other.&#34;I have no idea how it works in other countries, but in the US, finance ministers don&#39;t have the power to agree to treaties. Treaties in the US require a super-majority (two thirds) vote in the Senate. Unless Mitch McConnell has signed off on this, the G7 group of advanced economies did not reach a deal on anything. I don&#39;t even see the word &#34;Senate&#34; in the entire article.US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen can tell reporters whatever she wants. Without buy-in from Republicans in the Senate, finance ministers agreeing &#34;in principle&#34; amounts to finance ministers agreeing that if they had ham, they could make ham and eggs, if they had eggs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first proposal of having a minimum corporate tax rate probably doesn&#39;t mean a lot because you to then start policing what subsidies governments give to effectively discount below 15%.The more interesting part is what I hope is the start of serious efforts to tackle profit-shifting, which is a name invented for &#34;transfer pricing&#34; because that is technically illegal. But it&#39;s the same thing.A good starting point is that if you book x% of your revenue in country A then country A should get to tax x% of your profit.Here&#39;s another part of this they should adopt: borrowing money should count as repatriating profits. In the era of zero interest rates debt is used to effectively defer taxes forever. There&#39;s no legitimate reason to allow entities to borrow money at near-zero interest rates instead of repatriating retained earnings."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I do wonder if we wouldn&#39;t be better off eliminating corporation tax entirely.The revenue of a corporation can, roughly, be:1. Spent on goods or services from another company (including freelancers, contractors, etc.)2. Spent on rent3. Spent on capital purchases4. Spent on wages5. Spent on debt repayment or other forms of financing6. Paid out in dividends7. Spent on share buybacks8. Invested in something elseItems 1-5 are all good things that we want companies to do, and corporation tax is normally applied after this spending is accounted for. Items 6 and 7 ought to be taxed, and frequently are (dividends and buybacks create income for individuals who will pay tax on that income). Item 8 is a bit vaguer, but probably shouldn&#39;t be taxed in most cases (if we&#39;re worried about companies parking cash in very low-risk assets, then super-low yields are effectively a tax on that anyway).All that the corporation tax adds to this picture is the creation of work in tax avoidance services, and an unjust inequality between those firms that can afford those services and are structured to take advantage of the rules, and those that can not and are not.It&#39;s not obvious to me that corporation tax /can/ be fixed, and so it may be better simply to scrap it and replace it with something more difficult to dodge.EDIT: formatting"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s JPEG 2000, which is nothing like classic JPEG. It doesn&#39;t have the artifacts classic JPEG introduces at sharp edges, so you can read text. It has more color depth if you want it. It also doesn&#39;t mess up non-color data such as normal maps the way classic JPEG does.JPEG 2000 is not used much. Decoding is slow, and encoding is slower. The decoders are either buggy or proprietary. It has way too many options internally. 
The big users of JPEG 2000 are medical. It has a &#34;lossless&#34; mode, and medical imagery is usually stored lossless because you really don&#39;t want compression artifacts in X-rays.(I&#39;ve been struggling with JPEG 2000 recently. Second Life and Open Simulator use it for asset storage. Some images won&#39;t decompress properly with OpenJPEG, a free decoder. I finally found out why. There&#39;s a field used for &#34;personal health information&#34; in JPEG 2000. This is where the patient name and such go in a CAT scan. That feature was added after the original version.  Some older images apparently have junk in that field, which causes problems.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The XVideo extension, commonly used by MPlayer (at least in the past, maybe still?), has supported sending YUV images to your video card for 20½ years, since XFree86 4.0.2: https://www.cs.ait.ac.th/~on/mplayer/en/xv.htmlThere are various problems in XVideo that make it hard to use for general application display, but the fact that this was a thing they included in it makes me think that a substantial number of video cards have included YUV decoding capability in hardware since the previous millennium."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the challenges with Y&#39;CbCr (what Carmack is calling &#34;YUV&#34;) is that there are so many flavors.He mentions 4:2:0 chroma subsampling. But he doesn&#39;t mention chroma siting. Or alternative sumbsampling schemes. Or matrix coefficients. Or full-range vs video-range (a.k.a. JPEG vs MPEG range). Heck, how you even arrange subsampled data varies by system (many libraries like planar; Apple likes bi-planar; etc.).I&#39;d love to see more support for rendering subsampled Y&#39;CbCr formats so you don&#39;t have to use so much RAM, but it gets complicated quick."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The timeline of browser extensibility is quite fascinating. There&#39;s really not a single place that covers all of it, so I decided to research my own timeline/history:  - Consumer web browsers (1993-)
  - Plug-ins (1995-2015ish)
  - User Style Sheets (1998-2019)
  - Bookmarklets (1998–)
  - Browser Extensions (1999–)
  - Mozilla XUL (1997–2017)
  - Alternative Browser Distributions (2004–)
  - Userscripts (2005–)
  - Converging on the WebExtensions API (2017–)
  - Manifest V3 (2021–)
  - No/Low-Code Browser Extension Builders (2021–)

Here&#39;s a link to the blog post with my research: https://medium.com/brick-by-brick/a-brief-history-of-browser...Also, if you care about browser extensibility, join the w3 group (it&#39;s free) and watch the GitHub repo!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is their charter: https://github.com/w3c/webextensions/blob/main/charter.mdAnd the twitter announcement from the co-chair: https://twitter.com/xeenon/status/1400862543673921536I&#39;m cautiously optimistic that this will work well, but somewhat concerned that this will cause Manifest V3&#39;s de facto limits on ad blocking and the like to become endemic. It will be interesting to see how they balance &#34;compatibility with popular existing extensions&#34; against their foundational focus on security and privacy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Cumulative layout shift is supposed to measure whether your site shifts around while it&#39;s loading, but it&#39;s so strict that even Google Translate fails the test.And so it should be. There&#39;s hardly anything worse than having things shift around after you start reading, scrolling or clicking on something.I think it&#39;s a very good sign if Google&#39;s own sites fail these tests. It means the tests are meaningful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It&#39;s causing a fair amount of panic, because 96% of sites fail the test.Good. That sounds like a realistic estimation of the number of slow and bloated websites. What good are nice animations and designs when they destroy the UX?You&#39;ll never see someone gaming in 4k with hardware that can&#39;t render it with more than 15FPS. Yet we see that kind of &#34;tradeoff&#34; every time we browse the web. Users get loading times for the site itself, then processing of JS to redundantly do the browser&#39;s job of arranging the 20 layers of &lt;div&gt;s, then loading animations for the actual contents, and then a couple seconds after that you might get the first thumbnails.And I&#39;m absolutely not surprised Google&#39;s pages fail this test as well; Everything from Google Images to YouTube got increasingly worse with every new design iteration, with both slower loading times as well as an increase in breakage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Im actually surprised how good YT comes out in this. The page is a dumpster fire:Before Polymer (current YT framework) YT video page weighted somewhere around 50KB (10KB compressed) and was ordinary HTML + 1MB js player (400KB compressed). As soon as HTML part loaded the page was all there.Now its 600KB (100KB compressed) JSON + additional 8MB desktop_polymer.js (1MB compressed) that needs to be compiled/interpreted before it even starts building the page client side and anything starts showing up. 1MB js player is on top of that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yep.  It is not surprising at all that the term “insulting” appears three times because that’s how it feels for so many reasons.Remember:- They pretend with a straight face like it was somehow impossible to sell software or reach customers before their magical store made it happen.- They pretend like the current “search” feature of the App Store is not a sad reduction of what it used to be (or what it could be if a trillion dollar company put any effort into it at all).- They pretend to have all these problems hosting apps that are somehow solved by fees, while completely ignoring all the free apps that clearly tax that same infrastructure.- They conveniently ignore the absurd amount of money they must be making from scams that are constantly top-grossing to add insult to injury.I could go on but there are entire blogs written about this by now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the core sentiment here is being lost.This isn’t so much a call to action against Apple’s fees.It’s pointing out something that I’ve felt building over the last couple of years out of Apple, which is an attitude of hubris, contempt, and a “taking for granted” of Apple’s developers.The WWDC spiel of how much they value us has become trite and transparent.They do produce some really nice tools and APIs. I can’t knock what they provide developers.But often times the attitude beneath the veneer is a precursor of things to come, and it’s becoming noticeable that Apple’s culture seems to care less about its developers now than before.You might say “sure, but so what? Developers are part of the means to an end of selling stuff”, and you’re not wrong.But one of the things I loved about Apple circa 2009 was their respect for their user. It was palpable and magical, even.Then, learning Cocoa and Interface Builder coming from Eclipse and Java, that same respect seemed to permeate their dev environment as well.That seems lost. Following some of their tech leads on Twitter exposes some rather vitriolic feelings towards people in general.Customers, be they users or devs, deserve respect. Apple used to be great at giving that respect. I fear it’s slipping away culturally, and is worth calling out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At D5 [1], What did Steve &amp; Bill Gate admire in the other?Bill: Steve’s taste,Steve: Microsoft’s ability to partner.Apple is basically repeating a lot of their early mistakes. Some of those lessons Steve took it to heart when he returns to Apple from NeXT.&gt;This isn’t about the 30%, or the 15%,.......It’s about what Apple’s leadership thinks of us and our work.There is also another point Marco didn&#39;t mention. It is not your customers either. Apple has been very clear in all of their communications. The user of iPhone, are Apple&#39;s customers. Even the third party Apps, they are accessing Apple&#39;s customers. And hence the relationship is very much not a partnership. Since Apple claims  ownership on both the Apps and the customers. In the name of privacy and user experience.&gt;but Apple uses their position of power to double-dip.Finally! Someone in the Apple community use the term double-dip! A term Apple has used against Qualcomm and sent a whole PR team to damage their reputation.&gt;But the leaders have already shown us who they really are, what they really think of us, and how little they value our work.Unfortunately Tim Cook isn&#39;t the type of person who understand this. You should probably listen to his testimony to make your own judgement. But after the Epic Vs Apple trial it became very clear why Steve said Tim Cook isn&#39;t a product person. There are quite possibly zero product sensibility within Tim Cook. And I am not sure who is in-charge of the PR now either. Their message are delusional, hypocritical and reminds me a lot of Google in the 00s.   I missed Katie Cotton&#39;s era.[1] (76:30 ) https://on.wsj.com/2zWWqPU"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m not surprised but a little disappointed that most of the older techniques aren’t mentioned:- checkbox/radio inputs can be used to toggle state with `:checked ~ .foo` selectors- `:focus` (and now `:focus-within`, and `:active` though it’s less useful) can be used similarly, but also allow child selection [Edit to add: `tabindex=&#34;-1&#34;` makes anything focusable with a pointer input, but doesn’t capture keyboard tab or  iteration with assistive tools]- `:target` can be used similarly, paired with fragment links [Edit to add: but beware history entries, this can be a poor UX]- `&lt;label&gt;` can be used to not only set those states but also trigger scrolls (including within `scroll-snap` parents) without creating navigation history entries- the `attr()` function can be used to reference server-dynamic HTML data for display with `content` in pseudo-elements- I have to assume CSS animations are adopted widely enough that people aren’t using JS for that where it isn’t needed; but you can also use declarative, even interactive, animations in SVG- speaking of which, inline SVG (even `&lt;use&gt;` references) are part of the CSS cascade, and you can change any CSS-addressable property with `currentColor`- and you can nest HTML in SVG with `&lt;foreignObject&gt;` if you want to use SVG techniques in HTML- probably not worth mentioning but in case you don’t know... if you miss table layouts, you can use them with `display` on basically anything; if you want table semantics without tabular rendering you can override `display` as wellAlllllll of that being said, if you use these techniques check your stuff with assistive technologies!"</p>

Gtihub issue: https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/865The biggest issue that happens to me is that I&#39;ll have a large data table where I want `overflow-x:auto` with a sticky header, and this is just impossible without Javascript. Of course, the UX of such a table is not ideal, but sometimes nothing will substitute for a large data table when you have a lot of data that goes into a table and people want to see it."</p>

The rest was about software and programming (nice!)- third year: software and programming only (very nice!)So, about 80% of the students didn&#39;t pass the first year because of its heavy mathematics + physics content.Extra:- mathematics I = logic, Boolen algebra- mathematics II = calculus- matehmatics III = Multivariable calculus and something else I don&#39;t remember- mathematics IV = Complex analysis/complex variable calculus- physics I and II = electromagnetism and friends"</p>

Laziness has its virtues, but invariants, validity checks, run-time type checks, etc. should all be performed as early (and often) as possible - it&#39;s much easier to debug issues when the are proximate to an object or structure being created or modified, then when that data type is being used much later."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; One of the coolest parts of our codebase is the new general purpose language at its foundation. Though the semantics of the language are substantially different than Clojure, it’s defined entirely within Clojure using macros to express the differing behavior. It compiles directly to bytecode using the ASM library. The rest of our system is built using both this language and vanilla Clojure, interoperating seamlessly.Actually this sounds quite horrible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is what I imagine experienced clojure developers can squeeze out of a language like clojure. I would venture that they can train a junior programmer in a couple of weeks, and make them productive very fast.I guess they could make it work in any language but judging by the description clojure is indeed a great fit, due to the macro capabilities, flexibility and solid runtime via JVM."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27388587">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is the most shocking article I have ever read in my life. I&#39;d ask everyone to please read it because it is incredible.One thing I did not realize is that US researchers who conducted gain of function research tried to downplay and discredit the possibility of the virus originating from the wuhan lab. There was an anti-lab theory Lancet statement signed by scientists, and &#34;Daszak had not only signed but organized the influential Lancet statement, with the intention of concealing his role and creating the impression of scientific unanimity.&#34;Plus there&#39;s all the stuff about the miners shoveling bat poop for weeks and then dying of coronaviruses, and the Wuhan institute collecting and doing gain of function research on these similar-to-SARS samples. And then several of the lab&#39;s gain of function researchers became ill in late 2019. And there&#39;s the weird renaming of samples to hide the unmatched closeness of the mine samples and covid. This is just the absolute surface of the article. There&#39;s too much to list hereEdit: here&#39;s another amazement for the list: &#34;Shi Zhengli herself had publicly acknowledged that, until the pandemic, all of her team’s coronavirus research — some involving live SARS-like viruses — had been conducted in less secure BSL-3 and even BSL-2 laboratories.&#34; And the article says &#34;BSL-2 [is] roughly as secure as an American dentist’s office.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While this article is quite illuminating on the political side of the lab leak theory, on the evidence side it&#39;s mostly a rehash of some long-standing speculations.The only recent evidence it contains is the fact that 3 researchers from WIV sought hospital care back in autumn of 2019 with symptoms similar to COVID. However, this piece of evidence is hardly consequential without further details:- First, most common symptoms of COVID are indistinguishable from common cold. If the researchers were known to have any &#34;signature&#34; symptoms like loss of smell the article would certainly mention it.- Second and more importantly, China doesn&#39;t have a robust GP/family doctor system found in western countries. As a result, many people would go to hospitals directly whenever they&#39;re mildly sick.Taking the evidence as we know it now, the straightforward explanation is that 3 researchers caught cold, got mildly sick, so went to the hospital to get prescriptions or doctor&#39;s notes for sick leave (in China it&#39;s common for employers to require a doctor&#39;s note even for a short sick leave).That said, I believe the lab leak theory is still plausible, and shouldn&#39;t be ruled out unless a clear transmission path from bat to human has been identified (which was done for the 2002 SARS outbreak). But I also think that we may never know. I trust that some theories put forward were in good faith, but so far they are little more than speculations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Assuming the chance of a lab leak is non-zero, it is worth considering how this will ever end.- If there was any hard evidence actually proving they had SARS-CoV-2 in the lab before the pandemic, it will be long gone. Only an independent full access forensic level investigation would ever find any sign that evidence was destroyed, and that is never going to happen.- It seems extremely unlikely to me that anyone from within China will A) blow the whistle or B) that we would hear about it.- If a whistleblower were to escape the country, China would be able to claim they are lying, and it is a plot by the West to oppress the Chinese people etc. The chance that the whistleblower would be carrying irrefutable evidence of a lab leak is again almost zero.We can keep shaking the tree, but I don&#39;t think anything truly satisfying is going to fall out. Consider that even if the USA for example had actual evidence of a lab leak, they would be better off using this as leverage over China secretly than releasing it publicly.What actually can and should happen, is that some major change comes to virology research to absolutely minimise the chance of another lab origin pandemic. Wherever SARS-CoV-2 came from, we have had lab leaks before and we will have them again, that much is certain."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So I was interested in how well Boom was doing in keeping to its timeline, and found an article from two years ago:https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/01/supersonic-passenger...Some side-by-side comparisons:2019 article:  &#34;Boom envisions its Overture airliner traveling at Mach 2.2.&#34;  2021 article:  &#34;a plane that could fly at Mach 1.7&#34;2019 article:  &#34;Its planes could be ready for commercial service in the mid-2020s&#34;.  2021 article:  &#34;It is targeting the start of passenger service in 2029.&#34;The 2019 article also says that Boom is constructing a 1/3rd scale version of Overture that could be making test flights later in 2019.  This article from October 2020 says that the 1/3rd scale vehicle was &#34;rolled out&#34; in 2020 and could be ready for test flights in Q3 2021. https://www.forbes.com/sites/erictegler/2020/10/26/boom-supe..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great to see so much innovation in aerospace. Boom has said they&#39;re going to reduce noise, but they&#39;ve also said they&#39;ll only fly supersonic over water with buffers between supersonic zones and populated areas. So the &#39;boom&#39;, as it were, is still a concern.I&#39;m super interested to see how quiet their planes are at subsonic. If you ever saw the Concorde flying subsonic, it was unbelievably loud. Nothing to do with being supersonic - their engines were just obnoxiously loud. Came into Cape Town a long time ago and made the whole town rumble on final.In this blog post: https://blog.boomsupersonic.com/booms-principles-of-sustaina.....Boom says: &#34;Today’s subsonic commercial aircraft are 80% more fuel efficient than those of the 1960s, and noise footprints have shrunk up to 90% in the last 50 years. This technological progress has fueled Boom’s efforts to design a supersonic airliner that makes economic sense for airlines and their customers. &#34;However, the innovation that enabled this is high bypass turbofan engines. Turns out if you move more air slower, it&#39;s way quieter and more fuel efficient because physics. Boom can&#39;t take advantage of this - at least directly, because they have to go supersonic. A high bypass turbofan engine is huge, by it&#39;s very nature. At supersonic speeds this presents a lot of drag. That&#39;s why I&#39;m super curious how they plan to be quiet and fuel efficient while also being supersonic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Problems with supersonic (?):- Noise means you can&#39;t do US domestic- Concorde didn&#39;t have the range for Pacific- Costs didn&#39;t work for Atlantic routes- And airlines want lots of identical planes, not one special one for one routeWhich ones has Boom solved?https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/1400425028022308874"</p>

In other words, this will only work if it means company&#39;s are taking the threat more seriously, not less."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reminds me of when Apple started providing &#34;smaller size updates&#34; to OS X.  I was curious about the details since my doctorate had touched on the topic, so I worked my contacts (I had a few in Apple engineering from the FreeBSD / OS X relationship) and after a few months I got back as answer: &#34;We&#39;re using a tool called bsdiff, are you familiar with it?&#34;  I was indeed, since I was the author of said tool.(Just to be clear, there was no license violation involved in this case; just a lack of awareness of the provenance of the open source software they were using.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My stories are very minor. I did my PhD in a reasonably well regarded mechanical engineering lab. My area is experimental fluid mechanics. I ended up writing a lot of Matlab code while there and even worked with a spin out company from the lab in the biotech sector for a while.I&#39;d get a lot of other students coming to me for coding help. Most just wanted me to do their job for them and I was too naive to say no. One wanted to count cells in a microfluidic device using image processing. I sat down with them for a couple of hours and walked them through a few methods they could look into to get started collecting all the examples in a script. Basic stuff so they wouldn&#39;t feel overwhelmed. A few months later I see he published my simple introduction as a paper with zero modifications. He had the good grace to at least thank me in the acknowledgments.Several years later while working a $BIG_TECH lab we interviewed a candidate from my old lab. They presented their work and had performed some data analysis of thermal camera images. Turns out they were using a script I&#39;d written there and it was still actively used to work with the thermal camera. Nobody ever modified or improved the code — many engineering students are terrified of code. I was annoyed because there was no interest in further development the code, I don&#39;t think they even read it or understood it.While at the spinout company I developed a software tool for the PCR optofluidics platform that was being developed. It was considerably faster and more robust than the hacked together script they were using before and had a user friendly UI that I build with feedback from the biologists on the team. A few years later the founder and one of their new students published a paper documenting their amazing tool without any reference or acknowledgment whatsoever. That one pissed me off.There is a lot of ignorance around code authorship and respect for the developer in physical sciences research. Like I said, many are terrified by code but don&#39;t value the time and expertise it requires; once they have it they no longer think about its maintenance or acknowledging the author."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Years ago, I interviewed a candidate for a role on my team.  As usual, one of the ways I break the ice with candidates is to get them to talk &#34;war stories&#34;.The team he&#39;d worked on had produced a tool that was only ever intended to be used by the team to solve a particular problem they had.  It contained proprietary code.Unknown to the team, word had spread about the tool, and others had started to use it, including solutions architects.  Who started shipping it to customers to use, who absolutely loved it.That&#39;d be fine except one of the core libraries it used was GPLv3 licensed, and there was non-open source proprietary code used in the tool.The nightmare scenario he found himself in was having to rapidly re-architect the tool around a non-GPLv3 licensed library, without breaking any functionality, all the while having to have regular sync up meetings with a furious CEO and Legal department (who, to be clear, were mad about the situation, not this particular developer or his team, who weren&#39;t to blame)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got reasonably far in stats -- up to a single grad level course.My biggest problem with the teaching of math (and I can weigh in on this a bit because I spent over a decade as a private tutor of math) is that math is often not introduced in a concrete manner, as well as in a way such that its utility is obvious.  These are two sides of the same coin.You can see this problem in most Wikipedia math pages.  I took more math than most physics majors and I find quite a lot of what I stumble across either baffling or of unknown utility.  Set theory is a great instance of this.  I rarely see multiple examples listed as it is explained, nor does anyone bother to tell me what it is for, other than to do more set theory.Stats at least has the benefit of having to stick closer to applicability, I think."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not quite as simple as &#34;it works like &#39;Lord of the Flies&#39; or it doesn&#39;t&#34;.  Nicholas Christakis, in his book &#34;Blueprint&#34;, devotes a chapter to a database that he and his grad students made of shipwrecks, where the survivors lived long enough, in enough isolation, that they had to more or less put together a temporary society.  There were lots of cases where they turned on each other, and lots of cases where they did not.My review of Christakis&#39; book, in case you&#39;re curious: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2851365787"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It shouldn&#39;t be glossed over that these were six boys from a boarding school on a getaway. So, unless there were only six pupils in the boarding school, it would mean that this was a group of boys who like and trust each other enough to let in on a plan which could get them into serious trouble if the wrong person found out about it. Also, the school being a boarding school implies that the group had a preexisting social structure, and that they had been literally living together before the event.So, it&#39;s sort of a best case scenario of &#39;a group of boys forming a society on a deserted island&#39;.EDIT: Another commenter posted an audio interview with one of the survivors, highly recommended:
https://www.rnz.co.nz/audio/player?audio_id=2018746636"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s a wonderful story and and an uplifting rebuttal to Lord of the Flies.But to be fair, six Tongan boys were probably far hardier and well equipped than the typical British schoolboy of that time would have been. It seems they thought nothing of stealing a fishing boat and heading to sea, and they most likely had abundant life skills already - they basically relocated from life on one pacific island to another.So a great story but I don&#39;t know how much can be extrapolated from it about human behaviour in general."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m surprised at the negativity here. I agree with this decision.When I saw it was a 6-3 decision my first instinct was &#34;oh another conservative-liberal divide&#34; but no it isn&#39;t. I&#39;m actually surprised to find Thomas dissenting since he&#39;s just. a stickler for the literal text.To me the ruling seems correct: the offender may have exceeded department rules and such access by that measure was &#34;unauthorized&#34; but he was not an unauthorized user to the system.It&#39;s refreshing to see limits to the overreach on what constitutes &#34;hacking&#34;. This isn&#39;t hacking.Were this ruling in effect when Aaron Swartz was charged, I very much suspect it would&#39;ve invalidated the hacking charges under the CFAA (since he used a guest account he had access to)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am loath to defend agents of the government, law officers or otherwise; but I have to agree with the decision here.Van Buren violated department policy, and perhaps other laws in his conduct. But he did not gain unauthorized access to a system. He already had authorized access - he just used it improperly.Similarly, if I were granted access to my company&#39;s production database to perform some kind of operation that required me to read/write data, and I used that privilege to access financial records of customers, I would certainly be violating my company&#39;s policy and likely some privacy and financial laws. But it would not be gaining unauthorized access, as I was explicitly granted access to that system - just for a different purpose."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I guess this is the part that matters most?&#34;We must decide whether Van Buren also violated
the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 (CFAA), which
makes it illegal “to access a computer with authorization
and to use such access to obtain or alter information in the
computer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain or
alter.”
He did not. This provision covers those who obtain information from particular areas in the computer—such as
files, folders, or databases—to which their computer access
does not extend. It does not cover those who, like Van Buren, have improper motives for obtaining information that
is otherwise available to them&#34;Thomas, Alito and Roberts dissented, and I hate to say it, but I agree with them.&#34;The question here is straightforward: Would an ordinary
reader of the English language understand Van Buren to
have “exceed[ed] authorized access” to the database when
he used it under circumstances that were expressly forbidden? In my view, the answer is yes. The necessary precondition that permitted him to obtain that data was absent.&#34;That&#39;s Thomas dissenting."</p>

Supposedly all operations must be submitted in the an &#34;E-fogging Submission System&#34;, but as far as I can tell, there&#39;s no visibility into this.Singapore has also recently declared a &#34;climate change emergency&#34;, and I&#39;d consider biodiversity, at the very least, a part of that.My point is that: if the Singapore Government is unable or unwilling to manage this with a sense of urgency (or &#34;emergency&#34;), then I&#39;m not generally hopeful.(1) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fogging_(insect_control)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I work for another company that is going to do a partial return to office.  I will be looking at options for companies that offer full in person office (or 90% in person office) after things settle down.  I  have worked full remote for a total of 5 years of my career, and I believe working in the office is a competitive advantage.* Overhearing hallway conversations (and joining them) helps spawn invocation.* I often do/did paired programming, and over-the-shoulder code reviews.  These are easier in person* Having a workforce socially close improves productivity because everyone wants to step up for each other.* Being seen by my fellow employees helps keep me from becoming distracted.* Working at the office helps prevent home life from being distracting during work hours.There are some personal benefits I enjoy from being in the office.* I save money by spending less on food, drinks, and electricity.* I enjoy the routine.* I had a stronger work/life separation.  I rarely turned on my work laptop at home."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some here are being honest, so I&#39;ll be brutally honest: Covid has upset the master-slave relationship, and they&#39;re realizing they&#39;re giving up too much control.  Yes, even the supposedly forward-thinking, progressive tech world.It&#39;s so much easier to ignore the BS of &#34;company culture,&#34; &#34;a new family&#34; and other such nonsense when working remote.  Plenty of people here have outright stated they work as a way to fund their lives and they couldn&#39;t care less about &#34;the mission,&#34; &#34;changing the world&#34; and other similar lies.  When WFH you only need to put on a show (and sometimes pants!) when on a video call, then you can relax and get your work done and shut out the BS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I never thought I&#39;d handle WFH well. When job-hunting, I&#39;d always ignore fully remote jobs. It sounded totally depressing and demotivating to sit at home and interact with my coworkers virtually. I also always valued the office perks.During the first few months, it felt like WFH stripped out all the non-work aspects of my job. At Google those perks were substantial, and it put the work itself in full focus.But you know what? I like it now. I&#39;m able to put in more focused work between 9 and 6 because I can take real breaks. There&#39;s less BS intruding on my life. In the office, your breaks feel more limited to 1) walking to grab a snack in the kitchen, 2) scrolling through something at your desk, or 3) going all the way outside to take a walk. 2/3 of these make you look like a slacker when you do them too much, so I always ended up doing a lot of &#34;pretending to work&#34; breaks to refresh my mind. That said, nobody ever had a problem with my performance.Now I can pop out and walk around the block in 10 minutes, or wander into my back yard. I can do manual chores and intersperse them with knowledge work to give myself a break. I also don&#39;t have to commute for 2 hours each day. This means I have more time and willpower and actually get more done. I actually measure every minute of focused work, which is how I know."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"These are the kinds of articles I love to see on HN!I think it&#39;s so interesting to see how different OS&#39; have approached these long lived operations over the years. Arguably, *nix OS&#39; have been able to move past these problems since it appears that package management is much more of a first party concern. &#34;Oh, you want to upgrade this utility? Well, I rely on these other things so you should update them too.&#34;I&#39;m a webdev so a lot of this is foreign to me w/ how it actually all functions but it&#39;s cool to read about these problems and speculate how/why they came to be and why they may only exist on certain platforms."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting, didn&#39;t even know you can cut files from a zip in that Windows zip file viewer. I would have thought it&#39;s some read-only filesystem like viewing a mounted CD or so.In that context I wonder if you could cut from rewritable CD-RWs as well back in the day (can&#39;t remember) - that seems like another abstraction that&#39;s similarly slow in reality."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having written a shell namespace extension, I now use the concept as a great example of making the wrong abstraction interestingly enough. Shell namespaces are a odd win32 concept rather than a filesystem concept and cause a lot of headaches (read support calls) when people see that they work in explorer, but not from arbitrary applications depending on how they use the underlying APIs. If you&#39;re trying to abstract the filesystem with pluggable components... abstract _the filesystem_ with pluggable components.It&#39;d be interesting to now what lead to the architectural decision of wear to cut that abstraction. It feels like a Microsoft team balkanization issue (the explorer team and POs being different from the NT kernel ones, I assume?), but it&#39;s near impossible to know without inside knowledge."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My first job out of college was scanning books for the Internet Archive down in the basement of the Library of Congress. Their scanning machines used a foot pedal to raise and lower the glass Platen, so I&#39;d use one hand to flip the page and wiggle the cradle to get things nice and flat and the other would snap the photo. You can get pretty fast after a while, but boy is it mindless. Older books that had been rebound a couple times already were the hardest to work with as you have the least amount of margin. There&#39;s a bunch of different sized dowels that we would put under the spine in the cradle so the glass could gain a couple millimeters of margin, just enough to avoid cutting off text. Worst case scenario the book had to be unbound in order to capture. I did get to flip through a lot of cool old illustrated catalogues like this: https://archive.org/details/illustratedcatal00keil/page/14/m..."</p>

My one had 2 Nikon mirrorless cameras controlled via Pi-Scan. https://github.com/Tenrec-Builders/pi-scanI had a smaller toggle switch wired to the GPIO pins so I could click the scan next button without having to take my hands of the book. Once I got used to the workflow I could scan about 1000 pages per hour while watching Netflix.I replaced it with a Czur scanner that isn&#39;t as good, but is a lot smaller and is good enough for my less demanding needs now that I&#39;m not doing a masters degree :D"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At Japan in the meantime, people in book scanning community (that exists) often just cut the book spine and scan the pages using normal scanner, throw it away once all the pages are scanned.People (rightly) value room spaces than books there.
It&#39;s called &#34;Ji-sui&#34; (scanning by oneself)  and gear recommendation sites like [1] are abundant. Another reason of &#34;Ji-sui&#34; prevalence was the poor availability of ebooks, although that reason was less relevant today.[1] http://monomania.sblo.jp/article/60578693.html"</p>

If I need a 15 minute break, I can start a load of laundry, or run the dishwasher, or do some other chore.I can wake up later since I don&#39;t have a commute. I don&#39;t lose two hours a day due to the commute.I can wear as comfortable clothing as I desire. I can delay my shower until after my daily workout (Which I can do since my workout equipment is at home).I can control my environment so there are as many or as few distractions as i like. I can put on videos or audio that might not be considered work appropriate. I can use speakers since no one is around me to hear the sound.The number and magnitude of inconveniences we subject ourselves to by heading to an office every day has been fully revealed. I will do all I can to work from home for the rest of my life."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"OK. I WFH as well. I know all the benefits. And as I&#39;m WFH for pandemic only I&#39;ve been trying to find remote work post-pandemic and there I realized some bitter points:1. I compete for positions with people all over the world. Who can complete with a fraction of the salary I need.2. As a remote worker -most often working as a contractor- I&#39;m even easier to be replaced in a heartbeat. No severance or anything alike.3. Did I mention that I compete with all the planet? That makes competition for good roles really crazy.4. Work blends into life and it is very hard to keep it from. This gets worse depending on the company/role but in general these things tend to go the employers way not yours.5. You need to find new ways to socialize (and the motivation to do so is minimal) or you risk mental health issues.All I&#39;m trying to say is be careful what you wish for because you might get it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hope this is the start of a nation wide trend towards better work life balance. Production output has gone up over the past few decades and we’re expected to work the same amount of hours. I think the future probably looks something like 4 6-hour work days each week.

I switch to vscode when I want to do something my emacs setup isn&#39;t yet good for (like, working with Typescript).On the flip side, I use sublime text as a notepad replacement because it&#39;s that fast.

Why aren&#39;t there a supported compact mode, and why is the normal mode so full of unnecessary padding?With the new design my bookmarks menu that previously had plenty of vertical space left now needs scrolling. Tabs have poor contrast and lack visual anchoring to the web content they contain.I&#39;m going to keep browser.proton.enabled to false in about:config as long as it&#39;s possible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"People have the cause and effect backwards in my opinion. You know why &#34;binge drinking&#34; isn&#39;t a problem in Germany, except for when the Australians turn up for Oktoberfest? It&#39;s because you can just buy a beer on the side of the road with your currywurst, and drink it without being hassled. If you act up, you get arrested for acting up. Try openly having a few beers in the park in Australia or the US, you&#39;ll be run out by the constabulary, or at the least they&#39;ll make you empty it in the trash. When you treat people like naughty children and bake into your culture the idea that drinking is itself an anti-social behaviour that always leads to fighting and dickheaddery, then that&#39;s how they act."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Title is definitely true (america has a drinking problem), in a way. Excessive drinking is normalized, though not as common as problem drinkers think. Since college I always drank too much, but my real issue was that I assumed everybody drank as much as I did (maybe 20-30 drinks per week). Since I wasn&#39;t drinking as soon as I woke up or getting shakes without drinking, I thought I was fine. It wasn&#39;t until I realized that I drank waaayyy more than most people that I started working on reducing consumption. Thankfully I only drank that much because I just have fun being drunk or enjoy the taste - I&#39;ve never used alcohol to cope with stress, anxiety, shyness, etc - so it was easy when I decided to go cold turkey for a month. So I&#39;m sharing in hopes that I can help someone else realize they drink too much even if they don&#39;t think they do, and that it&#39;s totally doable to cut back.Just in this one month, I&#39;ve already noticed a huge difference in my life. It&#39;s amazing to wake up rested and energetic every day, never having that dread about a hangover, being groggy, or wondering if I did something embarrassing last night. I feel present in everything I do, rather than having my routine and my attention thrown off by alcohol. Saving calories makes my weight more stable and lets me indulge in more food if I want to. I&#39;m saving tons of money, especially at restaurants. I&#39;m already regaining the hyperactivity and excitement towards life and events that I had in grade school before I started drinking, because now I can look forward to stuff other than getting drunk. It feels great to go to parties, restaurants, watch a movie, go on a date, do anything, and not even think about alcohol. For me drinking was fun and easy, but now I&#39;ve learned that drinking is shallow and comes at way too high of a cost compared compared to the deep joy of living sober and enjoying life for its own sake again.I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to recommend drinking less to anybody who does drink. You don&#39;t need to be black and white and think that it&#39;s either cold turkey or stay where you are. You don&#39;t need to worry about the &#34;benefits&#34; you get from red wine and whatever other stuff people love to talk about. Just try drinking less. Maybe don&#39;t drink on weekdays, set a maximum number you can drink in a day, take a 1-day break, take a 1-week break, start drinking lower-percentage drinks, set a maximum number of drinks per week, there are tons of options. I tried them all and over time I was able to consistently reduce how much I drank. I used to have trouble imagining not drinking during a weekend, and now I&#39;m already having trouble imagining wanting to drink more than a few times a month at most.Alcohol is like junk food or soda. It&#39;s fun and it&#39;s easy. But life is a lot better if you can break the habit and stop making it part of your life, or at least make it a once-in-a-blue-moon indulgence rather than a regular thing. Learn to love things with deeper and healthier value. If you don&#39;t control these things, there&#39;s the risk that you&#39;ll gradually get worse over time. You don&#39;t want to look at yourself in 20 years and realize you gained 50+ lbs and don&#39;t recognize yourself because you didn&#39;t take the chips or chocolate seriously. You don&#39;t want to look at yourself in 20 years and realize you have cirrhosis or heart disease because you didn&#39;t tone down the drinking. You don&#39;t have to be obese or an alcoholic to benefit from making healthy lifestyle changes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My favorite OBS feature is that you can bring in transparent browser windows all over the place. As such, I have my work conferencing set up so my time appears in the upper-right corner. I’m on the east coast and everyone I work with is on the west coast. It’s a nice way to remind them of my current time. (It also passive aggressively animated to purple with a moon when its “after hours,” a/k/a 5pm for me.)I also have shortcuts to pull in live weather conditions, our company stock price, crypto prices for fun, a 1- and 3- and 5-minute timer, as well as a countdown of days until important work events.It’s fun, and all just a bit of HTML and CSS and JS. (And PHP/cURL/cron to pull stock and weather prices in the background.) All this for free with OBS.Easily a top 5 app for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Excited for this release since it contains M1 Apple VT H264 Hardware Encoding support[1] — I know on my Intel Mac, OBS would massacre the CPU if I didn&#39;t have the hardware encoding enabled. On the M1 it&#39;s not quite so bad, but being able to use hardware encoding does save a lot of CPU cycles when streaming at higher bitrates![1] https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/4170"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I haven&#39;t heard of using docker compose for production development, only local development. In production I normally see people building production images and spinning up them up in their cloud with Terraform and whatever other infrastructure they need, especially for databases where your local MySQL container isn&#39;t going to be configured or provisioned like an AWS RDS instance. What do you hand a docker-compose file off to in production? Swarm? When would you choose this path over a separate system to provision your production resources (like Terraform)?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had remembered docker&#39;s own documentation in the past recommending against using compose at all in production, but that is apparently no longer the case: https://docs.docker.com/compose/production/I&#39;m fairly surprised by this. You can deploy a fairly similar compose file into a Docker swarm cluster, but if you&#39;re doing a single-server deployment of everything, that is awfully brittle for production, to say nothing of considerations brought up in other comments where you may be using managed services from a cloud provider for things like database and caching in production but you&#39;re probably just spinning up a local postgres server on your laptop for development."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The thing about smoking is that when you quit smoking you quit it every day. Imagine a light switch on the wall. You turn it off by quitting smoking and you can always go back at a desperate time for instance and turn it on. And some time later off again. Smoking your first cigarette implants that light switch on your mind and you can&#39;t make it go away. Since you know how it makes you feel good when the switch is on, you at some level desire to back to it. Whole idea of quitting smoking is then finding ways to stop yourself from turning it on again and this is true until you die. So do yourself a favor and avoid any substance that creates such light switches in your mind.Edit: Of course this is not the case for 100% of humans. Everyone is different. Some weak some strong in willpower, discipline, etc. But we can all agree that it is an addiction that sucks life out of you slowly. You wouldn&#39;t want to test your willpower your whole life against such a sneaky enemy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I started smoking when i went to study in China. Someone gifted me an expensive brand of cigarette, and I kept it hidden in a drawer for two weeks as I didn&#39;t smoke. One very cold day with no where to go and nothing to do, I took the pack out and lit one stick. My did it have a lovely scent. The heat it created inside me was also soothing. It took me about a week and half to finish the pack of 21 cigs. I couldn&#39;t afford to buy the same brand often but i had become addicted to smoking. I struggled with anxiety back then and smoking calmed my nerves. Within 1 year I was smoking 2 packs a day.Smoking is frowned upon in Ghana, so upon my return there were few places I could smoke. One day while out and about I got really anxious about something and I needed a cig badly. I had to go some distance to get one, and even got a harder time finding a place to hide and smoke. I felt like I was committing the most heinous of crimes cause I had to take off my shirt to ensure the smell didn&#39;t stick on me. I didn&#39;t even enjoy the smoke because the quality wasn&#39;t that good, I smoked in a hurry and kept looking over my shoulder. I simply couldn&#39;t live like that anymore. So I quit after that day. The next time I tried to smoke again was 2 months later. I couldn&#39;t even finish a stick as it made me feel sick. I have disliked the smell of cigarettes ever since. And that was 7 years ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ian Banks in his novel Complicity writes powerfully decrying smoking. Quoting from the novel.  I take out another cigarette, light it and draw deeply. I 
  gag again, coughing and hacking and feeling the whisky 
  and the can of Export I had earlier slosh around inside 
  me, almost coming up. My eyes are watering. What a stupid 
  drug, what a completely useless fucking drug; no real hit 
  after the first drag, highly addictive and lethal in all 
  sorts of ways, and even if the lung cancer or the heart 
  disease doesn&#39;t get you you can look forward to 
  gangrenous legs in your old age, bits of your body just 
  rotting away still attached and dying in instalments for 
  you, rotting and stinking while you&#39;re still alive and 
  then they have to cut them off and you wake up after the 
  operation wheezing and burning with pain and gasping for 
  a fag. Meanwhile the tobacco companies sponsor sport and 
  fight off advertising bans and look forward to all the 
  new markets in the East and the Far East and more women 
  taking up the weed to show that they can be brainless 
  fucks too, and suits with worm-shit in their brains go on 
  television and say, &#39;Well, nobody&#39;s actually proved how 
  tobacco causes cancer you know&#39;, and you sit there 
  seething and then you find Thatcher is taking half a 
  million from Philip Morris for a three-year find 
  consultancy and you swear never to buy any of their 
  products ever again but at the end of the day you still 
  light another cigarette and suck in the smoke like you 
  enjoyed it and make more profits for those evil fucks.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Let&#39;s be clear about this, the donation money isn&#39;t just used to keep the encyclopedia online. They have hundreds of language versions of Wikipedia itself, and many related &#34;sister&#34; projects, with perhaps the most clearly impacting being Wikimedia Commons (a huge repository of free-content media with a focus on educational use - including much media in the public domain) and Wikidata (a project that has now emerged as the closest thing to a &#39;hub&#39; in the still-developing Semantic Web ecosystem).  Quite a bit of their funding also enables growth in least-developed countries, where access to high-quality educational content in local languages is going to be especially impactful wrt. broader development goals.People like to focus on the excess growth of management roles within the foundation and call it &#34;cancer&#34;, but all large organizations have some possible waste within them.  It might just be one of the many costs of doing business and pursuing what are in reality some very ambitious and perhaps worthwhile goals.  And building a long-term endowment only looks like the prudent thing to do, since the results of fundraising can be quite volatile and uncertain."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The WMF also has high-flying, global plans to “become the essential infrastructure of the ecosystem of free knowledge” by 2030. It says it wants to create “knowledge equity”—a world where people everywhere will have as much access to information in their own language as a first-world citizen—and that this will require continuous budget increases.Godspeed to them in this endeavor. I think this is not the time to become absolute purists in the choice of tech overlords. The tech world is being controlled by less than a handful of trillion-dollar monopolists that crush anything that stands in their way. A few hundred million in this war is a drop in the ocean.Yes, power corrupts, and money is power. Yes, left to their own devices, people in NGOs will maximize revenues and expand their employee empires - just like those in the for-profit sector. What matters is the strategic goals and their execution by the leadership, and there is nothing - absolutely nothing - to indicate that WMF went astray from its stated mission.I cannot but feel this is another pissing contest like the open source world experienced, where everybody and their brother started their own distributions/forks to virtue signal their true commitment to the open source goals. This led to a massive fragmentation of the scene, the few companies that tried to use the model, like Redhat and Ubuntu, were exposed as deviationists from the party line; meanwhile big tech ate the world and put every man, woman and child on the planet in invisible jails."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ridiculous question and even more ridiculous factoids.The assumption that operating as a non-profit implies an entity should stop asking its audience for help advancing the mission, or that it should pay its necessary staff less than competitive wages...please.Give wikipedia more so they can take on the MUCH more well-endowed and entirely opaque private capital taking over nearly every other information outlet in the US and often around the world."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article suggests using a probabilistic failure model instead of a large a safety factor, and explains how a safety factor established in the 1930s affected the cost of the Space Shuttle. But spacecraft might be a special case, where any additional weight is so expensive, and you also expect the models to be especially accurate and manufacturing to be extremely precise.For more everyday civil engineering, I think the safety factor &#34;covers up&#34; a lot of systemic inaccuracies everywhere in the system, from modeling to design to manufacturing to unintended uses. Some of those you might account for in a probabilistic model. But it&#39;s very difficult to probabilistically model errors in the model itself, as the financial industry found out the hard way.When driving over a bridge built the way suggested here, how comfortable can we be that certain stresses aren&#39;t correlated in ways that the engineers didn&#39;t anticipate? Or that a certain distribution isn&#39;t actually as well approximated by a Gaussian as it was assumed to be? Intuitively, it&#39;s a lot harder to be wildly wrong with the factor of safety approach.To put this another way, a more complex way to reason about safety necessarily has more moving parts, and is thus more likely to be wrong. So in effect, adopting more complicated safety models introduces a safety risk all on its own. I think that needs to be considered as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Grossly increasing the factor of safety is a subtle way that science fiction stories connote a feeling of very advanced technology.For example in the JJ Abrams movie Star Trek Into Darkness we see the Enterprise operating at depth in an ocean, then dramatically zooming away into space. Then later another ship falls from orbital height and plows through San Francisco without losing its hull shape.In Star Wars the Millenium Falcon is constantly doing things that would seem to be outside a normal design for a spacecraft, and it survives (aside from the radar dish).Even as far back as the movie 2001, the monolith is made out of a material that humans can’t dent or cut. Why so strong? It’s basically just an automated radio.The idea is: this advanced civilization has such command over physical technology, that they can effortlessly engineer unnecessary strength without losing any of their designed performance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;&#34;&#34;A non-empirical alternative to the factor of safety has been around since the 1940s, but still doesn’t have widespread adoption. I think the image below describes the concept, called probabilistic design, best.&#34;&#34;&#34;This is _exactly_ LRFD (Load Factor Resistance Design) which has been in the Civil Engineering building codes since the mid 80&#39;s, and became common in use the 90&#39;s when I was an Engineer (in training).(It&#39;s the difference between the older green book and the newer (at the time) silver steel design handbook)It was absolutely drilled into us in school though, that Safety Factors and LRFD factors covered material and other uncertainty, they did not cover blunders."</p>

They were more expensive, as in a gazillion times more expensive. The delivery schedule was already falling at the time. They were already terrible planes at the time compared to their competition. Most hilarious of all, they don’t actually fit into our small country because they are loud, so the government is still buying up properties in areas that they’ll have to fly over because the noise levels are so illegal they have to let people move away. They are also struggling with what to do with the airspace in one of our Airports, because the only two routes these planes have around it is over the ocean (fine but typically avoided during rain because of the low altitude they fly to avoid the airport) and our second largest city, ooops.Somehow it still won, to no ones surprise. And that’s really just how it is. The US wants bases in Greenland? Well, it’s technically not really Danish territory but we’ll make an exception and to full colonial masters. The US wants a radar thing in one of our commercial airports? Sure! (Since moved to another part of Europe). The us wants access to data on Moslem citizens? sure thing!

Apart from cross-device sync, you can share your albums end-to-end encrypted, and filter photos by location and time.We recently had a &#34;successful&#34; launch on r/degoogle[3]. We wanted to Show HN after incorporating the feedback we received from there, but since OP asked, I thought I’ll drop a comment here.If you’ve any questions, please ask.[1]: https://ente.io[2]: https://github.com/ente-io[3]: https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/njatok/we_built_a..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you&#39;re willing to self-host, Photoprism[0] is pretty nice and easy to get up and running.It has the flavor of Google Photos, but it&#39;s definitely a step down in UX. One of the features I really love about Google Photos is the ability to jump quickly through time. Like if I&#39;m looking for a photo I took around June 2018, I can get to it in &lt;5 seconds.I didn&#39;t realize what a magical feature it is until I tried looking for it with alternatives and found that they all have a lot of scrolling, pausing to load new photos, more scrolling.But I&#39;m impressed with what Photoprism has achieved as a small, donation-funded OSS project, so I&#39;m hoping to see them grow.[0] https://photoprism.app"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To be honest, $2/month isn&#39;t that unreasonable from a useful service. I would definitely class Google Photos as useful, especially its ability to search for pictures.I personally use iCloud, and back everything to a Synology."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This story is amazing. The story of US war games seems to commonly be &#34;Yeah the Read Team won but...&#34; and no changes are made. Maybe those are just the stories I hear.It&#39;s also interesting to consider if the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor would have happened if it weren&#39;t for our own dress rehearsals we carried out in front of the Japanese. Maybe war games are a bad idea when they&#39;re too big to keep secret and you&#39;re too politicized to integrate the lessons. Admiral Yamamoto didn&#39;t have to worry about upsetting US Navy top brass. He was able to benefit from our lessons, even if we weren&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well, in retrospect it&#39;s easy to say that air power is the future and battleships are obsolete. But with the information available at the time, I don&#39;t think it really was that clear back in 1932. Back then, no capital ship had been sunk let alone been severely damaged(?) by aircraft. Aircraft, and in particular naval aircraft, at the time were flimsy biplanes, with monoplanes slowly entering the scene. Sinking a battleship with those? Pfft, entirely reasonably people said.I mean, put yourself into the hypothetical supreme naval planner of, say, the US or Japan at the time. Are you really going to gamble your entire nations (or empires, if you will) capability to project force overseas on the notion that air power is the future and battleships are obsolete? If you&#39;re wrong, the enemy battleship fleet will just shrug off your feeble aerial attacks and proceed to crush your navy and conquer your overseas assets.So in that sense it&#39;s no surprise that both USN and IJN built both battleships and carriers. And at least the US kept building them long after Pearl Harbor (though the Iowas were all ordered before Pearl Harbor, but they weren&#39;t cancelled in favor of carriers or converted into such either)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Colonel Billy Mitchell, the &#34;father of the US Air Force,&#34; was famously court marshalled in 1925. He had predicted that in the future Japan would attack Pearl Harbor with aircraft. He predicted &#39;aircraft traveling 1000 miles per hour would fight each other in the stratosphere&#39;. He predicted troopers would one day parachute behind enemy lines. He predicted long range heavy bombers. He aggressively argued for stronger investment in air power, against a resistent brass, who, irritated with him, had him court martialed. A great 1955 Gary Cooper film tells his tale, &#34;The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell.&#34; This is the climactic court martial scene:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecMYH3dPIUI"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The desktop is broken not because of the file/folder paradigm but because we stopped using files to represent information. Figma, Slack, and Notion should save their information to disk. You should be able to open a Notion document, or a Figma design, from your desktop, instead of through their Web interface. You should be able to save a Facebook post or Tweet and their replies to disk.Why can&#39;t you? Well, for one, social media companies don&#39;t want you to save stuff locally, because they can&#39;t serve ads with local content. Furthermore, browser APIs have never embraced the file system because there is still a large group of techies who think the browser should be for browsing documents and not virtualizing apps (spoiler: this argument is dead and nobody will ever go back to native apps again). Finally, the file system paradigm fails with shared content; you can&#39;t save a Google Doc to disk because then how can your friends or coworkers update it? It&#39;s much easier for Google to store the data on their server so that everyone can access it instead of you setting up some god-awful FTP-or-whatever solution so that your wife can pull up the grocery list at the store.I&#39;m hoping the new Chrome file system API will bring a new era of Web apps that respect the file system and allow you to e.g. load and save documents off your disk. However, this still won&#39;t be good enough for multiplayer apps, where many devices need to access the same content at the same time. I don&#39;t know if there is any real way we can go back to the P2P paradigm without destroying NAT - WebRTC tries but WebRTC itself resorts to server-based communication (TURN) when STUN fails."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That dialog also invokes so many issues with computers today.When I open a program, I want to use that program. I don&#39;t want to update it, I don&#39;t want to see all the new features, I want to USE it. I opened it because I had a task to complete and all this junk is getting in my way.And same when I close a program, as the author hits on very well.Basically, the computer/program/etc always wants me to do something for it, but it never asks for those things at an opportune time.No, I don&#39;t want to update my computer right now, and no, updating overnight tonight isn&#39;t good either because I need to keep this program running until tomorrow. I understand that your new UX is better for me, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll love it, but forcing that on me right now is preventing me from doing what I need to do. I see your error dialog describing some odd issue, but I don&#39;t have time to triage that right now and decide to take the time to fix it.I wish software would respect the human element more. My time and attention is valuable, please don&#39;t interrupt it carelessly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The essay did not convince me the need to rethink the desktop or sufficiently explain the idea of fragments versus work products.Yes, search is great when it works. You know what also works? Organization. I used search within folders of very large category to rapidly narrow stuff down.If the desktop ain&#39;t broke, it doesn&#39;t need fixing.Instead, I am thinking about all the dark patterns and anti-patterns, as well as performance hog, endless constant update, as well naggers trying to upsell you shit.There&#39;s a reason why I returned to linux.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing I&#39;ve seen happen again and again in a lot of technologies is a &#34;framework gravity&#34;. A lot of people see this as engineers just wanting to work on &#34;hype&#34; technology but I think what is actually happening is a reflection of global engineering time.React is great for SPAs. Most large companies are working on honest-to-god SPAs. By extension most engineers are working on SPAs. So most tooling is created for SPAs. Now if you aren&#39;t building an SPA you look around and find almost every resource is around building an SPA. Even if you know you don&#39;t need an SPA, it&#39;s easier to hire, iterate, and even use other open source solutions if you are building an SPA, so you try to hamfist your project into an SPA.It&#39;s a bit like having a bike commute in America. A bike might be the best thing for you to do - cheaper than a car, keeps you healthy and you don&#39;t need a garage. But you quickly find that everything is built for cars and it&#39;s easier to deal with the disadvantages of a car than try to commute with a bike.I remember thinking the same thing about Hadoop 5-6 years ago. If you had &#34;small data&#34; you could get what you wanted with SQL and fast disks. But everything else assumed you were on Hadoop. Newgrads were trained in hadoop. New tools were Hadoop first. New research was all hadoop. If you hit a small issue with your DB, almost every solution would be &#34;this is how it&#39;s solved in Hadoop&#34;. It was hard to even know if what you were trying to do what even possible without Hadoop.The only optimism I have is that maybe in 5 years we will all collectively wake up and stop trying to shove React everywhere just like we stopped with Hadoop."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The amazing part to me is that SPAs are so much harder to do right compared to old-school server-side rendered HTML. One could be forgiven if they think a &#34;simple&#34; SPA is a good starter project, but they&#39;d be very wrong. Async programming (Javascript Promises and/or async/await) is difficult, error-prone, and should be avoided whenever possible. On top of this, understanding how data flows through these SPAs is no small task.Compare this to server-side rendering where you run some DB queries, generate some HTML based on those results, and send it to the browser to be rendered.There are some cases where you actually need a rich experience in the browser. In those cases, I would start by seeing if plain old Javascript would work.In writing this, I definitely feel like a &#34;get off my lawn&#34; guy. But I&#39;ve just seen too many junior and senior engineers (me included) fall flat on their face trying to use these SPA frameworks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As mostly a user that doesn&#39;t develop web apps anymore, all this feels very true to me.I&#39;m soooooo sick of interfaces that load an empty useless shell of UX chrome and then slowly trickle in content at some later time, and leave spinners, or even worse, gray boxes simulating text.Send the text content in the initial reply, please! It&#39;s bad enough having to wait for webfonts, but when you wait to start doing the slow database query for content until after an html shell has been loaded, and after a huge JavaScript bundle has been parsed and executed, you&#39;re just wasting time. Reminds me of the Google Web Toolkit of yore. We really haven&#39;t progressed much in the decade for single-page apps since then, when it comes to the user. And that&#39;s a horrifying thought."</p>

So is it a wonder that people are dismissive of the results of other scientific research like climate change research?Overwork *CONTRIBUTES* to the death of more than 745k per year. It did not solely and directly cause those deaths. How would you even know if it did? But the claim of the title is that overwork killed them as if overwork popped out behind them with a gun and shot them. It&#39;s just obviously a nonsense claim. And once you put it this way, tons of things CONTRIBUTE to excessive deaths. Poor diet, exposure to many everyday chemicals, living in a city(air pollution).In fact, what are the odds that overwork doesn&#39;t correlate with living in a  higher air pollution environment? Anyway, the claim in the title is nonsense."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Like most people, I&#39;ve ordered a lot of packages (hundreds?) on Amazon and almost never had a problem. In the rare case of a problem, Amazon would instantly refund me. But almost all those orders are under $1000. Everything changes when you have a problem with an expensive order. Amazon has a price threshold where the support system is different and the normal CS people are powerless.During lockdown, I ordered a Sony camera and lens that was in the $5k+ range. The package went &#34;missing&#34; with the shipper with obvious fake tracking data, like multiple &#34;customer not home&#34; delivery attempts timestamped at 12am in the morning. The packages never showed up. Amazon kept saying it was the shipper&#39;s fault and the shipper said it was Amazon&#39;s responsibility. Lots of tweets, etc, got me nowhere.In the end Amazon finally refunded me, but it was a nightmare. They wouldn&#39;t even talk to me until I waited a number of days after the package was late and even then all they would say is that it had to be escalated to management who would review the issue eventually. Even when they finally agreed the package was lost, I had to wait for another management review to actually get the refund issued. They had my money tied up for weeks with no recourse for a package they never even delivered. I can only imagine how bad it would be if the shipper claimed it was delivered.My recommendation is to skip Amazon for anything expensive or at high risk of shipper theft/fraud. Your customer experience will not be the same as when they lose a $10 package. They will treat you like a criminal no matter what your past history with Amazon is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I do not trust Amazon to ship anything safely and securely anymore. Almost everything I receive is damaged, late, or mis-delivered. Books are especially abused somewhere in Amazon’s fulfillment. (They’re always bent, creased, or dirty.) Items that are supposed to be 1-day shipping typically take &gt;=3, and Amazon’s tracking mostly says “oops! it’ll come trust us”. (Not verbatim, obviously.)Amazon’s return process is becoming incrementally more obtuse as time goes on. While they’re still decently good, it’s getting harder to do easy, no-nonsense returns. Typically—if they don’t just tell me to dispose of the item myself—they demand I drive to Amazon lockers or Whole Foods or Kohl’s to drop stuff off at no charge, and pressure me into just getting Amazon credit.I would never buy a $7,000 item on Amazon under any circumstance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This was despite the fact that when boxed the Sony a1 weighs 3.22 lb (1.46 kg), and the Chiles’ package was listed by UPS as weighing only 2 lb (900 g).Not sure why Amazon was still arguing at this point. If UPS confirms the package was basically empty, then Amazon has no reason to believe the customer was lying."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seems like commenters are misreading the lawsuit here. My first instinct after reading the top paragraphs of Stoller&#39;s post was also &#34;so what, this seems fine,&#34; but if you read to the end and see what the suit is really alleging, it&#39;s not just a policy that punished sellers for offering discounts on their products when sold off Amazon. It&#39;s the fact that Amazon is charging anywhere between 30-45% in fees to the sellers, which is much higher than other online marketplaces and obviously less than the 0% they&#39;d charge themselves to sell through their own site (though they&#39;d still need to pay money to operate the site), and then punishing them if they sell somewhere else that has lower fees for a lower price.That seems like legitimately monopolistic behavior and something that is illegal and should be stopped. The post is still misleading in that it doesn&#39;t mean Amazon is raising prices across the board by 30-45%. But they are raising prices across the board by whatever the delta is between their fees and WalMart&#39;s fees, or some other marketplace that charges even less, minus the difference in shipping.Normally, market forces would solve this problem without any need for legal intervention, because some other marketplace like WalMart can just offer lower seller fees and attract all the sellers. But that doesn&#39;t happen precisely because Amazon&#39;s massive subscribed user base represents so much of the market that no can afford not to sell there, which is seemingly the definition of a monopoly and why legal intervention is called for. Lower-cost marketplaces can only compete if Amazon is not allowed to blackball sellers from access to the only customer base that matters."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know how some can see it as shady or misleading, but I still prefer it.  That is, I prefer having the price baked in, right in front of me...no surprises.  Versus some indy site I&#39;ll think &#39;oh only six bucks?  sure I&#39;ll try it&#39; only to be shown it&#39;s actually closer to 20 after shipping and tax.  That just wastes both our time.Further, even if it&#39;s a hair more expensive, I&#39;ll still pay it for the no hassle returns.  I recently purchased a knife I saw on Amazon, but decided to go through the seller&#39;s official site to save a couple dollars.  It was not worth it, and not something I&#39;ll do again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Now, if this were all that was happening, sellers and brands could just sell outside of Amazon, avoid the 35-45% commission, and charge a lower price to entice customers. “Buy Cheaper at Walmart.com!” should be in ads all over the web. But it’s not. And that’s where the main claim from Racine comes in. Amazon uses its Buy Box algorithm to make sure that sellers can’t sell through a different store or even through their own site with a lower price and access Amazon customers, even if they would be able to sell it more cheaply. If they do, they get cut off from the Buy Box, and thus, cut off de facto from being able to sell on Amazon.&#34;This was the missing piece for me. Would like to see more specifics about how Amazon does this."</p>

I once worked in a lab where we would have frequent catastrophic failures because there was never any disaster planning or contingency management plan. I personally triaged 3 such incidents alone or with people who happened to be there when the problem arose and attempted to disseminate some suggestions for how to prevent similar problems in the future. No one was interested. People were primarily interested in tearing my head off because I hadn&#39;t handled the problem the way they would have done it (of course, they were out drinking beers or sleeping while I was dealing with the issue at 12 AM or on a weekend).After the third time I said fuck it, the next time there is an issue I am going to insure my own projects are safe and then I&#39;m going home and turning my phone off.

The reality is that the internet was immediately extremely interesting (either useful or fun) for practically everyone who got access. Email and ftp alone were killer apps. A bit later came Usenet and IRC and MUD gaming. There were things to download, people to meet, flame wars to participate in. People would stay up until 4am to get a chance to go online in university shared facilities.With cryptocurrency there’s nothing to do. You could pay $100 to buy a “cryptokitten” or whatever, but then you’d be stuck shilling it on somebody else somehow. The community is a mix of Scientology-like groupthink and multi-level marketing sales pitches. The early Internet was infinite times more fun."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These two resonated with me:&gt; A lot of intelligent observers look at cryptocurrency, see that it makes no sense, and reasonably infer that they must be missing something profound on the technical level. Tech culture has a nice tradition of not deriding new ideas, but we need to break it here and speak out&gt; [non-tech people] don&#39;t see the huge silent majority of tech people who know it&#39;s a scam.

I&#39;ve studied the space for months and have come to the conclusion that crypto is two-sided in almost every aspect.Many/most coins are speculative, which you can associate with words like &#34;greed&#34; and &#34;casino&#34;. Yet also provide wealth savings/growth to people locked out of it in our traditional system.NFTs are a cruel joke right now, yet ridiculous as they are, may be a precursor to various groundbreaking uses having real utility, in an exponential way.Smart contracts are largely dysfunctional, yet there&#39;s early success in replacing financial products like staking, lending, leverage. When it works, it&#39;s permission-less, which has interesting social benefits (access not defined by your identity/social class).And so on.I&#39;m not here to debate any of these points, my only point is to not dismiss crypto as a whole (binary thinking) and to not underestimate it. The topic is too complex for it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I will postulate an opposing view to TFA:Quality consumer goods are better in two key areas. First, they are replaceable. I don’t want a military grade mixer in my kitchen if getting a broken whisk or motor on it is going to require me hunting all over eBay for the specific part hoping it’s available. I was very excited at one point about the idea of getting a commercial dishwasher that can run a load of dishes in like 90 seconds. Problem with those is that you can’t go to Lowe’s and get a replacement part when it acts up. You have to call a restaurant equipment servicing company and pay them what a restaurant with a broken dishwasher would pay. Or more because you aren’t a frequent customer. Sure, maybe it’ll break less but here’s the thing: my modern LG dishwasher will be more convenient to use and if I get 10 years out of it rather than 20 I still spent only $1000 on the top of the line one rather than the $4k on a 10 year old used commercial unit that I will struggle with the entire time.Second, consumer goods are replaceable. I am used to my Kershaw knife. I broke it yesterday. I can get it serviced by the manufacturer or get a brand new one, or both. If I buy some special forces surplus knife and chip the blade I am either done with that knife or I’m taking it to a specialist or I’m buying a new one. Knowing that I can replace an item I’m used to when a one-for-one replacement is a comfort. Obviously that doesn’t work for everything but it works for items that are made by high quality manufacturers.Bonus: a military grade mixer is going to suck to make high end pastries because it’s geared towards making mashed potatoes for the troops. I feel like the author is romanticizing ma class of products that in reality aren’t all that amazing except in a couple of key areas that to most consumers aren’t as big of a deal. So while it’s possible that, as the author states, the average consumer is an idiot, I don’t see much evidence that the author is much ahead of the pack here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love to use professional-grade items where i can, but sometimes &#34;overkill&#34; means a worse product.  like the professional-grade fan - it&#39;s not just designed for a high duty cycle, it&#39;s also probably designed to be operated in an environment where people regularly use hearing protection, so quiet operation is not a consideration."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The average consumer is an idiot, so the bean counters keep milking them... They want pizzaz over functionality and durability. They want shiny stuff in a bigger box... The industrial, military and commercial market doesn&#39;t mess around. They want to purchase equipment that works reliably and performs to a specification. It&#39;s professional and their livelihood depends on it. It sort of self filters the entire market. Shitty things drop off the radar due to poor sales.This sounds like a cool hobby and conversation starter. But it&#39;s hard to take the author seriously when he proselytizes on the practical virtues of buying ejector seats over retail chairs. Industrial goods are often built for very specific use-cases. If those use-cases don&#39;t align with your own needs, you&#39;re just paying a lot of money for something you don&#39;t need. And often, something that fails to deliver on your actual needs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The idea that a field can be reformed by making it worse until it suddenly faces a reckoning and emerges much better is ... I don&#39;t know where people keep getting the idea that this might work. It has never worked in any field ever in history.The thing that can happen: fields gradually split into rigorous and non-rigorous camps. Like with evidence-based medicine, or chemistry/alchemy. Depending on the field, either might prevail in the market. Medical research and bridge-building are mostly rigorous, programming is mostly non-rigorous.AI/ML has a range of rigor levels, from fairly good to total crap. I think people in the field have a reasonable idea which is which. It&#39;s frustrating to people outside the field that think they can just take the technique with highest reported performance numbers and expect good results."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s worth noting: In most of these cases, even when caught, the guilty parties and the bad papers remain unnamed. There are known-to-the-editors fraudulent papers in major journals still being cited.The consequences of committing academic fraud are minor, and the consequences of not doing so generally mean no academic jobs or tenure.There isn&#39;t a 99.99% innocent claim here (as at the end of the article). This stuff is widespread. This is much more accurate:&#34;because everybody is complicit in this subtle fraud, nobody is willing to acknowledge its existence&#34;Littman is at Brown, where the majority of the CS department engages in this !@#$%. I&#39;m not trying to single out Brown. Parts of MIT, Stanford, etc. are even worse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I manage an applied research group in the machine learning space, particularly AutoML and synthetic data generation. That means is we read the latest literature and create applications. Sometimes we build new research, most of the time we patent something new. But the goal is to get research to production as fast and as impactful as possible.The first thing I do when sorting research (papers, blog posts, presentations, etc) is sort the research by “B.S.”, “maybe B.S.”, “probably real”.If you look at research papers in computer science, half are what have the following problem: “running a simulation over and over until the authors get the results They like”.I can’t tell you how many papers with thousands of citations are just blatantly wrong. They don’t run corrections based on the number of simulations they run, they don’t take into account other variables, etcThis isn’t limited to CS either. Biology, economics, environmental sciences, etc all suffer the same fate.The worst part about it, is it’s PEER REVIEWED. Meaning, others agree this is the way to do things, which is why I don’t trust academia almost at all."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;The turning point in my life was the day I realized to run great engineering teams I didn’t need to be the best engineer in the world, I needed to get good at advertising my people and their stories up the chain of command. I needed to improve their observability so that we can keep bureaucracy at bay by maintaining a high level of trust.&#34;Poof. Another Big Tech middle manager got their wings.This cynical surrendering is not keeping bureaucracy at bay, at all. It&#39;s joining the bureaucracy and increasing its size. It is the bureaucracy.At companies that have competent managers up and down the hierarchy, it doesn&#39;t have to be like this. Good work can be judged by good managers, and rewarded, without anyone having to play bureaucratic games. There are companies, mostly smaller, that work like this.It seems to reliably fail as companies scale, but for each company it might fail at a different point. The longer competent management can be maintained, the better chance of the company succeeding in a big way.But all it takes is one good manager hiring a bad manager and the whole thing can start to fall apart. Once the company culture starts to reward people for playing bureaucratic games more than doing good work, it becomes broken and dysfunctional. Diseased.Everyone quickly realizes that the dynamic has shifted. That good work isn&#39;t rewarded any better than bad work that is well marketed internally.And so the best people, who have the most confidence and ability, go to smaller/better companies that know how to reward the people that do the best work. The other people stay and settle in for long-term escalating bureaucratic warfare.And these broken companies are left to fail or ride out the momentum generated before they were broken. All the while being miserable places to work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I actually experienced an interesting incident that made me switch from Charter with no intention of ever giving them my business again. They had upgraded their default speed in my area from 200 Mbps to 300 Mbps but you wouldn&#39;t get it unless you called in for them to increased it. Then a short time later they announced it as a increase to service at no additional cost and it would automatically take affect. Then a couple of months later they reduced again and said it was never an option. I was just so annoyed I switched to 1 Gbps service for an extra $30. I really hope that one day cellular or satellite gut them. Charter/Spectrum is one crooked company that should be sued out of existence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Funny coincidence: The same week that the city started running conduit in our neighborhood for municipal fiber, a Xfinity &#34;account manager&#34; came to our door and left a handwritten note saying great customer service was their goal and to call him if there was ever a service problem!Funny how legit competition makes them sit up and take notice...At some point after that, Xfinity dropped their gigabit service level from $190 to $70/mo (IIRC).In theory we have competition, but the alternatives are: Century Link 40Mbps DSL, or Rise Broadband terrestrial wireless (which hasn&#39;t proven a very good alternative for my coworkers)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So that invites an obvious question: Why isn&#39;t the competitor available on that next street too?Some streets are more expensive to dig on than others.

This problem results from weakness in the enamel that makes the underlying dentin and nerves more vulnerable to heat or cold. Most common products currently on the market can put a layer of organic material on the tooth and numb nerve endings with potassium nitrate, but the relief is only temporary. The peptide, however, addresses the problem permanently at its source by strengthening the enamel.I want this so badly.I&#39;ve never had a cavity despite my poor dental hygiene habits and lack of dental practice visits but apparently I suffer from bruxism that can make half of my teeth hurt whenever I bite on anything harder than a wet noodle.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Estonian here. At Skype (10+ years ago) I observed, that members of large cultures (American, British, Hindu etc.) had real trouble adjusting to the predominantly Estonian-based engineering culture. Probably because they had never had to adjust, commonly people adjust to _their_ culture as it tends to dominate large organizations. But once they did make an honest attempt, that was always most welcomed and gained them a large amount of goodwill. Our US CEO going to a sauna with 20 naked engineers...I’ve also seen the “how are you” thing described in comments unfold.A Hindu pm had the habit of sitting next to developers while they worked, sometimes putting a hand on their knee. After being politely explained  that the size of an Estonian personal space is measured in astronomical units and that this was the reason devs literally scattered upon his approach, he immediately changed his behavior and became great friends with the team.A US lady came to hr complaining about an Ukrainian dev approaching them inappropriately during a party. The hr-person, having witnessed the situation, explained that this was just their way of showing friendly interest and no disrespect was intended. A while later, a Japanese guy came to the hr person complaining the original lady from us had hugged them. Again, it was explained that this is just what Americans do.Cultures are hard and take a lot of mutual respect to work through."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Plenty of contribution already,so I&#39;ll just add a personal anecdote. Some years ago I happened to have some beers with a Latvian Russian,who lived here, in London. He tells us that he doesn&#39;t get the Brits. He just doesn&#39;t understand the reasoning in some situations. I ask to elaborate. He says: last year, I had a pretty serious trauma and ended up in a hospital. It&#39;s so bad, pain, lots of tests,etc. And I&#39;m pretty fed up with all of it. Then, one day, a surgeon comes in, says hello and asks me &#39;how are you?&#39;. And I reply: &#39;really bad!&#39;. And suddenly surgeon&#39;s face changes: his eyes start moving faster,he looks at me and then observes the room,then at me again. Then the surgeon,in a slightly panicky voice ask me again: well what&#39;s wrong,is it the food? Is it the nurses? Did they do all the tests? What&#39;s going on?&#39; Then the Russian looks at the doctor and says: well look, I&#39;m in a hospital, I&#39;m ill as hell, I&#39;m in pain and you have the audacity to ask how am I? Are you crazy? It should be pretty clear that it&#39;s definitely not my day! The surgeon goes on to explain the subtleties of the question and etc. At that point I already lived in the UK long enough to understand the doctor&#39;s position but I also found the Russians point to be absolutely hilarious.From personal experience I find the Russians absolutely hilarious even without much smiling (the young ones smile more).They are somehow similar to Italians,who are also hilarious, but as is the case with the Russians, the funniest things tend to be equally tragic too. Kind of a never ending tragicomedy on full blast."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am Ukrainian. Came to the US when I was 14. I may never be cool like all the hard looking dudes in movies and whatnot but I smile all the time because either I find something funny in what I’m engaged in or if I don’t that I try to think of it as such. I have always been this way and I can’t imagine not doing it.Also, I have read a few comments in this discussion about how fake American smiles and “how are you?”s are and I have to disagree somewhat. To a large extent Americans use “how are you” and “what’s up” as generic greetings but at the same time you can often tell when someone is using it instead of “hello” vs having 30-120 seconds to chat pretty easily. If my day is going well I make a point of telling the random person I’m interacting with why that is: “I’m doing great. The weather is so nice and I had a lovely cup of coffee on my back porch today.” Quick interaction, mostly meaningless, but to me it’s a nice way to break up the monotony. On the other hand if I’m having a bad day I don’t feel like hiding it but the trick is to not make it the other person’s problem: “I’m getting by. I blew a tire on the way to work and I just had all four tires replaced. But oh well, that’s just how irony works I guess.” Again, quick and simple and not the typical “fine” response. At worst they go “oh that sucks. Paper or plastic?” but more often it could result in a short conversation and I don’t think there is anything wrong with that."</p>

Until one day, sat in standstill traffic in my car on the M74 motorway just outside Glasgow, a rider on a BMW S1000XR, with the same loud exhaust as on mine, filtered past the window and I didn’t hear him until he was level with my rear passenger door.Exhausts sound great, i love the sound of a nice engine, it’s utterly intoxicating but it turns out that modern insulated cars block out the noise too well to make them useful as an awareness tool.So, i’m fine with a silent electric bike from a safety point of view. The exhaust noise was a false comfort blanket that deserves no faith put in it as a device to be better seen on the road."</p>

At a stop light; I put my foot down; at a really long stop light, I put the kickstand down.If the self balancing feature can function as form of driver aid. Meaning you declarivity tell the bike &#34;I want this line with this apex&#34;; then the bike will follow through with it&#39;s active systems. That would be wild.2) 
The device right behind the rider gives me goosebumps. In a crash; seems like a great way to break your back and be pinned in the bike.Background data:MechE background. Owned and crashed high CC several motorcycles. I&#39;m doing totally fine healthwise; just really lucky."</p>

That will download the file locally with that file name.- Put the file on Dropbox or something that will get it to your phone.- From dropbox on iphone, share and export the file, then choose your podcast app. The podcast app that worked for me is &#34;Pocket Casts&#34;.- Now in Pocket Casts -&gt; Profile -&gt; Files, you should be able to play the mp4s with nice podcast-style controls and learn physics and be happy!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I know what building an MMO is like, having worked on one 10 years ago that was already 10 years old and still exists today (small audience though).Building something like these people are talking about requires more $ than a Marvel superhero movie to get anywhere. We could manage about 100 simultaneous players visible to each other in a reasonable time but no more; the internet is not fast enough to manage more than that many &#34;people&#34; with anything resembling real behavior, even then its hard to maintain the illusion of fluidity with the random latency of so many streams using prediction. Supporting millions of users like these people claim is fantasy even if you only saw a handful. Maintaining state in a single world at that volume is impossible with real people (you can fake a lot of &#34;AI&#34; characters but not actual players). There is reason why most MMO and similar games limit the number of players, or like Eve throttle the game time and slow everything down if too many ships appear in the same place (not possible in a &#34;on ground&#34; sort of world).Also building something of this magnitude and even getting it to do even a small subset of what they want requires people with lots of experience, as this is highly complex and specialized programming, not to mention an enormous amount of art creation, lighting, audio, story and other content, unless you go the No Man&#39;s Sky route and generate everything. But they don&#39;t support huge numbers of&#34;local&#34; players either."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been following the DreamWorld saga on YouTube for a hot minute now, mainly because I find it so interesting how they got through the YC vetting process when I myself have applied twice (maybe 3 times) and I also know plenty of people -- brilliant, motivated, entrepreneurial folks -- that applied many (many) times as well and were rejected (YC is mega-competitive after all).IMO, it&#39;s a bit insulting to the struggling startup community at large, and not to mention damaging to the YC brand."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There was a recent submission saying the same things:DreamWorld (YC W21) MMO raises all red flags - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26898266 - April 2021 (195 comments)I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s driving this, but I&#39;m not inclined to moderate the current thread in any way, even though the title is breaking HN&#39;s rules egregiously, as I explained here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27321926.The reason is that we moderate HN less, not more, when YC or a YC startup is the story: https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;qu.... It&#39;s important that when people accuse us of manipulating HN to serve YC—as internet users, you know, kind of do from time to time—we can answer in good conscience (https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;que...). Taking lumps like this are the price we pay for that. This a low-quality drama story that normally wouldn&#39;t clear the bar for HN&#39;s front page even if it weren&#39;t a quasidupe of a thread from a month ago.Moderating HN less, however, does not mean not moderating at all—that would be a loophole you could drive a truck through. If and when the story comes up again, we&#39;ll probably start moderating it closer to the standard rules that we&#39;d apply to any similar story: when it&#39;s an ongoing saga, we downweight follow-ups unless there is significant new information. Here are the relevant links about all that in case anyone wants to know:https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;so...https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sor...https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;so..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting to read this here. When my son was born (naturally, normal weight, fully healthy, and around expected due date), the midwife in Denmark had educated us about the Danish way of handling the birth - as soon as the baby comes out, they literally put the baby on mom’s chest, and leave us(parents, and baby) alone in the room for about an hour. Nothing needs to be done other than the baby being in care of it’s parents! They believed it helps the baby form a natural bond, but also acclimate to the outside world better than being whisked away and cleaned.It was such a lovely experience. One of the many things I am thankful to Denmark for.Several things that I was surprised to learn while going through this in DK.1. Childbirth is handled by midwives (Jordemothers) instead of doctors. Doctors are brought only when medication or any treatment is necessary.2. Child birth is considered a natural process and never treated/thought of as a sickness or medical condition. This is reflected in the whole process.3. The social healthcare system works great. It changed my perspective even more. Not having to think about hospital bills or insurance leaves us parents to enjoy the arrival of our little one.4. If everyone in the country, regardless of their current financial condition gets such an experience for their childbirth, I will gladly pay my taxes, and never complain. Healthcare should not be a business imho."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting.Our baby arrived 10 weeks premature and although it wasn&#39;t immediately after birth (as I&#39;ll explain why below), the hospital strongly encouraged the kangaroo care as mentioned in the article, which mom did daily until we could take our baby home.In a week it will be a full year since birth and the baby is in no way behind developmentally compared to other 10 month olds (when adjusting age due to prematurity). So although anecdotal, I can believe this can be a very helpful practice.Due to arriving mid-pandemic and because neither of us had COVID tests prior to the unexpectedly premature birth, we weren&#39;t allowed to visit the baby in the NICU until our tests came back negative, which was about 30 hours later. I wasn&#39;t even allowed to be with mom during delivery, but the doctor did allow me to see the baby for a couple of minutes from a distance and under the proviso that I touched nothing in the NICU (including things like walls, windows, doors, handles, etc).Anyway, somewhat superfluous information at the end there, but it was quite an experience and I&#39;m just happy everything turned out fine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I received the opposite care. Was delivered by C-section, no contact with anyone while in incubation for several weeks. My mother would often tell the story of how she was unable to touch me for weeks after my birth.45 years on and I haven’t a single bond, not with family, not with friends, not even with animals. Like a ghost floating through the world with no attachments and seemingly no compelling interest in them. Active avoidance is on point. But don&#39;t be sad for me. It&#39;s just the way I developed. And the lack of bonding, skin-to-skin contact with my mother is one possible reason.They’ve tried to make a number of diagnoses fit, from autism to Schizoid Personality Disorder, Bipolar to Asperger&#39;s. Nothing. Nothing fits. There&#39;s nothing wrong with me except that I don&#39;t bond, at all.One of the more disturbing experiences was watching what happened to chimpanzees when their mothers were taken away from them after birth (or were denied bonding entirely). They rock back and forth with anxiety; they grapple for the nearest comfy thing; more rocking. It was like watching myself. I&#39;m typing this 45 years later holding a pillow for comfort. You&#39;ll rarely see me seated without one. I rock all the time. The pillow, the rocking. They fill a hole. It&#39;s protective somehow. I&#39;m sure a shrink would say it reminds me of the womb that was stolen from me.And I know I&#39;ll live the rest of my life like this, without bond, alone, and not really sad because of it, just totally missing what compels others towards their own kind, to bond.So, yeah, more skin-to-skin sooner. No more lost people like me. Again: not sad about it, but life without others 
(and very much not wanting them) can be a severe challenge. You have only yourself."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is the kind of failure mode that I imagine (now with hindsight) should be mitigated by (re)designing the system in such a way that the timestamp desync would always be detected because each part of the system should have its own internal model of the approximate times that it should be receiving from other systems and never blindly trust them.I imagine it is sort of like the organisms early in evolution that simply believed their sensory system when it had in fact been hijacked by something that wanted to eat them. There aren&#39;t many sensory systems with those issues these days because anything that doesn&#39;t have an internal model that it can use for comparison winds up being a snack or crashing on an alien planet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel this bug in my bones. I work a lot on WAMI/aerial imagery. I&#39;ve dealt with this exact problem of timestamp-off-by-one-image. I have 9 cameras with different exposure times all triggered by the same hardware pulse. Fortunately my system is data-collect only so the worst outcome is some wrong filenames.I learned only way too late in the project that most GigeVision cameras emit timestamps that can be synched using NTP and/or PTP. The camera specs/manual said nothing about this. Only found it by accident looking through the GeniCam XML API.Moral of the story: ensure your cameras emit timestamps on device. Don&#39;t rely on system time."</p>

Your YouTube videos are absolutely great and there is just something about it all (probably the &#34;under one roof&#34; philosophy) that makes showing the &#34;adding/fixing this little piece&#34; so much more consumable.

Money is only a means to an end for obtaining the basic necessities to live: you cannot eat a dollar bill for nutrition or sleep under a dollar bill for shelter. Government provided housing and food should be available to any citizen — no questions asked. At that point you can get rid of all welfare programs since the government is directly supplying the basic necessities for those in need.People would still be incentivized to work in order to obtain luxuries which are not supplied by the government: a private house, travelling, a car, etc.Stories like this further affirm that handing out money is not a good way for the government to provide welfare."</p>

So how is the ossification broken?Every app has to implement it itself rather than calling a syscall and letting the OS deal with its complexities (same as for TLS, making fewer apps implement it without a lot of extra work). Which also increases context switching. In the future more protocols will be built on top of QUIC, expanding the user-space stack, increasing fragmentation of application-space IP stacks. And are network cards now going to start implementing it?It&#39;s painful to watch us stride headlong into the future depending on band-aids because surgery is too complicated."</p>

This makes their queries super complicated with multiple joins.Once you have the schema figured out, it&#39;s dead easy to build a third-party client that works better than the official one. Even search works great with a simple LIKE query but Apple re-indexes all messages leading to your CPU going over 1000%: https://twitter.com/KrauseFx/status/1396433852126670852Source: I built a third-party desktop client for iMessage at https://texts.com and reverse engineered the complete sqlite structure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Author here: the gist is that it&#39;s practically impossible to scroll to the beginning of an iMessage chat, and that&#39;s the only way to get to the beginning of a conversation. These old conversations take up several gigabytes of space, yet there&#39;s no good way to search them (because search for old messages is unreliable).This aspect of the iMessage user experience has remained untouched for a decade, despite everyone&#39;s chats growing longer. Searching for particular iMessages sucks because the results miss the broader context of the conversation (a single message is not useful when you want to reread a conversation).(Also just noting, as the post author I created a title better-suited to HN&#39;s 80 character limit.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My sister was having a problem where she was taking all the iCloud storage for our family because she keeps sending videos to people but couldn&#39;t figure out a way to efficiently delete them. I had to write up a Python script (https://gist.github.com/saagarjha/615dee3c04e226b44828e910a5...) to scrape the iMessage database for large attachments, and then print out the text to messages around it so that you could search for it and jump to around that place in the chat history and then delete the files from there. It&#39;s kind of insane how hard it is to manage old messages :/ I feel like Apple didn&#39;t really prepare for Messages coming in from iCloud meaning that every device had every single message you&#39;ve ever sent, and now it&#39;s really hard to get through them without reading the database manually…"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There’s a question as to why that fake consensus emerged. But I think the more troubling question is: How did people let the original story of what Tom Cotton even said go so badly awry? Essentially Cotton said something that was then transformed into a fake claim of a Chinese bio-attack, then the fake claim was debunked, and then the debunking was applied to the real claim with little attention paid to ongoing disagreement among researchers.I think this part of the text really sums up everything I hated about reading the news and social media in 2020. Each site seemed to be funneling you into a single source of truth and way of not only thinking, but FEELING about an event. I don&#39;t like being reminded of corporate sponsored social movements if I open facebook/google/amazon/twitter. I don&#39;t want my app reminding me to vote/get vaccinated(I did both btw) every time I open it without a way to dismiss and select &#39;I already did, stop reminding me.&#39; I don&#39;t want reddit creating a central sub-page for discussing [Current Event] within the narrow bounds of what their moderators think is acceptable. I don&#39;t like non-dismissable context text on twitter and under youtube videos that are often off topic and triggered by bad speech detection that simply take you to a link dump of regular news articles. I don&#39;t like the idea that there&#39;s an oligopoly on &#34;truth&#34; and &#34;credible sources.&#34; No amount of branding will convince me that &#34;fact checkers&#34; are any more objective and impartial than regular newspaper columnists; fact checkers are what editors are supposed to be. There&#39;s no academic rigor to fact checking, and the reality that so much casual skepticism on a variety of topics was suppressed and equivocated with being a flat-earther is sickening."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m not necessarily worried about climate change per se. It will result in hardship for many, for sure. Temperature changes will render some areas uninhabitable, it will cause mass migration, and probably destabilize the world politically.What am more worried about is the direct wholesale destruction of the biosphere. There are absolutely bonkers numbers about extinction, ocean acidification, runaway permafrost melt that actually could choke out a majority of people.Worse still, these effects aren&#39;t easily solvable by stopping emissions, or blocking out the sun with mylar sheets, or any of the &#34;low hanging&#34; technological fruit -- the stuff that could be solved with today&#39;s space technology or electric car tech.In order to actually solve these &#34;deeper&#34; problems, we will need an absolutely massive bio-engineering effort that is probably only possible with some kind of entropic breakthrough.Evolution is basically hyper-organization, a point of locally super low entropy that only happens by hundreds of millions of years of energy expenditure. When a species dies, it&#39;s not those individuals, it&#39;s every one of those individuals that ever lived that dies. All that concentration of local entropy, destroyed forever. It&#39;s like using every GPU on planet earth to train a hyper-smart GPT-4, for many human lifetimes -- and then hitting rm -rf on the weights."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Climate change is real, we are warming up and should/can solve this, but I&#39;m skeptical that apocalyptic narratives help the cause.&#34;A senior U.N. environmental official says entire nations could be wiped off the face of the Earth by rising sea levels if the global warming trend is not reversed by the year 2000.&#34;https://apnews.com/article/bd45c372caf118ec99964ea547880cd0"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We&#39;re definitely going to go beyond 2ºC in the coming decades.Even if a miracle happened and we stopped all human emissions today, current GHGs in the atmosphere will keep trapping more heat for some decades. This is known as climate inertia or climate lag.Another aspect I don&#39;t see frequently mentioned are feedbacks. Again, even if we stopped all emissions today, self sustaining climatic systems will keep adding more heat to the atmosphere (methane, etc) or the sea (Arctic ice melting).We&#39;re currently at aprox 36 billion tonnes of carbon emissions per year [1] only counting fuel burning. It would be a miracle if we could even reach 50% of that in our lifetime, which was aprox the emissions from the 70s.[1] https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel like I must be living in an alternative reality from the Twitter deriders in this thread, I&#39;ve had almost the exact opposite experience. I&#39;ve made more friends and acquaintances on Twitter than any other social network. It&#39;s also easily the most intellectual social network. (If that sounds crazy, really compare it to the others. They&#39;re either not intellectual or [youtube] not really social.)If you care deeply about something, you will find other people on Twitter. If you work in public, people will find you. Someone right now I met from Maine is currently drawing up the plans to teach me to timber frame a structure I just got approved. About 20 people I met from twitter have been over my house (for dinner, etc) at different times. Far more people read my work because of Twitter.If you don&#39;t use it as a political mouthpiece it&#39;s incredible and there&#39;s nothing like it. And that&#39;s really up to the user."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a reasonable twitter following (between 5-10k followers) and have recently realized that I needed to remove the app from my phone and only occasionally check it from time to time on a laptop. I&#39;m considering giving it up all together.I&#39;ve struggled a bit with this decisions since I&#39;ve made a fair number of real friends through twitter (people I keep up with in real life after) and come across a lot of interesting books, papers etc.But I&#39;ve come to realize that despite its benefits, twitter is ultimately toxic to your mind. I&#39;ve seen far too many people I care about slowly dissolve into a fever of dopamine fixes as they slowly contort their personality into a stream of memes and rants looking to gain followers.I always tried to fight the urge to post stupid shit just to grow followers, but anything genuinely nuanced or thoughtful you post will have virtually zero engagement. This is fine in isolation, but it leads all conversations to eventually degrade in to a miasma of garbage thinking that is just a mix of groupthink, rage and memes.The final straw for me was finding myself angry about the vague opinions of people I don&#39;t really care about at all. This same type of thinking is what got me to drop facebook entirely years ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My main issue with Twitter is that you follow people, but those people have different interests. So I may follow @JohnSmith because he’s a known dev in the JS community and tweets about JS, but he also tweets about his country’s politics, what he ate at lunch, and engage in heated debats about pineapple on pizza I don’t care about.Twitter recently introduced topics, so that you can follow one topic that aggregates lots of tweets from various people.
This is not what I want: I’d like to follow @JohnSmith, but only for the JS content.As someone who tweets, I’d like some sort of kafka-ish topic queues: I would post tweets about JS in the JS queue, and tweets about Italian food in that other queue, so that people could follow the queues they want. In the end I don’t tweet on either topic because I’m afraid I’ll deceive people who followed me for the other content."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is great and I wish this mentality was pushed earlier on reddit.There was a golden era of reddit right before the great Digg migration. Excellent comments, diverse opinions, and really great back and forth being shared of individual&#39;s experiences in almost every single subreddit.Today, it&#39;s definitely harder to find good commentary and exchange. It&#39;s also super heavily astroturfed by political groups in all the subreddits (on both sides) to try to influence the general groupthink narrative/consensus. It&#39;s so disgustingly obvious but doesn&#39;t seem to be an issue for the team.Maybe I am just getting old. I guess what I&#39;m try to say is nothing will beat simply Google searching a topic and typing &#34;reddit&#34; afterwards to query some super insightful and awesome 5+ year old forum post on whatever the content is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People keep saying how great Reddit is, but I tried signing up to a bunch of my &#34;Niches&#34; and all the posts where just low quality junk; for example every other post in the 3dprinting subreddit is just &#34;MY FIRST PRINT!&#34; or &#34;I BOUGHT A THING!&#34;  and for some reason people think it&#39;s cute so they upvote it.  EDC?  here is another picture of my gun!  Tech reddit; &#34;here is a link to a medium post that you can&#39;t see unless you subscribe!&#34;.And the rest of the posts are just people re-asking the same questions over and over because they can&#39;t be bothered to search.Reddit is just a fire hose of low quality content."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I did to improve my reddit experience:1. unsubscribe to all the big default subreddits, like askreddit, funny, etc (don&#39;t worry, you can still check them out if you want).2. go to r/all and use the filter feature to block the most annoying content or popular stuff that you absolutely don&#39;t care about. I blocked politics subreddits, some memes, anime, communities for popular youtubers, some of the worse default ones. Just look at the current /r/all listing and block whatever you don&#39;t care about that appears in the first few pages, refresh and do it again a few times. I go back every once in a while to repeat the process.3. subscribe to specific things you care about. smaller communities are better, some of the large ones are better moderated than others.4. favorite a few (3-4) subreddits that are about things I want to check often.My home feed is mostly tailored to my interests, even if there&#39;s some fluff. Smaller subreddits I don&#39;t check often and appear there. Then I check my favorite subreddits for specific things, and there&#39;s r/all for the popular stuff.I find that general topics like tech, music, sports are usually bad, but more specific, not necessarily niche, are better (a sub about a specific framework, maybe, or about your hometown, favorite band, or favorite team). Moderation style helps a lot."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At a high level, I really like this. Some UX concerns are all that stop it from being amazing:- The mouse should be a pointer, not a hand. Not only is that the expectation when an element is interactive, but it helps with precision clicking.- The map almost made me sick when it starting moving. It needs to be slower and smoother. You already let people speed it up, but start slower.- Dragging the map should be possible. I wanted to scroll back to something that had moved off-screen, and the map dragged a few pixels, then snapped back. If it is supposed to be draggable, let it drag.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few years ago, I ordered the cheapest six-axis robotic arm from ebay for about $100 that came with basically no software or motor-driver boards, so I did it all from scratch with a PCA9685 board, a basic kernel driver and some very hacky scripts from user space.One day I had some friends over for a glass of wine, and wanted to show off my creation. I invited them into my &#34;lab&#34; and placed my wine glass down on the desk so I could type a few commands with both hands.My rudimentary software had some motion smoothing once it was up and running, but upon initialization, if the arm was significantly displaced from where it had been when it was turned off, the PWM board would instruct the motor to immediately &#34;be&#34; in a position that required the arm to travel clear across the desk in effectively as little time as possible.In this case, where it had been previously happened to be where my wine glass was now, and the flimsy aluminum at high speed was enough to shear the stem from the glass and explode the bulb. Luckily the wine didn&#39;t get in any sensitive electronics, but I learned a valuable lesson about the difference between messing around with hardware vs software."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"About seven years ago I got a bright idea to build a quadcopter. I had experience with little $25-50 drones that bumped around the house with their fragile one-inch propellers, which obviously qualified me to build and pilot something significantly bigger.Off to Aliexpress and Banggood I went. I ordered a carbon-fiber chassis, big strong motors, ESCs, 3-inch propellers, a FrSky receiver, a Devention transmitter, an STM32-based controller, giant li-poly batteries, and all the cables and fasteners I needed. Over the coming weeks the parts trickled in. Finally once the whole kit had arrived, I assembled everything, connected the TTL serial, built the firmware, downloaded it to the controller, and like the brilliant software engineer I am, plugged in the batteries on my bench at home.Nothing happened. Those of you who have blown off fingers wondering why the firecracker under the Coke can hasn&#39;t exploded yet can guess what I did next.I examined the chassis closely and began fiddling with the cables and connectors. Again, like the brilliant software NOT HARDWARE engineer that I am.Evidently, I fixed the problem. Which caused four gigantic propellers to begin whirling around my hands and face. And four brushless electric motors to emit their usual high-pitched whine, which today I instinctively hear as them saying to me &#34;You god damned idiot. You are so ours.&#34;I was not injured. But that evening, I came close to slicing at least a couple things off my body. I hadn&#39;t appreciated the scale of the thing I was building, or the inherent risk in debugging it once I&#39;d slapped it all together. I shelved the project for years, eventually giving it to someone at work who claimed to know his stuff when it came to drones. I hear he&#39;s doing fine.Disclaimer: this story isn&#39;t about code or my own code. But I think it fits here because I approached dangerous hardware with the &#34;build, run, see what happens&#34; mindset of a software developer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few random thoughts here:* some better tools for searching, tagging, tracking my history, etc to allow me to better use and self organize their docs on &#39;mdn plus&#39; would be a useful service.  it may also give them some more insight on how people are using it and what areas are of bigger utilization.* tools to allow me to ask private questions in areas of their docs, with some prioritization for answers/responses.* IDE plugins - I think there&#39;s one for IntelliJ Ultimate, but not specifically from MDN.  Having more direct access to MDN info while inside my IDEs would be something probably worth paying for.  I suspect they may get some useful data on when/where people are having trouble.  I wouldn&#39;t even mind contributing some of my source code snippets back from within the IDE if it would help give more examples to MDN.* a couple years back, a friend started a podcast experiment of just reading MDN docs for javascript.  It was... a bit different, but trying out some other formats for their docs.  perhaps a Q&amp;A podcast where mdn folks answer some of the answers (taken from the paid-Q&amp;A bullet point above).  (but yeah, they fired a bunch of people last year, no?)$2-$3/month, if there were/are nicer tools to help me track what I&#39;ve seen, perhaps letting me add private annotations so when I come back I can jog my own memory... I would try that, at least for a while (I think I&#39;d get use out of that).  $10/month - for just some &#39;premium&#39; content?  Probably not.  $50/year would, for me, probably be an upper bound (unless/until I see more potential benefits).EDIT: had not seen &#39;down below&#39; - they have &#39;Bookmark and annotate free and paid content for reference across devices.&#39; as a feature - possibly along the lines of what I was thinking above.  Signed up for waitlist."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish they’d clarify if the money is used to support MDN or not. I wouldn’t be opposed to supporting MDN patreon style, and if it comes with “perks” like articles, sure, why not. But I would do this to support MDNs core documentation, not because I’m dying for technical deep dives.That said $10/mo is a bit steep for me. And in any event, if they don’t make explicit that the money goes to support MDN upkeep and development then it’s a nonstarter. I’m not giving Mozilla money to fritter away on another rebrand or whatever else they want to use it for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Obviously it would be nice if everything everywhere was always free, but docs and opensource suffer a lot from lack of sustainability when based on voluntary donations. Companies simply have no incentives to pay for anything.There are surely tens of thousands of companies worldwide, whose employees rely on MDN on a daily basis. There are poor startups among them, but many of those companies have pretty deep pockets. If just a small percentage of those employees ask their bosses for this $5/mo. sub, this can improve things considerably. For now everything is free, so no one has an incentive, or a way, to pay.As developers, we are collectively guilty for never asking our employees for anything which costs $$$. Many of us (me including) assume that asking for a few bucks sub is almost a crime. Or we don&#39;t want to deal with stupid bureaucracy and an arcane process to set up the sub.Personally I hope the experiment will work. Let&#39;s see in a few months.I think the best model would be something like: subscribers get the premium content immediately, other people with a few weeks/months delay. This would keep a healthy balance and keep the incentives in place for people to pay."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey Everybody,We are really excited to open source NocoDB today.NocoDB is an open source Airtable alternative.Github : https://github.com/nocodb/nocodbNocoDB works by connecting to any relational database and transforming them into a smart spreadsheet interface!NocoDB currently works with MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite, Amazon Aurora &amp; MariaDB databases.This allows you to build no-code business solutions collaboratively with teams.Getting started is simple :    docker run -p 8080:8080 nocodb/nocodb
    or
    npx create-nocodb-app


Also NocoDB&#39;s app store allows you to build business workflows on views with combination of Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord, Twilio, Whatsapp, Email &amp; any 3rd party APIs too. Plus NocoDB provides programmatic access to APIs so that you can build integrations with Zapier / Integromat and custom applications too.For storage you can connect to S3, Mini, GCS, Azure, DigitalOcean spaces &amp; any S3 compatible APINocoDB gives programmatic access to REST &amp; GraphQL APIs. And with our API tokens it can be easily integrated with Zapier / Integromat.- - - - - -Also please join our community at :- Github : https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb- Discord : https://discord.gg/5RgZmkW- Twitter : https://twitter.com/nocodbWould love to hear usecases &amp; feedback.Thank you,Team NocoDBedit : made the comment short :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks more featured than Seatable I was looking into.
A few questions on features and plans:1. Are all the views mobile friendly,2. Any plan for a map view,3. Multiple views in a page? (aka dashboard)4. How does AGPL affect getting payed to create a solution based on this? I&#39;m not talking about offering it as a service as is  as happens with elastic, redis and the cloud providers.5. How do we create plugins?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great news. I don&#39;t know if anyone remembers this, but there used to be a program called Ecco Pro that Airtable really reminded me of. I haven&#39;t run Ecco in probably 20 years to more so I could be entirely off the mark, but the &#34;freeform spreadsheet&#34; seems really similar."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Klarna is no stranger to criminally lax attitude towards data privacy and security. In Finland, they implemented a checkout flow based only on your SSN (personal ID number). By simply entering someone else&#39;s SSN (which is not hard to guess/pry) you can reveal anyone&#39;s official home address.Further, they enable a &#34;pay later by invoice&#34; checkout flow, again by just knowing someone&#39;s SSN. Scammers use this to order items from web stores to automated pick-up lockers with someone&#39;s else&#39;s SSN for payment info. The victim usually only becomes aware about this activity when they start getting debt collection notices for unpaid invoices from multiple stores for thousands and thousands of euros. The debt collection process in Finland is famously unfair and harsh towards the supposed &#34;debtor&#34; (here: victim of fraud).Unless the &#34;debtor&#34; (victim) actively opposes each and every individual collection, the cases will eventually end up in court with summary judgement. This will ruin the victim&#39;s credit rating, which has devastating results for just about all aspects of life. People are known to have collapsed under the burden of all this and ended up taking their own life.Klarna&#39;s response to all this is that they want convenient checkout experience and some fraud is unavoidable. Although there are excellent technical means available to strongly identify users in Finland, they add a minor layer of inconvenience compared to just typing in your SSN. This is OK for Klarna since they give exactly zero fucks about security as long as they can make a little buck from it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At a large site I used to work for circa 2011, before everyone had gone fully HTTPS, we received similar panicked reports from users: &#34;I&#39;m logged in as someone else!&#34;  Turns out an ISP in the Philippines decided to just ignore `cache-control` and `vary` headers and forcibly started caching logged-in responses along with auth cookies. Bad times. Made it clear to me why the whole web would have to go HTTPS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked in a project over 10 years ago where something very similar happened!We had built and authentication service that, among other things, was used by a SyncML service that was used back in the day of feature phones to syncs contacts etc. You can imagine that getting someone else&#39;s contacts on your phone isn&#39;t exactly ideal. This was how we came to know about the problem, from customers getting other customers data!The error was caused by a CDN switch. Our instructions to the the CDN team responsible for the switch was &#34;Make sure the CDN honors our cache headers, if our HTTP responses say something can be cached do so, if they say that the response should not be cached then don&#39;t&#34;. We were in at least three meetings where we repeated this mantra.I believe that the CDN team thought that they had setup the CDN correctly but they had missed an edge case. The CDN was in fact setup to cache even uncacheable responses, and served those, _only_ when it could not reach our servers.So if there was a traffic spike and the CDN determined that our authentication servers were unreachable it would fall back to serving data that should never have been cached in the first place! Happily returning tokens to random users that had authenticated just before the traffic spike..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Very Hungry Caterpillar is probably the single most important kids book in my extended family. It was the first book I got as a kid due to my dad loving it, and Mum sewed me a little toy which was my favourite toy for many years.It the became a “thing” where it was the first book we got for every kid born in my extended family, and now that I have my own kids 40+ years later it was the first I got for them too. They both know it by rote, have the toys, had the bed sheets, everything. They’re now in the early years of school and still absolutely love the story and have the posters in their rooms despite them being “old” for it.RIP Eric. You’ve left an amazing mark on the world."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not to downplay the cultural importance of The Very Hungry Caterpillar – but can I suggest another one of Eric Carle&#39;s books?It&#39;s called &#34;Pancakes, Pancakes!&#34; In it, the protagonist wants to eat some pancakes – but he discovers that in order to do so, he needs to harvest and mill some wheat, milk a cow and churn some butter, and so forth.I read this to my kids when they were little, and it struck me as actually a pretty good lesson about how much work goes on outside of our house, in order to make Saturday Pancakes possible. But it&#39;s not presented in a preachy way at all – more of an excited way, like &#34;isn&#39;t it interesting how much background work goes into Saturday Pancakes?&#34;.I credit that book with getting my kids interested in food/cooking and much more than that as well – the seed of thinking about what has to happen for an Amazon box to show up at your door with a particular gizmo.So I&#39;ll pour out some pancake batter for Eric Carle on Saturday morning."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I look forward to USB 4.1a Type C.2 Phase iii.b Gen 3E and the 482646282 different cable capability combinations that all plug in and have no distinction of those capabilities whatsoever. I also look forward to all the necessary and helpful posts telling me how the identical ports on my laptop are in fact diffferent despite their identical appearance.But at least everything uses the same plug, so that’s nice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"USB-C bashing threads represent the &#39;HN echo chamber&#39; for me. :)I understand the problems of different cables, I&#39;ve run into them already. One cable can do Thunderbolt, the other cannot. One cable transmits 4K video signal, the others doesn&#39;t transmit anything. And so on.However, it is sooooo much better than anything before because at least _most of the time_ stuff works. Chargers charge. Sometimes slower, sometimes faster, but things mostly work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I genuinely don’t understand how I’ve managed to be so lucky. That is, I absolutely do not disbelieve the many tales of woe I hear on HN (like the many in this thread) - but I’ve literally never put any thought into what cable I plug in to what device, and had no trouble that I can recall. It really had lived up to its hype for me so far.My USB-C devices are: a wireless charger, two MacBooks (one intel, one m1), a Pixelbook, Nintendo Switch, Oculus Quest and Quest 2, iPad Pro, and the charging case of some earphones… I think that’s everything. Oh, and my partner’s phone and headphones too.Anyway - I’ve cables and chargers dotted around the house, plus some A-C ones for use with power bricks - and never had any grief powering/charging any device from any of them. What am I doing right? I’m definitely not only plugging Apple devices into Apple cables and so on."</p>
