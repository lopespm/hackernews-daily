								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My git productivity hack is `git diff --color-words`. Instead of showing the line-by-line diff, it shows only the words that changed. Especially useful if you have long sentences where only a comma changed or some other typo. With git diff, the two lines are shown, with --color-words, only the changed symbol is highlighted. The option --color-words also works with git show. I even made aliases for them: git cshow and git cdiff.Other than that, I recommend that people learn to use git properly. In my work, I often have problems with people overwriting their commits and trying to handle merge requests of commits where one commit message is &#34;did some updates&#34; and the other commit is &#34;some fixes&#34;. Getting to know git for an hour, may have prevented both issues. But I am biased, since I use git since my bachelor thesis."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; with git checkout you can create and switch to the new branch in one command using the -b flag:
git checkout -b new_branch&gt; You can do the same with the new one, but the flag is -c:
git switch -c new_branchIt&#39;s like they had a design meeting where they discussed this and said &#34;so  I propose switch -b newbranch to create and switch to a new branch&#34; and the objection was &#34;nah that would make it consistent with checkout, which is against the project policy&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You don&#39;t need -- as much in the &#34;git restore&#34; example. With git checkout it may be necessary to separate the branch and the paths with &#34;--&#34; but since &#34;git restore&#34; does not take a branch (except with -s), doing this is totally fine    git restore test.txt"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This problem unfortunately applies to a lot of remote access software, particularly when the web browser is the client.I know of one company that switched to Web VNC for accessing a specific piece of software. They had a lot of offices and the software was expensive (paid per machine). This way, they could switch to a much smaller number of licenses, letting any employee connect from anywhere and wait in line if necessary. A blind person has lost a job over this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thanks so much for holding Cloudflare accountable for this. It&#39;s upsetting that they had so much input from you leading up to it and now they&#39;re dropping the ball. A lot of accessibility stuff and mission statements just honestly amounts to virtue signalling with companies and sad to see that&#39;s the case with Cloudflare so hope they step up. It shouldn&#39;t have to get to the point where they&#39;re sued but I feel like more often than not that&#39;s the only thing that changes things like this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They wouldn&#39;t be the first. An SVP of a major SV company once told me &#34;[my company] doesn&#39;t give a shit about accessibility, and no one in Silicon Valley does.&#34; When I went to the CSUN accessibility conference that year, guess which company&#39;s logo was emblazoned across the lanyards? Yup, their marketing department was happy to write checks that their company had no intention of cashing.Silicon Valley is famous for its &#39;patina of accessibility&#39;: https://medium.com/@nicklum/silicon-valleys-patina-of-access..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a CS associate professor. I teach a course which consists in contributing to a free software, in third year at my uni. A few years ago a couple of students decided to make a contribution to GNU ls. The change was to have the output color independent of capitalisation (it is based on filename extension). Their code was accepted. It was a tiny tiny contribution, but it&#39;s probable that these few lines of code are and will be executed a few thousands times more than all other contributions my other students made."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work in finance. About 5 years ago I started building a FIX library on my spare time, out of curiosity. Over the years it has been countless fin tech start-ups as well as big companies reaching out to me about the library, suggesting fixes and features. Since then I have long lost the interest in the technology which enables connectivity to financial exchanges to automate trades, but I keep working on the library for the benefit of others and just the joy of creating something. But what’s the actual impact? Enabling companies getting richer? Greed?https://gitlab.com/logotype/fixparser"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Companies isolate devs from customers by using Product Managers. PMs interview customers and then decide what to build. By the time the tasks get to the dev it’s hard to understand the motivation and impact. The best companies I’ve worked at put the engineers and customers in close contact so they understood the impact and shortcomings in their work. Alternately you need to foster a culture of shared purpose where you have “faith” that your work has impact."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Even if you think you’re well paid, now is the time to look around. I’ve had a lot of friends, mentees, and coworkers get huge bumps on total compensation even as relatively senior engineers and managers. Pay is jumping and companies aren’t doing a great job keeping that up for their people who have been around for a few years. As an employer, that should be the top worry, keep comp up, don’t lose your people because you’ve become complacent on pay and don’t understand that the market is changing right now"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An interesting corollary is that certain types of business are no longer economically viable. If I have a business that competes with advertising companies for niche talent, my business model has to be able to generate the same outsized returns on that talent if I want to be able to afford them, so this limits the work I can do.I don&#39;t think people should work for below market wages, only observing how it can change what kinds of products and services are available. And in the case of tech talent, salaries are being driven up by a few key industries that arguably are not where society would like to see tech product and r&amp;d investment concentrated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate that the market is so great right now because I really can’t take advantage of it.I would love to start the process, to try and get a salary increase anywhere from 30%-100% but unfortunately I’ve stagnated sharply skills wise. Don’t qualify for the jobs I see I think I’d enjoy, and don’t even qualify for the jobs that meet my salary preferences that I’d otherwise dislike. I also would have to be looking at immediately remote roles which just makes things harder. I also am about 90% I could not perform on interviews at most places. Digging myself out of the aforementioned stagnation and prepping for interviews is likely to take years at this point and who knows what the market will look like at that point."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The more project management tools I have to work with, the less likely I am to work for or with a company.I have a somewhat similar stance on software architecture. Sure, I’m TOGAF certified but if you actually expect me to work with notation correct Archimare/UML/whatever and not just draw boxes on a napkin you’re either insane or sell a product with no competition.This is anecdotal of course, but after 30 years of working with hundreds of companies to supply our municipality with software, we have yet to see a correlation between quality and “best practices”. It doesn’t matter if companies do this or that testing and use the full confluence suite or if they just pull spaghetti out of their asses and support is a phone call… the quality is the same over time, hell, often we get more from the spaghetti companies than the “best practice” ones. You might think that it’s a short term thing and that the spaghetti and no testing catches up, but it doesn’t. Maybe because we don’t have to fund those 8 people, that you never really learn the role off but it sure isn’t technical, that sit in on every meeting as opposed to talking directly with the spaghetti slinger and a sales person? I’m not sure, and I’d love to tell people that following this or that “best practice” is the way to go, but that’s just not what our data shows."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I still think David Allen nailed it in Getting Things Done. Not the system necessarily, but he nailed the diagnosis of why we fail to get things done: an inability to be honest with ourselves about (1) the full scope and scale of the commitments we make, and (2) just how little time and attention we have at our disposal in meeting those commitments.Really, it’s the same sort of problem that is described in The Goal and The Phoenix Project, but on a personal level. Calendar timeboxing feels like a solution that actually addresses the real problem, although it is challenging to implement for people who are low in conscientiousness (or have ADHD)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good. When we die, we will still have a giant todo list, and that’s OK. That doesn’t mean we haven’t done things, it just means the list didn’t capture the entirety of our desires and goals.Maybe the point of writing them down is mostly reflective; to contextualize them as much as possible and do the ones that we find most important by some unconscious heuristic. That means there will always be uncompleted things.Also we have to see when we itemize things to do, we also objectify ourselves as a doer of those things. Which is OK for making things graspable, but ultimately we are not mere doer of things, we are humans in an existential context.Maybe it is a good thing that we left todo items unchecked, maybe that is our protest against being reduced too much, maybe that procrastination is an attempt at gaining our humanity back, maybe that resistive Netflix binge has some unconscious meaning that needs to be honored."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m not under an illusion that it does any good, but I swore off all Blizzard products after the Blitzchung incident. It doesn&#39;t feel right giving money to a company that would side with the CCP over human rights in Hong Kong. I&#39;d previously played Hearthstone and Overwatch, and I&#39;d been a Blizzard fan since the original Warcraft. That happy company is dead, and something ugly is animating its corpse.I think company founders are often great, idealistic people. People who genuinely want to make the world better.When they step aside, however, the people who take over after them tend to be terrifying: zero empathy creatures who favor profit maximization over any and all human cost. Does anyone know why this happens?"</p>

He blamed the players for Blizzard internal problem. this whole mess is Blizzard&#39;s own problem and he is dragging the players into it.he should just say due to internal problem. the patch for WOW 9.2 will be delay and leave it.Blizzard have been going down hill for awhile. They treat their players like cash cow and try to milk them anyway that they can.players = paying customers. if you can&#39;t cook the burger that a customer already pay for. your paying customer will leave. its simple as that.bottom line: Blizzard treat their employees and customers like shit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This problem won&#39;t get fixed without legislation.  Single use plastic is cheaper, so of course companies will use that if they can.  Most people don&#39;t have the income to support &#34;voting with their wallet&#34;, and even those who do don&#39;t always have the option.  IF the best solution out there happens to use single use plastic, you&#39;re not going to opt for a worse solution just because it doesn&#39;t.And even if one company cares enough to do something, they will change their tune when they have to start charing more.The only way this will get better is if the external costs of single use plastic are borne by the companies that make them and consumers are subsidized to absorb the extra cost."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pre pandemic, I&#39;d go often to trader joe, and they would give samples.  It was maybe a small bite of a food (ice cream, salat, or whatever else), and use a plastic fork for it.Just one bite, and you had to throw it out. It was more plastic than food.  Whole Foods was the same.  I think it is a crime against environment and I started feeling bad about it, and stopped taking samples when there were plastic utensils.It think behaviour like this should be legislated out.  For something like a sample, just a small wooden  spoon, or anything else renewable, should be enough.The externalities of that plastic, is something that neither Trader Joe or Whole Foods pays, but we all do in some way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The pioneering 2015 study of marine plastic didn’t include illegal dumping and export of plastic waste. In the new analysis, the team considered those actions, but only for the U.S. They say data for other nations were inconsistent or didn’t exist.&#34;Doesn&#39;t this seem like it&#39;s saying illegal + legal plastic waste in the US is greater than legal plastic waste in other countries?  That seems like a much different claim to me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing I’m always curious about is why we are so concerned with plastic waste.My local grocery store recently switched to paper bags. So I got curious. Turns out you have to re-use a paper bag 43 times for the energy use to be the same as plastic grocery bags. This is impossible since they are made of paper. Aluminum and glass bottles require several hundred times more energy to produce as well (between 170-250x).Then when you look at plastic pollution and see that for the most part North America is quite good at properly disposing of plastic you wonder why we are so obsessed with this as a problem.Plastic waste really isn’t a big problem unless you’re talking about developing nations. North America is responsible for about 3% of mismanaged plastic waste. Asia and Africa account for 86% of it.Don’t get me started on plastic straws. They make up 0.03% of plastic waste in the ocean.If we want to make a difference here we should be helping developing nations to better manage their plastic waste so that it doesn’t end up in waterways.The Yangtze and Ganges are releasing plastic into the ocean at a rate far greater than all of North America combined, and our response is to expend huge amounts of energy produced by fossil fuels trying to recycle our plastic instead of burying it in a landfill where it is unlikely to pose a major ecological threat.Like many environmental initiatives I worry that we’re more concerned about making ourselves feel better than actually solving the problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was thinking these days, that when I was a kid some 20 years ago, people were all the rage against paper, because you had to cut trees and whatnot, everything was switching to plastic so you could &#34;save the trees&#34;I still wonder what that was about, all it did was screw the paper companies that had their own private forests, and cause the stupid plastic patch on the pacific ocean, and now everyone has to switch BACK to paper."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Pressure is also building for “polluter-pays” laws that would shift the cost of waste collection from taxpayers to the companies that make and use plastic. Earlier this month, Maine became the first U.S. state to pass such legislation… The American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry group whose membership is dominated by plastics makers, says polluter-pays measures would hurt the economy.This is the kind of solution that seems to appeal to HN and appeals to me personally. It’s a system-wide incentives problem. So just change the incentives and price in the externality, right? Same goes for carbon taxes. I hope these kinds of laws catch on."</p>

I disagree. A lot of the &#34;fluff,&#34; as the author describes it, is excess capital finding its way to things people find pleasurable, whether it be dope, travel, beauty, or rock and roll. Purveyors of such pleasures have proved to be remarkably adept at creating &amp; providing these opportunities."</p>

Is my life planned by large corporations? From my work there I would say not, as most campaigns tend to fail even in the short term."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The ultimate tool for corporations to sustain a culture of this sort is to develop the 40-hour workweek as the normal lifestyle. Under these working conditions people have to build a life in the evenings and on weekends.I slightly disagree with this point. The 40 hour work week is a rather recent development; in the past, people had to work a lot longer with no or only one day of. The trend actually goes in the direction of reducing it further (at least here in Germany), where 35 or 32 hour weeks are getting more common (depending on the job, of course). Plus, there are alternative models, such as 4x 10h days + 3 days off.Sure, the current model serves corporations, but it is by no means their invention. And while they are a big part of why it still is so large, the reason is most likely that they need the labor hours, not the specific consumption behavior."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"About a decade ago, I implemented the Causal Tree CRDT (aka RGA, Timestamped Insertion Tree) in regular expressions using a Unicode string as a storage. Later we made a collaborative editor for Yandex based on that code.
It used many of the tricks as described in the text, even the optimization where you remember the last insertion point. So I am terribly glad it all gets rediscovered.The code is on GitHub [1] There is also an article which might be a tough reading, so no link.
Recently I greatly improved CTs by introducing the Chronofold data structure [2].
Regarding that benchmark article, I spent many years in academia, so the quality of content problem is familiar to me. In other words, I don&#39;t take such articles seriously.
CRDTs are fast enough, that is not a concern.[1]: https://github.com/gritzko/citrea-model[2]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09511"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On a meta-level, does anyone else think that the whole idea of writing a peer reviewed paper that is just a benchmark of different algorithms should be really rigorously reviewed before being accepted? Writing good benchmarks is hard, and so highly contextual that writing fair comparisons beteen algorithms (or data structures) is almost impossible unless you&#39;re an expert in all of the algorithms involved."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"By the way, as someone who has published academic papers, if you&#39;re ever bothered about a paper or have some comments, don&#39;t hesitate to mail the authors. (Their e-mail addresses are always on the paper; especially target the first author because they have normally done the work.) We are happy to hear when someone has read our work and I at least would&#39;ve liked to have known if someone found a problem with my papers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s one lovely trick.If I may suggest one thing... instead of range requests on a single huge file how about splitting the file in 1-page fragments in separate files and fetching them individually? This buys you caching (e.g. on CDNs) and compression (that you could also perform ahead of time), both things that are somewhat tricky with a single giant file and range requests.With the reduction in size you get from compression, you can also use larger pages almost for free, potentially further decreasing the number of roundtrips.There&#39;s also a bunch of other things that could be tried later, like using a custom dictionary for compressing the individual pages."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I haven&#39;t used Lunar (https://lunar.fyi/), the app the author built, but it looks fantastic! Clearly great effort has been put into it!I really appreciate this class of application that exposes more hardware functionality to the end user. Flux (which may or may not be a direct competitor) is another great example, as is Halide, the pro camera app for iPhones. They&#39;re certainly not flashy, but they can be great quality-of-life improvements.And they&#39;re difficult to write! They require using APIs that are often woefully under-documented, and terribly difficult to debug. I wanted to write an app that would slowly lower your device&#39;s volume over time (so you could raise the volume for a song that you like, but then not accidentally spend the next 30 minutes with the volume super loud), and even doing simple things like listing audio devices and getting their names was endlessly frustrating."</p>

The 16 in this example is the &#34;block size&#34;, and could be anything. But this notion of expressing computation over blocks of dense data seems to be the big difference from other approaches.A very exciting result of the incredible performance that Triton achieves, is the ability to fuse NN operations such as Matrix Multiply + LeakyReLU + Batch Norm. Previously, you needed to rely on cuBLAS for fast hand-written Matrix Multiply kernels, and then your LeakyReLU would need to read that result out of memory, and then your Batch Norm would read the LeakyReLU out of memory again.The ability to write very fast kernels, and especially being able to fuse them together, to avoid unnecessary memory round-trips is a big deal!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was a cryptologic linguist for the army and went through a 16 month course of 6-7 hours of classroom instruction per day M-F, native speaking instructors, tons of immersion, and a couple hours of homework each night and left still feeling like I hardly knew the language that I was supposed to be interpreting. Unless your major in college is a specific language, you probably won&#39;t achieve any sort of fluency in your target language from taking a course in it, either.Language learning is hard and a multifaceted thing that no single application is going to adequately prepare you for. Speaking and listening are related skills yet speaking is much harder than listening, and both are much harder than reading (for the vast majority of languages). Rote memorization is necessary. Immersion is necessary. Comprehensible input is necessary.Language learning apps like Duolingo sell the idea of learning a language which is an extremely attractive idea to a lot of people. They also make it a fun activity and incentivize engagement with humor and gamification. The problem is that you can&#39;t possibly become fluent in a language with an app like it and there isn&#39;t any single app that will.I suppose in the end Duolingo&#39;s valuation is more a reflection of people&#39;s desire to learn a language rather than people actually learning a language, though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I am an AI skeptic. I am baffled by anyone who isn’t. I don’t see any path from continuous improvements to the (admittedly impressive) ‘machine learning’ field that leads to a general AI- I share the skepticism towards any progress towards &#39;general AI&#39; - I don&#39;t think that we&#39;re remotely close or even on the right path in any way.- That doesn&#39;t make me a skeptic towards the current state of machine learning though. ML doesn&#39;t need to lead to general AI. It&#39;s already useful in its current forms. That&#39;s good enough. It doesn&#39;t need to solve all of humanity&#39;s problems to be a great tool.I think it&#39;s important to make this distinction and for some reason it&#39;s left implicit or it&#39;s purposefully omitted from the article."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What a confused and muddled post, trying to touch on psychology, philosophy, and mathematics, and missing the mark on basically all three. I&#39;m quite bearish on AI/ML, but calling it a &#34;parlor trick&#34; is like calling modern computers a parlor trick. I mean, at the end of the day, they&#39;re just very fast abacuses, right? Let&#39;s face it: what ML has brought to the forefront -- from self-landing airplanes to self-driving cars, to AI-assisted diagnoses -- is pretty impressive. If you insist on being reductive, sure, I guess it&#39;s &#34;merely&#34; statistics.Bringing up quantitative vs qualitative analysis is just silly, since science has had this problem way before AI. Hume famously described it as the is/ought problem†. And that was a few hundred years ago.Finally, dropping the mic with &#34;I don&#39;t think we&#39;re anywhere close to consciousness&#34; is just bizarre. I don&#39;t think that any serious academic working in AI/ML has made any arguments that claim machine learning models are &#34;conscious.&#34; And Strong AI will probably remain unattainable for a very long time (I&#39;d argue forever). This is not a particularly controversial position.† Okay, it&#39;s not the same thing, but closely related. I suppose the fact–value distinction might be a bit closer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What baffles me is the number of humans who think they are in the personal possession of some super special sacred form of magical and unexplainable intelligence. &#34;AI is just stats&#34; yes, indeed, but so is human intelligence. In many ways, AI from 2010 was already better than human intelligence.Three remarks:- The task many people seem to be benchmarking against is not just a measure of general intelligence, but a measure of how well AI is able to emulate human intelligence. That&#39;s not wrong, but I do find it amusing. Emulating any system within another generally requires an order of magnitude higher performance.- The degree to which human intelligence fails catastrophically in each of our lives, on a continuous basis, is way too quickly forgotten. We have a very selective memory indeed. We have absolutely terrible judgment, are super irrational, and pretty reliably make decisions that are against our own interests, whether it&#39;s with regard to tobacco use, avoidance of physical exercise, or refusal of life-saving medications or prophylactics. We avoid spending time learning maths and science because it&#39;s not cool, and we openly display pride in our anti-intellectual behaviours and attitudes. We&#39;re all incredibly stupid by default.- AI researchers need to work more closely with neuroanatomists. The main thing preventing AI from behaving like a human is the different macro structure of human NNs vs artificial NNs. Our brains aren&#39;t random assortments of randomly connected neurons: there&#39;s structure in there that explains our patterns of behaviour, and that is lacking in even the most modern AI. We can&#39;t expect AI to be human if we don&#39;t give it human structures."</p>

For our everyday workhorse typeface, we exchanged Roboto for Inter.

It looked good and it was widely available free of charge. Tack själv, Rasmus!

How they have pushed Chrome as a &#34;better browser&#34; on the front page of Google (were no one else have been allowed to advertise) to Firefox users since way before Chrome was anywere nearly as good as Firefox, making it both a lie and - more importantly - a massive abuse of dominance in one market to gain monopoly in another just like Microsoft did with IE.As we saw yesterday with AWS authorities are willing to punish rampant abuse if they have a good case and this definitely is one.Edit: since this comment is getting a lot of attention the relevant authority in Norway is Konkurransetilsynet with web address https://konkurransetilsynet.no(Finding the exact correct form on that site and for this purpose seems to be an art and/or science it seems but if you can&#39;t find any just submit somewhere and explain the situation.)It would be beautiful if everyone could post underneath with the address to the equivalent office in your jurisdiction."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It’s a really powerful article, and it’s hard to argue with any of it. What a nightmare it must be to have what happened to Amanda Knox happen to you. A totally innocent person, who was not only imprisoned for years for a crime she had nothing to do with, but also had her name dragged in the mud by the global press for years. To such an extent that most casual observers still think she had something to do with the crime.It’s clear that the filmmakers have no legal obligation to Knox (and she acknowledges as much in the article), but I think it is equally clear that they have a moral obligation to not slander her using a thinly veiled fictional character.It’s a shame too, because the real “Amanda Knox saga” would make for a much more interesting movie: what is it like to have your roomate murdered, your life destroyed, and your identity robbed from you by the global tabloid press? That’s the real Amanda Knox story."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fascinating article.  I thought she was exaggerating when she complained about people accusing her of being a media whore, until I scrolled down to the [flagged] [dead] and saw someone doing just that.But I don&#39;t think she has a choice.  In the past, it would&#39;ve been possible for someone in her shoes to choose obscurity.  In the past, the real Amanda Knox and the idea of Amanda Knox that exists in the collective unconscious of the media and media consumers would&#39;ve drifted apart.  Now, it&#39;s hard to imagine how that could happen.  Even if she invented a new identity and moved to a small town in Alaska (which would be a new kind of prison sentence in some ways), it&#39;d be newsworthy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting to me how the truth got lost, and how uninterested people are in the aftermath.  The real killer ended up with a sentence almost half the length of what Amanda Knox got.  And he is already out of prison.  Italy&#39;s justice system is very different from the US&#39;s, for better or worse."</p>

Employees are horribly treated, wages suppressed, and all sorts of terrible and abusive practices.Then it comes time for me to buy something. I needed a new pair of size 14 sneakers. I drove to Adidas, Footlocker, dicks, and a few other stores but I just couldn’t justify $100 sneakers that didn’t look like prison issued.Opened my Amazon app in my car after leaving the crowded mall, and find what appear to be a decent pair of shoes. FakeSpot agreed with the reviews, and I bought then for $35. They will arrive tomorrow.That kind of convenience is terribly addicting. I haven’t figured out the solution, but I remember what it was like when Walmart came to town, put others out of business, mistreated employees, etc. We were unable to stop it then, how the heck are we going to stop it now?So aside from “just stop buying from Amazon” what can we do ?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That makes Amazon #3, after the federal government and Walmart:     Entity        US Employees
  1. US Government         2.7M
  2. Walmart               1.6M
  3. Amazon                1.0M

If Amazon continues to grow at current rates, it will surpass Walmart&#39;s figure within 2 years.Looking at these figures, it&#39;s evident that these three entities are far larger, wealthier, more connected, and likely more powerful than the vast majority of US cities, the vast majority of small countries in the world, and maybe even a few smaller US states."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m not sure why everyone continually romanticizes brick and mortar retail. Its terribly inefficient, and wasteful of time, energy, space etc.Think of all the Walmart, Dicks, Big Lots parking lots and strip malls that could be converted into better space. Think of how much waste there is when you have to pack, unpack, stage and repack merchandise.Amazon’s distribution is a superior business model which is why it is popular. I’d also reckon that the carbon footprint per package is lower if you account for the driving that is required for more traditional shopping.I’d rather see more competition using a similar business model than a return to concrete strip malls full of big box retailers."</p>

It&#39;s also &gt;10x faster in creating the search index.Here&#39;s the demo also for Wikipedia: https://demo.phiresky.xyz/tmp-ytccrzsovkcjoylr/dist/index.ht...
I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s more efficient than the SQlite version in this form, but it definitely has more upward potential and is more fun to work with.And the corresponding draft PR: https://github.com/tantivy-search/tantivy/pull/1067I sadly haven&#39;t gotten around to working on it more and writing an article about it.Other people are also working on using this stuff to make Sci-hub and LibGen more available by using this in combination with IPFS for distributed and &#34;uncensorable&#34; hosting which is pretty awesome.Edit: Just realized that the OP demo only searches in article titles, while mine searches in full article contents by default. You can search in only the titles in my demo by querying `title:harry title:potter`"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The new particle contains two charm quarks and an up and a down antiquark. Several tetraquarks have been discovered in recent years (including one with two charm quarks and two charm antiquarks), but this is the first one that contains two charm quarks, without charm antiquarks to balance them.This is not the first time a tetraquark has been measured, but instead it&#39;s the first time a tetraquark with two charm quarks and no charm antiquarks. That&#39;s still nice work, but I was initially confused by the headline (&#34;didn&#39;t they discover those already?&#34;)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Quarks are the fundamental building blocks from which matter is constructed.&#34;I sometimes wish would include &#34;In our current model&#34;,
&#34;We now think that&#34;, or some other qualifier.Such absolute statements have been made frequently prior to our current understanding.I have no special knowledge to lead me to believe that quarks are not the end all of parties.But I was happy with atom being the fundamental thing, 
and then electrons, neutrons, protons were the thing as well.The other day I read about Fractons &#34;quasiparticles or Partial Particles&#34;, so now I have to figure those out as well.I have lost track if the graviton has been found yet.
I dont think it has.From a purely layman&#39;s sense of esthetics the current model for particle physics is messy and a little spooky.I have an odd hobby.
I collect old paper encyclopedias from pre 1970
For every language that I speak.  
It takes up MASSIVE amounts of space.The oldest I have been able to acquire on a limited budget
Is 1880.It is always fun to track concepts over time.They all state what the world is like, and how it works as bombastic facts.Yet over time, most of it gets replaced or at least highly refined
and things are removed.Particle physics is an active field with much still to learn or figure out.
Let us keep that in mind."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We&#39;ve gone full circle - CSS components to inline CSS-in-HTML back to CSS components.But I actually think I will use this. A big problem with CSS is that you end up making overrides no matter how composable you make the classes. And some simple things (e.g. responsiveness) are unintuitive and / or annoying to do in CSS. Hence Tailwind&#39;s &#34;CSS-in-HTML&#34; mini classes. But that doesn&#39;t fill the core purpose of CSS, bigger general-purpose classes to avoid repetition. Combine the two (general classes + mini classes for slight case-by-case fixes) and you get the best CSS experience I&#39;ve seen so far (at least I think, I haven&#39;t tried it yet)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m not saying this is ugly but the visual execution of some of these components is poor. No good usage of padding in some examples, poor ratios between the typography and the containers, inconsistent use of different line widths and border radius, weird and incosistent design choices in spacing and proportions…I mean. This looks alright and it will certainly make any UI look pretty decent, but the execution is not superb like the actual TailwindUI library which is incredibly well thought from a visual design perspective. Those components are perhaps less shiny than these but they are incredibly functional and way more intentional.This is a good effort though and I hope to see it improving."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ok, I&#39;ll guess I&#39;ll be the lone voice of dissent here. I don&#39;t like it. I think it goes against the concept of utility classes / functional CSS. As soon as you start making component-level classes, things begin to become opinionated and you lose the universality.My understanding of the functional CSS approach was that you&#39;d make a button component, and use the variety of &#34;atomic&#34; classes to style it. If you&#39;re using a &#34;btn&#34; class etc, it muddles the distinction of where the semantics live, and things get harder to reason about / debug."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Beautiful. The nostalgia hit me very hard with this.I remember in the original version you had all sorts of options, and could even combine screensavers.For people who may not remember: screensavers used to be a neccessity as old CRT tubes would &#39;burn in&#39; an image if they held it static for too long - leaving a shadow of the static image permanently. Screensavers kicked in after a few minutes and displayed something dynamic so as to save your screen from burn in.In the 90&#39;s, having a cool custom screensaver was cool (around the same time that having a custom ringtone on your 3210 was cool), and you&#39;d pay money for software like After Dark."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"https://uxfactor.ca/1151/I know one of the authors of Flying Toasters and sent him the link. Here&#39;s what he had to say:&#34;It&#39;s a rough approximation, which is super cool, but misses all of the nuance.&#34;You see, back in the day, there were very strong competitors to After Dark that had as much or more animations. The thing that set After Dark was a &#34;je ne sais quoi&#34; that felt like an elevated experience. Both the customers &amp; the competitors thought this was some sort of accident, or that the animations were important, but neither of these things was true.&#34;The secret was that people loved the nuance of interacting with the product (&amp; subtlety in the animations) and it was very carefully designed with cognitive science. I pushed the team very hard before I would let anything be released because I insisted on the nuance.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was a kid in the 90s learning to program, writing screen savers was one of the best ways to demo your &#34;skills&#34;. Also just something creative to do when you didn&#39;t really have a project in mind. I still think they&#39;re an underappreciated art form, and it&#39;s kind of disappointing that OSX only ships with a couple really basic ones. Apple should bundle in all the AfterDark modules (there were several releases).There was also an amazing set of screensavers which I don&#39;t remember the name of, but one of the set was called &#39;kaos&#39;, and a lot of them were based on fractals. If anyone recalls the name of that software...[edit] I found it! DarkSide of the Mac by Tom Dowdy. Brilliant. http://poubelle.com/DarkSideDocs.html"</p>

I&#39;ve had a home office.  I&#39;ve worked from bed.There are tons of good ways to do it.Lately I swap between a kitchen table and a chair on my porch. I no longer use multiple screens, I&#39;ve just gotten really fast at swapping windows on my 15&#34; laptop; I&#39;ve gotten good at figuring out how wide my terminal window breaks should be and where my browser dev tools should sit.Surely there are more optimal ways of doing stuff.  Odds are that there is a Taylorist approach that would pull more productivity out of me.  But much like my typing speed (~50WPM) isn&#39;t really the limiting factor in my programming skill, screen real estate isn&#39;t a big factor in getting stuff done for me.But the big thing for me is that, in the end, it&#39;s fine for me to switch stuff up on a monthly or quarterly or yearly basis.I could never have done that when I was in an office.  I couldn&#39;t take 20 min and play banjo or accordion and come back to my problem with a fresh eye.  I couldn&#39;t put on my laundry and hang it up while I listen to other folks on the daily stand up.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"For the past 2 weeks, I&#39;ve been working from a treadmill. It has been incredible. I got a small under-the-desk treadmill for my standing desk and I walk at about 2.5km/hour and get around 20,000 steps in per day. It has improved my mood, my clarity, and also has improved my sleep (because I&#39;m tired of walking). I also find it easier to focus on tasks for some reason.If you can make a setup like this work for you, I highly recommend it. Your body will thank you in the long run.EDIT&gt;&gt; A few of you are asking about the model. I actually bought 2, one for myself and one for my partner, who also loves it.This one is mine https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V7F8QYK. I got it when it had a $100-off coupon, so the price wasn&#39;t as steep. No real complaints so far, except you can&#39;t store it upright. I just roll it out of the way when I want to sit.The one for my partner is https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0895DRWVY. She likes it. It&#39;s a little smaller and can be stored upright and out of the way, which is nice. There have been complaints about the remote (and it only comes with 1), but the manufacturer claims to ship new remotes free of charge if yours breaks.They&#39;re both a little quirky with a very simple LCD screen. Supposedly mine has an app integration for step counting, but I just use my phone in my pocket. They both get the job done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Survey seems pretty flawed and potentially biased. The survey was done by a contractor/home improvement company so maybe they used customer&#39;s as their population?While SWEs might need/want a good desk setup, many office jobs just don&#39;t need it. I&#39;m not sure people are really improvising but rather find sitting with a laptop is how they normally work anyway.And working in the bedroom can be misleading... it&#39;s often a private place you can put a proper desk.I WFH and went from living alone to having 3 roommates who all WFH. I have my bed, desk, and theater setup all in the (master bedroom). It&#39;s actually better than a 1bdr apartment, it&#39;s quieter (no leafblowers!) and I don&#39;t have dirty dishes right behind me.I have a small desk but a 4K 32&#34; monitor and a vertical 1080p one. A microphone on an arm and NO webcam; I use screen sharing 90% of the time but I don&#39;t need to see peoples faces. (I really wish video calling didn&#39;t compress &gt;1080p screens so much). If I need a webcam, I use my laptop.Maybe the pandemic changed things but you could get decent chairs for $20 at goodwill.I guess I&#39;m just skeptical that a majority of people have difficulty working from their home... You know the place you live and pick your own furniture."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Making the item system polymorphic was ultimately a mistake, but that was a big one.Q: Why was this was a mistake?A: When you declare a class that’s a kind of item, it locks you into that structure much more tightly than if you just have member elements. It’s nice to be able to use virtual functions and that kind of thing, but the tradeoffs are just too much. I started using a “tool” item in the hierarchy, which started to get various functionality, and can now support anything from a stepladder to a beehive to a mortar (and pestle, separately, ha ha), and it just feels more flexible, and I wish every crafted item in the game were under that umbrella.We do a lot of procedural generation, and if we wanted to, say, generate an item that acts partially like one thing and partially like another, it’s just way harder to do that when you are locked down in a class hierarchy.Preach:https://ericlippert.com/2015/04/27/wizards-and-warriors-part...https://ericlippert.com/2015/04/30/wizards-and-warriors-part...https://ericlippert.com/2015/05/04/wizards-and-warriors-part...https://ericlippert.com/2015/05/07/wizards-and-warriors-part...https://ericlippert.com/2015/05/11/wizards-and-warriors-part...I have certainly committed all of these sins, too."</p>

This is way past censoring Alex Jones. You can&#39;t possibly censor every crackpot conspiracy theorist. Actually, we&#39;re probably all crackpot conspiracy theorists in some way. We probably all believe some conspiracy about 9/11 or the NSA or elections or vaccines or masks or aliens or royal families or whatever.The rate of censoring is almost certainly accelerating faster than facebook&#39;s growth, and once you&#39;ve been censored once, you&#39;re likely to radically curb your use of that platform. I can&#39;t imagine that FB doesn&#39;t have stats on how many people keep using FB after they&#39;ve been censored just once.FB only works when you and 99% of your social group are on there.And the network effect works in reverse, too."</p>

More recently, I have consistently played Starcraft II since its release and enjoy a sense of mastery over that game unparalleled by my experience in any other.I haven&#39;t purchased new Blizzard products since the Hong Kong censorship debacle[1] and quit playing Hearthstone at that time. However I had still played some of my other old favorites, reasoning that I was not providing them further financial support. The recent announcements about their terrible, sexist culture had challenged that notion for me, and I was not sure what to do.This news is the straw that breaks my back. That Activision/Blizzard would double down on their despicable behavior and stance in this way is completely beyond the pale, and I for one will never again fire up those games that I loved so much.Thanks for ruining that for me, Blizzard.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitzchung_controversy"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Steve Jobs quote on why Xerox failed [1] strikes again. The finance people have taken over Acti-Blizzard and they&#39;ve been coasting for 10+ years on their original franchises. All we have is annual CoD releases and Blizzrad coasting on their old properties where Blizzrd hasn&#39;t had a significant original release in 10+ years.This effort seems like it&#39;s part of the ruthless approach to controlling costs that slowly strangle a company from within.I believe WoW is the #2 property (after CoD) at Acti-Blizzard and it&#39;s clearly changed from one of delivering a game to simply extracting as much money as possible from each customer much like how almost all mobile games do.The state of California&#39;s complaint is bad. I mean really bad. The fact that 3-4 different people from AB all released different statements in the last week should tell you exactly how bad it is. That&#39;s classic panic mode. There should only be one.This latest move tells you the company believes it will blow over and they&#39;re looking to do the minimal required to appease the detractors and get back to business as usual without having to pay people more or pay out a bunch of lawsuits.Honestly, the heads of J Allen Brack and Bobby Kotick in particular should roll over this lawsuit.[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlBjNmXvqIMEDIT: commenters have noted (correctly) that I overlooked Overwatch. This was a significant release but it seems to also have waned in popularity and Overwatch 2 is inextricably going in some weird PVE direction.Other than that you have a poor received Diablo sequel, a series of lackluster to bad WoW expansions, a disastrous Warcraft 3 remaster and complete abandonment of the RTS genre that propelled them to success in the first place.WC3 Reforged (&#34;Refunded&#34;) was significant in that it was not only underwhelming and plagued with problems it made the original game worse with a forced download and loss of functionality.The most significant change however was Blizzard not wanting a repeat of missing the MOBA boat with Dota 2 by adding a condition that all the IP for third-party maps belong to Blizzard, completely killing that ecosystem."</p>

I know, you&#39;re thinking that&#39;s a silly gimmick and it can&#39;t possibly be any good, but it was actually done quite well. At least until the later parts of Calculus where the situations have to get pretty contrived.Highly recommended, at least for precocious kids who like math and fantasy novels."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Speaking of books about calculus, I like Robert Strichartz&#39;s The Way of Analysis. Robert develops intuition and motivation of key concepts in an amazingly detailed way. He often starts with an intuitive but flawed idea, and then gradually revises the idea to a mature definition or proof. The whole book focuses on &#34;why&#34;: why real numbers are defined that way, why limit uses the delta-epsilon notation, why we need to topology, etc and etc. Reading the book is more like an adventure than following a set path. The author explains his approach eloquently: &#34;Mathematics is more than a collection of theorems, definitions, problems and techniques; it is a way of thought....My goal in writing this book is to communicate the mathematical ideas of the subject to the reader. I have tried to be generous with explanations....I believe that what you learn through a process of struggle is more likely to stick with you than what you learn without effort....Understanding mathematics is a complex process. It involves not only following the details of an argument and verifying its correctness, but seeing the overall strategy of the argument, the role played by every hypothesis, and understanding how different theorems and definitions fit together to create the whole. It is a long-term process; in a sense, you cannot appreciate the significance of the first theorem until you have learned the last theorem.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When learning Calc, I always appreciated anyone who could teach the main points without slipping into formal textbook descriptions and terminology. The more advanced one gets in Math, (eg, your teacher or professor with an advanced Math degree), the more they tend to do it, even of they try not to.I like this text - reminds me of &#34;the complete idiot&#39;s guide to calculus&#34; which I used as a companion to my Calc textbook (Stewart) when learning. Not sure I would have faired as well without it.https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Idiots-Guide-Calculus/dp/002...It gives a great and sometimes humorous understanding, which formed a nice framework when I moved on to Vector Calc, Differential Equations, etc later on. At that point in your math career, you can&#39;t (or shouldn&#39;t try to) rely on mindless algorithms/processes to solve problems like you may have in high school. You&#39;ve got to understand what you&#39;re doing.Ps, I doubt many on HN really needed to hear that, but it may be a useful note for somebody."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a VIM-only dev, spend all my day in a Tmux session, and I use the command-line probably a lot more than average.The single best improvement to my command-line workflow I&#39;ve done in the last few years has been switching shells. First I moved from Bash to ZSH, but about 2 years ago I switched again to Fish.Why I love it:
- history completion searches by default, so I can just type part of a command, hit arrow-up and look through only the relevant results (ZSH also did this, but Fish is better)- tab completions are shown to you in advance (in light gray in front of your cursor)- Basic configuration (which is good enough, honestly) can be done via a web browser. Just run &#34;fish_config&#34;, and it starts a web server, pops open your browser and any changes you make there are saved to your actual config files. No more looking up syntax.- aliases (which are called abbreviations) are actually expanded after typing, so the full command appears in your history. You can also edit the full command before running it, if you need."</p>

I&#39;d be pretty okay with going in if I had my own office with 4 walls.First job of my career, they told me I would have an office of my own. First day I come back do for full time (I had interned there too with my own office), they tell me they&#39;re switching buildings to go open office in about a month&#39;s time. I got a precious few weeks with a personal office, and then it was all gone. I hated this change of scenery mmediately, but I guess I got used to it after a few years.Working from home took me back to that zen. I didn&#39;t even know how much I missed it - how much I needed my own space to feel productive.I&#39;ve since changed jobs, and I kinda dread having to go to the open office nightmare once this is all over. The facilities are way nicer than my last job, but it&#39;s still an open office.Open. Office. As. Implemented. In. Our. Industry. Is. Stupid."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sounds like the relationship is dysfunctional in both directions.On the one hand, the employer set up a panopticon in the office, with crappy furniture, lots of interruptions, a crappy office kitchen, no decent food (i.e. needing to bring food from home). Garbage in, garbage out. Of course nobody is happy to sit in traffic to come to an environment like that.Then we have the author, who has the mistaken idea that the number one most important thing that you do at your job is your directly measurable productivity. Not relationship-building, just pure &#34;shut up and let me sit down and get my work done.&#34; Personally, I&#39;d prefer it if engineering work didn&#39;t go the way of Amazon warehouse workers, because if &#34;productivity&#34; is the sole metric of an employee&#39;s performance, just wait until your employer decides to try and optimize it.Best of luck to the OP at the dice roll that is the next company he works for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I noticed is that while more experienced people are productive working from home, it is devastating for fresh starting employees.

This effectively cut down DS deployments from potentially days to about 45 seconds. It was seen that be hard and I had a good amount of help from our awesome devops person and worked through a number of issues with the lead dev. When this was delivered everyone loved it, lots of kudos and compliments because it was seen as hard. I felt like a bit of a fraud as I felt I had a lot of help and it really was a team effort, I made efforts to highlight this.I also worked on my own (with the exception of some nginx issues) on a feature to keep an in browser file browse up to date for all users via web sockets. This was really a view on a git repo accessed through the Gitlab api, it was a nightmare to deal with because of the way Git tracks (or doesn’t really) folders. This feature was seen to be easy and I slaved on it for days and eventually weeks because of edge cases and feature creep to no kudos or compliments.

(e.g. I keep getting told I don&#39;t &#34;have a scientific background&#34;, so I&#39;m not qualified to work on problem X, despite the fact that I have a PhD in the field and extensive experience on closely related problems)It&#39;s because I&#39;m seen as a technician, not an engineer or a scientist.That&#39;s because I&#39;m the person everyone picks for the &#34;hey, just whip up this quick demo / generate this report / prototype this idea for me&#34;, and therefore I get critiqued when it&#39;s not fast enough / polished enough, despite it being a &#34;drop everything and have this done by 10pm&#34; situation every time.The big things I&#39;ve accomplished, other people have _always_ gotten credit for.  The things that fail, I get the blame for.So serious advice from someone who&#39;s too old to change it now:  SAY NO TO URGENT ONE-OFF REQUESTS FROM MANAGEMENT!!!  Once you start, it&#39;s a trap that&#39;s really hard to get out of and gets you nowhere career wise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A classic &#34;easy&#34; thing that appears &#34;hard&#34;: write a little bit of assembly. Note, a little bit[1].Writing assembly, again, in small amounts, is exactly the kind of thing that is difficult to start, and fails spectacularly if you have little experience. Debugging is a pain. But you can totally get the hang of writing assembly, and as long as you are doing it for the right reasons (TM), it&#39;s justified, and heroic. The key is you need to write and debug a little at a time.Case in point, I wrote an entire Wasm interpreter[2] in x86-64 asm over the past few months. I wrote it a little at a time, had lots of unit tests, and am working in an engine that was already completely functional (with a slower interpreter).[1] If you find yourself writing more than a hundred or so assembly instructions in a sitting, you are going to fail. If you find yourself writing more than a few thousand assembly instructions, total, you have probably have already failed.[2] https://github.com/titzer/wizard-engine/blob/master/src/engi..."</p>

The professor who studied them (Prusiner) had to overcome tons of resistance and the experiments were heroic (often waiting months for mice to die).  It&#39;s really funny that everybody resisted it until somebody mentioned that there was a plausible physical mechanism of refolding catalysis."</p>

But it doesn&#39;t. For example, I have a page on the American Revolution. Google&#39;s context sensitive ads are usually for travel agencies, presumably based on the place names on the page.

One of the things I did was keep an eye on mysterious traffic.I managed to find a huge spam network that set up a proxy service that delivered normal content, but injected &#34;you  can win an iPhone!&#34; spam to all users visiting them.Since I was in the position of being able to monitor their proxy traffic towards many sites I managed. I could easily document their behaviour.In the same time, I wrote a crawler that visited their sites over a long, long time. I learned that they kept injecting hidden links to other sites in their network, so I did let my bot look at those also.By this time, I also got a journalist with me that started to look at the money flow to try and find the organisation behind it.My bot found in excess of 100K domains being used for this operation, targeting all of westeren Europe. All the 100K sites contained proxied content and was hidden behind Cloudflare, but thanks to the position I had, I managed to find their backend anyways.We reported the sites to both CF and Google, and to my knowledge, not a single site were removed before the people behind it took it down.Oh, and the journalist?

And it&#39;s mainly not even their fault.I&#39;ve been using Google search for all kinds of research for 15 years. There used to be a time when you could find the answer to pretty much anything. I could find leaked source codes on public FTP servers, links to pirated software and keygens, detailed instructions for a variety of useful things. That was the golden age of the web.These days, all the &#34;interesting&#34; data on the Internet is all inside closed Telegram chats, facebook groups, Discords or the rare public website here and there that Google 
doesn&#39;t want to index (like sci-hub, or other piracy sites).The data that remains on SERPs is now also heavily censored for arbitrary reasons. &#34;For your health&#34;, &#34;For your protection&#34;. Google search is done."</p>

It looks like the German content is generated through GPT2 or 3. It makes no real sense if you read it.
If you go on the page you are immediately redirected to a scam just like the article mentions.
Interestingly they use &#34;.it&#34; domains here. It also looks like the domains might have been hacked or are expired domains that have been bought.For example if you check havfruen4220.dk on archive.org you can see that it appears to have been a legitimate business website before. https://web.archive.org/web/20181126203158/https://havfruen4...How do they rank so well?I&#39;ve checked the domain on ahref and it has almost no backlinks. But if you look closely you will see that all the results that rank very well have been added very recently.
On the screenshots in the article you can see things like &#34;for 2 timer siden&#34; which means 2 hours ago.
It looks like google is ranking pages that have a very recent publishing date higher.Edit: Here is what the content of such a site looks like: https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Bk0VsM..."</p>

They can host a blog for you, or you can publish to their service for free using your own blog by pointing Micro.blog at your RSS feed (I do the latter).  Think blogging but with a social element, facilitating both interaction and content discovery.Second, there&#39;s the IndieWeb movement more broadly (https://indieweb.org/), which advocates for a whole ecosystem of distributed, open technologies for enriching the blogging ecosystem and encouraging interoperability.Third, believe it or not, webrings live on!  The indiewebring (https://indieweb.org/indiewebring), for example, is a fun way to find additional bloggers out there.As you can tell, I&#39;m a fan of blogging and the IndieWeb movement... :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Awesome, I agree, personal blogs are great.I can&#39;t help but notice all the blogs tagged &#34;software&#34; in the list (so far). In fact, I think if there was a filter to exclude software blogs, there might be only a few remaining?I missed out on the whole RSS thing when it was popular. My sense was that it solved the problem of knowing when, among a whole bunch of blogs, a site had new content.Perhaps it exists, I want an app/site that will scrape a list of sites I give it (blogs for example) to show me any new content each day. A personal home page with titles and perhaps a hundred or so words from each site I track that has new content.In the broader picture, I feel overwhelmed by the amount of technology these days, spend too much of my time browsing, etc. (HN, case in point). So I am looking for something I call TRAoT, The Right Amount of Technology.Maybe it&#39;s a &#34;magic mirror&#34; that displays this overview, home page. Interactivity is minimal or nil. No ability to comment, follow links, etc. Like the morning newspaper of old, I spend a little time in the morning with it and then go about my day &#34;offline&#34;.In short I am looking at ways to take the open-ended and stress inducing (anxiety inducing?) relationships I have with technology and replace them with a more staid, maybe even serendipitous, relationship that allows me back more free time, less stress.Maybe this &#34;Solar Punk&#34; thing is something of the Zeitgeist of our time."</p>

More than any development ideology just having the passion to continue working on whatever it is you&#39;re doing is an extremely powerful force for creating useful software. And SumatraPDF is definitely useful software, has been for a long time.&#34;ideology doesn&#39;t matter as much as doing&#34; being said the syntax valid semantic invalid error at the end of this excerpt in the section on extensive tests being overrated gave me a chuckle:&gt; Dogma is powerful. Sometimes in my corporate life I felt like writing tests was just going through motion. Maybe we should spend more time writing code instead, I though?In all seriousness I agree though. In a project where you write the majority of the code it is possible to overdo tests in a way that you are wasting more time than you&#39;re saving yourself and in a passion project efficiency isn&#39;t always as important as interest anyways."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I&#39;ve wasted many an hour combing through Google and my search history to look up a good article, blog post, or just something I&#39;ve seen before.This is the fault of web browser vendors who have yet to give a damn about book marks.&gt; Apollo is a search engine and web crawler to digest your digital footprint. What this means is that you choose what to put in it. When you come across something that looks interesting, be it an article, blog post, website, whatever, you manually add it (with built in systems to make doing so easy).So it&#39;s a searchable database for bookmarks then.&gt; The first thing you might notice is that the design is reminiscent of the old digital computer age, back in the Unix days. This is intentional for many reasons. In addition to paying homage to the greats of the past, this design makes me feel like I&#39;m searching through something that is authentically my own. When I search for stuff, I genuinely feel like I&#39;m travelling through the past.This does not make any sense. It&#39;s Unix-like because it feels old? It seems like the author thoroughly misses the point of unix philosophy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My version of this is https://dogsheep.github.io/ - the idea is to pull your digital footprint from various different sources (Twitter, Foursquare, GitHub etc) into SQLite database files, then run Datasette on top to explore them.On top of that I built a search engine called Dogsheep Beta which builds a full-text search index across all of the different sources and lets you search in one place: https://github.com/dogsheep/dogsheep-betaYou can see a live demonstration of that search engine on the Datasette website: https://datasette.io/-/beta?q=dogsheepThe key difference I see with Apollo is that Dogsheep separates fetching of data from search and indexing, and uses SQLite as the storage format. I&#39;m using a YAML configuration to define how the search index should work: https://github.com/simonw/datasette.io/blob/main/templates/d... - it defines SQL queries that can be used to build the index from other tables, plus HTML fragments for how those results should be displayed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love this idea, but the name “digital footprint” sort of implies it’s what effect you’ve had on the Internet for helping keep your online persona under control: your tweets, comments, emails, et cetera.But this is a great idea! Having a search engine for vaguely _anything_ you touch very much does look like it’d increase the signal:noise ratio. It’d be interesting to be able to add whole sites (using, say, DuckDuckGo as an external crawler) to be able to fetch general ideas, such as, say, “Stack Exchange posts marked with these tags”."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few key differences with other OSS companies that IMHO are positive:1) Element or other matrix components do not require a copy right transfer. That means Element is hard to re-license under another license than its current one.2) The license for Element is Apache 2.0. A fine choice for any OSS project looking to maintain a healthy ecosystem of contributors for decades to come.3) The ecosystem has a diversity of stakeholders and contributors outside of Element the company maintaining various components, integrations, etc. It&#39;s an ecosystem that already serves many millions of users.4) Not all the Matrix components are under the Element umbrella (see 3). Element is probably dominant in this community but it&#39;s based on merit rather than ownership. E.g. the Matrix foundation is mostly run by people outside of Element. Even the Element apps have contributions from outside Element the company (see 1).5) Decentralization is at the core of the Element sales pitch. They are unlikely to want to walk back on that; or even be able to do that without damaging their credibility. For better or worse, that&#39;s what they are selling and stuck with. And they seem successful with it too. Hence the investment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Element foundation should use some of that sweet money to:1) buy FluffyChat and some serious UI designers, because Element is probably one of the worst matrix clients in terms of UX.2) fix decryption issues that happen randomly even by just using Element on the matrix.org server: https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/issues/1721 as it&#39;s a real show-stopper once you hit it3) add support for multiple accounts and identities (too many requests to list on the issue tracker), since federation is great, but it&#39;s not always wanted.Disclaimer: I managed to convince a group of technical users to switch over to matrix. We stay for the principle, but not really for the experience so far. FluffyChat is the best client we tried on mobile. On desktop, I&#39;m glad weechat-matrix and gomuks exist, because all the other clients &#34;reek&#34; to us. And even if you like the modern chat UIs, they&#39;re really not bug-free either.Overall many clients and some severs to choose from, but I did prefer irc just for the simple-no-BS-clients alone (the protocol has nothing to do with it)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fluffychat is mentioned a lot here as a good UI/UX alternative to Element. Just wanted to bring up another that I&#39;m working on called Syphon. It&#39;s not at the stage where it can compete with Fluffychat in terms of spec parity or maturity, but I think it&#39;s worth discussing as an effort.https://syphon.orghttps://github.com/syphon-org/syphonLike I said, it&#39;s still very much in Alpha and needs quite a bit of work, but the UX flows and design have been well received by others. Though there is an opinionated default UX and design paradigm, there is a focus is to make everything customizable and the theming options are growing over every release.The goal is to eventually find a sweet spot between Discord and Signal and bridge the gap to Matrix between those communities.I have a demanding day job and other obligations that keep me busy, but I spend nearly all my free time and every vacation in the last year working on this project. We&#39;re constantly looking for other contributors and there&#39;s several other ways to help including donations. Feel free to  join the official room for updates to track progress and please feel free to reach out with feedback!https://matrix.to/#/#syphon:matrix.orgAdditionally, I just merged Multi-account support this week and it will be in the next release. Not sure of any other Matrix client that has this feature, so there&#39;s some unique features that we&#39;re focusing on to set it apart."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something about this reminds me of the &#39;Winning Ticket Hypothesis&#39; in artifical neural networks: that some &#39;random&#39; initializations prime a network far better for later faster learning. From https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635 - the abstract:Neural network pruning techniques can reduce the parameter counts of trained networks by over 90%, decreasing storage requirements and improving computational performance of inference without compromising accuracy. However, contemporary experience is that the sparse architectures produced by pruning are difficult to train from the start, which would similarly improve training performance.We find that a standard pruning technique naturally uncovers subnetworks whose initializations made them capable of training effectively. Based on these results, we articulate the &#34;lottery ticket hypothesis:&#34; dense, randomly-initialized, feed-forward networks contain subnetworks (&#34;winning tickets&#34;) that - when trained in isolation - reach test accuracy comparable to the original network in a similar number of iterations. The winning tickets we find have won the initialization lottery: their connections have initial weights that make training particularly effective.We present an algorithm to identify winning tickets and a series of experiments that support the lottery ticket hypothesis and the importance of these fortuitous initializations. We consistently find winning tickets that are less than 10-20% of the size of several fully-connected and convolutional feed-forward architectures for MNIST and CIFAR10. Above this size, the winning tickets that we find learn faster than the original network and reach higher test accuracy.Are these innate patterns of activity priming mammalian brains in a similar way?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To put this into context, retinal waves (essentially self-propagating excitations along the retina) pre-birth have been known to exist and help neural organization for what must be 20-30 years. What&#39;s new in this paper is that they additionally confirmed that the direction of the propagating waves coincided with the mouse&#39;s typical optical flow pattern, essentially helping priming motion-detection neurons in addition to the well-known edge-detection neurons early.I wouldn&#39;t compare this to dreaming really, it&#39;s a very different process where top-down connections hallucinate sensations. This is a completely bottom-up process, it&#39;s more or less like a test-bench connected to the optic nerve generating moving edges pre-birth."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is amazing. I built one to help my nephew walk, and now selling commercially ( http://trexorobotics.com )I am fed-up at the lack of options available to individuals. People thought that everyone will get an exoskeleton and be able to walk with it everywhere. But the industry ran into many challenges.A big one that many dont understand is getting insurance coverage. The way the US healthcare system is designed, it will only cover restoration of mobility, not a restoration of function. So, from their perspective, a wheelchair and some pain meds can do the job easily.I believe that they key is to start with children, this is where you have families desperate for a solution, higher costs due to them growing and spending their entire life in a wheelchair, and the option to truly have a life changing impact.But things are changing, people are starting to notice the work that we are doing. We need a lot more people building exoskeletons and similar powered orthotics!!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been making my own, purely as a pipe-dream to have some hope of walking again, it&#39;s not easy but I&#39;m hoping it&#39;ll be a better fit than consumer ones, and probably cheaper.I feel like we&#39;ve made leaps and bounds in prosthetics this past decade but orthotics and exoskeletons haven&#39;t been following the trend for some reason. As an engineer I imagine there are some significant design constraints that make it hard but seeing what we&#39;re capable of doing in any other industry I can&#39;t help but feel the problem has to be something other than purely technical limitations.  
The price is also a big issue, 10k for the cheapest exoskeletons, 150k for the one in this article."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Because IE was seriously outdated, lacking support for cutting-edge web APIs and technologies enabling the modern websites and web apps we use today.This is just false, or at best only half of the story to make a false equivalence. IE was cutting edge until Firefox. The biggest problem with IE was all the insanely weird shit it did, not missing features. It would “fix” missing tags, that would then be broken on every standards compliant browser, had active x, and had an absolutely insane amount of security bugs.Mobile safari ain’t the IE of the modern day. It’s just fucking not. I’m sorry. Chrome is closer to IE than Safari because of market share AND developers developing exclusively for it forgetting anything and everything else.Does mobile safari still suck? Sure. But we don’t need to call it IE or constantly drone on with comparisons to IE. Let something suck in its own unique and shitty way, please."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple has its own opinions about what web standards it should implement. It’s as simple as that. Google has been extremely successful in convincing developers that browsers that don’t behave like Chrome are behaving wrong.Don’t get me wrong, I wish Safari had more features, fewer bugs, and an evergreen release cycle. It’s clear Apple do not see themselves as competing with Chrome, largely because of iOS, and I do want them to take it more seriously. But the people who write Chrome explicitly do not care about other browsers, and think that the world would be a better place if Chrome were the only one. Between that behavior and the whole AMP fiasco, I’m surprised so much of the blame gets thrown at Apple for destroying the web. Am I supposed to be writing PWAs now, or AMP pages? If Reddit can’t figure it out, how the fuck am I supposed to?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"  &gt;Why did developers and software engineers hate IE so much? Because IE was seriously outdated, lacking support for cutting-edge web APIs and technologies enabling the modern websites and web apps we use today.

Nonsense. The almost universal contempt for Internet Exploder amongst web developers had nothing to do with lack of support for cutting edgw APIs. It was because Internet Exploder refused to follow basic web standards and was stuffed it full of proprietary and  non-standard rendering quirks.This meant you could guarantee that any website you designed and that you ensured followed web standards and rendered perfectly on every browser known to man would either break or display completely differently on IE. So you had to then pollute your lovely clean code with countless ugly hacks and conditionals just to ensure your site rendered the same on IE as it did everywhere else.That was why every web developer not working in a Microsoft bubble loathed that browser."</p>

It&#39;s the result of a two year investigation and the claims are.. shocking.I want to make a point about &#34;culture fit&#34;. &#34;Culture fit&#34; in a company typically comes down to &#34;we like you&#34; and the reason why people like other people is that they are like them. Similar age, background, whatever. It&#39;s why Stanford grads probably like other Stanford grads.This &#34;we like you&#34; can and does lead to discrimination.But here&#39;s the even darker side of this. Toxic cultures of sexual harassment as alleged in the complaint against Activision-Blizzard always come down to a few key individuals who then &#34;spread&#34; by hiring or promoting other people who are like then. I doubt this is ever explicit. It&#39;s more that you can sense a fellow predator (make no mistake: they are preying on vulnerable staff).So without intervention this toxicity will tend to spread. Those who oppose it will leave. Those who tow the lines get promoted.And it&#39;s leadership&#39;s responsibility to root this out and eliminate it. Heads should roll here. Maybe even J Allen Brack&#39;s and/or Bobby Kotick&#39;s. If you want to take credit for the successes you also have to take responsibility for the giant failures here.Oh and whoever wrote and sent out that statement about how the state was pursuing this was why so many businesses are leaving California needs to be fired. It was so utterly tone deaf and irrelevant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems to largely match a lot of the same things that happened with Riot Games over the last couple of years. I am hoping that these actions can help spread awareness of any issues that may be present at Blizzard and past, current, and future employees won&#39;t face the same issues. It is a long road to be traveled to get there.I hope that the current WFH situation doesn&#39;t detract from the walkout. A lot of the visibility raised when Riot went through this was outside of the Riot gates where employees were congregated.Without speculating on the claims, I do find it interesting that the DFEH has lawsuits against both Riot Games and Blizzard for similar issues. I recall reading that Riot&#39;s response was that the DFEH was not working in good faith: are both of these companies aligning their responses, is the DFEH out of line, or is the industry just that broken?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Appeal to public opinion is generally a great idea but there is a risk.  Activision gets no sympathy from me, but I also don&#39;t think the answer will come from the masses. 
 I&#39;m not sure that most gamers really care about sexism in the gaming industry.  Video games are synthetic, we don&#39;t really see the people behind them.  At least in movies we see the actors.  If push comes to shove, I think most gamers will still be lining up for the latest AAA title no matter what they hear about the company that created it.  Imho change therefore has to come from something other than public opinion.  This lawsuit is exactly that: the government enforcing a code of behavior because the market clearly cannot do it on its own.  The system is working."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Zulip&#39;s search is powered by this built-in Postgres full-text search feature, and it&#39;s been a fantastic experience. There&#39;s a few things I love about it:* One can cheaply compose full-text search with other search operators by just doing normal joins on database indexes, which means we can cheaply and performantly support tons of useful operators (https://zulip.com/help/search-for-messages).* We don&#39;t have to build a pipeline to synchronize data between the real database and the search database. Being a chat product, a lot of the things users search for are things that changed recently; so lag, races, and inconsistencies are important to avoid. With the Postgres full-text search, all one needs to do is commit database transactions as usual, and we know that all future searches will return correct results.* We don&#39;t have to operate, manage, and scale a separate service just to support search. And neither do the thousands of self-hosted Zulip installations.Responding to the &#34;Scaling bottleneck&#34; concerns in comments below, one can send search traffic (which is fundamentally read-only) to a replica, with much less complexity than a dedicated search service.Doing fancy scoring pipelines is a good reason to use a specialized search service over the Postgres feature.I should also mention that a weakness of Postgres full-text search is that it only supports doing stemming for one language. The excellent PGroonga extension (https://pgroonga.github.io/) supports search in all languages; it&#39;s a huge improvement especially for character-based languages like Japanese. We&#39;re planning to migrate Zulip to using it by default; right now it&#39;s available as an option.More details are available here: https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/full-text-..."</p>

Now that Apple has released a patch for it widespread reverse engineering will begin immediately and it&#39;ll only be a matter of time until packaged exploits become part of standard mass-use toolkits. Having a patch ready to deploy is great, but simultaneously means it&#39;s all the more important to get it deployed fairly promptly if it&#39;s something that could have serious root/remote execution potential.Though I suppose if this bug can be used for a jailbreak there may be some people who&#39;d actively want to stay on 14.7 as well. It&#39;s too bad on iOS Apple forces people to choose between security and control of their own systems and doesn&#39;t at least allow a purchase-time option to have the ability to load ones own root signing certificate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thank you once again for writing such an excellent article &lt;3In contrast to some other comments here, I love the narrative style. After all, these are half tutorials half entertainment - and the entertainment keeps it enticing. I would not have spent nearly two hours reading about the nitty-gritty of futures implementation details today if it weren&#39;t for the way you write about things.To put it the other way - if I wanted to read a super condensed, concise reference of how these things work, I would, you know, read a reference. The narrative style of building things on your own, solving problems as you face them, picking tools and libraries on the way, feels relatable as the everyday lived experience of software development. It feels appropriate for the medium - it&#39;s a blog after all!Besides, blogs are the perfect place to mention the tiny useful tools and libraries people might not have heard of. References and books might err on the side of being &#34;neutral&#34; and not making opinionated recommendations, but this can also lead to unknown unknowns. People don&#39;t know what they are missing out on! Luckily, blogs have more freedom here. Mentioning things like `cargo-edit`, `serde` and others can probably make some readers feel like &#34;one of today&#39;s lucky ten thousand&#34; - enjoying the newly-gained quality of life improvements."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I don&#39;t know! Why do they truncate stuff like that?Because Linux limits thread names to 15 bytes (not including the required terminal nul).Other unices are better though not great, macOS is 63 I think.By comparison Windows allows 32… kilobytes.Though “runtime” is probably what should be shortened here, “rt” is literally the name of the tokio features for configuring the runtime, so that would likely be more understandable than the trailing “-w”."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So, most people reading this aren&#39;t looking for the marketing section. But I wanted to point something out I see all the time. Take a look at the roles under CMO at a 125 person company:--CMO (15)Director, Product Marketing, plus 3 PMMs (4)Director, Demand Gen, plus 3 marketers (4)Director, Sales Enablement, plus 2 marketers (3)Director, Brand Marketing (3)PR &amp; Analyst Relations (1-2)Events/Community (1)--What I posit is that Product Marketing is useless as a position and should be eliminated most of the time.The role ends up being:
- Jane Doe is the Product Marketer for product X. She&#39;s responsible for growing it as much as possible.
- She works with Anne X. in demand gen to make ads to promote the product to new customers.
- She works with Hillary Y. in email marketing to cross promote to existing customers
- She works with tech to do landing page/funnel testing.However what I find is that the role just adds friction and useless tests to show value. Let the subject matter experts (in demand gen, email, website testing) create the plan for each product holistically. Product Marketers are dead weight 80% of the time.I would only say this anonymously but its true. Source: I&#39;m a marketing consultant that has worked with dozens of fast growing SaaS companies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a good rough outline. As the author says, it&#39;s not meant to be a perfect target that fits every company. Adjust accordingly.I like how he limits the number of C-level titles in the early stages to just a CEO and CTO. It&#39;s a common mistake for startup founders to hand out too many C-level titles to their cofounders and early hires. This causes problems when the company outgrows some (or most) of those people. If you need to bring in a more experienced CMO, CRO, CSO, or other C-level, your only options are to demote the existing C-level and replace them with a new boss or to arrange their exit from the company. Neither are good looks, and neither make people happy.Much better to start with Director and VP level titles in the early days. You can either bring in a C-level above them when the time is right, or promote them to C-level if they grow into the role.That said, most SaaS I&#39;ve worked with would want more people on backend/devops at the earl stages. Having 3 people total handle combined devops and backend development is a big risk, especially if any of them want to go on vacation or leave for other jobs. Downtime and server outages are not a good look for a growing SaaS, so don&#39;t skimp on people who can keep it up and running."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why do the number of front end devs exceed the back end? Does anyone else see a problem here? Front end effort has always been a fraction of back end effort on the systems I&#39;ve developed. If that&#39;s not the case, I can only hypothesize it&#39;s because front end toolchains have gotten overly complex for what they accomplish. Not only that, but I would posit that for most SaaS ventures, the back end is where the differentiation and value is delivered, so that is where the bulk of dev resources should be deployed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Neat. I’ve been looking for something like this for gamedev — being able to model pseudo-realistic simulation of planetary evolution (for my interest, just starting at plate tectonics and going up until wind patterns) to provide a “basis” for further simulation.It’s surprisingly hard to google though; almost all content is simple perlin noise generation that looks kind of correct but ultimately produces total nonsense (so any further derived rules have to also be total nonsense) — generally constrained with further nonsense rules to produce higher level concepts like “animals” and “biomes” that can’t be touched meaningfully.Other material I can find is far too involved, and far too slow — targeting actual simulation of the earth. The few that do it with the goal of “just realistic enough” still end up being 10+ minutes generation time for small worlds. Modeling erosion processes being the main culprit, afaict.Definitely stealing this one, for all my nefarious deeds."</p>

Essentially, it&#39;s a search problem -- take some elements and probabilistically form increasingly complex molecular machines to the point where they become self-replicating and exhibit the basic properties of life. Once this bootstrapping has begun, it&#39;s a matter of subjecting the proto-lifeforms to evolutionary pressures, and over time, they will &#34;evolve&#34; to become increasingly complex organisms."</p>

We don&#39;t have to put up with this. We could pass a law and ban new code in unsafe languages from national security threatening devices like phones or cyberphysical devices like self-driving cars and we would be the better for it in under a decade. We could even have taxes to give breathing room during a transitionary period to encourage it before outright banning it, but we don&#39;t. We don&#39;t because so often it is less of a hassle for the government to trust the private sector that it is to take some real position on the regulatory issues that matter.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I did a Ph.D. in number theory, published a few dozen research papers, and have programmed a lot and this post sounds about right to me.  I did CS as an undergrad, before doing a math Ph.D., and remember being very surprised that math papers weren&#39;t a lot more wrong than they actually are (since computer software is so often full of bugs, and all it takes is one single bug to completely invalidate an entire paper).  When I was a grad student at Berkeley, I once asked Serge Lang (who I think wrote the most advanced math textbooks of anybody who ever lived) why mathematics research papers don&#39;t have a lot more incorrect results in them.  He responded that it was because people secretly &#34;proved&#34; everything to themselves in multiple ways, but only wrote up one proof, and it was unlikely that multiple very different reasons for something being true would all be wrong.  Of course, there are serious mistakes and gaps in the literature, though what one person considers a gap, somebody else who knows more might not consider a gap.  For example, I remember once that Ernst Kani was complaining to me about a big gap in a paper by Ribet; I didn&#39;t believe it, so I read the relevant section and was able to fill in the gap in a few hours sufficiently to satisfy him.   In any case, I&#39;ve spent decades both programming and doing number theory, and despite some similarities, they are very different things.    Another related way these threads come together is with Kevin Buzzard&#39;s big project to formalize mathematics using LEAN; he&#39;s another number theorist, and he told me that a few years ago he started really worrying about the correctness of a lot of number theory papers, and that strongly motivated his interest in LEAN."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If anyone is interested in number theory and would like to help some incarcerated people that are working on a number theory paper:I&#39;m a director of the Prison Math Project: http://prisonmathproject.org/We have a few advanced mathematicians in jail who don&#39;t have access to computers. They need help with formatting their work in LaTeX and stuff like that to make it ready for publication (credit offered).They have previously co-authored some papers from within jail eg&#34;Linear Fractional Transformations And Nonlinear Leaping Convergents Of Some Continued Fractions&#34;&#34;Math And Art In Prison: A Collaborative Effort Across The Ocean&#34;please reach out if any interest in helping them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of my takeaways: When I see &#34;stitch together black boxes,&#34; to me that says that aspects of academic math are becoming similar to opportunistic software development.When such an effect happens in group psychology it is typically part of the &#34;grounding&#34; effect happening. There is a high supply of theory without the energy to go into analyzing so many individual black boxes anymore, and a correspondingly high demand arises for integrative applications which bring the high-minded ideas down to more fundamental, widely-scoped, or practical effect. Down to earth, so to speak.Some would think of this as an economic-benefit effect. The point is, it tends to bring all those stitched-together black boxes much closer to the end user space, where application is key, not so much theory.So I wonder if in the coming years we will see a dramatic closing of the gap between direct access to mathematics inputs and daily living. It may be that the typical non-math-minded individual will soon readily and happily bootstrap themselves into the language of mathematics via the closing in of a perception of direct competitive or economic value.To share an example, in 2003 I started to use a node-based editor to edit 3D textures for graphics projects. This node-based tool gave more control than standard sliders, color pickers, and checkboxes. But soon I discovered that in a lot of cases it was easier to enter a math formula in a node than to chain nodes together. Maybe a single checkbox designated whether the function was periodic, but other than that, enter math here, please. Your mathematical wish is our graphics-producing command.So I wonder if we&#39;ll soon get to the point where formulaic systems control with direct mathematic input will be more desirable and common in unified system interfaces that are found in office and household work.Let&#39;s say you want to write the perfect formula for a given air quality factor in your office...Or your competitive game which allows you to program AIs is made much more efficient if you can tweak formulae by hand...Or you need to design a new form of printed steak, but simple toggles and switches just won&#39;t do...(Then...when the time is right for the black-box theory end to pick up a lot of momentum again, imagine how large a pool of new mathematicians will be ready...)"</p>

I was tracking it on a separate issue, and had forgotten to close this one.We do, in fact, take issues like this very seriously. This bug was extraordinarily rare, and because we have no metrics/remote log collection, there was an initial period where we had to spend time adding logging and collecting user-submitted logs to try to track it down. As soon as we were able to pick up a scent, it was all we worked on, and we were able to get a fix out very quickly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some additional context for those who don&#39;t follow professional cycling: the Dutch women&#39;s team was incredibly strong coming into this road race. All 4 riders on their team are stars in their own right, and the only reason there wasn&#39;t a clear favorite for the race overall is that people weren&#39;t sure which Dutch rider would win.So you have a complicated group dynamic, where the majority of the peloton has no interest in pulling the group to catch the break, since they would just get beat by one or more of the Dutch riders, and the Dutch riders didn&#39;t seem to have a clear plan on how to control the race and who would sacrifice their chances and work on the front for the rest of the team.As others have said, there were no radios allowed for riders in the race, so all information about the breakaway came from the race director&#39;s car trailing the peloton. This was a well known fact about the race coming in, and it&#39;s the same way that the annual World Championship race is run. It&#39;s normal for riders to drop back to the team car to get information about the break, and the lead moto for a group of cyclists will occasionally show time gaps on a whiteboard.At least one of the Dutch riders claimed to have known about the lone rider off the front [1], but somehow that information didn&#39;t make it to the rest of the team. It seems that most of the peloton didn&#39;t know (or didn&#39;t care) how many riders were up the road, and the Dutch team failed to communicate amongst themselves and establish a plan.All that leads to Kiesenhofer&#39;s solo move working out. All credit to her for an extremely strong ride.[1]https://netherlandsnewslive.com/miscommunication-and-underes..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fantastic ride and if you follower her Twitter she&#39;s been doing a lot of very detailed exploration of her endurance limits in preparation.When the lead group fell to 3 they had an 11 minute lead.She broke free and went solo with 40km to go.When she finished that lead had eroded to 2 minutes as the front group she dropped had been caught.So in those 40km she lost 9 minutes of lead she had built with the help of the breakout group.This was all strategy and then a tremendous physical performance on her part.Dutch team needs a serious kick in the ass for underestimating an &#34;amatuer&#34; in this regard.  It was obvious she was in it for the gold or nothing; and they fatally assumed it would be the later.Fantastic win when you consider training, strategy, and performance all came together to pull it off.  This is what olympians are all about!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"(More related to the comments than the article) I&#39;ve seen tons of takes on this since watching the end of the race this morning and, although it certainly played a part in deciding the outcome, it&#39;s a shame that more focus has seemed to be on making excuses or how the Dutch riders messed things up instead of Dr Kiesenhofer&#39;s incredible story and ride.Kiesenhofer was on a fantastic day: van Vleuten&#39;s earlier attack from the peloton made no inroads to Kiesenhofer, assuming the time gaps shown on the TV were correct.Watching on the TV we knew there was still a rider out front and, even if the race &#34;ardoisier&#34; (blackboard holder) wasn&#39;t the best, team management should have figured out a way to get that information to the chasing pack. I mean, the race finished on a motor racing circuit with pit lanes containing team helpers! It&#39;s not like it was like stage 16 of this year&#39;s Giro, where poor weather stopped race images being broadcast[1].[1] https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/gallery-amazing-images-from-..."</p>

Is it actually possible to formally license a DIY LTE network? (Or AMPS, 2G, 3G). In the UK, for example  it is possible to get experimental licenses in principle, but I doubt it would be possible for an individual to legally operate a permanent or long term network on/near commercially allocated frequencies?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Pretty much. The best way to insert supply chain exploits is to embed them in a stack exchange answer to a beginner&#39;s question.This isn&#39;t new, we&#39;ve always had programmers who programmed by &#34;recipe&#34; rather than first principles, and DRY paints that as a feature, but it underlies a lot of pain and cost over the years.To give some context, I inherited some kernel code when I worked in the Systems Group at Sun Microsystems in the 80&#39;s that was written by a mathematician who had become a programmer because the money was in programming, not applied math. They had cut and pasted code they didn&#39;t understand in order to achieve the result they wanted out of the code they were &#34;writing.&#34; When I inherited it I read through it and found a couple of dozen ways the code would panic the kernel[1]. Once fixing those obvious issues, it became clear that the original owner of the code didn&#39;t really understand what computation did. They had an idea, and mathematically they could show that it was correct, but literally no ability to express that algorithmically.This is not a &#34;new&#34; problem but it is an important one that managers of software engineers need to watch for.[1] At the time the only difference between &#34;kernel&#34; programmers and &#34;application&#34; programmers was that kernel programmers recognized that unsafe code crashed the whole system, not just the application. So they tended to be cultivated from paranoid programmers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I freelance fixing and maintaining legacy web apps, almost always PHP.Anecdotally I see SQL injection vulnerabilities  in about half the code I look at. It’s one type of problem among many other problems and vulnerabilities in code written by amateurs and often copy/pasted.PHP programmers can find lots of resources online. Some of those are terrible, either very old or written by amateurs excited to show how they got something to work.I have seen the same kind of thing with Java and Python, but the popularity of PHP means there’s a lot of junk info and examples online.PHP has supported safe SQL and safe HTML for decades, but the programmer has to understand the problem and the solution."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some time ago I found this video series on YouTube about how to build a PHP application from scratch. Ten hours worth of XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, badly coded authentication, you name it. When confronted, the instructor said that he did not want to confuse the beginners with all of that security stuff. I just thought &#34;ok&#34; and moved on.Now I went back to this guy&#39;s YouTube channel and saw that half a year later he finally did upload a bonus episode on how to mitigate SQL injections. One person in the comment section actually thanked him for the much needed video because their site was getting hacked. It is pretty hilarious to see this unfold but I do feel bad for the ~10k people who watched his videos."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author of the Damn Interesting post here. Internally we worried that there would be some fallout from abandoning our Facebook page--by the numbers we had more followers there than any other social media platform, by far. But the response from our audience has been almost 100% positive, even from our Facebook followers[1]. It put only a tiny dent in our site&#39;s daily traffic. It resulted in many new subscribers to our email list. There was a flurry of new donations, with attached supportive comments about the amputation. Facebook was exactly the gangrenous thing it appeared to be, and we are better off without it. If you will permit me the indulgence of quoting my own post:&gt; Some call it a “necessary evil,” but if that’s the case let’s do all we can to make it unnecessary.For any organizations considering the same move, I cannot recommend it enough. It feels like cutting off contact with a toxic acquaintance--equal parts relief and optimism.[1] https://www.facebook.com/DamnInt/posts/10158097374656961"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just wish more people and especially companies would join this movement to leave.I hate that the city I live in has almost zero online presence.  If I want to sell something, everyone says &#39;use FB market.&#39;
As someone who refuses to, I have a ton of stuff waiting for the yearly yard sale.The neighborhood I live in also only posts updates to FB.  So cue the monthly surprise(garbage not picked up, road repaving, etc) and never knowing about it in advance.And don&#39;t get me started on companies with zero website and only some FB page.I know it&#39;s &#39;free&#39;, and at this point it feels petty, but I&#39;m literally holding out until the end."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So Facebook is no longer showing all posts to people who intentionally subscribe to a page? If so, what, if anything, does “subscription” or “following” mean, then?I realize I’m showing my age here, but I remember when missing an issue of a paper “subscription” was cause for anger and resulted in an apology from the publisher (and usually a redelivered copy). But I also remember when “follow” meant “show me all new posts from this user” on Facebook, too, back before they fucked up the News Feed in the 2010s and turned it into their manure delivery system."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just as a point of comparison, one of the programs San Francisco introduced during the pandemic was &#34;safe sleeping sites&#34;, which are parking lots where homeless can have their tent without it being periodically swept by police. To that, they add chemical toilets, a water supply and (I&#39;m not sure why) 24/7 security staff. For this, the city pays around $60k per tent site per year. I&#39;m not sure if this is in part due to some unsavory relationship between the org administering the program and some city official.
Recently the program was extended. It would be cheaper to rent apartments at current market rates, even in San Francisco.Our revealed preference seems to be that we&#39;d rather have homeless people live in tents than have poor people get free or nearly free housing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The fundamental problem with Agile is the fundamental problem with all product development:The customer doesn&#39;t know what they wantAgile assumes as a first principal that including the customer throughout the development process will align the building team and the customer to come to the same conclusion.This is almost never actually true. Having built and managed a lot of products I can state fairly confidently that the amount of time the customer has, and clarity about the problem they want solved is orders of magnitude more ambiguous than is required to actually build and deliver something to their satisfaction.In my opinion successful products, and I mean ones with significant flywheels with customers and viral growth and stickiness are with few exceptions - accidents. It was someone who had an interesting thought and a lot of people for whom the product was good enough for their desire that they often didn&#39;t even know they hadYou can&#39;t write down how to do that, it&#39;s like asking a nobel prize winner how they came up with their discovery. It&#39;s not repeatable. Some people have better intuitions than others and these are the people who are repeatably successful with products. But it doesn&#39;t generalize.That said, the fundamental problem isn&#39;t wrong in theory, it&#39;s just naiive in practice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Agile is a generic umbrella term that involves a vast array of complex, subtle knowledge and skills. It&#39;s like saying &#34;Engineer&#34;, or &#34;Chef&#34;. Each has a shared skillset, to be sure. But each category&#39;s members can&#39;t just work the same way at all jobs, and there&#39;s no book on how to be an Engineer or Chef everywhere.The Agile Manifesto is a failure at trying to make Agile happen because it can&#39;t tell you how to make it happen, because it varies wildly. No manager can read a book on how to &#34;Agile-ify&#34; their org, they have to apply their brains and figure out how their specific version of &#34;Agile&#34; will work. But the skill-set required to do this is not a Managerial skill, it is a lower-level-worker skill. But it&#39;s also a very advanced lower-level-worker skill.And that&#39;s why things like &#34;Agile&#34;, &#34;DevOps&#34;, etc will fail. People at the higher end have no clue how to make it happen, and people at the lower end who have an idea how to make it happen don&#39;t have the power to make the organizational changes to do so. You need a way for the lower-end people to tell the higher-end people what to do, and have the higher-end people listen to them, and make the changes happen. This is very hard in a traditional organizational hierarchy, because higher-end people have big egos and bigger concerns over things like politics."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not an expert on this subject, but I feel like &#34;agile&#34; could be summarized as &#34;a process for actively incorporating feedback early and often&#34;.That doesn&#39;t mean you need points or tshirt sizes or constant status meetings. You just need channels of communication with the right people and a chance to adapt to what they say."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Since the storage media in these IoT devices would not last long if true deletions were being performed constantly, “deleted” data is often simply invalidated and moved to an unused page in the block (in a process called “wear leveling”). These invalidated pages, which still contain the data, remain present until a block fills up with them and a true deletion is initiated.&gt;Accessing flash memory that has been factory reset in this way does require some amount of technical skill and specialized equipment, but nothing that is a real barrier to the average enthusiast working at home.By that logic my iPhone 11, my Android phone, my Mac or my Windows PC doesn&#39;t wipe personal content either after factory resetFeels like a bit clickbait-ishBut at least Macs have a built-in 7-pass erase option to comply with DOD standards https://techpatio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/disk-utilit..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This explanation infuriates me so much. 
They use technical terms and true technologies to lie about their security issues and measures. Flash memory should easily withstand north of 10k write/erase cycles, base on type.
Even if there was somehow some very low limit, users’ request to delete personal &amp; sensitive data should be honored and any cost.
But then again, we’re talking about people paying actual money to have these devices in their homes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fun fact: you can overload the Python import system to work with other languages that you create.I use this for my Python-based Lisp: https://github.com/shawwn/pymen/blob/ml/importer.py  import foo

checks for &#34;foo.l&#34;, and if found, compiles it to foo.py on the fly and imports that instead.It&#39;s so cursed. I love it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are two things that are annoying about Python&#39;s import system.Number one is that relative imports are weird. My intuition about imports is good enough that I never bothered to learn all the rules explicitly, but sometimes something simple is just not possible and it bites me. I think the case is importing files relative to a script (and not running with python -m ...).Number two is, in order to do package management, you have to create a fake python installation and bend PYTHONPATH. Virtualenvs are the canonical way to do it, but to me it feels like a hack - the core language seems to wants all packages installed in /usr. So now I have all these virtualenvs lying around and they are detached from the scripts.Why couldn&#39;t the import system resolve versions, too? You could say `import foo &gt;= 1.0` and it would download it to some global cache, and the import the correct versions from the cache."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Python import system is by far the worst one I dealt with. Using Setup.py and regular or namespace packages, relative import, having complex sub packages and cross importing, running a script from somewhere inside one of your sub packages, and many more craps like these. Import system must be intuitive and easy to use!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In particles physics, they have a different explanation of electromagnetism that is also very natural, almost inevitable. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics#Mathem... The explanation in particle physics is compatible with Quantum Mechanics and Special Relativity, but no one is sure about how to extend it to General Relativity. I&#39;m not sure how compatible is it with the proposal in the article discussed here.Non technical version (ELI25):In quantum mechanics the wavefunction Ψ is has complex values. If you multiply everything in the universe by -1, nothing changes because all the physical results use ΨΨ* (where * is the complex conjugation). You can also multiply everything by i or -i. Moreover by any other complex number of modulo 1 because ΨΨ* does not change. (The technical term for this is U(1) global gauge symmetry.)But you can be more ambitious and want to multiply each point of the universe by a different complex number of modulo 1. ΨΨ* does not change but the derivatives of Ψ change and they are also important. (When you use the same complex number everywhere, the derivatives is just a multiple of the original derivative. When you use a different number in each point, it changes.)The only way to fix the problem with the derivative is to add a new field A. When you and multiply each point of the universe by a different complex number of modulo 1, then A changes in a simple to calculate but not obvious way. The change in A fix the problem with the derivatives of Ψ.So now the equations of the universe with Ψ and A don&#39;t change when you make this change. (The technical term for this is U(1) local gauge symmetry.) When you write carefully how a universe like this look like, the new field A is electromagnetism. (Actually, you can get the electric field and magnetic field using the derivatives of A.)This explanation looks more complicated than the explanation of the article, but the article is full of technical terms that you really don&#39;t want to know, like:&gt; Riemann curvature tensor is more than just Ricci curvature—electromagnetic fields stretch and bend the spacetime"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not an expert in GR, but the linked paper seems nonsensical[0]. It postulates a highly degenerate decomposition of the metric tensor, for which they postulate a contrived action which then seems to correspond to the Einstein-Hilbert, through mathematically unsound manipulations (how can you raise indices with the metric being nowhere even close to invertible?).Besides, how can you talk about unifying general relativity and electromagnetism without mentioning Kaluza-Klein theory[1]? And what about one of the most beautiful principles in physics, gauge invariance[2]?I don&#39;t want to be rude, but I&#39;m very curious as to how this got through peer review.0: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1956/1/...

This paragraph for instance is a bunch of true-ish sentences but overall is gibberish:&gt;  The metric tensor of spacetime tells us how lengths determine in spacetime. The metric tensor also thus determines the curvature properties of spacetime. Curvature is what we feel as &#34;force.&#34; In addition, energy and curvature relate to each other through the Einstein field equations. Test particles follow what are called geodesics—the shortest paths in the spacetime."</p>

Asking because my military unit used individual cables to exaggerate numbers.  i.e. 6 strands at 1 mile would become &#34;6 miles of cable run&#34;.  Either way, great they are doing this.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"We&#39;re taking a different approach in Australia (the state of Victoria specifically), and not only are we replacing bare wire overheads with buried cables [0], we are also implementing Rapid Earth Fault Current Limiter (REFCL) technology to lower the risk of bushfires due to downed wires. [1]When powerlines come into contact with the ground or a tree, arcing can occur. If the line remains live and continues arcing, the risk of fire is quite high.REFCL tech works by detecting the phase-to-earth faults that occur when a one of the three-phase powerlines breaks and falls to the ground. REFL instantly reduces the voltage on the fallen line, and boosts the voltage on the other two phases. REFCL will then test the faulted line after a few seconds, and if the fault was intermittent full service is restored. If not, the whole line is removed from service to prevent fires and make the line safe to work on.On Total Fire Ban days (very high risk of fire due to weather conditions), the REFCL settings operate at increased sensitivity.There&#39;s a requirement in Victoria that by 2023 all high risk zone substations have to install REFCL technology, and all HV customers connected to those zone subs have to be REFCL compliant (their equipment must be able to handle the over-voltages that occur during REFCL operation).[0] https://www.energy.vic.gov.au/electricity/powerline-replacem...[1] https://www.energy.vic.gov.au/safety-and-emergencies/powerli..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a question I haven’t seen anyone address so far: how much can we expect this to reduce the frequency of wildfires? Intuitively, to me, the effect would seem to be negligible. All of the conditions for wildfires will remain in place. It’ll simply be something else that lights the spark. If it’s not power lines it’ll be lightning.So then to follow up: what is the point? To deflect blame from PGE? And who pays for it?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I agree with the author that the real estate agent described something most people want, and not necessarily what the author himself wanted. I think it&#39;s unfortunate that the agent didn&#39;t hear what the author wanted and just pointed him to the general public&#39;s preference anyway.However, I disagree with his take that America&#39;s housing development model is to develop into outskirt suburbs, let middle class move in, let it deteriorate in 30 years, and build more outskirts.Now, maybe I live in California and things are different. In the bay area even old areas with very old houses rise in values, and in fact, they rise more than newer developments. Demand for housing everywhere in the bay area + surrounding areas are high regardless of how new they are and how deep in town or out in the outskirts they are. Areas developed 30+ years ago continue to have high demand from middle to wealthy families. These areas didn&#39;t just not deteriorate but have grown into larger and more modern areas and in some cases developed their own downtown.Admittedly California and bay area specifically is probably a bubble and behaves differently than much of America. But I have a feeling more than a few popular cities are going through something similar. Appleton might not be, and maybe he&#39;s right that the new development outskirts will deteriorate in 30 years, but I doubt that&#39;ll be the case in new developments around Phoenix or Denver."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"| All of America’s institutions are focused exclusively on churn.Planning prior to 1990s was predicated on the assumption of continued  upward mobility, middle class persistence and strength of US production of goods and services (a/k/a wealth).Instead, the US exported all of that to China, and praised its new service-led, consumer-based, greener economy. Of all the self-inflicted (likely fatal) wounds inflicted upon great societies throughout history, the civic ignorance (and arrogance) of our body politic is the greatest."</p>

Is it the ship that&#39;s ephemeral, or the iceberg? (It seems like a reference to the Titanic, and at least in my mind, both the Titanic and the iceberg were ephemeral.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;&gt; In 1995, 2% of schizophrenia diagnoses in the country were associated with cannabis use disorder. In 2000, it increased to around 4%. Since 2010, that figure increased to 8%, the study found.Worded that way, causation isn&#39;t the first thing this suggests to me. If percentage of cases associated with marijuana rise, it could also be that a larger percentage of the population is smoking and admitting to smoking marijuana regularly. If cases themselves rise, it could also be increases in the percentage of cases that actually get diagnosed, etc.It could very well be that marijuana puts you at higher risk of schizophrenia - I certainly have an acquaintance in mind for whom recreational drug usage seems to have led them to a paranoid and narcissistic personality described here in other comments - but the connection in this article feels weak. Certainly weaker than the connection we see between marijuana law enforcement and the negative fallout of that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can only speak from personal experience, which is of course limited.  I smoked occasionally in my 20s, but not since (I&#39;m middle-aged now).  I&#39;ve been friends and acquaintances with many people that smoke a lot.  I see a trend among these people - not necessarily schizophrenia (I&#39;m not a psychologist and probably wouldn&#39;t even notice a mild case) - but instead a consistent arrogance and self-importance.  It&#39;s peculiar - they may be contributing very little to society (or maybe a lot), but regardless there&#39;s a sense of superiority that seems to crop up among them all.  Maybe even narcissism?I could be completely wrong.  I don&#39;t express this to assert it, but rather to ask if anyone else has noticed anything similar."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As usual, a sensational headline averring a research article&#39;s causal hypothesis, of which the PI even calls for reproducibility. Reading such paltry science articles makes me really appreciate papers like Quanta, whose reporters seem to actually have a semblance of domain knowledge.Indeed, no discussion of the existing link between schizophrenia and tobacco smoking, in conjunction with the increased availability of marijuana?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"On the Hotel California EffectIf it&#39;s expensive to move data out of AWS, it&#39;s not just about making it hard for customers to leave AWS. It means that any third-party service that wants to sell to AWS customers must also use AWS.For example, Snowflake can&#39;t really run its own data centers. They need to rent from AWS. If you&#39;re a company on AWS, you won&#39;t want to spend $0.08/GB sending things to Snowflake.The high egress cost gives Amazon a lot of power to keep the third-party ecosystem within AWS and without as much negotiating power on things like EC2 costs. Snowflake can&#39;t say to Amazon, &#34;if you don&#39;t give us a great discount, we&#39;re going to move our operations to DigitalOcean&#34; because Amazon would just say, &#34;no you&#39;re not. Your customers aren&#39;t going to pay $80/TB to load things into Snowflake when you&#39;re charging them $23-40/TB for storage. They&#39;d be paying 2-3.5x your storage costs just to load the data into your system!&#34; Yes, I&#39;m sure that Snowflake does get a discount from AWS, but having less negotiating power can make discounts smaller.There are other reasons to want a third party to use AWS if you&#39;re on AWS. Still, the egress pricing seems to make it very hard for third-party tech providers not to use AWS if their customers are using it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Working in realtime games that require high bandwidth usage, AWS and basically every other public cloud is fundamentally unusable for us because of this exact problem. Our bare metal infrastructure for the Hypixel Minecraft network uses 3-4PB per month, so we simply lease a 100gbps transit link billed at 95th percentile.Last I checked, AWS wanted ~$200k per MONTH, for just bandwidth (no compute, memory, storage, or anything else). We&#39;d love to be able to use the cloud, but not at the cost of increasing our monthly expenses by an entire order of magnitude, so we just stick to bare metal colocation.I honestly believe that if you have the technical skill in-house, and are spending more than, say, $30k/mo on public cloud hosting, that you should seriously evaluate whether bare metal could significantly decrease your costs."</p>

I wonder if it is because Cloudflare has data transfer agreements with GCP, Azure, and Alibaba! But that would mean this is a shoddy hit piece to strong arm AWS into an agreement with them. Nonsense, I&#39;m sure Cloudflare would never do that...Edit: I&#39;ve removed claims about Cloudfront&#39;s pricing since it isn&#39;t actually clear what they charge for egress and seems to vary on a number of factors.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Syncthing is one of the &#34;fire and forget&#34; kind of programs. It takes some time to setup when doing for first time, but then you pretty much forget its there, and when you need it, you realise it has been chugging along doing its job.Two things I like about it in particular, are1. It can and favors syncing over local network. This has a huge cost savings in developing world. Even when you do have massive bandwidth, local network sync still has more throughput and lower latency. My music is shared between devices and if I add a track, it takes less than a second to appear on my other devices.2. You can set conditions, such that delets can be ignored. Eg. I have a WhatsApp message+media backup going back almost 7 years now, ~65GiB. But I don&#39;t need all that on my phone. So I just disable syncing delets on my storage. Now my phone can get away with ~3 GiB of whatsapp data (only because I don&#39;t delete very often) and I still have complete backup in case I need it.3. Absolute rock solid stable. At $DAYJOB we use syncthing to sync multi dozen GiBs of new data every day, total file count in 10s of thousands in about ~300 directories. And in past 5 years we have had about 3 instances where we had something that needed attention, out of which 2 were not syncthing&#39;s fault.I&#39;ve been using Syncthing for years and have absolutely zero complaints against it. Everyone with 2 or more devices should give it a try, just to see there are better options out there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using Syncthing for years now, between ~10 Linux servers, Linux desktops, Linux and Windows laptops and Android smartphones, over LAN, wired and wireless Internet.I&#39;m synchronizing less than 100 MiB of data, but it&#39;s changing all the time. I&#39;ve not yet had a single issue with it. I&#39;ve a few conflicts every week when the same file is changed in different locations at the same time, but Syncthing keeps all versions of a file until I resolve the conflicts; I can&#39;t see how it could handle that better.Long story short: I highly recommend this tool."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On of my favorite program, and it keeps getting better.You can even set an encryption key per share, and if you want to use an untrusted device in your nodes, you can simply not provide it with the encryption key and it will simply synchronize the encrypted payload across nodes.So if you have a shady/cheapo VPS, you can use its storage without worrying about the plaintext data being stored there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fantastic blog post. I highly recommend reading it in full, and also checking out the work of the European Spreadsheet Risks Group, and Felienne Hermans specifically (referenced in the original post). I&#39;ve been working on a spreadsheet startup [1] for the past 8 months or so and those folks have a large amount of absolutely upsetting-but-helpful research on spreadsheet usage/errors.After the past few years working with spreadsheet power users, here&#39;s how I like to think about them:
1. Most spreadsheets are just used a lists/trackers [2].
2. Some spreadsheets are very calculation heavy, and are better understood as complex software projects (usually modeling something; s/o to those PE mfs) than as anything else.
3. Spreadsheets make the transition between (simple list/tracker) and (complex software project very fluid. This flexibility usually means that the (complex software project) that is created is buggy as hell.Spreadsheets give not-super-technical users an incredible visibility into their data. Spreadsheets give not-super-technical users a way to program data transformations in what I would argue is the most generally intuitive way that exists. Spreadsheets give not-super-technical users tools to build software without introducing them to proper software development methods. Ya know, like maybe a test. Or a code review. Or no global variables. Etc.If you want to see how we&#39;re attacking the spreadsheet problem, check us out. Feedback highly appreciated! [1][1] https://trymito.io/hn

There is something about all those little cells that presents an itch everyone wants to scratch, and you just know that for some that scratching is going to produce something akin to a spreadsheet version of gangrenous melanoma.On the other hand, some people are happy to say that the complexity of sophisticated Excel models means they would have been better off built in a code interface. Ha ha ha!Even with the right mix of functional and object-oriented code and suitable documentation and version control applied to code, I respectfully disagree.Data handling capabilities could benefit from skill in all of these tools: error checking (including analytical review); pen &amp; paper; calculators; databases; spreadsheets; math &amp; stat techniques; Word processors (&amp; clear logical explanations).Together, they form a rich menagerie of tools which will probably all be around until we have an AI that follows us around and we just tell it what we want. Actually, even then, it would be good to know them so that we can grasp the underlying logic and frame the concepts leading to the actions that we ask the AI to assist with..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my experience, for a pure engineering role, nobody seems to care. I had credits at large companies, posted talks online (interviewers rarely looked at them), but if I forgot how to write binary search in 10 minutes in an interview it didn’t matter.This actually made me realize being just an IC wasn’t actually my goal though. Once I started interviewing for management and sales, all of those things _really_ mattered. Now that I’m running workshops and talks professionally, posting publicly is _critical_.Moral of the story: if you enjoy posting in public and teaching in public, but you feel like its getting you nowhere career wise, maybe you are in the wrong career like I was. Once I decided to double down on my strengths and spent nights and weekends at public speaking training instead of grinding leetcode things started to click."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are two modes of hiring:1. General purpose: Typical FANG like where hire first and then do team matching later2. Targeted hiring: Companies want specific people and they try to recruit themA sizable number of top open-source contributors get recruited are in #2. Eg. 1) Top contributors in Rust lang hired by AWS. 2) FANG companies targeting top AI researchers from academia.One&#39;s open-source presence needs to be really prolific and the project has to make an large impact to be in #2 category.For #1 category folks, your public profile does not matter that much (atleast for FANG companies)Other way to think is #1 are treated as cattle, #2 are treated as pets.The famous incident where author of homebrew was rejected by a top company because he could not invert a binary tree got in the wrong channel (#1) to begin with where he was treated as a cattle.Note: Recruiter from FANG calling you still goes in #1 category for most people"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a few jobs interview recently. Here&#39;s what I got out of it:If you have something you want to promote (or is on your CV in general), be ready to talk about it. I&#39;m very lucky because I can talk about things on the spot very easily. If that&#39;s not you, make a list of the few main points that you want to talk about and try to memorize it. If you always get the same questions, it may be a good idea to address them before people even ask them, or to memorize an answer to them too.I really underestimate the amount of stress that can be felt when you&#39;re alone facing 6 people for a job that you want. I don&#39;t have a good answer on how to handle it, although I think having my canned answer ready helped. It got better once this started to be a conversation. The good part is that I developed a lot of empathy for people that talk about interview stress.It&#39;s going to be my first &#34;real&#34; job so these are probably obvious, but it might help someone so I&#39;d rather share."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Deploying k8s has gotten a lot easier these days -- some alternatives in this space:- https://docs.k0sproject.io (https://github.com/k0sproject/k0s)- https://k3s.io (https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/)k0s is my personal favorite and what I run, the decisions they have made align very well with how I want to run my clusters versus k3s which is similar but slightly different. Of course you also can&#39;t go wrong with kubeadm[0][1] -- it was good enough to use minimally (as in you could imagine sprinkling a tiny bit of ansible and maintaining a cluster easily) years ago, and has only gotten better.[0]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/[1]: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubeadm"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"(Full disclaimer - I&#39;m an engineer at Talos, but I believe it&#39;s pretty relevant here)If folks are interested in this kind of K8s deployment, they might also be interested at what we&#39;re doing at Talos (https://talos.dev). We have full support for all of these same environments (we have a great community of k8s-at-home folks running with Raspberry Pis) and a bunch of tooling to make bare metal easier with Cluster API. You can also do the minikube type of thing by running Talos directly in Docker or QEMU with `talosctl`.Talos works with an API instead of SSH/Bash, so there&#39;s some interesting things about ease of use when operating K8s that are baked in like built-in etcd backup/restore, k8s upgrades, etc.We&#39;re also right in the middle of building out our next release that will have native Wireguard functionality and enable truly hybrid K8s clusters. This should be a big deal for edge deployments and we&#39;re super excited about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried a few incarnations of self-hosted k8s a few years ago, and the biggest problem I had was persistent storage. If you are using a cloud service they will integrate k8s into whatever persistent storage they offer, but if you are self-hosting you are left on your own, it seems most people end up using something like nfs or hostPath - but that ends up being a single point of failure. Have there been any developments on this recently, aimed at people wanted to run k8s on a few RaspberryPi nodes?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As an employee of Hashicorp, I&#39;m very excited for this change. Not that Mitchell was anything less than a great leader—on the contrary, I thought he was excellent. It&#39;s just that he&#39;s also got such a great ability to identify the right abstractions when tackling a problem. The fact that he&#39;ll be &#34;in the trenches&#34;, so to speak, gives me even more confidence that Hashicorp will continue to make tools that strike a nice balance between power and simplicity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well done. A very graceful and transparent announcement.I decided to leave senior leadership and return to IC engineering work last year. I was met with shock and, frankly, negative feedback from my peers. It has been a difficult transition, and it&#39;s easy to miss the benefits of leadership, but I knew engineering was the right place for me.It was difficult to do this as a veritable nobody, I can&#39;t even imagine the difficulty of the decision for Mitchell. I wish him luck and continued success."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Such a great guy. At Hashiconf a few years ago he was just one of the normal people, a load of us all went to the speakers’ dinner and he just found a seat and sat down - opposite me, as it happened, and we had a laugh. Armon is a top chap too, we would talk motorbikes if I ever bump into him. Their tech skills are top-notch and I wish them the best of luck. So many tech companies would be better off this way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m “unlocking” that this will be dead within 18 months. It will get too hard and bored engineers will head back to Google Corp where the promotion game is better.I’m in manufacturing. Machinery is highly specialised. Making a generic robot without taking up huge amount of floor space and/or huge leaps in programming is like… Kubernetes being good for hosting your moms book club blog."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Makes sense. The end state appears to be that humans should only be supervising ML that generates goal and outcome based behaviors for robots, and the machines will construct tools to solve problems themselves.The leap from an AI model learning how to replicate a behaviour (e.g. evolving walking to solve problems https://unitylist.com/p/2id/walking-ai ) to reasoning about it in terms of actuators and physical feedback, to assembling a physical model out of a relatively small list of parts seems like a solvable engineering problem when it is broken out into a pipeline.Those robot parts are basically a version of mechano with actuators that a model would map a behavior to, and the robots in the article would assemble them. When you look at something like Lego or Mechano as an intermediate representation to construct buildings out of, where all objects made from it are essentially a directed graph of those elements, robots designing and building robots seems like less than 20 years away.e.g. we could functionally specify to an ML model, &#34;produce a digraph of these element parts that has these degrees of freedom, and then load or derive a model that solves for this outcome within the domain of those degrees, where outcome is &#39;plug cables into a board&#39; &#34;"</p>
