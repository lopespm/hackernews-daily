All because if they receive a trademark complaint they won&#39;t contact the domain owner first and give them reasonable time to &#34;fix&#34; the &#34;issue&#34; (even 2 hours would have been enough). No, they just turn off the production server and simultaneously send an e-mail &#34;you better respond to their complaint if you want your domain back up&#34;.Totally unprofessional and a complete joke. Will never use them on a production system again. Always angry if they are mentioned here like they are a legitimate choice..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It sounds to me like you failed to renew your domain on time, and missed the grace period. Redemption grace period is not a fine, it’s a normal period of the lifecycle of a domain name during which they (the registry, via the registrar) give you a last chance to get your domain back. This is well documented and part of the conditions you accept and need to understand when you rent a domain.You said you had another payment mean, but they’re likely not allowed to use it without your approval. If you missed the email requests for approval, they couldn’t renew and you legitimately lost your domain.The annual contact accuracy check (WDRP) usually doesn’t result in deletion but suspension, so something sounds fishy here. Maybe it came at the same time as the renewal (which makes sense) but I’m pretty sure it’s not the direct reason for deletion of your domain.However the above is true only for gTLDs, not for ccTLDs. What’s the TLD of your domain?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Godaddy is the worst. Apparently if you ever decide to move your domain out of GoDaddy(which has alot of dark patterns to discourage you), they will remove whois privacy protection(which they charge you for) until transfer is completed. It gives bots/scrapers enough time to get that information(ICANN requires you to provide accurate personal information with email, phone number, name, and address) and your private info is ripe for abuse.It&#39;s like a punishment for moving away from them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This info gives us an interesting opportunity to estimate the rate at which Signal is adding new users. They&#39;ve been very tight-lipped (understandably) about their usage stats but anecdotally they seem to be an increasingly common presence on my friends&#39; phones, even the non-techies.As far as I can tell, Signal uses Twilio only to send SMS for phone number verification. Verification happens when a user registers a new number or changes the number on their existing account.The rate at which Signal is adding new users could be calculated by:1900 * (proportion of new registrants among SMS recipients) / (length of Twilio incident)You could probably make some common-sense assumptions about the first variable. But I can&#39;t find any publicly available info on when Twilio was first compromised. Their press release only mentions that they discovered the intrusion on August 4, which is presumably close to the end date of the incident. Does anyone know what the estimated start of the incident might be?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The attack Twilio suffered is almost identical to the recent attack against Cloudflare: https://blog.cloudflare.com/2022-07-sms-phishing-attacks/ (even down the wording of the text messages, which are nearly identical). Cloudflare’s use of security keys prevented the attackers getting access to any accounts in that case.These attacks are sophisticated and are capable of bypassing TOTP or mobile-app-based MFA. If this is widespread, I’d be surprised if we didn’t see a massive influx of breaches soon. The vast majority of companies are not well defended against this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Among the 1,900 phone numbers, the attacker explicitly searched for three numbers, and we’ve received a report from one of those three users that their account was re-registered.I wonder if this was a curious attacker trying to see what they could do with their access, or a targeted attack."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a a beautiful thread. All the concerns that come into play with a commercial business, a very human representative of that business, and someone outside expressing a need. A need that some would see is contradictory to the pure business goals.Doing business out in the open like Tailscale is doing is so refreshing. Having seen Brad Fitz communicate in other places, it is obvious he isn&#39;t doing the right thing for the user only because these conversations will be scrutinized in public. Tailscale has a lot of great technical people who actually are even better communicators.This is the lesson for me in this thread: remember to optimize hiring good communicators and not just good technical people. This conversation would have quickly gone south if it was purely about the technical or business reasons for doing it. After all, the root word of communication is commune: to connect. We often forget that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article, and some of the comments here, seem to confuse &#34;second-order&#34; with &#34;long-term&#34;.Long-term just means doing the same analysis far out into the future: &#34;If I spend less on maintaining software product $LEGACY, I will save money. If I continue to do this, I will save more and more money by each passing month.&#34;Second-order means discovering neighbouring causal links. &#34;If I spend less on maintaining software product $LEGACY, I will save money. I will however also have to prioritise which bugs I fix. This will lead to some bugs that would be fixed today not getting fixed. That might mean that some users of $LEGACY move to a competitor. In turn, it costs more to acquire new customers than to retain old ones, so just maintaining the same customer count while dissatisfying customers until they quit will cost more money than by trying to make existing customers happy.&#34;Quitting $LEGACY customers will however lead to fewer bugs being discovered in $LEGACY, meaning the reduced maintenance budget might be sufficient again. However, quitting customers doesn&#39;t only force me to spend more to re-acquire similar number of customers – it might also be negative for marketing, so it becomes harder to acquire new customers, thus having a non-linear effect on the customer replacement costs.&#34;Decreased maintenance of $LEGACY might make some developers happier, but signal to others that we are not serious about the lifecycle of our product. This might result in them not putting in as much effort to make maintenance easier in future products, which will increase the maintenance demand in future products. Thus, insufficient maintenance efforts on $LEGACY may lead to increasing maintenance demand, which leads to insufficient maintenance efforts, which leads to increasing maintenance demand, and so on.&#34;As the last parts of that hint at, what&#39;s really important is not all the neighbouring causal links, but those that lead to nonlinearities and feedback cycles. By mucking about with things in a stable system, in particular when there are nonlinearities and feedback cycles involved, you can accidentally create an unstable system that wants to drive itself into the ground."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One by economist Thomas Sowell[0] explores this in good detail, applying it to political and economic policies, in his book.Housing policies, medicare and today&#39;s problem of defund the police can be better analysed if the framework of second-order thinking is used to view the pros and cons of such policies and their subsequent ramifications.Second-order thinking is a great mental model to have and helps us address some of the cognitive biases that get in our way when making choices.To me this form of thinking is evident in chess, the evaluation necessary to make a single move gets us to look at the consequences after the third and fourth move before a final decision is made.I believe when the time allows for it we should really consider the future ramifications of our actions before making a move.[0] https://www.amazon.com/Applied-Economics-Thinking-Beyond-Sta..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use the predictive horizon model. It&#39;s not that there&#39;s a clear division between first order and second order thinking, it&#39;s that some people&#39;s ability to model consequences covers a narrow area, a few people can model successfully much further out, and a tiny minority can make astounding predictive leaps that reach far into the future.It&#39;s a continuous variable, not a Boolean.But it means most of the population literally cannot see consequences that seem obvious to someone with a wider reach.Asking &#34;and then what&#34; won&#39;t change this, because if your modelling ability is poor you&#39;ll just get a longer list of wrong predictions.It&#39;s a mix of native ability (IQ helps, but it&#39;s not a sole determinant), domain specific experience, and experience with synthetic thinking - the ability to filter and combine multiple trends, as opposed to purely analytical thinking which usually looks at one or two."</p>

Apparently they did something similar for a friend&#39;s iPhone 6 a couple of years ago.  Didn&#39;t charge a cent to service a 5 year-old smartphone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not sure if Bun has had an influence on this, these features must have been in development for a long time, but the timing surely is impeccable.npm compatibility is huge for Deno. It is basically the one major drawback to Deno, which gets hopefully fixed with this feature. It also looks like this compatibility layer is implemented transparently in the existing module management, which is a big bonus. Nobody wants to deal with node_modules anymore when working with Deno for an extended period, just love to see this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m actually a little disappointed by NPM compatibility. Or at least conflicted. Deno has felt like an opportunity to reboot the server-side JS ecosystem into something far more sensible than it currently is. Not that anyone is to blame for what it is, really, but you learn lessons and move forward. Sometimes making breaking changes.This seems like an acceptance that moving on simply won&#39;t happen. The existing ecosystem is too big and too powerful to be ignored. If I were a particularly cynical person I&#39;d also point to Deno taking on millions in VC funding - once you&#39;ve done that you can&#39;t be content to create a perfect, gleaming sandbox. You have to bring in money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a non-user of Deno, I’m curious, how do people tend to manage dependency version centralisation in Deno? I suppose this will apply to existing Deno as well as npm imports. I can just see you ending up having to change “import express from &#34;npm:express@5&#34;;” from 5 to 6 in lots of places when the next major version comes out.When contemplating how I might do it, I came up with centralised reexport, a file deps.ts containing:  export express from &#34;npm:express@5&#34;;

This would basically stand in for the dependencies object in package.json.So then I looked up the docs and found https://deno.land/manual/linking_to_external_code#it-seems-u... and was amused to find the same solution, even down to the file name “deps.ts”!Is this how people tend to work with Deno?I see it also supports import maps, https://deno.land/manual/linking_to_external_code/import_map..., which could readily solve the problem too. Do people use that?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Many moons ago, one of the things I did was to port the Windows version of Google Earth to both Mac and Linux. I did the mac first, which was onerous, because of all the work involved in abstracting away system specific API&#39;s, but once that was done, I thought Linux would be a lesser task, and we hired a great linux guy to help with that.Turns out, while getting it running on linux was totally doable, getting it distributed was a completely different story. Due to IP reasons, this can&#39;t ship as code, so we need to ship binaries. How do you do that? Do you maintain a few separate versions for a few popular distributions? Do you target the Linux Standard Base? The first approach is a lot of work, and suffers from breakages from time to time, and you alienate users not on your list of supported distros. The second version, using LSB, was worse, as they specify ancient libraries and things like OpenGL aren&#39;t handled properly.End result; management canned the Linux version because too much ongoing support work was required, and no matter what you did, you got hate mail from Gentoo users."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Agree. Had a few games on Steam crap out with the native version, forced it to use proton with the Windows version, everything  worked flawlessly. Developers natively porting to linux seem to be wasting their time.Funnily enough with wine we kinda recreated the model of modern windows, where Win32 is a personality on top of the NTAPI which then interfaces with the kernel. Wine sits between the application and the zoo of libraries including libc that change all the time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Coincidentally, Win32 is also the only stable API on Windows.WinForms and WPF are still half-broken on .NET 5+, WinRT is out, basically any other desktop development framework since the Win32 era that is older than a couple of years is deprecated. Microsoft is famous for introducing new frameworks and deprecating them a few years later. Win32 is the only exception I can think of."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel there is some slight mis-information in this article that might confuse people and give them the wrong impression of &#39;Local SSDs&#39; vs the network based ones and about the nvme protocol and made it seem like &#34;local ssd == nvme&#34;.NVMe - &#39;non-volatile memory express&#39;. This is a _protocol_ that storage devices like SSDs can use to communicate with the external world. It is orthogonal to whether the disk is attached to your motherboard via pcie, or it lives somewhere else in the datacenter and uses a different transport layer. For example, local NVME SSDs will use PCIe transport. But you can also have NVME-over-TCPIP, or NVME-over-fiber-channel. Or NVME-over-Fabrics. Many of these are able to provide significantly lower latencies than a millisecond.As a concrete example, AWS `io2-express` has latencies of ~0.25-0.5ms, though i&#39;m not sure which technology it&#39;s using.nvme over fabrics: https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/NVMe-ove...
many interesting presentations on the official nvme website: https://nvmexpress.org/education/documents-and-videos/presen...
aws: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/achieve-higher-database..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An easy way I usually solve this with most MongoDB deployments is to have a couple data-serving nodes per shard that have local NVME drives and then have a hidden secondary that just uses an EBS volume with point-in-time backups.Your write load is already split up per-shard in this scenario, so you can horizontally scale out or increase IOPS of the EBS volumes to scale. And you can recover from the hidden secondaries if needed.And no fancy code written! :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of mirroring an SSD array to a HDD! I believe this is what some college kids get their hands on, since many motherboards come with 2 NVMEs. NVME RAID0 is too dangerous and RAID 1 is too expensive, but, by pouring few hundred more bucks, one can gain a marginal safety while enjoying the blazing fast RAID0.The magic here is `--write-behind`/`--write-mostly`[1] in `mdadm`. I mean, that&#39;s the only method that I can think of here. This is an old dark magic that prevents (though not entirely) reading from a specific drive.[1]: https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Write-mostlyTBH, in general, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good option for databases. The slow drive does cause issues, for it is literally slow. The whole setup slows down when the write queue is full, reading from the write-mostly device can get be extremely slow thanks to all the pending writes, and the slow drive will wear out quicker thanks to the sustained high load (though this one should not apply in this specific case).So you mostly don&#39;t want to use a single HDD as your mirror. For proper mirroring, you need another array of HDDs, which will end up being a NAS with its own redundancy. That&#39;s a large critical pain in the butt, but this is necessary for industrial grade reliability, and also allows making your &#34;slow drive&#34; faster in the future.In this specific case, it&#39;s pretty well played. They get 4 billion messages per day, which is roughly 46k per second. Assuming each write requires updating at least one block - 4kb - the setup needs to sustain at least 185 MB/s, which is clearly beyond a single HDD. Google Persistent Disk is a kind of NAS anyway, so that perfectly aligns with the paragraph above."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Is the fear of &#34;people selling your email to spammers&#34; a modern myth, or are spam filters that good?Email databases for sale are not always for spam or malware.  They are often used for tracking and cross marketing calculations.  Placing a companies name in the address will signal a canary and they may likely filter your contact out of their database or at least flag it and treat it differently.I&#39;ve been using email canaries for decades but recently had to adjust my canaries to be less obvious.  A few vendors got upset that I had their name in the address and one even accused me of fraud and canceled my $500 gift card.  That was the Tractor Supply Company.Either way I will continue using canaries and multiple domains as it is a good way to be filtered out of some cross marketing databases and to avoid some behavioral tracking and some machine learning.  It is also useful to find companies that get upset.  This is an indicator to me they lack integrity and should be avoided.  Canaries are also a good indicator to detect if a company has been compromised."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m glad you had a good experience.  I had a different one.I&#39;ve ran my own domain for longer than you have, and many emails have been compromised.Some are 100% from companies selling the emails to sister companies.The majority, though, is from a company itself being compromised by hackers / database access / etc.  LinkedIn, Neopets, ProFlowers, TeeSpring, etc.  I can go on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let&#39;s consider a few things:1) Just because it hasn&#39;t happened to you, that doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t happen. I have quite a few examples of companies selling or otherwise sharing, whether intentionally or through compromise, my email addresses.2) If someone (some company) is going to sell email addresses, it&#39;s not unreasonable to imagine that they&#39;d want to remove any addresses that would directly link those addresses to their source, so a quick search to remove any address with the word &#34;adobe&#34; in it when selling Adobe mailing lists would not be unexpected in the least.Years ago I set out to learn more about the &#34;missing sock&#34; problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_sock). I bought a dozen pair of brand new socks and I ironed on labels identifying each and every sock. Guess what? The labeled socks never went missing. The act of labeling the socks dramatically affected the experiment.Perhaps using companies&#39; names in our email addresses is affecting our results."</p>

This failed unit is purely an example of doing just enough to get by until it is someone else&#39;s problem.&#34;I&#39;ve been seeing this as a common issue throughout most of the household appliances we&#39;ve tried to buy in the last ten years. They just don&#39;t last."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These studies never account for survivorship bias. There were plenty of crappy appliances decades ago, but they’ve all long since broken, so we only have the very best old appliances to compare against today.Also, the inflation adjusted cost of a fridge in the 50s was something like $10k. A $10k fridge today (e.g. Sub Zero) will easily last for many decades. A $1k Wal-Mart special will not."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Without numbers it&#39;s really hard to say how good or bad these engineering choices were in regards to the consumer to come out on top or not.In my experience appliances are a lot more efficient and cheaper than they used to be. My new stainless steel fridge has much more capacity while using the same amount of power than the 20yo one it replaced (Which didn&#39;t actually fail, but the white coating was rusting all over the place).My HE washer doesn&#39;t fill the entire tub compared to the old upright ones, so my water heater is used less, and spins at ~1,200rpm, greatly reducing dry times for my electric dryer. The recessed lighting in my house went from 90 watts per bulb to 12 watts for LED, and saves me $$ on cooling when needed. My tankless water heater heats up only the water being used, no more, no less.I&#39;m paying roughly 32¢/KW all-in (after taxes, fees etc.) for electricity in the Bay Area, so efficiency gains build up quickly over time.Anecdotally, the only issues I&#39;ve had so far have been with poorly engineered Samsung refrigerators, where the fans would seize due to ice buildup, not mechanical wear."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lebanese here. To answer some of the questions in this thread:- No, Lebanon does not follow Islamic Banking.- No, people can&#39;t make wire transfers anymore. All bank accounts are frozen, you can&#39;t withdraw your own money. You have to beg and wait in line for weeks to be able to get a tiny amount of your account to be able to buy bread etc.- The local currency collapsed, lost more than 90% of its value. If the bank decides to give you some change (from your own money), they play money conversion tricks so that e.g. your account is down $1,000 but you get $100 only.- This person did not &#34;rob&#34; the bank. He tried asking the bank for money because  his father (and some people said his child as well) were in the hospital, needed medical care, and for that the hospital needed money. He had $210K in his account, but the bank kept kicking him away in previous attempts to appeal to them. He came back with a gun, and held hostages. Negotiated until they give back $35K, to his brother who was waiting outside. Then he surrendered without hurting anyone.- He is now in bad health because he&#39;s on a hunger strike after they arrested him. (In the negotiation they promised him not to arrest him, but of course they need to make an example out of him.)- Why is this all happening? Bad economic and financial policies for 40 years, rampant corruption. The economy was unproductive, but they kept the local currency subsidized, as it turns out by just spending the money that people deposited in the banks. And it&#39;s all gone now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I mean even at Google (on a different team) I was a &#34;technical lead&#34; in my 20s, and let me tell you, I had noooo business leading anything technical of any importance. But this is very common! We would never accept this in other fields. Would you live in a house built entirely by junior carpenters in their late 20s who built one or two houses that barely stood up? Would you drive cars designed and built by junior engineers?I find this kind of funny, because this is what happens right? I was under the assumption that architects typically design the building plans and do all the engineering, and a construction crew (which can consist of people mainly in their 20s) will build those plans under the supervision of the lead engineers/architects.So, in the same way that many senior software engineers don&#39;t write much code, don&#39;t architects/civil engineers typically refrain from using power tools to build the actual building? If this is the case, then software engineering is very akin to other engineering disciplines in this regard.I feel like the author of this tweet is conflating craftsmen with senior leads. A craftsmen is somebody I would expect to have been working with the medium for 10+ years, and continues honing their craft throughout the years. Whereas engineers and architects are typically more concerned with the abstract ideas and overall outcome. An engineer/architect can be a craftsman, but I don&#39;t believe they need to be synonymous."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The culture of “we are awesome” has dominated most internal communications for the last couple of years, including in 2022. We all believed that we were awesome and would continue growing and winning.This is the big thing that drives me nuts.I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a fragility of ego thing or what the cause may be, but it results in a corporate inability to critically self-evaluate at the highest levels.  If you can&#39;t say where your weak areas are, you&#39;re not improving.One of the experiences that untreated ADHD blessed me with was routinely failing classes.  That repeated exposure to undeniable failure (and the consequences of it) really helped me accept that failure is the default.  If you&#39;re not constantly fighting against failure, you&#39;re failing.  You can&#39;t pretend that something didn&#39;t work out, or stop thinking about it because it hurts.The self congratulatory back-patting (even if it&#39;s just &#34;everything is fine, we&#39;re doing great&#34;) is treating success like an achievement.  Success requires vigilance.  Excellence is not an achievement, it&#39;s an activity.We need more leaders that talk about the things we could be doing better, and doing so inspirationally, not derogatorily.  It&#39;s ok that you&#39;re not the best at something.  Very few are.  That doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t or shouldn&#39;t do better.Try internalizing that if you&#39;re not constantly struggling to do better, you&#39;re not living up to your potential."</p>

I have to let one of the three of you go.  Do you want me to decide or do you want to decide amongst yourselves?&#34;.  She knew we were good friends outside of work and would probably make a better choice than her.I ended up volunteering because one other guy had just bought a house and had a baby and the other guy had debts to pay off and I didn&#39;t.

Do not use with fast changing content like videos.Have you noticed the degraded display in your Kobo?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the bar to whether something is an &#34;illegal data breach&#34; or not, should be whether the security is half-decent according to most security researchers. Because in cases like these (and the one where someone almost got arrested for clicking &#34;view source&#34;), the vast majority of security researchers will agree that the security was terrible and irresponsible.Even scraping public data could be a gray area e.g. if you&#39;re scraping a huge amount of possible addresses or de-aggregating on a massive scale. More importantly, you could say that you are doing this, e.g. claim that you found a &#34;secret&#34; 64-bit key by evaluating every possible one. But if your data is accessible via simple API requests, clearly there is limited &#34;guessing&#34; or brute-force going on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On the one hand, I do think that scraping should be legal, on the other hand, I maintain a lot of websites and scrapers are a gigantic pain in the ass that make hosting a popular site for normal people cost-prohibitive (you need to scale up servers or invest engineering time to prevent scraping).This can only lead to a more centralised web where only rich people can afford to host content.There needs to be a solution like some kind of internet metadata archive, distributed on IPFS or something where bots can get their data if they want."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Changing a security model that has been used for decades to a more restrictive model is difficult, especially in something as complicated as macOS. Attaching debuggers is just one example, there are many similar techniques that could be used to inject code into a different process. Apple has squashed many of these techniques, but many other ones are likely still undiscovered.&gt; Aside from Apple’s own code, these vulnerabilities could also occur in third-party software. It’s quite common to find a process injection vulnerability in a specific application, which means that the permissions (TCC permissions and entitlements) of that application are up for grabs for all other processes. Getting those fixed is a difficult process, because many third-party developers are not familiar with this new security model. Reporting these vulnerabilities often requires fully explaining this new model! Especially Electron applications are infamous for being easy to inject into, as it is possible to replace their JavaScript files without invalidating the code signature.It makes me sad that we are likely not going to see any new fundamental design rethink for security&#39;s sake in mainstream operating systems. It is cost prohibitive at this point to do something that gets security right for the world of 2022 and yet not break all the apps which would never be rewritten!Mobile OSes were a good break off point as far as security goes but that came with a lot of functionality sacrifice.Although something like QubesOS can theoretically dream of being semi-mainstream with support from hardware and OSS OS vendors like RH/Suse/Canonical or even Microsoft."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It is unclear what security the AES encryption here is meant to add, as the key is stored right next to it. There is no MAC, so no integrity check for the ciphertextI imagine this is to prevent accidental disclosure of sensitive data through basic tools (only) like grep, and Spotlight.Also to prevent layman attempts at tweaking the files in a text editor like one used to do tweaking save files as a kid. But not to protect against dedicated attackers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Surely there is a better fix to a deserialization exploit than just making every new app implement `bool dontBeHackable { return true; }`??Even just, I don&#39;t know, forcing all builds to silently include this property in the compiled output - I mean, interacting with  OS app state data files should be abstracted away from the programmer anyway, so it shouldn&#39;t matter if they&#39;re signed/encrypted behind the scenes, just handle it automatically, right?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve programmed for a long time. One of the best programmer&#39;s I&#39;ve known actually had his own debugger. He was an OS kernel developer and carried the debugger with him from job to job; we were working on the new operating system at IBM that would become AIX. He was a bit of a nuisance in the large development organization because he would wander around the kernel in his debugger fixing code before others had even noticed the defects.We were working on a distributed file system, and I had complained that we couldn&#39;t be expected to finish on the same deadline as the hardware device driver teams and the network stack teams. How would we even develop our software if we didn&#39;t have any working communication between machines? Well, my friend came to the rescue and wrote the kernel support for the NIC and a comm stack up to the level of UDP (having a debugger helped).Eventually, the managers of the other departments that wouldn&#39;t cut my team any slack on our schedule started coming around to ask us for help because they were falling behind schedule. They were responsible for the official development of the network device drivers and networking, and it turned out they didn&#39;t have a working kernel debugger like we had (thanks to my friends personal one), so they had fallen behind schedule while we were already making good time on our distributed file system running on top of the our own hacked together temporary device drivers and networking code. I had to lend the teammate and his debugger to the other two teams to help them with their schedules."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Such a joy to listen to Carmack talk about just about anything.Not sure if it&#39;s an age thing but there is a particular feeling common to contemporaries of that era, growing up in our formative years as computers grew from their humble beginnings to the incredible machines we have now. At that time, each new improvement brought astounding differences in capability. In the space of 10 years we went from 8k to 64k of memory, 4 colors to 256 colours to 16k colors to 16M colours. Resolution from 320x200 to 640x480 to 1024x768, which was close to photo-realistic (for the time, an amazing capability). I remember how revolutionary it was when I first got a computer that could render 80 columns of characters - rather than 40. Storage went from tapes to floppy drives storing a hundred kb of data to MB to hard drives storing GB of data. Every time one of these changes happened, a vista of opportunity opened up to explore and innovate and figure out what you could do with the new capabilities. Writing code in those times was all about deeply understanding the internal capabilities of the machine you had and how to get the most out of them.Something about that process forged a deep appreciation for the fundamentals of hardware and software that I don&#39;t know how anybody could get these days."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been trying to listen to the whole thing (it&#39;s 5 hours!), and there are some really interesting moments. Albeit, a bit too much talk on old video games that aren&#39;t from my generation, but I&#39;m sure this will be interesting to some people to.What I found interesting:* he has insane hours and has never burnt out. He says that if you want to achieve big things in your life, you need to work a lot. He also says that as long as he&#39;s working, and making progress (and he always makes progress when he keeps trying, reminds me of Linus), then he can withstand his hours and pressure.* he learns a lot through reading computer science books* he is really big on simplicity, seems to appreciate Golang and its design, and he&#39;s not into metaprogramming on C++. I really like that he&#39;s focused on building things that work, and can be maintained, and not that interested in theory and advanced concepts that don&#39;t seem to bring him much. He also says he spent some time on the functional side, and that probably made him a better programmer, but he&#39;s back doing C++.* he talks about the sort of hacking community he felt part of, where you just wrote code and shared it and reused other people&#39;s code. It really feels like open source is something else, made me feel bad about all these patents, and weird licenses (even Apache 2 or MIT) and academic people whining about credits. Wish we could just share and use whatever and be happy with it :(* Agree with him, VSCode is THE IDE. It&#39;s much better than emacs IMO (I&#39;ve tried using vim many times but couldn&#39;t).* 8-9 diet cokes a day. Holy fuck. That&#39;s a lot of caffein (and I&#39;m guessing not good for the teeth)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;But because of a subtlety of Unix systems (of which macOS is one), when an existing file is moved from another location to the root directory, it retains the same read-write permissions it previously had.&#34;And ownership. (The sentence before that suggests &#34;root directory&#34; here means &#34;directory owned by root&#34;.) The permissions on the directory apply only to the file&#39;s directory entry, not the file itself.This isn&#39;t a &#34;subtlety&#34;, it&#39;s how it works, and no-one who doesn&#39;t understand this should be writing macOS installers.The correct approach is to open the file for read and copy its bytes into your private area. Only then check the cryptographic signature. Just renaming into your private directory isn&#39;t enough, even if that directory has no read or execute access to other users, because the attacker could have opened the file for write access before you did the rename."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For years, I have refused to install zoom, webex etc clients for exactly this reason. Their installer wants admin user access for no apparent reason. They could have given a simple drag and drop installation app. Instead they want to run an installer with root user permissions to do whatever. Also, I hate apps that installs a helper background program, and doesn&#39;t let me disable it via preferences. I refuse to use those too.Besides, for what zoom does, why do they need an app? Browser has all the capabilities they need."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note that if SIP is enabled (the default), &#34;root access&#34; does not mean full compromise. On macOS, root is far from being as privileged as it was in the old days of UNIX yore. (Even on Linux it does not have to be, but my impression is that on most distributions it probably still is.)Just because you&#39;re root does not mean you get any entitlement you want, or arbitrary access to the whole filesystem, arbitrary memory access (a la /dev/(k)mem), or can replace the kernel just like that.(That&#39;s also probably why you don&#39;t hear of iPhones being &#34;rooted&#34;, but rather &#34;jailbroken&#34;. Just being root on an iPhone wouldn&#39;t do that much.)Make no mistake, this is still a privilege escalation attack and needs to be fixed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the things I remember being discussed on m.d.s.policy not so long ago was making a registry (maybe handled by IANA) for example private keys. Turns out Peter Gutmann did the heavy lifting (thank you Peter) to turn that from idle discussion into a draft document:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-gutmann-testkeys/From the point of view of m.d.s.policy the main idea is to require CAs to reject these keys in certificates for the Web PKI and encourage software to use these keys (rather than their own examples) in sample code. Basically when you build my-cool-website.example and copy paste the private key from an example into your certificate fetching code, the CA should say &#34;Er, no, you need to actually choose your own private key, that&#39;s what the word private means&#34; and this should happen when you copy-paste a high-rated Stack Overflow example, the provided sample code from the library you used etc. Ideally these would all be the same keys is the idea.It would also make sense for tools to care about these example keys e.g. GitHub could flag code that&#39;s checked in and has keys which are not these examples since maybe you used real keys by mistake in your GitHub repo, meanwhile your build-for-production CI tools could reject keys which are on the list because that means you forgot to pick actual keys for the real build."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Mac address part stood out to me, has something changed over the year that made changing Mac addresses more complex?Back in college our school had some limitations on the internal networks in our dorms. After doing my normal stuff (you know mega downloading,ftp, limewire etc) my net stopped working. Come to find out they had a bandwidth monitor and would just block you for some time if you used too much and had to contact tech support, even for simple things like window updates.Anyways, somehow I found out I could tweak some net configs in the registry. So here I randomly change some dword value to change my Mac address. I finally got back online and just forgot about it.A few days later I came back to my room after classes, my roommate told me the school officers raided the room trying to get on my PC. I went to the student dean&#39;s office and come to find out I took net access from I think the president and they tracked it to my PC ... Some luck I say lol .. Tech support said that there was no possible way I could change my Mac address after a bit back and forth I decided to just agree with him.O yeah and they had like a 200-300 page printout of irc chatlogs ,there was more stuff but I&#39;ll end it there.Needless to say my net access was blocked for a year even tho I had a work study job with the webdev department.
It didn&#39;t stop me though, I ended up running a long cat5 cable from the dorm next door. Fun times."</p>

And even if it was relatively secure today, I doubt it will get security updates for the 10+ years I expect to have the car, if at all.I&#39;m glad folks can now sign their own firmware to run on their own cars, but what else is vulnerable in these things?The car is amazing otherwise, and I&#39;m glad Kia does not seem to use the modem for any anti-features, so the car is totally fine with removing it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Like another comment here mentioned, housing is complicated. People don&#39;t want to live in a random house in the middle of nowhere (&#39;roof over your head&#39;). Some people prefer to be homeless on the street versus getting to a roof over their head that they don&#39;t like.People want to live where they want to live (near family, jobs, culture etc)Take NYC for instance. Politicians try to address the NYC housing crisis from a demand/cost perspective. Rent is too high? Let&#39;s just screw the property owner and cap the rent. Or let&#39;s just raise minimum wage to make it easier for people to live in those properties.The result in both cases: you didn&#39;t have enough housing before, you don&#39;t have enough housing now. You give more money to people, rents will just go up. You cap the rent, there&#39;s still a huge number of people that can&#39;t live where they want and you make it impossible for existing tenants to move (or for new/more development to be built, for that matter)So, what instead? You want to build more housing in NYC? Great, that should work. But you have to make it cheap. Deregulate construction, get rid of unions, prioritize developer rights over tenant or homeowner rights. What? You don&#39;t think these are good things? Okay, but then you&#39;ll have to sit back and watch new construction trickle in and result in &#39;luxury&#39; housing because that&#39;s the only way a developer can recoup their enormous land acquisition, regulation and construction costs.
So the challenge with housing is that it requires fundamentally difficult decisions. To pretend that you can just spend 100 billion (or even a trillion) and the problem will be solved and people will be happy, is an illusion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I definitely do. It&#39;s something that turns a basic necessity into a speculative asset, with a price distorted by the money poured into it. Airbnb is also a deeply harmful influence on housing prices.Imagine if we did the same thing with, say, water: privatized it and then &#34;democratized&#34; ownership of it.It&#39;s easy to get retail investors to buy things at inflated, speculative prices, so the price of water would go up. People would say, &#34;Why are so many people dying due to lack of access to water?&#34; And we would blame these startups, laws would be passed, and we would fix it.Unfortunately the necessity of housing is not as direct and clear, and we have a long history of denying housing to people who are unlucky, sick, or the children of such people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a natural first impulse, but it&#39;s wrong. What is the correct impulse is to be concerned about how lopsided most cities zoning is towards single family, as that is what is driving the market power that makes real estate profitable as a financial asset. If most of a city was zoned to allow up to multi residential highrises rather than most of a city being zoned for single family it would cut the appreciation ability of the scarce and valuable land zoned for higher density already and would allow more people to live closer to where they want to live (i.e. close to work/wherever they daily commute).The market isn&#39;t failing to function because someone realized they could buy up current stock and make a large profit over time, people noticed they could make a large profit over time because city governments zoned everything wrong for the actual demand."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was fortunate enough to spend about 18 months as staff assistant to my CEO, including access to their email and basically all meetings. This was a PE-backed roll-up that was in the midst of acquiring several smaller companies, and then pursuing an exit.The experience really opened my eyes about the requirements for the job. The amount of code-switching required to communicate well with ownership, the other C-levels, employees, customers, and potential acquirers could make my head swim. The breadth and depth of technical, financial, and human expertise necessary to verify all the parts of the business and smell out where issues might be hiding. All of that before even getting to (in this case) integrating several businesses into a whole, identifying up-and-coming leaders, and keeping the employees happy; let alone actually having a strategy, getting buy-in, and implementing it. And then spending most evenings networking with the elite class that you need to know to have access to capital. You can never have a bad day. Ever.This was for an org that was comfortably under 1000 employees, all located in the US, where none of the VPs were the kind of political operators you get in meatier companies.I walked away thinking that there can&#39;t be even 100k people in the country with the ability to do even a non-laughable job as the CEO of a 500ish employee company. Not even do a good job, just do a job that doesn&#39;t look like one of those 80s child-parent-bodyswap movies where the kid tries to work in an office.I still think CEO pay is out of control, but I understand better why boards end up paying what they do.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The &#34;What it&#39;s like&#34; posts are really cool. Especially enjoyed this account[1] from a content writer who shadowed the CEO during a half-day meeting with a major investor and got to see the impact of their work in a context they never expected:&gt; Next we met with Vinod, Bruce, and investment partners Brian Byun and Sven Strohband for a company brief and brainstorm session. Sid began with an update on the financials, and detailed our massive growth and expansion both in terms of people and product. There were no slides presented. Instead, Sid used our website as a visual aid. Nearly every question or discussion point was first addressed with a Google search to pull up the appropriate GitLab web page to reference.[...]&gt; I’ve been working at GitLab for two and a half years as a content writer on our marketing team and at times have been extremely frustrated with our marketing website—the content on it, how it’s organized, what we’re presenting, etc. It doesn’t look or operate in a way I’m familiar with so my instinct was to not trust it. But nothing we do at GitLab is “normal,” and witnessing our CEO use the website as a single source of public truth to inform our investors is just one example of what it means to be a transparent company.[1] https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/04/08/khosla-ventures-git..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m constantly in awe of Gitlab&#39;s radical transparency approach. I have no idea if this is actually a good idea (surely every competitor of Gitlab has a huge amount of assymetrical information about Gitlab that Gitlab does not have in return) - but I am fascinated by it and truly grateful for them for daring to go out on a limb and do this experiment. My fingers are crossed that this brings them amazing success as I wish all companies worked this way."</p>

There is an assumption that businesses should be able to sort things out amongst themselves and the court system. However an SME barely has any more power then a consumer going against a giant like Autodesk.I wonder if the solution wouldn’t be to extend those protections to smaller businesses, and additionally allow reclaiming the cost of any investments in the platform (Training, etc) and other expenses.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you have to debug at that level, and you&#39;re not designing hardware, things are really bad.Some years back, Wes Irish at Xerox PARC tracked down one of the great mysteries of early coax Ethernet - why was throughput so much lower than theory predicted? For this, he got both ends of a building-length coax with many machines on it connected to one office, so he could plug both ends into a storage scope. If the waveforms disagreed, somebody was transmitting when they shouldn&#39;t. Storage scopes with large storage were rare then. It was an expensive LeCroy unit.After the end of each Ethernet packet on coax, there is a brief &#34;quiet time&#34;, and then the next packet can be sent, beginning with a sync pattern. The hardware detects if what it is sending does not match what it is receiving, which indicates a collision. Both senders stop, wait a random time so they don&#39;t collide again, and retry. This is how &#34;carrier sense multiple access - collision detection&#34;, or CSMA-CD, works at the hardware level.This setup revealed that something on the cable was transmitting a single spike after the end of each packet, during the &#34;quiet time&#34;. That reset the &#34;quiet time&#34; timer in the network interface, which inhibited the transition to &#34;look for sync&#34; mode. So the next packet would be ignored. 
The quiet time timer was at a very low level - software did not see this event.What came out of looking at the waveforms was the surprising result that the                                                                                      spike during the quiet time was not coming from either the data source or the destination, but from something elsewhere on the cable. The spike was not synchronized to the packet just sent.
With the waveforms for both ends of the cable visible, speed of light lag revealed both that this was happening and where it was coming from, as distance along the cable.It turned out that several brands of network interface used a part which contained the quiet time timer, the sync recognizer, and the transmitter power controller. When the timer ran out, the device did a state machine transition, and during that transition, for a nanosecond or so, the transmitter turned on. It wasn&#39;t supposed to do that. This generated a spike on the cable, resetting every quiet time timer and causing the next packet to be silently ignored by all stations.The network interface didn&#39;t need to be active to do this. Being powered on was sufficient. One device with that part could halve the data rate on a coax Ethernet. Thousands of network interfaces had to be scrapped to fix this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know a little bit about Ethernet, having used it since the early 10Base-2 days as well as having done a bit of &#34;hacking&#34; in an effort to decode 1000Base-T.This article is focused on the QSGMII PHY chip, without which it would be practically impossible to use an oscilloscope for any meaningful troubleshooting.1000Base-T is the most commonly used Ethernet variant in use today.  It uses four balanced differential pairs for signalling.  Each pair transmits and receives simultaneously.  This works because 1000Base-T is a point-to-point connection and the PHY contains a hybrid that subtracts the voltage being transmitted from what is received.  This makes the problem of &#34;tapping&#34; the interface harder because the third party observer sees a jumble of data and cannot easily determine what data is coming from either of the two connected devices.  Each pair can send/receive five possible symbols, represented by voltages of +3.5, +2, 0, -2, -3.5 volts.  In addition, the PHY &#34;scrambles&#34; the data being sent with a LFSR (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register) seeded with either a &#34;master&#34; or &#34;slave&#34; value.  (The master/slave identity is negotiated between the two peers when they detect each other.)  It gets even more complex with hamming codes and an abstraction layer to separate the control/data planes.  There&#39;s also a complicated DSP for line equalization.BTW, I do own one of these: https://www.amazon.com/midBit-Technologies-LLC-SharkTapUSB-1... which can make the job very easy, but it was not an available option for my &#34;hacking&#34; application."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The scope&#39;s sample rate really jumped out to me:&gt;  I configured the oscilloscope to collect 100M samples at 1 TSPS (tera-sample per second, 10^12) ...Wow! Sampling at 1000 GHz? I wouldn&#39;t have thought that was possible! Does anyone know how the scope can even do that?"</p>

are no longer equivalent to DFAs.Since Xerox Research Europe&#39;s invention of xfst, the term &#34;extended regular
expression&#34; is already taken for a specific superclass of expressions that
describe regular relations.So I propose two alternatives, semi-regular expressions and super-regular expressions, for strings that look like regular expressions but that use non-regular extensions like backreferences that push the complexity beyond what can be done with NDAs/DFAs."</p>

It was either my just before or just after lunch interview and it stuck with me for the rest of the day and I couldn&#39;t give my entire focus to the rest of the sessions.anyways, after it was done, I found kernighan&#39;s blog post and decided I should try to implement this in java as it will allow me to even get some practice with things like junit and more experience with object oriented programming as I had been living in the C world at that time).  so I did, but I then found this regular expression page ( https://www.regular-expressions.info/) and learned many more things about &#34;regular expressions&#34; that i hadn&#39;t learned in school (because they aren&#39;t regular) and wondered if I could extend pike&#39;s simplicity to them in a relatively simple manner.  So I did.which I created this https://github.com/sjpotter/regex.Not meant to be &#34;performant&#34; but meant to be educational to me and perhaps others.Then when I was learning go, I rewrote it in Go.  I did things that are not &#34;normal&#34; go patterns (i.e. using panic and recover to make error handling cleaner (in my opinion, if an error path is simply if (err) { return err } all the way up, I personally think panics/recover at the top can be cleaner, but it seems most disagree), but it was educational on how to rewrite my java code to an object oriented style in Go and to explore the limitations of interfaces and how one might get around them (also perhaps in ways that go against what might be considered proper go programming)https://github.com/sjpotter/regex-gothough now that I look at that repo, wondering if all the work was done elsewhere and then I just pushed a single commit there, might need to go back and look at it"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The crazy part is that this journey is only the tip of the iceberg for this pedometer. It is made of many components, all of which follow similar journeys to the pedometer factory from their respective factories. And the components are made of raw materials, which are also shipped around in a similar manner after being mined. And the mining itself displaces those who live in that space."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why did they do this backwards? It sounds like they took the trip in reverse. I thought they recorded it forward (tracking an actual object the whole time) and presented it in reverse, but it looks like they didn&#39;t actually follow a real object. They just chose a path and took the path in reverse, using the types of transportation that such an object might in theory have taken:&gt; They write that, “Four years later we found ourselves on the largest container ship in the world on our way from Sweden to China.” As per the trip: “We had started the journey by truck to Middle Sweden, then by freight train to the port of Gothenburg, and after four weeks at sea, we filmed from a truck again, this time from the port of Shenzhen to a factory in Bao’an.”The idea of following a single, real object from point of manufacture to destination--documenting all the transfers and hiccups along the way--is interesting to me. Presenting it in reverse chronological order is an artistic decision I&#39;m ambivalent about. But it doesn&#39;t sound like that&#39;s what they did. They didn&#39;t track a pedometer; they just took freight vehicles along a path that maybe the thing went on, without following the actual transfer of the item from box to container, from truck to ship, etc.I&#39;m disappointed. I was ready to actually watch the whole thing. But it&#39;s contrived."</p>

And it definitely doesn&#39;t make sense to treat protocol devs as if they were the executives of those companies. The CEO of a bank and the lead dev of a protocol have very very different powers and responsibilities, and we can&#39;t just throw our hands up in the air and say &#34;the law&#39;s the law, and you gotta follow it&#34; (even when it&#39;s literally impossible given the decentralized and autonomous nature of the protocol).Analogously when joint-stock corporations first entered the scene it required the development of whole new branches of Western law. That law had to be tailored to reflect the realities and nature of joint-stock corporations. What would have been very dumb is simply to pretend like nothing changed and say &#34;same rules apply&#34; and make individual shareholders liable for the action of the corporate entity the same way we&#39;re trying to make software devs liable for the action of the decentralized protocol."</p>

As the backyard was enclosed with no chance of the goat escaping, we left it by itself. The goat was be extremely hungry and ate everything insight including the roots, leaves and bark. By Monday, the backyard is barren and took months recover.Moral of the story - keep an eye on the goat."</p>

If there was ever a win-win situation, this is it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another story from a fellow hacker with a backyard goat - It actually starts in a very subtle way. Goats have different tastes and moods, and it&#39;s not like they eat everything right away unless the density of a goat per backyard m2 is too high. I started giving mine some free &#34;roaming&#34; time with the chickens every day before the sunset. It looked very innocent - first few days she ate just some weeds, nettle and some low hanging branches of pear trees. No worries, I was planning to cut those anyways. After few weeks of not paying that much attention in the evenings, bottom third of all our ~12 trees were gone, she got into salads, potatoes, zucchini, pumpkins, peppers and cucumbers, all nettle was done, and she started checking out tomatoes (which seemed that she is really really not into at first). I am building a new goat house with it&#39;s own separate &#34;backyard&#34; with weeds that she won&#39;t be able to escape. :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The study didn’t actually find anything related to cookware. Modern Teflon in the US doesn’t expose people to PFOA/PFOS like old version did due to new regulations. The chemicals could also be entering peoples body’s through drinking water or bioaccumulation in meat or plants.You should throw away nonstick cookware from before 2013, but new nonstick cookware sold in the US does not have PFOA. I believe the EU followed suite recently.Edit: After doing more research based on many comments here, I realized I was wrong. The brand Teflon replaced PFOA with GenX, a different fluorosurfactant that&#39;s probably worse than PFOA. From what I can tell, fluorosurfactants are more or less required to make PTFE and it seems quite likely that all fluorosurfactants are toxic. Personally I choose to use Teflon for eggs and stainless or cast iron for everything else. That feels like a decent trade off to me comparing years of life lost from liver cancer to time spent scraping scrambled eggs off of pans.I want to add that a lot of cool startups are working on PFAS remediation. One I know of is Cyclopure, they make a Brita filter replacement that filters out PFAS (it&#39;s very expensive at the moment, though). Probably worth it if you live near a chemical plant, airport, or US military facility (airports and military bases both use PFAS fire-extinguishing foams which they typically fail to contain)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They&#39;re finding PFAS in everything now.https://www.consumerreports.org/bottled-water/pfas-in-bottle...https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7gban/rainwater-everywhere-...https://www.dcourier.com/news/2022/aug/11/prescott-valley-sh..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There isn&#39;t a human alive today whose blood is free from PFOA and/or PFOS. The question to answer is what are the major routes by which this is happening.There is a lot of discussion in this thread about cookware. The problem is that these chemicals are now found throughout the environment and used in countless products. The stuff is found increasingly in drinking water and foods. Maybe cookware is a major contributor, but the truth is nobody knows yet.Nor does this effect appear limited to liver cancer. The paper notes:&gt; Studies examining associations of PFAS exposure with risk of other cancers, such as kidney cancer, in the general population have found similar associations to those reported here. For example, in the only existing nested case-control study examining the prospective association between PFAS levels and risk of renal cell carcinoma, PFOS levels &gt;50 μg/L were associated with more than two-fold increased risk of developing renal cell carcinoma (OR=2.51; 95% CI: 1.28-4.92), and similar associations were reported for PFOA and PFHxS [[52]]. These findings are notable due to the similarity in PFOS concentrations associated with risk of HCC in our study. ...https://www.jhep-reports.eu/article/S2589-5559(22)00122-7/fu...For its part, the paper never mentions the word &#34;cookware&#34; and is instead focused on the link between blood concentrations and cancer.Edit: Wikipedia has the following paragraph on the topic of cookware:&gt; Despite DuPont&#39;s asserting that &#34;cookware coated with DuPont Teflon non-stick coatings does not contain PFOA&#34;,[91] residual PFOA was also detected in finished PTFE products including PTFE cookware (4–75 parts per billion).[87] However, PFOA levels ranged from undetectable (&lt;1.5) to 4.3 parts per billion in a more recent study.[48] Also, non-stick cookware is heated—which should volatilize PFOA; PTFE products that are not heated, such as PTFE sealant tape, had higher (1800 parts per billion) levels detected.[92] Overall, PTFE cookware is considered an insignificant exposure pathway to PFOA.[93][94]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfluorooctanoic_acid"</p>

They said, and I quote, &#34;due to RBI regulations, we can&#39;t&#34;. Naturally, I asked &#34;which regulation document? do you have a number?&#34;. The other person did not have an answer and escalated my call. They said they would get back to me and in the meantime, I read all the regulations there were. The regulations clearly stated that issuers shall give an option to close the account at any time. There was no such option in the app.I pressed again to close the account to prevent misuse and/or fraud. The person on the other end of the call asked me (beratingly) to logout and delete the app. Because it was the same as deleting the account. I argued that it is not the same thing.

It&#39;s not a technical problem but rather a political one; manufacturers should be forced by law to unlock boot loaders and publish at least the bare minimum documentation enough for porting
software to devices that became obsolete either by the introduction of a newer version, or after support has ceased.
Until that happens, I&#39;m afraid we&#39;ll see more and more projects supporting only a very small part of the available devices."</p>

Let&#39;s find comments that are encouraging or thought provoking or point readers in helpful directions Like @londons_explore did.Bringing the beatdown is bad for everyone. Especially bad for young engineers.  This kid is impressive, straight up impressive.  Let&#39;s encourage him and others like him.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is inspiring, and let&#39;s look at why so many of us have the impulse to figure out what the flaw or missing part of the story is.For me, it&#39;s because I hadn&#39;t done something so cool at 17. That makes me think, huh, I wonder if I&#39;m not a &#34;natural born engineer&#34;. I start going through my life story so far and beating myself up for playing too many video games, or not going deep enough on my interests.Then I start thinking about the ways my life is different from his. I start to feel resentment about the opportunities I didn&#39;t have, the resources that weren&#39;t available. What could I have done if things had been different?Next I start to resent how society scores us on things that can contribute to the economy, or things that look particularly cool, and things that we accomplished at a young age.And then I start to imagine the difficulties that this young inventor will have. &#34;Oh yes&#34;, I think, &#34;He&#39;ll find out soon enough what the REAL world is like.&#34;And these thoughts are not who I want to be. But I can reflect and learn something about myself from them. And I can choose to go another way.I can decide that, if a 17 year old kid with the right resources and a crazy idea can make something really cool, then I, as an adult with more experience and resources can make something at least as cool if I want to. And I&#39;m going to. It&#39;s not like my life is over because I&#39;m older than 17.And if this article is making you spiral with insecurity, I hope you make a similar decision. A decision to be inspired instead of intimidated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Inspiring story all round but this paragraph stood out for me:“I didn&#39;t have a mentor to help me, really, so each time a motor failed, I had to do tons of research and try and troubleshoot what went wrong,” he says. “But eventually on the 15th motor, I was able to get a working prototype.”I imagine most 17 year old would not have kept going 15+ times until they arrived at something which worked."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few years ago we played this for a few weeks at the office over Christmas break when things were otherwise slow.  We had maybe a dozen players, and played in Survival mode which I believe is infinite with difficulty ramping up.We split into four teams, with one providing power, one providing ammo, one building defenses, and the rest just running around trying to help out where we needed it the most.There was a ton of potential.  I had to keep adjusting the difficulty as the match went on to keep us alive and then to finish us off when we were running out of time.I&#39;d love a multiplayer coop game like this but with the potential to have fifty or a hundred players.  Right now the office plays CS:GO once a week, with the settings changed to allow max players, but it still caps at thirty.  CS:GO is hard for new employees to get in to so I&#39;d love something where everyone has fun.  We also did TF2 for a while, which was better because the newbies could be medics and still feel like they were contributing, but the hard-core player base loved the challenge of CS:GO."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really like Mindustry.One place where Mindustry is clearly better than factorio is the feel of trying to build things quickly. It&#39;s very satisfying to lay something down fast. A stumble there is that the keyboard combinations are chorded but not overlap-free. So you hit like 1-3 for one thing and 3-1 for another, which means if you change your mind you can&#39;t abort a chord by starting another. Quite frustrating in the moment.Another &#34;so close to greatness&#34; problem is that the campaign doesn&#39;t allow you to trust your friends to run separate parts of the planet. You all have to be on the same map at the same time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It looks like Twitter is using SFSafariViewController for their in-app browser. This is the system-recommended way of creating an in-app browser. It prevents the embedding app (Twitter in this case) from reading website data and injecting JavaScript into the view. You can also break out of the session into Safari pretty trivially by hitting the Safari button in the lower right corner.Apps that implement a custom web browser using WKWebView (e.g. IG) are much worse and can do those nefarious things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really like the simplicity of this proposal, and how Adrian compares it to X-Frame-Options: DENY which has been in place for a decade now and has solved the problem of clickjacking and unauthorized framing for regular websites.My hunch is that having X-Frame-Options: DENY start applying to native mobile apps wouldn&#39;t be feasible because it would break too much existing stuff that didn&#39;t intend to opt-out of native embedding, but having different syntax (X-Frame-App-Options: DENY for example) would solve this need very effectively.It&#39;s interesting to note that Google have already taken steps in this direction: Google sign-in now detects if it is running in an in-app embedded browser and shows you an error telling you to use the native browser instead: https://developers.googleblog.com/2021/06/upcoming-security-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I used to work in mobile advertising, advertisers and tech vendors were always so desperate for this, because it would let them track users across apps and not just websites, so I’m not super sold on enabling it by default.&gt; Seem familiar? This is framing, merely in app form. But this time, the framed website has no way to framebust.Click the safari button. It opens it in your normal browser. Better behaved apps (shout out to Apollo) will let you set a config that sends off links to safari directly.
The only apps I know of that don’t have this button are Facebook messenger and TikTok, to nobodies surprise, 2 reasonably badly behaved apps. I think Instagram still does as well, but that’s not a surprise.
You can still escape the app context via the sharing menu though, although that is somewhat more involved."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think a few more concrete use cases would help.First, a key limitation that every architect should pay attention.  Redis reaches the limits of what you can do in well-written single-threaded C.  One of those limits is that you really, really, *really* don&#39;t want to go outside of RAM.  Think about what is stored, and be sure not to waste space.  (It is surprisingly easy to leak memory.)Second, another use case.  Replication in Redis is cheap.  If your data is small and latency is a concern (eg happened to me with an adserver), then you can locate read-only Redis replicas everywhere.  The speed of querying off of your local machine is not to be underestimated.And third, it is worth spending time mastering Redis data structures.  For example suppose you have a dynamic leaderboard for an active game.  A Redis sorted set will happily let you instantly display any page of that leaderboard, live, with 10 million players and tens of thousands of updates per second.  There are a lot of features like that which will be just perfect for the right scenario."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;  it was difficult to find images where the entire llama fit within the frameI had the same trouble. In my experiment I wanted to generate a Porco Rosso style seaplane. illustration. Sadly none of the generated pictured had the whole of the airplane in them. The wingtips or the tail always got left off.I found this method to be a reliable workaround: I have downloaded the image I liked the most. Used an image editing software to extend the image in the direction I wanted it to be extended and filled the new area with a solid colour. Cropped a 1024x1024 size rectangle such that it had about 40% generated image, and 60% solid colour. Uploaded the new image and asked DALL-E to infill the solid area while leaving the previously generated area unchanged. Selected from the generated extensions the one I liked the best, downloaded it and merged it with the rest of the picture. Repeated the process as required.You need a generous amount of overlap so the network can figure out which parts is already there and how best to fit the rest. It&#39;s a good idea to look at the image segment you need to be infilled. If you as a human can&#39;t figure out what it is you are seeing, then the machine won&#39;t be able to figure it out either. It will generate something, but it will look out of context once merged.The other trick I found: I wanted to make my picture a canvas print, and thus I needed a higher resolution image. Higher even then what I can reasonably hope with the above extension trick. What I did is that I have upscaled the image (used bigjpg.com, but there might be better solutions out there.) After that I had a big image, but of course there weren&#39;t many small scale details now on it. So I have sliced it up to 1024x1024 rectangles, uploaded the rectangles to DALL-E and asked it to keep the borders intact but redraw the interior of them. This second trick worked particularly well on an area of the picture which shown a city under the airplane. It has added nice small details like windows and doors and roofs with texture without disturbing the overall composition.What I did:"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; [TikTok]&#39;s addiction-based advertising machine is probably close to the theoretical maximum of how many advertisements one can pour down somebody’s throat.Well put. It&#39;s interesting that we pivoted in my adult lifetime from:1. Myspace&#39;s emphasis on sharing things on your own webpage, essentially a hosted blog
2. Facebook&#39;s evolution from &#34;hosted blog&#34; to &#34;friend update aggregator&#34; to &#34;chat client&#34; to &#34;friend update &amp; ad aggregator&#34;
3. Instagram&#39;s callback to simple update sharing (with pictures) and a chronological ad-free news feed
4. Snap&#39;s emphemeral sharing
5. Facebook&#39;s slow agglomeration and bastardization of all of the features that made Instagram and Snap distinct.
6. TikTok&#39;s addictive advertising machine that barely includes any friend connections at all.Initially I was concerned that this would mean the death of real social media, just like the article initially suggests. But I really like the conclusion the article ultimately comes to: we basically don&#39;t have social media right now, we have advertising engines masquerading as social media. Better that Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat show their true colors and become disgusting advertising machines just like TikTok.If we&#39;re lucky, that means a federated, open, mostly-ad-and-suggestion-free open source social media experience can fill the power vacuum for intimate, interpersonal, high-latency communication over the internet. microblog seems promising, but I think even mastodon could provide the experience I&#39;m looking for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the &#34;social&#34; part of social networks just moved to group chats. All my friends share updates of their family events, kids&#39; stuff etc.. over Whatsapp and Telegram. Strangers gather over topics that interest them and want to talk about it seem to have moved to discord, slack etc.The whole &#34;broadcast yourself to the world&#34; part of social networks just moved to Tiktok, Twitter, Instagram etc.. I think."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"TikTok is winning because it is video first. The more immersive the media, the more profitable the ads. Facebook is having trouble pivoting it&#39;s products to video. Facebook is betting big that the next more-immersive medium after video will be VR. That&#39;s basically the whole story.Notice I didn&#39;t use the word &#34;algorithm&#34; or &#34;social&#34;? These takes are tired and naive, TikTok isn&#39;t addictive in any operationally useful sense of the word, people just like it and use it. You may as well write a blog post saying &#34;TV is addictive and it&#39;s dying because of commercials&#34;. It&#39;s just not an accurate conceptualization if the landscape."</p>

And the legacy providers are clearly sitting on their monopoly position in a way that makes their pathetic alternative so starkly unattractive.But isn&#39;t it also true that once his network grows above a certain customer base (and gets into the maintenance phase), he will start to see all the effects that eat into being able to do this cheaply?Namely:-- customers who don&#39;t behave as well or kindly as before-- customers who need 24 hour customer service-- maintenance that can&#39;t be done himself, and he has to employ people-- customers and vendors who sue you for breach of contract, or other simply nuisance lawsuits-- upgrading the network to the next technology requirement, or when he&#39;s unable to get 2nd-hand parts so cheaply, etc.-- or a natural disaster that unexpectedly forces replacement of (and charging for) equipment that wasn&#39;t anticipated in the original subscriber priceMaybe none of this rises to the level of making it fundamentally different or unsustainable?  But it seems to me the honeymoon phase doesn&#39;t last long, and it&#39;s got to hit some unavoidable realities soon.   At least, if you think you can replicate this, it requires finding people and neighbors who are willing to do actual work and investment/concern to make something like this possible, and not simply pay a vendor a premium to phone it in.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was super confused by this since to the best of my knowledge SFSafariViewController blocks anything like this, you, as a developer, cannot inject anything or peak into the view it creates. Then I got to the bottom and realized I was correct, but FB/Meta/IG/etc aren&#39;t using SFSafariViewController and instead using the older ways to embed a web view.Honestly I thought all other methods had been deprecated and had no idea apps could still make use of the less secure (for the user) options. Trust me, as a developer I&#39;ve wanted to reach inside a SFSafariViewController many times to make my life easier but in the end I&#39;ve just grumbled and assumed it&#39;s not possible and worked around it.I wish there was a privacy-safe way to get the best of both worlds but due to bad actors I doubt that will be possible. I need to look more into App-bound domains but I don&#39;t think even that will give me what I really wish for (a way for the page loaded in SFSafariViewController to tell my app something). Something like postMessage support for SFSafariViewController would be amazing and be safe privacy-wise I think since the contained page would need to support sending/receiving messages instead of just having code injected against their will."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Only Instagram? Every app maker who makes an in app browser can see what you do, that’s the point of embedding it. And why not? You arrive there because of a link in the container app you clicked on. They want to see what you do with the link they gave you. Otherwise only Google/Apple can see what you do with it. Someone can see what you do with the link no matter what."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a consultant, I come around a bit.I have seen many companies with very poor productivity, and in zero of those cases was it laziness of the employees. In fact they usually would have loved to be more productive. Nobody wants to spend their life being dead weight.But as companies grow they install more and more rules and regulations that end up making sure nothing ever gets done. It is not unusual to meet &#34;developers&#34; whose company calendar is 80% filled with meetings. Well no wonder they don&#39;t get anything done!Also remember that this is only half the problem. The other half is that agile makes you iterate through pseudo productivity before you actually understood the problem, accumulating cruft that you need to maintain and extend as you go on. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if of the productivity that is left, more than half gets wasted on crufty software structures and writing code before you understood the problem.And then nobody wants to throw code away that turned out to be not what we need. Wasting yet more productivity on working around bad decisions from before we knew what we are actually building."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe it’s not the employees fault, but the management who hired them… or maybe it’s the fact that it takes forever to get anything done at FAANG nowadays.Or maybe, just maybe, interviewing based on esoteric computer science problems isn’t the best way to identify high performing builders.. but a great way of identifying people who can hack a process to secure maximal reward.Look, if I can ‘crack the coding interview’, then I can certainly crack ‘how to do as little work as possible and stack paper to the ceiling while my stock vests’.I wonder when the last time was that Mark or Sundar actually wrote any code they pushed to prod."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"By the end of my employment at Google I was not working very hard.  Probably a few hours a day, mostly doing whatever I felt like doing.  My managers consistently gave me &#34;meets expectations&#34; regardless of how much I achieved or how hard I worked.  However, any time there was an emergency related to my function, I had everything required to jump in, fix serious problems, and then get out of the way during the cleanup then contributing my bit to the postmortem.  
I could tell there were very few (fewer all the time) people who truly understand google prod, and in that sense, the company seems to be OK with paying top salaries to people who can prevent the company losing lots of money, or other critical prod issues."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m looking at https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/ and I still can&#39;t tell what&#39;s interesting and unique about this as compared to other options in this space.I acknowledge that this might be a PEBKAC situation, but I&#39;d love to hear thoughts from people who used Next.js, Remix, or whatever and found Astro to be a revelation.It seems like Astro&#39;s creators believe &#34;content-focused&#34; is a differentiator, but I find that confusing since content-focused sites are a popular use case for web frameworks that are also suitable for more complex apps."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used Astro recently to rebuild my personal website/portfolio, and I really enjoyed it. I&#39;m not a frontend dev and I quickly get overwhelmed by all of the choices and the breakneck speed that the web ecosystem changes at. Astro was exactly what I needed. It&#39;s optimized for spending most of your time writing content in markdown, but it gives you complete freedom to seamlessly add web code of any complexity you like. MDX is just markdown plus custom components, and Astro lets you drop in stuff from React, Vue or Angular, so you&#39;re not restricted to whatever components you can find for the single framework that you choose at the beginning of your project. Everything possible is made static. I found it to be pretty intuitive and I don&#39;t feel boxed in by it. This is how I want to make (frontend-only) websites in the future.My biggest issues using it (admittedly in the beta state) were 1) wrong line numbers printed for errors due to extensive rewriting and transpilation without source mappings and 2) no built-in image optimization (there is a third-party tool that works well enough, but for a content-first framework this doesn&#39;t seem good enough to me).[Edit]: Ah, I see in the 1.0 they have built-in image optimization :) I&#39;ll have to try that out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sometimes all the frameworks that re-invent MVC (but in a detached fashion) and tout &#34;server side rendering&#34; just feel like we&#39;ve come full circle where we&#39;re just serving a static view cache that was generated from models and data using a controller.The big difference here (as with other JavaScript-based renderers) is of course the &#34;use one tool/language for everything&#34; aspect which to me is a bit of a &#39;meh&#39;-benefit.At this point, while all the renderers get better and simpler, we&#39;re still in a situation where complexity or writing code hasn&#39;t really gone away, it just shifted around to new places. Perhaps at some point we get to the HTML + WebComponents stage again (kinda like MDX and React mixing), and classic Apache Server-Side Includes become the new hot thing again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have noticed that a lot of/majority of  &#34;regular people&#34; tend to coast along on the back of others as a way of life. If &#34;smart people&#34; are perceived by friends and family as being problem solvers, many will route their problems to a &#34;smart friend&#34;, someone who seems to have their life somewhat in order or always have the answer to everything. I used to get an endless stream of requests for everything from technical help, legal/financial advice, help planning vacation, help making decisions on purchases, career advice and help fixing their &#34;failed to launch&#34; kids, really often far exceeding simply asking for an opinion, folks effectively transfer ownership of their problems to you for you to fix.Of course they may praise you for this and perhaps you get addicted to this positive feedback, but it comes at a high cost, especially as you can end up spending so much effort on &#34;friends&#34; that you neglect to solve or even recognize your own problems.I have come to realize recently that I don&#39;t actually have any friends, only dependents. Declining to take ownership of people&#39;s problems caused basically all of them to more or less cut off contact with me (maybe I get a text once a year or something), but I am so much happier now that I ever was before."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not especially smart, or happy, but, personally, I don&#39;t know how to be it, or what it feels like. I know pleasure, but being in a constant pleasurable state is not what is meant by happiness as far as I know.Slavoj Žižek (someone who does seem to be especially smart):“Happiness was never important. The problem is that we don&#39;t know what we really want. What makes us happy is not to get what we want. But to dream about it. Happiness is for opportunists. So I think that the only life of deep satisfaction is a life of eternal struggle, especially struggle with oneself. If you want to remain happy, just remain stupid. Authentic masters are never happy; happiness is a category of slaves.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many people conflate hedonistic pleasure with happiness. This is a big mistake that leads to addiction, selfishness and inevitable dissatisfaction. Even happiness as a sustainable state may be an unrealistic or unattainable goal. For me the answer to this puzzle is a finely tuned balance between self growth and contentment with perhaps a heavier emphasis on contentment. Regular and consistent periods of reflection and appreciation for what you have (no matter how small) is the recipe for promoting states of contentment. Pleasure is ephemeral, happiness comes and goes but contentment can be reliably and directly cultivated."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Most businesses, consumers, and developers universally continue to ignore the primary reason that iMessage is a closed platform, rather than an app on every platform as iTunes is:Apple is using device serial numbers for anti-spam, supported by a fully-authenticated hardware and software stack that does not allow user modification. This permits Apple to simply “console ban” any Apple device that spams on iMessage. This makes it prohibitively expensive to send spam over iMessage. They have been doing so since iMessage was launched.Android offers no such attestation that I’m aware of. Windows, on Pluton, could offer this attestation securely — and that is a key deliverable of Pluton.It’s easy, then, to predict what Apple’s first non-Apple platform will be: Microsoft Windows 12, only if secure-booted, with Pluton-signed attestation that the kernel is unmodified. And it’s easy to predict how Apple will implement anti-spam: by applying “console” bans to specific Pluton chips by their serial number.If Android wants to join the party, then Android phone builders need to implement secure boot with hardware-signed attestation of non-rooted-ness, in the style of Apple T2 + macOS or Microsoft Pluton + Secure Boot. Until then, Apple iMessage will remain single platform.(I recognize that this is extremely unpalatable to device hackers, but the same freedom to modify an OS kernel that hackers desire is also the freedom to spam all users, as we have seen repeatedly with all messaging software platforms operated without hardware-backed attestation for the past thirty years — including email, Jabber, and HN itself.)(No, I do not work at Apple.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can understand Google&#39;s frustration but they have no one to blame but themselves.Everyone is familiar with their graveyard of failed messaging applications (along with their graveyard of products generally).When I had an android phone, I tried RCS with someone else on Android. It never worked. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s improved, but as the common theme of this story goes, Google blew their chance.I also don&#39;t trust google to abide by the &#34;standard&#34; they&#39;ve created. Their track record is abysmal. I don&#39;t want to use yet another messaging service that they&#39;ve built. I don&#39;t trust it to exist in the future, receive support and updates, and for it to be maintained. If google abandons it that means the telecoms are stuck holding the bag and when we demand even more from the next iteration of messaging apps, RCS will go the way SMS has today.This is nothing more than Google reaping the results of their own failures. It&#39;s a shame they squandered the opportunity over the last 15 years to develop a cohesive messaging app strategy across their products, but its their shame and now they have to pay the price.In a last ditch effort they&#39;re trying to throw all the blame on Apple who was able to innovate and launch a successful messaging service years ago. Apple recognized that SMS could be improved, and they improved it. They didn&#39;t wait for anyone and they recognize the importance of continued support - a quality Google does not seem to foster.Google had their chance over and over again but they blew it over and over again. I don&#39;t care about the little things RCS adds, message bubbles, delivery confirmation etc. These may be nice additions but they truly don&#39;t make a large difference. If an Android phone wants to send a high quality image, video etc they can share a link. That&#39;s good enough for me.Google failed, miserably and publicly. This latest campaign is just embarrassing for them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t love RCS[0], but Apple implementing it (including the E2EE extensions) would strike a huge blow to messaging fragmentation immediately, at least in the US.Hell, Apple doesn&#39;t have to ditch iMessage; they just have to support RCS for messaging with Android users, or group messaging with mixed Android/iOS devices.I would also (grudgingly) accept an opening of the iMessage protocol so Google could implement it in the Android Messages app.  Not ideal by any measure, and I figure Apple would never do this (and I suspect Google would hypocritically not want to do this anyway), but it would at least improve things.The thing that&#39;s sad overall is that the current state of affairs is just a result of an anti-consumer corporate pissing match.  The only losers here are the users, both on iOS and Android.  And meanwhile both Apple and Google get to tout the benefits of their preferred solution as if they&#39;re both the good guys, fighting for their users.  When in reality they&#39;re merely fighting for their own market dominance.[0] Tying messaging to your carrier is just a continuation of the crappy SMS &#34;portability&#34; experience.  Sure, most RCS backend implementations are currently provided by Google, but one thing I&#39;d like to see would be the ability to select your RCS provider.  Maybe others would crop up if this were an option, and if RCS were actually popular."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Jury nullification is just one manifestation of good-ol&#39;-boy-ism.Good-ol&#39;-boy-ism is a good thing when it let&#39;s the sheriff of Mayberry teach a kid a lesson without making him a felon and ruining his future.Good-ol&#39;-boyism is a horrible thing when it let&#39;s the sheriff of Mayberry teach a kid a lesson, making him a felon and ruining his future.I have personally benefited from the former. I don&#39;t know how to reconcile the latter when the only difference was the kid&#39;s last name, or skin color, or religion. Every good thing can be abused. Sometimes the scale of abuse calls for the abolition of the &#34;good thing&#34;. Sometimes it is better to tolerate some abuse because of the scale of good that comes from the good thing.For me, this train of thought always breaks down to reasoning that good-ol&#39;-boy-ism is good when the ol&#39;-boys are good and bad when the ol&#39;-boys are bad. But that&#39;s obviously broken when &#39;good&#39; or &#39;bad&#39; is left to the decision of the ol&#39;-boys. Historically, we just have constant war to decide who gets to be the ol&#39;-boys this week."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Personal vehicles will be getting both bigger and smaller.  What&#39;s different from the past is that electric motors scale much better than IC engines. Both the world&#39;s smallest vehicles (kid&#39;s toys) and the largest vehicles (huge mining trucks) are both electric.First the small.  Cities will soon start to ban all but electric vehicles in their downtown cores  (already happening in some Chinese cities).  The primary reason being electric vehicles don&#39;t emit the poisonous gases that IC vehicles do.  The next phase will be only EV&#39;s that are half the width of a normal car lane will be allowed in the downtown core.  Most vehicles in the downtown core now are single occupancy, a city can double its downtown vehicle infrastructure for free by restricting most EV vehicles to taking up just half a lane.  These vehicles will be much cheaper too, probably less than $10k.Now the big.  IC RV&#39;s are a bit of a pain but an all electric RV will be much better all around.  That&#39;s because all of the required functions will be electric and run off the huge battery.  Hot water, TVs, heat, refrigeration, very little maintenance just like a normal house, but smaller.  Tesla vehicles already have &#34;camp mode&#34; and people love it.  Image when Tesla builds an EV RV.  This will become young people&#39;s &#39;First home&#39;.  Buy it for $70k and live in it for much less than rent.  When you finish Uni, you own an asset rather than peeing your money away on rent.  Oh and for weekend trips to the lake or the ski mountain and all that, couldn&#39;t be more convenient.Remember, you read it here first.EDIT ... a few typos"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Energy? I feel like it&#39;s been talked about a lot but maybe not?Solar panels are dropping in cost at an exponential rate [0]. As of this writing, consumer &#34;new&#34; panels are $0.75/W and used are at around $0.30/W right now (I won&#39;t give a link as a Google search will do).Battery technology is also dropping at an exponential rate. I believe, with a little effort, one can purchase batteries at about $0.08/Wh.Taken together, one can purchase a 30KWh (daily) solar panel and battery storage system for about $4,200 (not including labor and extra hardware/electronics), which puts the return on investment (ROI) at about 3.5 years if we consider the average house spends around $1200 (in the USA).Dropping costs will quickly put that in the 2 year ROI range which, in my opinion, is the inflection point where it effectively becomes too good to pass up for the average consumer.The dropping price of energy comes with all sorts of side effects, like a potentially decentralized energy grid, use cases for excess energy (eg bitcoin mining, carbon capture, hydrogen production, etc.), novel power storage systems etc., which is maybe the &#34;novel&#34; part that I haven&#39;t heard too much talk about.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swanson%27s_law"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So, the RPC-4000 version of blackjack seems lost, but the LGP-30 version exists (and can be run on simh). I&#39;ve disassembled and partly annotated it, and found that it too has a sort of cheat switch.The LGP-30 has no source of randomness to use as a seed. From loading the program, if the player plays optimally, the games will all be the same. Over the first few dozen games, the player ends up in the hole (IIRC, noticeably more than the long-run house edge).The LGP-30 has one conditional branch instruction, that tests the sign bit of the accumulator. But if the sign bit on the instruction is set, and the TRANSFER CONTROL switch on the front panel is set, then the branch is always taken. This appears once in the program. On startup, if the switch is set, it marks two of the aces as already dealt. This perturbs the sequence enough so that, over the first few dozen games, the player has the advantage."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The commenters saying be reasonable, they were sanctioned, GitHub had to do this, should look into the last time code was made illegal or similar turmoil and what the developer community did in response…It was not accepting sanctions or govt failures to understand code as “well that’s that.”- Phil Zimmerman (PGP) was under  criminal investigation for arms exports by releasing the code for consumer encryption. The case escalated and was eventually dropped, included POTUS attention.- Aaron Swartz passed away via suicide in 2013 under threat of 35 years in prison and a lot else  for downloading from JSTOR programmatically- Clifford Stole spent several years being ignored by every govt agency under the Sun, except for CIA, for finding, attributing and then exposing a widespread KGB hack of govt systems in the 80s- L0pht testified in front of congress to expose significant  internet security risks that were otherwise ignored.I’m not saying Tornado Cash and related devs were doing a purely moral action. But the automatic siding with the heavy hand of govt sanctions on code the govt doesn’t really understand is pretty shameful for a nuanced technical audience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People on Twitter are either wilfully dumb or simply ignorant.GitHub had to do this. It was required of them by law. Tornado was sanctioned.&gt; These prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any blocked person and the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.This is, unambiguously, directed toward entities such as GitHub providing them service.I&#39;m not a fan of GH these days but they did the only thing they could do in this situation. You can be upset about it, but you can&#39;t be upset at GitHub about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honest question: was GitHub legally obligated to delete the accounts of anyone who had contributed to the repos?I get that contributing to the repos would be a violation of the sanctions, but it&#39;s not clear to me when the project was sanctioned and whether all the contributors were aware that they were contributing to a sanctioned project. Would it have been enough for GitHub just to remove the projects?I ask as someone who has a lot of developer friends from Cuba who run into problems with accounts on platforms being deleted all the time. IIRC there was an episode awhile ago when accounts were being deleted simply for logging in from Cuba.It seems like the legal obligation would be to block logins from Cuba (and/or Cuban people), but deletion of accounts seems more like a CYA move than a strict obligation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, i almost forgot about Firebug.From my point of view it was really a game changer. The first time debugging and understanding web-applications became accessible. Probably all browser dev tools were inspired by this tool"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An interesting convention that ~started with Firebug was the use of angle brackets in the DOM/Elements view. (eg a DIV element is shown as `&lt;div&gt;`). HTML, as a text format, uses angle brackets to denote tags. But DOM is an in-memory object model; it doesn&#39;t have tags, but elements, and those have nothing do with angle brackets (other than getting el.innerHTML will serialize back).From a usability POV, it&#39;s entirely defendable: make the DOM visually look like the HTML you authored. But Firebug and our current browser devtools only add them for aesthetics and familiarity.It rarely causes problems, but it&#39;ll explain why you&#39;ll see `&lt;tbody&gt;` in DevTools even if your HTML doesn&#39;t have it.  Still, I think dropping the HTML-y representation of DOM elements could be a win — removing end tags in particular would improve the information density.Bonus: A Firebug Cheatsheet I made in 2007, 4 years before I was working on Chrome DevTools: https://imgur.com/I2KbZWm"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Source: I work in the field.This is a current limitation, and an artifact of the data+method but not something that should be relied upon.If we do some adversary modelling, we can find two ways to work around this:1) actively generate and search for such data; perhaps expensive for small actors but not well equipped malicious ones.2) wait for deep learning to catch up, e.g. by extending NERFs (neural radiance fields) to faces; matter of time.Now, if your company/government is on the bleeding edge of ML-based deception, they can have such policy, and they will update it 12-18-24 months (or whenever (1) or (2) materialises). However, I don&#39;t know one organisation that doesn&#39;t have some outdated security guideline that they cling to, e.g. old school password rules and rotations.Will &#34;turning sideways to spot a deepfake&#34; be a valid test in 5 years? Prolly no, so don&#39;t base your secops around this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Slightly more robust method...Ask the caller to move out of the frame and then back in again.You will see a noticable &#39;step&#39; as the face that is partially in the frame suddenly gets detected as a face and the deepfake is applied.The only way around this is to crop the input video quite heavily - by at least one face diameter, which is a lot if the user is near the camera."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a constant cat-and-mouse game. When I worked in this space (2019-2021), the best defense against deep fakes was looking at the microfacial behavior/kinematics of the &#34;puppetmaster&#34; and comparing against known standards of the deepfake subject. Works even if the fake is pixel-perfect (since it looks at the facial &#34;wireframe&#34; rather than the image itself). The obvious downside is you need sample data of the subject (and usually tons of it). I wonder if that general approach can be optimized. E.g. Deep fakes tend to struggle with certain fine movement/detail, if you had a reflection of the subject, the algorithm would have to not just replicate the main face and the mirror, but also be completely optically consistent.Was a fun project, but the cat-and-mouse feeling was inescapable. 
For those curious, look up the DARPA MediFor project. Siwei Lyu (in the article) did a bunch of work in this space. Also see Hany Farid and Shruti Agarwal. They&#39;ve worked specifically with deep fake detection.https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14491"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Jonathan Haidt speaks about something similar in The Happiness Hypothesis. Epiphanies can only take you so far, before their novelty wears off and they lose the power to change your behaviour. This is why self-help book readers tend to keep reading self-help books. 4 weeks after finishing one they need another hit of epiphanies.Even the lamest examples listed in the OP article can probably give someone a boost in productivity for a while, as long as that epiphanic rush lasts.I&#39;ve felt this in myself over the years.

In fact, in the &#34;How to get startup ideas&#34; referenced in this post, pg says:&#34;So if you can&#39;t predict whether there&#39;s a path out of an idea, how do you choose between ideas? The truth is disappointing but interesting: if you&#39;re the right sort of person, you have the right sort of hunches. If you&#39;re at the leading edge of a field that&#39;s changing fast, when you have a hunch that something is worth doing, you&#39;re more likely to be right.&#34;To me, he is doing the opposite of insight porn. Basically saying this might not even be for you. He doesn&#39;t even suggest that you go become an expert in something. Rather, he just throws his hands up. He tries to spare you from the disappointment of hearing this by calling it &#34;interesting&#34;. That contrasts _a lot_ with what most of the insight porn is trying to convince you of.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Whether it’s because I was wrong, or failed to make the argument [for HTTP trailers support], I strongly suspect organizational boundaries had a substantial effect. The Area Tech Leads of Cloud also failed to convince their peers in Chrome, and as a result, trailers were ripped out [from the WHATWG fetch specification].FWIW, I personally think it&#39;s a good thing that other teams within Google don&#39;t have too much of an &#34;advantage&#34; for getting features into Chrome, compared to other web developers, however, I also think it&#39;s very unfortunate that a single Chrome engineer gets to decide not only that it shouldn&#39;t be implemented in Chromium, but that that also has the effect of it being removed from the specification. (The linked issue [1] was also opened by a Google employee.)Of course, you might reasonably argue that, without consensus among the browsers to implement a feature, having it in the spec is useless. But nevertheless, with Chromium being an open source project, I think it would be better if it had a more democratic process of deciding which features should be supported (without, of course, requiring Google specifically to implement them, but also without, ideally, giving Google the power to veto them).[1]: https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/772"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had never heard of HTTP trailers. So FYI&gt; The Trailer response header allows the sender to include additional fields at the end of chunked messages in order to supply metadata that might be dynamically generated while the message body is sent, such as a message integrity check, digital signature, or post-processing status.https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Tr..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few years ago I worked on a service that had to stream data out using protobuf messages, in a single request that could potentially transfer several gigabytes of data. At the HTTP level it was chunked, but above that I used a protobuf message that contained data plus a checksum of that data, with the last message of the stream containing no data but a checksum of the entire dataset (a flag was included to differentiate between the message types).This simple design led us to find several bugs in clients of this API (e.g. messages dropped or processed twice), and gave us a way to avoid some of the issues mentioned in this article. Even if you don&#39;t use HTTP trailers, you can still use them one layer above and benefit from similar guarantees."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is kind of stunning.  They appear to have discovered something like 30 novel (previously unknown) immune cell receptor interactions (Fig 1).  Then they built a quantitive model, looked into where these interactions are localized in the body, and lots more beside.  A truly ridiculous amount of information for a single paper. This seems to be the &#39;what&#39;s it all about&#39; paragraph in the paper:&gt; &#34;The immune system is distinctive for being a distributed system. It is not fixed to a single localized organ in the body, but rather is made up of numerous specialized cell types that must adaptably organize their intercellular connections to respond to pathogens and other threats wherever they may appear. We provide a systematic and quantitative view of the cell-surface proteins that enable immune cells to dynamically wire their interactions. The receptor interactions that we report in our network each merit further individualized study to characterize their full roles in health and disease.&#34;For those interested in computational modeling (basically they simulate immune cells circulating freely within the body and interacting based on their receptor types), here&#39;s the supplementary description link (pdf), which is enough for a whole paper on its own.https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs415..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who struggles with some vague immune system issues with more questions than answers, I was shocked at how much knowledge of the immune system is presented here. I was immediately curious about how I can apply this knowledge to help me understand my own immune issues. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t know enough about biology and chemistry to understand much of this. But I found this bit near the end encouraging, and a helpful summary of what is presented here:&gt; More broadly, the integrated approaches that we pioneered here for disentangling the immune system provide a framework for future systematic investigations ... Our analysis and the methods that we developed provide a template for future studies looking at physical cell wiring networks in detail. From these combined approaches, we may finally begin to disentangle cellular circuits in immunity and beyond, bridging from individual protein molecules to multicellular behaviour.This seems to be a comprehensive model on a level that has never been seen before, so in that sense, I&#39;m very excited about it. I just hope it doesn&#39;t take decades to trickle down into providers&#39; hands who can actually do something to help patients."</p>

I trust a handful of companies to vet their supply chain so I&#39;m confident of authentic cells like Murata VT6, etc .. but its less than ideal. I don&#39;t think my mom would be able to just find a authentic 18650, and this has to pass the mom test* Easy way to recycle these cells.

For example, engineers tune the individual per-cylinder exhaust distance - this way, the exhaust fumes from each individual cylinder align nicely once the exhaust from each cylinder merge into the final exhaust pipe. Otherwise, if, for example, the firing pattern is 1-5-..., then the air from cylinder 1 might arrive to the exhaust pipe at the same time as air from cylinder 5, given high RPMs and limited speed of sound.And the fluid dynamics of the cylinders are something that is extremely critical to modern cars, too.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thanks for the kind mention!I am Stephane, the person behind that website/project. I see a lot of people having concerns about the title - Background Sound Canceller - and they are right. That title is not mine, but poster&#39;s own.I describe my project as &#34;Background Noise Generators&#34;, or sometimes as as &#34;Non-Distracting Noises and Music&#34;.They are not sound cancellers but sound maskers.The idea is to create a noise you like, to mask a sound that you don&#39;t want to hear. Your colleagues, tinnitus, ... anything.Because these noise generators are designed to be non-distracting, there is a big chance that your brain will not even hear them after a couple of minutes... but they will keep masking the nuisance you wanted to het rid of in the first place. That is the magic exploited by the project. Create these sonic &#34;focus bubbles&#34;.Happy listening."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I expected a website offering to use your microphone to record, invert and cancel background noise via the speakers. Turns out the website is offering prerecorded sounds instead, not really cancelling anything. Still though, surely someone has tried my idea? It would likely need some adjustability to match the phase delay between microphone and ears-via-speakers but I guess it could work."</p>

Did everyone follow that?I&#39;m in stitches; dying of laughter over here. Folding together apps to reduce the number of chat apps if probably a good thing, but renaming them to an existing name while the old app is still around? Even Microsoft had the decency to tack on &#34;for business&#34; when they were butchering Skype&#39;s branding!On a more serious note, I&#39;ll be interested to see how this affects the business side of things; will Google Workspace keep Meet, and what Meet will it be?EDIT: Reading through the linked help article, they talk about Google Workspace under the section for the new &#34;Meet&#34; nee Duo and not under the section for &#34;Google Meet (original)&#34;, so I guess they have or will transition it.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Haxe is really unusual and interesting, and I don&#39;t think it gets talked about enough.&gt; Haxe can build cross-platform applications targeting JavaScript, C++, C#, Java, JVM, Python, Lua, PHP, Flash, and allows access to each platform&#39;s native capabilities. Haxe has its own VMs (HashLink and NekoVM) but can also run in interpreted mode.Compiling from one language to another isnt particularly unusual, but compiling from one language to so many is very unusual. On first impression it sounds unserious—real compilers output machine code—it&#39;s tempting to denigrate it by calling it a transpiler. But there are a lot of advantages that come with this approach. You always have access to the full capabilities of your target platforms. From a single language you can write code that is massively portable while also targeting specific platforms with just an if statement.The &#34;real&#34; compiler authors spend months working on linkage, calling conventions, runtimes, symbol mangling, allocators, and debuginfo trying to get their native code to link properly to the objective-c frameworks on iOS—and it never feels quite right. If you instead compile to objective-c, a lot of things get easier. It&#39;s a very pragmatic approach."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32366759">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The biggest problem with graphql is that you have to do a lot of non-obvious work to harden your system against DOS attacks or people that want to fly by and download your whole database. It&#39;s easy to construct a query which puts unreasonable load on your system.The more fine-grained nature of boring REST calls makes it more easy to control client impact on the system.If you want to see the kind of work you actually need to put in to make a graphql API, look at Shopify. They have rate limits based on quantity of data returned. Cursors and pagination. The schema is a huge ugly mess with extra layers that never show up in the pretty examples of GraphQL on the internet.Note that even if you use graphql for a private api to your web client, folks will reverse engineer it and use it for their own purposes. There are no private apis on the web.I&#39;m not a fan of graphql for anything that the public could see. It&#39;s somewhat akin to exposing a SQL interface; it opens up too many avenues of trouble. Keep public communication channels as dumb as possible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having worked in big tech and small startups, I think GraphQL is a brilliant way to solve an organizational problem that massive tech companies have.It&#39;s that the team maintaining the API is different from the team that needs changes to the API. Due to the scale of the organization the latter doesn&#39;t have the access or know-how to easily add fields to that API themselves, so they have to wait for the maintainers to add the work to their roadmap and get back to it in a few quarters. Relevant Krazam: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8OnoxKotPQAt a small start-up, if the GET /foo/:fooId/bar/ endpoint is missing a field baz you need, you can usually just add it yourself and move on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Whether it was the intention or not, I find GraphQL solved a fascinating problem: it let front end developers move faster by greatly decoupling their data needs from the backend developers.Backend developers describe the data model, expose it via graphql. Front end developers, often ones who never met those backend developers, can see the data model and just use it. They can change what they&#39;re querying on the fly, get more or less as they see fit.It lets everyone move faster.But as a backend developer, I actually fucking hate it, myself."</p>

Drums bass and vocals come out fairly well, though the drums stem seems to lack other percussion elements outside of the core rock drumkit (e.g. tamborine), and cymbals hits are clipped rather than ringing. The &#39;other&#39; stem, the rest of the instrumentation, keeps a fair bit of the percussion and there&#39;s bleed from the vocal melody.The backing vocals seem to have disappeared for the most part, and are only audible in the vocals stem when the lead vocal is present (like they&#39;re reverse-ducked? Been a while since I did any production, the terms have escaped me...).Not much use with complex arrangements to be honest, I was hoping to get things like the strings section separated from the rest of the arrangement.Original: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWX3El-slpYOutput: https://file.io/etpOQt57ziKe"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Old Norse word for Saturday, laugardagr, literally means &#34;washing day&#34;. This custom still survives here in countryside Eastern Europe where many people routinely go to sauna (banya) every Saturday (or Sunday like my family). Before the 20th century,  a lot of Eastern Europe (especially Russia) still lived like they lived in the middle ages: 95% of the country were serfs on feudal property living in traditional wooden houses with no modern benefits of civilization, and the bathing culture was pervasive: there were saunas (banyas) everywhere, and most villages were close to a river so water access was not a problem. Saunas were also a place where people gave birth. I find it hard to believe that Russian peasants were living the same lifestyle for centuries and only recently decided to start bathing. My family comes from Old Believers, a religous group which rejected church reforms of the 1600&#39;s and went into hiding in taiga, they preserved pretty ancient customs and their bathing culture was pretty intricate: for example, there always must be a separate towel/bucket of water for head, body, feet - this wouldn&#39;t have developed without a rich bathing culture before. Those villagers who could not afford their own sauna bathed in... ovens (inside the house). It&#39;s one of the older customs still preserved in some places. The traditional oven was pretty large and a whole person could fit in it. My mother was bathed like that when she was a child in their Old Believer village. However, I don&#39;t know if this was specific to Eastern/Northern Europe or common in Western Europe, too. I remember reading that due to overpopulation and deforestation it was harder for West Europeans to have frequent bathing every week. But here, population wasn&#39;t dense and forests were abundant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Its funny that western history distorts the history of the rest of the world.I hear western kids saying no one used to bathe in the ancient times.As an Indian, it was practically mandatory for each and every individual to take a bath at-least two times a day. Additionally the following customs were very prevalent till recent times.  1. Washing legs after coming home from outside.
  2. Washing hands, face and legs before sitting to eat food.
  3. Washing whole body after sex.
  4. Washing legs before entering others homes.
  5. Leaving footwear outside the *gate* of any home before entering it.
  6. A full bath in a river / lake / house tank *before* sunrise and once *before* sunset.

Also, body was supposed to be massaged with oil of sesame seeds (once a week), and greengram flour was rubbed on every part of the body. After sitting in the sun like this for a few minutes, the flour was scrubbed off by hand, and then a hot water bath taken.For shampoo, two traditional herbs are recommended. Kunkudukai and shikakai. Both are used as it is without any processing. Kunkudukai would be crushed and mixed with water to form a liquid and then applied on head. Amazingly, it would form a lather when rubbed on the head. I remember doing this type of head bath every sunday, until about 2005. Any shampoo was forbidden in our home. The items were dead cheap too.[Edit]Kinkudukai is also called soapnut.https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/benefits-of-soapnuts-for...The above site tends to exaggerate the benifits a bit, but it is believed that kunkudukai inhibhits dandruff and is anti-fungal and anti-bacterial.By personal experience, it tastes absolutely vomit inducing bitter and will burn your eyes to high hell if as much as a diluted drop enters it.Its a natural, safe and environmentally friendly way of taking a head bath."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"ughh I dislike when pop history takes this smarmy tone and is also not particularly accurate.&gt; In fact soap is a motherfucking medieval invention. Yes. It is. The Romans – whomst I don’t see a bunch of basics going around accusing of being filthy –  did not, in fact have soap, in contrast. They usually washed using oil. Medieval people? Oh you better believe that they had soap.Wait a minute, what about Aleppo soap? I thought the Romans knew of it and Wikipedia alleges the same in their article:&gt; Although it has been claimed that soap-making was introduced to the West from the Levant after the First Crusades, in fact, soap was known to the Romans in the first century AD and Zosimos of Panopolis described soap and soapmaking in c. 300 AD.Citation: https://www.google.com/books/edition/A_History_of_Greek_Fire...Then the OP author goes on to say:&gt; It was first introduced from the East, like most good stuff was at the time, but it took off rather quickly.This contradicts their claim that soap was a medieval invention! It wasn&#39;t a medieval invention. It was adopted technology.That&#39;s not a big deal I guess, but if you&#39;re going to make a rant about historical accuracies, what else isn&#39;t exactly accurate here? It seems the effort is put into the berating imaginary enemies rather than the writing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Super informative article, with a lot of little insights, claims, and customer blames.  Some are exceedingly fair, others are shirking responsibility on the seller&#39;s side.  Still a great read!1. &gt; If an item is in good shape or really is new and just unwanted, the packaging is almost always damaged beyond what could be considered a new item, so at best we might be able to sell it in a damaged package sale, which we do twice per year.It&#39;s generally difficult to open products without damaging the packaging.This is an intentional design with consumer packaged goods, likely for a variety of valid reasons.Doesn&#39;t seem like the customer&#39;s fault (and shouldn&#39;t be the customer&#39;s problem), as long as the customer is being honest and not pulling a fraudulent return.2. &gt; but the Pista has two little screws that you have to remove take the thing apart and when we looked, all of these returned pumps have had those screws unthreaded which you can see as deformation in the screw head, whereas a new in box pump has only had them installed.Does this suggest the manufacturer is using sub-par zinc screws instead of stainless steel?  So many products have cheap screws that basically can&#39;t be removed without stripping or deforming the head, it makes the product unserviceable and dooms it to eventually land in a landfill, prematurely.  Seems unacceptable to call a product top-notch with these kinds of components inside.Fraudulent returns are still bad, as are shoddy products falsely marketed and sold as top-notch gems.3. &gt; Folks think they’re pulling one over on Jeff Bezos but don’t understand Amazon doesn’t own that inventory, it belongs to companies and when you think you’re screwing Amazon you’re actually screwing directly with some smaller company behind the product.This is 100% on Amazon, due to marketing things as &#34;Amazon Prime&#34; and &#34;Sold and Fulfilled by Amazon&#34;.  Nasty, because the customer signals get to be ignored by Amazon as they reap the profits and offload the problem downstream onto Little Companies."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember MySpace being described as &#34;an easy personal website&#34; back in high school.Unfortunately, it&#39;s not easy to make an easy personal website today. Personal sites take so much work to design, and most feel stale because they don&#39;t have dynamic content like posts. About.me used to be great, but it didn&#39;t get maintained.I&#39;m working on a project to make personal websites as easy to set up as a social profile. No designs to pick - just a photo and profile photo. Not static - you have a mailing list and the latest post is shown on the homepage. And, people can &#34;follow&#34; with their emails.Facebook used to be pitched as &#34;the place everybody is&#34;, but that&#39;s no longer true - social networks are getting dis-aggregated. So, I expect personal sites to become a way for people to gain more control over their audiences, and to help move an audience from one platform to another (via a &#34;link in bio&#34; to their personal sites)If you&#39;re interested in trying out my project for your own site:https://postcard.page(Will trade free access for feedback!)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When social networks started taking off, in the spirit of the late 00s there was a push to create standards for distributed social networks so that personal websites could replicate a lot of what social networks did. DiSo is one that comes to mind [1].The fact was...people didn&#39;t care. It made building harder...not easier.I think it&#39;s inevitable. Over time, adoption trends towards easy UX, and open standards almost by their nature lag behind silos in their ability to optimize experience.[1] https://diso-project.org/"</p>

Snapshoting using ZFS is not a feature to discard either.- FIBs, absolute miracle routing tables that you can apply to whatever software, define the routes as fib 1 (lets say it is openvpn) and then use them as simply as `setfib 1 bash` to use them in all child processes- backward compatibility, this is where linux is really horrible, there was an article about compiling binary on freebsd 2 and running it on freebsd 10. Try this on linux, binaries are not compatible even on minor versions.- jails... docker? Really? Jails are 15+ years old implementation, kernel supported, that stood test of time, actually being a security feature. It runs circles around the docker in everything except how much it was adapted by community. I never understood why people rather used an inferior solution like docker.- not to mention all the chaos in linux ecosystem, in next sub-version, the commands can have completely different switches,...I will never understand on what technical merits people are using linux for servers except the support-ability of hardware. Due to the whole show that linux is getting we would prosper as a humanity by ditching the linux. Unfortunately, marketing is worth more than anything.(I do understand that people will not agree due to their preference, but try to use it. I doubt you will prefer linux ever again.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have tried learning FreeBSD occasionally, mostly for nostalgia because I learned Unix on BSD 4.3 (or 4.4?) on MicroVaxes many years ago. But I get stuck on some very basic things:- My wifi card doesn&#39;t work. The installer recognizes it, but the driver doesn&#39;t work.- The console terminal defaults to 80x25, I don&#39;t know how to resize it.- I can&#39;t figure out how to start X Windows.- If I run it in a VM (e.g. VirtualBox), the network bridging doesn&#39;t work so my FreeBSD instance has no internet access.It&#39;s probably my fault, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s in the docs somewhere. But it probably means that I&#39;m not the target audience for FreeBSD, since I don&#39;t have the time and patience to figure out the most basic things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One application where FreeBSD especially shines is as a fileserver to Windows clients: Unlike on Linux, NFSv4 ACLs are supported natively!The NT ACLs used in Windows and SMB are much more expressive than Linux&#39;s POSIX draft ACLs. When a Windows client writes a file to a Linux Samba server, it cannot necessarily express the file&#39;s ACL as a POSIX ACL losslessly. To work around this, Samba&#39;s vfs_acl_xattr saves the &#34;real&#34; ACL as an extended attribute: https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/vfs_acl_xa...This means the ACLs set by clients won&#39;t be enforced for local users on the file server, and that you need special tools to view and edit those ACLs.In contrast, FreeBSD supports NFSv4 ACLs on ZFS, and those are a superset of NT ACLs. Samba saves the NT ACL as an NFSv4 ACL, and this can be viewed or edited using getfacl and setfacl as with any other file on the server."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This one: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19584921 And it wasn&#39;t even my post!A long time ago I found myself teaching Computer Graphics at my alma mater. Over the following years my approach to the subject evolved, and I really got the hang of it. After I stopped teaching, I took my notes, handouts and slides, and made them into a series of articles that I put on my website, where they remained in relative obscurity. Hacker News managed to find it every once in a while, and it was generally well received, but nothing came out of this. Until April 2019, when that post made the HN front page again, except this time it caught the attention of an editor in No Starch Press.Long story short, my materials are now a book, Computer Graphics from Scratch, sold by No Starch Press [0], and also available for free on my website [1].This genuinely wouldn’t have happened without your support. THANK YOU, HN community :)[0] https://nostarch.com/computer-graphics-scratch[1] http://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seven years ago, I started a blog called The Pragmatic Engineer. For three months, I wrote a post every two-three weeks. But no one really read them. So I took a short break, which break turned into a month, then another, another… and I did not have motivation to write. Barely anyone read it, after all.A few months after starting the blog, I saw a small traffic spike - maybe 30 visitors - from this site called Hacker News after a submission [1]. I never heard about HN before but it looked interesting so I started to visit it, and eventually registered to upvote stories I like.Then, another few months later - when I had not published anything for 3-4 months - as I was checking out HN, I could not believe what I saw: a months-old post of mine was on the front page titled “Move Fast Without Breaking Things”. Traffic was so high, my site could barely keep up on shared hosting with MediaTemple, my blog running Wordpress.There were 50+ comments discussing my post, versus the 2 that were on the blog itself (it had a commenting system). The comments were more insightful than I’ve ever seen for any of my blog posts. This was the HN post [2].Now, this post did not “make me money”. But it WAS a turning point where I got validation that strangers on the internet find what I wrote interesting. And it gave me a motivation to write when no one read it, knowing that just because people are not interested in what I wrote today, people might find it interesting months or years later.I kept writing my blog for years. Eventually, this blog served as the basis of The Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter which I launched a year ago, and which is my new fulltime job and one of the most popular technology newsletters with over 120,000 people reading it. More than enough people chose to pay for it to make this a a viable fulltime career on the long run.Thank you, Hacker News, for those first two submissions, all the comments, and the motivation it gave to keep writing. It was a turning point. I still remember how I could barely believe in March 2016 that so many people I never met can be interested in reading thoughts I put in writing.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10692734[2] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11374221"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This one by user tempsy about /r/wallstreetbets from January 2020: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22186392This comment made me aware of the whole options market and leverage. I didn’t know a thing before reading it.I made €500k by betting that the Corona virus will have more impact than the market anticipated in February 2020 and got it right. Which of course, was kinda naive and quite lucky. I totally cannot recommend to play around with options at all."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a clear demonstration of the user&#39;s expectation of search having exceeded what&#39;s possible today.From the article:&gt; Lets look at some examples. One of my favorite places in the world is Koh Lanta, Thailand. When traveling, I’m always on the lookout for places that give off the Koh Lanta vibe. What does that mean? Hard to say, exactly, but having tourist amenities without being touristy. Charming, slow, cheap. I don’t know exactly; if I did, it’d be easier to find. Anyway, forgetting that Google is bad at long tails, I search for what is the koh lanta of croatia? and get:This is a near impossible query for human beings, let alone for computer given the state of the AI at this point in time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a lot of Google hate on HN, and much of it is deserved, but I think this particular trend of blaming Google for the prevalence of useless clickbait articles is a bit much.The real answer to this question is that walled-garden social media took over everything. The much-pined-for &#34;Old Google&#34; worked because people used to actually create content on their own sites, and not just post it on walled garden monolithic social sites like Facebook or Twitter."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; What I dream of is Google circa 2006. A time where a search engine searched what you asked for. A time before aggressive SEO. A time before social media, when the only people on the internet had a reason to be there. A time before sticky headers and full-screen modal pop-ups asking you to subscribe to a newsletter before reading the article. A time before click-bait and subscription-only websites which tease you with a paragraph before blurring out the rest of the content.Well, I built sort of exactly this: https://search.marginalia.nu/It&#39;s not great, but it sure has its moments.Should be noted, regarding Koh Lanta, that travel is one of the most aggressively SEO-spammed topics, along with pharma and online casinos. It&#39;s extremely difficult to cut through the noise and reach any sort of signal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s pretty funny. I work for a company that puts 5 alphanumeric characters on physical devices to track and identify them. We are always putting those 5 characters into various google sheets. And every so often one had an E in the middle of all numbers and google would convert by default to something like &#34;1.10E+34&#34; so we had to make SCIENTIFIC_NUMBER_REGEX = Regex(&#34;\\d+e\\d+&#34;) and stop making codes with E&#39;s in the middle."</p>
