								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s time to have a big talk about transparency.Some of the people who defend the ultra-rich are also the ones who claim to be in favour of free markets. A small bit of economic orthodoxy is that for free markets to work, parties need to be informed (and externalities priced in, but that&#39;s another story). This is not just in terms of &#34;this is the price of bananas&#34; but also in terms of knowing eg what various salaries are, which businesses are profitable, etc.How can we have free markets when we don&#39;t even know who owns what?As for taxation, there needs to be an overhaul. Things need to be simpler, and I say this as someone who has used international tax advisors. There&#39;s no reason the tax guy&#39;s diagram of your business should be more complicated than your own diagram. Moving profits to other countries shouldn&#39;t be possible, or rather, it should be more fixed by the nature of the business than by the desires of the CFO. We simply hear too much about &#34;selling IP rights&#34; to subsidiaries and similar schemes that are clearly meant to lower tax rather than increase revenue. Granted some things will be legitimate, but it&#39;s important that some vague concept of fairness is adhered to. This again goes back to transparency. We invented corporations to help improve society, so we ought to know what kinds of things people are doing with them.Edit:Perhaps the way to see it is, if you say &#34;we make money by selling coffees in the UK&#34; you would expect that entity to report a tax structure that contains a bunch of coffee and UK related entries. Reporting to investors ought to mirror reporting to the taxman."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I see here is tax evasion. But done in a roundabout legal loopholish kind of way.1. Establish profitable company in your home country.2. Establish 2nd company in a tax haven country.3. Give 2nd company some kind of ownership, and then pay rental fees, licensing fees, or simply set up a high interest loan that the 2nd company loaned the first.4. Once you set up a way to make it look like you owe the 2nd company tons of money, now your 1st company no longer is &#34;profitable&#34; and actually in debt losing money, which means it doesn&#39;t need to pay taxes on the massive profit it&#39;s making.While I believe it&#39;s legal it hinges on bad ethical practice. But many large companies do this, such as cruise ships and I think Apple."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve wondered a lot about this with the Snowden and Wikileaks stuff, and I wonder about it with this topic too: the most salient part of this story, and about Panama Papers etc. before it, is how small a dent it seems to make in the discourse, and in the world as a result. At best, these stories get a good chunk of the airwaves for a couple of weeks, and then it&#39;s on to the next thing.In history books, you get a sense sometimes that there were eras in which stuff like this sent people into the streets in rages. In which governments were voted out or overthrown, in which meaningful legislative responses were made. Or, you know, riots.But I look around after reading those books and wonder what makes us so different. It&#39;s weird to live in this era. I read a Guardian article like this and look at the staggering sums, this entire &#34;shadow financial system&#34; devoted solely to one notion: I&#39;m going to take as much as I can, in whatever way that I can, regardless of legality, and I&#39;m going to give nothing back because I sincerely don&#39;t believe I owe anything back -- oh, and I&#39;m going to keep it all a secret.And I look around and not only don&#39;t see any riots; I sometimes get the feeling that people are actually envious, sometimes even respectful of the ingenuity it takes to manufacture these schemes. It&#39;s tough.The only silver lining I can think of is what all the secrecy says: we&#39;re not just doing this in the open because we&#39;re still afraid we&#39;ll end up like the Romanovs if too many of you get angry. I think that while they&#39;re still afraid, there&#39;s still some hope.EDIT: Reading some replies. It&#39;s weird to have to say this to such a smart crowd, but I&#39;m not advocating riots as such; I&#39;m advocating a substantive response. Of course riots are &#34;bad&#34; in some sense, but my observation is really about the odd contrast between the huge size of the &#34;stimulus&#34; (theft of wealth, much of it yours, on a staggering scale) and the tiny size of the &#34;response&#34; (newspaper articles and web forum discussions), especially when contrasted with other historical periods. So while I wouldn&#39;t &#34;want a riot&#34;, seeing one would make me go &#34;well, that makes sense&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m more than willing to believe there&#39;s insider trading, but the data presented at the beginning is not convincing.&gt; Of the 496 trades [Filler has] made since 2014 in Alabama’s ServisFirst Bancshares Inc., where he sits on the board of directors, and Century Bancorp Inc. of Massachusetts, where he’s the largest shareholder, 372 of them, or 75%, have shown a profit three months later.&gt; Besides Filler, other TipRanks stars include Steve Mihaylo, the CEO of telephone services company Crexendo Inc., where he owns a $60 million stake. Mihaylo has turned a three-month profit on 83% of his trades over the past five years even as Crexendo’s shares have seesawed.We&#39;ve also had an unprecedented bull market over the past 10 years. If you pick any random stock at any time and hold it for three months, what are the odds that it will be worth more?The article compares the returns to the S&amp;P500, but that is the net performance of those 500 stocks. You&#39;d have to compare it to the base rate of picking a random stock to see if it&#39;s actually remarkable.Maybe the S&amp;P 500 performed lower because 75% of the stocks in it went up and 25% went down. But that means that if you randomly pick one stock, you&#39;d have a 75% chance of it being one of the ones that went up, and you&#39;d outperform the S&amp;P500. (Well, not quite, maybe it could go up, but not as much as the S&amp;P500 as a whole. But still, most of the stocks that go up, would have to go up more than the average of the whole index in order to compensate for the ones that go down)Later in the article, when they mention that insiders tend to reliably sell stock ahead of bad news, that seems much more damning."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Remember, you can trade stocks without trading stocks.What do I mean? Mark Cuban sold a collar on his Yahoo stock through Goldman for $[I forget] billion dollars. That was an off-market trade in which someone bought his entire block off of him. In today’s world, with tons of low interest (as in, single/double-digit basis points) loans and other fun weird contraptions, you have a lot more options to trade without trading.I have no grand reveal here, but there’s probably an entire “dark dataset” regarding that activity that is missing from this conversation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Eh, kinda. Calling something a &#34;best practice&#34; is basically an appeal to authority. It means, &#34;this is the right way to do things, for reasons I don&#39;t have time to explain.&#34; There are times when that&#39;s appropriate.But really, &#34;best&#34; and &#34;right&#34; are highly situational. Any rule of thumb, even the most basic and uncontroversial, has a situation where it doesn&#39;t apply. I was part of a discussion on a mailing list years ago, where somebody got flamed harshly when he mentioned using a global variable. He then explained that he was working on an embedded control system for cars and all the variables in that system were global. The team was well aware of the pitfalls of global state and used a combination of documentation, static analysis, custom tooling and elaborate testing to mitigate them. It was a considered design choice that made it possible to develop high-performance, hard-realtime software that could run on very limited hardware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The biggest issue I saw with &#34;best practices&#34; in my career is the failure to take into account who it claiming it to be a best practice, and in what context. I saw too many junior developers read a rando blog article, then get a non-technical / semi-technical manager excited about something that made their life easier, even though it was by no means a good practice for the context at hand. Or alternatively, believe some vendor carte blanche when they tell you their product somehow follows a best practice.The overarching problem is that yes, there is software engineering going on in the world, but most organizations are not willing to do engineering. I don&#39;t blame the technical staff - they often have good intentions - but rather the typical business is not willing to pay the cost in time or money to do long-lasting engineering practices. This is one of the things not enough of us think about in our career choices - am I going to a place that practices fire drills or engineering?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; How can Software Engineers call themselves engineers when there’s no rules, governing bodies, or anything to stipulate what true Software Engineering is?We call ourselves software developers in Canada.According to Canadian engineering[1]:
The &#34;practice of engineering&#34; means any act of planning, designing, composing, evaluating, advising, reporting, directing or supervising, or managing any of the foregoing, that requires the application of engineering principles, and that concerns the safeguarding of life, health, property, economic interests, the public welfare, or the environment.To be considered a work of engineering, then, that a piece of software (or a software-intensive system) must meet two conditions:1. The development of the software has required “the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software.”2. There is a reasonable expectation that failure or inappropriate functioning of the system would result in harm to life, health, property, economic interests, the public welfare, or the environment[1] - https://engineerscanada.ca/news-and-events/news/when-softwar..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My father put together a (vacuum tube) Heathkit tape recorder in the late 1950s and made recordings of my great grandparents (on both sides) in 1959 and 1960.  They talked about their lives growing up, how they met, and some of the hardships they endured.  They were probably 35-40 years younger than the gentleman in the video, but they also described a time before automobiles, electricity, radio, and telephones were commonplace.I converted those recordings to MP3 about 15 years ago.It&#39;s amazing how far we&#39;ve come in such a short time."</p>

Sure, you have some experts who can talk about how parts of the algorithm work, you have the underlying bones of page rank, you even have SEO experts who can get you reasonably close to the top search results.But is there a single individual on earth who knows all the ins and outs of all the minutiae of every single aspect of Google search - from search result algorithm to ingestion to crawling to artificial intelligence? Not a chance.You don&#39;t even have to get as complicated as Google search - any reasonably complex software system with hundreds of engineers working on it will be beyond the comprehension of any human being - fully understanding that is (which also entails knowing exactly all the edge cases, all the bugs, all the unexpected results possible, etc.)How does the economy work? Nobody knows - but that doesn&#39;t mean nothing intelligent can be said about it, or that the Fed can&#39;t make reasonable decisions on imperfect information - just like any other incredibly complex system that humans struggle to understand."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the problems with looking at the economy through the lens of inflation is defining &#34;inflation&#34; itself.Consider the Wikipedia definition:&gt; In economics, inflation (or infrequently, price inflation) is a general rise in the price level of an economy over a period of time.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InflationWhat is &#34;the price level of an economy?&#34; How do you measure it? What factors are included and excluded? Why? Who decides?Do we include real estate? Financial assets like stocks and bonds? Or do we stick to things like milk and eggs. Housing? Is that an asset or a consumable?And this happens before we can really talk about what causes inflation to increase or decrease. The problem with most of the discussions of inflation I&#39;ve read and seen is that each side has its own, often implicit, definition of inflation."</p>

This happens more frequently if you drive the GPU with an external monitor. Unfortunately the OS does nothing to notify you of overheating and throttling, which is an insanely stupid oversight by apple.  I only found out because I noticed that the computer ran fine while running the AC, so I installed an app through Brew called &#34;Hot&#34; which tells you temperature and throttling percentage, and confirmed that this was indeed problem.This happens when the room is over 80 degrees Fahrenheit, even when the CPU is at 3% utilization.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Might be similar to the last time this came up (i&#39;m looking for it now, edit: found it[0]) where the developer worked with a sizable development-for-hire firm that were themselves associated with many other dev accounts, some of which ended up being suspended for ToS violations (possibly by this firm, possibly by the customer without the firm&#39;s knowledge). The anti-ban-evasion technology Google runs then effectively poisoned this firm&#39;s Play developer profile so that anyone working with them would be suspended for the potential ban evasion, eventually.Note that, for this specific case, it might not be a firm but one of the developers themselves that has a poisoned account thanks to past dealings that violated ToS. I imagine the system only banning by associate if the $25 developer account itself ever uploads an app so that it doesn&#39;t ban associated Google accounts for non-play-developer purposes.0: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19124324 (comment explaining https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19124463 )"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Parallelism with the computing units in GPU permeates the entire computing model.  For the longest time I don&#39;t get how partial derivative instructions like dFdx/dFdy/ddx/ddy work.  None of the doc helps.  These instructions take in a number and return its partial derivative, just a generic number, nothing to do with graphic, geometry or function.  The number could have been the dollar amount of a mortgage and its partial derivative is returned.It turns out these functions tied to how the GPU architecture runs the computing units in parallel.  The computing units are arranged to run in parallel in a geometric grid according to the input data model.  The computing units run the same program in LOCK STEP in parallel (well at least in lock step upon arriving at the dFdx/dFdy instructions).  They also know their neighbors in the grid.  When a computing unit encounters a dFdx instruction, it reaches across and grabs its neighbors&#39; input value to their dFdx instructions.  All the neighbors arrive at dFdx at the same time with their input value ready.  With the neighbors&#39; numbers and its own number as the mid point, it can compute the partial derivative using gradient slope."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Many people are seeing all these different vendor specific CPUs as a win. I&#39;m a bit more skeptical, but perhaps that it unwarranted.But Apple, Google, and Amazon are now creating their own ARM CPUs for their own products. So most of FAANG, all if you count the ones with consumer products.The first version of these CPUs will be very ARM compatible, as they are trying to drive adoption to of their silicon. Once there get a leg up they will start adding patented operation to their stuff. And then we&#39;ll end up with a fragmented CPU field driven by corporate greed.And because they are not OEMing this hardware, they really have no incentive to be cooperative with the others. Similar to older gaming console that had custom and experimental architectures.However it is obvious why this is all happening. And that is Intel and Qualcomm inhibited growth and squeezed too much profit from the market."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The question I have around Google&#39;s CPU ambitions is what their end game is.I understand Apple&#39;s end game. They sold lots of iPhones and wanted to in-house the chips for that. Makes sense. Once they had that working well (and Intel was falling behind on their chips), they decided to put in-house chips in their macOS computers. Makes sense.AWS rents more CPU time than anyone out there. Makes sense for them to want to develop some custom chips for their stuff.What&#39;s Google&#39;s end game? They don&#39;t actually sell a lot of chips. I&#39;d understand them wanting to create a server chip, but they seem to be targeting phones and laptops. Is Google looking to become a major player in Android hardware? I like the Pixel phones, but they&#39;re a very small part of the market. Chromebooks are usually built by companies like HP and Acer, not Google directly.The article says that Google&#39;s Pixel sold 7M units in 2019 (their highest year) and they&#39;re looking for 50% more than that (so 10.5M) for the Pixel 6. In 2019, Apple shipped 215M iPhones (over 30x the Pixel). Is Google looking to make the Pixel a much larger part of the Android ecosystem? Are they looking to compete directly with HP, Acer, and others in the Chromebook market?I guess I wonder what the end-goal is here. Maybe the premium on Qualcomm&#39;s Snapdragon chips is so high that they&#39;d rather make their own. Maybe they want to become the primary hardware vendor in the Android ecosystem - or at least a much larger one. But Google never seems to push its own hardware aggressively so it&#39;s a bit curious."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hope so. I had a Google Pixelbook, and with the Linux container support (aka Crostini) it was an ideal developer laptop, especially as the Linux support improved over time. I was worried they were going to drop it as the Pixel Slate is much more of a consumer device.Would love to see another Pixelbook with great performance and stability for Linux apps."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m a “true believer” in CRDTs, which I have some experience in. You can implement a useful CRDT for simple applications in under 100 lines if all you care about are standard database objects - like maps, sets and values. List CRDTs are where they get complicated, but most applications aren’t collaborative text editors.The promise of CRDTs is that unlike most conflict resolution systems, you can layer over a crdt library and basically ignore all the implantation details. Applications should (can) mostly ignore how a CRDT works when building up the stack.The biggest roadblock to their use is that they’re poorly understood. Well, that and implementation maturity. Automerge-rs merged a PR the other day which brought a 5 minute benchmark run down to 2 seconds. But by bit we’re getting there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Its a good article but it should be noted that this very much is a web-centric view of Offline First and its challenges. When I say web-centric, I mean as opposed to offline-first on a mobile app.Native apps dont deal with the same issues around storage, and are actually _much_ more performant overall. If you haven&#39;t done an offline-first app, I highly recommend it. The experience is magical. You can fly around your app at the speed of the users touch. Content is magically loaded as soon as its clicked on. Its amazing as a user.As for similarities, conflict resolution is a universal problem and is either the most difficult or second most difficult problem [1] to solve. What makes this more difficult is that there is no one-size-fits-all for this. You need to have a deep, nuanced understanding of your system and what makes sense for your use case in terms of resolution strategies. Then you need to implement them, which is not easy especially if your backend is bog-standard REST on a classic SQL datastore.I&#39;ve enjoyed reading the past 2 rxdb articles on this (the one mentioned here as well as the one from a couple days ago [2]). Its great to have more content on this publicly available, when I was getting into offline-first I only had a couple options.[1] - At the end of the day, offline-first is a whole bunch of caching, and so you end up needing to deep dive into cache invalidation strategies which we all know is a hairy problem.[2] - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28690427"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been working on offline-first apps (CouchDB/PouchDB + Cordova/Capacitor and published via App/Play Store) in the last years and can definitely relate. But some points to add:- The 7 days IDB limitation does not apply for apps that are published through the stores- Conflicts can happen, but depending on your design they might not matter in practise. „Implement a proper conflict resulution strategy“ has been on my „todo: maybe“ list for over 3 years now but was never important enough.- Data migration is not needed as long as schema changes are additive (new doc fields, new doc types). Design carefully early on, keep track of „abandoned“ properties and you&#39;ll rarely need a difficult migration.- Depending on the performance of your customers&#39; phones and the amount of data your app is processing, it (JS -&gt; ... -&gt; IDB and back) might not be fast enough. I had to add caching layers for some use cases. But at some point, you probably want a proper state management library anyways which should include caching nearly for free.- You can (and should!) still consider most of your data relational. There is even a relational-pouch plugin. But I&#39;m strongly missing foreign key constraints and better DB-level data validation than CouchDB&#39;s design docs provide."</p>

SBCL is amazing and aside from calling C directly, it is still very fast. Python is slow without its specialized libraries from the C-world, but SBCL produces short, readable code that is pretty efficient. There ECL[2] for an embedded Lisp, or uLisp[32] for really small processors like the ESP chips.[1]  http://lush.sourceforge.net/

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I write Clojure for food, and Common Lisp for fun. One reason for the latter is CL&#39;s speed -- awhile back I compared a bit of (non-optimized) Clojure code I wrote for a blog post with a rough equivalent in CL, and was stunned that the Common Lisp code ran about 10x faster.  This made me curious as to how fast it could be made if I really tried, and was able to get nearly 30x more[1] by optimizing it.Clojure is definitely fast enough for everything I&#39;ve done professionally for six years.  But Common Lisp, while having plenty of rough edges, intrigues on the basis of performance alone.  (This is on SBCL -- I have yet to play with a commercial implementation.)[1] http://johnj.com/from-elegance-to-speed.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I miss my common lisp days, and I think rust being able to export C ABIs makes it a really great companion language for CL. I also think common lisp (or really, any fast lisp) is a really great tool for game development. The fact that you can redefine a program as it&#39;s running really helps iterate without having to set up your state over and over. Pair that with a fast, low-level language that can handle a lot of the lower level stuff (been trying to find time to look at Bevy on rust), and you have a killer combo.The main reason I stopped using lisp was because of the community. There were some amazing people that helped out with a lot of the stuff I was building, but not a critical mass of them and things just kind of stagnated. Then it seemed like for every project I poured my soul into, someone would write a one-off copy of it &#34;just because&#34; instead of contributing. It&#39;s definitely a culture of lone-wolf programmers.CL is a decent language with some really good implementations, and everywhere I go I miss the macros. I definitely want to pick it up again sometime, but probably will just let the async stuff I used to work on rest in peace."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Supervisory managers brandishing Agile + endless meetingsPersonally for me - this led to burnout and I have quit last two jobs that used Agile faster than I have the 2 before that didn&#39;t use Agile. Agile is very clearly being misused to turn developers into factory line workers whose productivity can be measured by number of commits, reviews and docs they put out every two weeks. And the meetings it takes to do Sprint planning, stand-ups, reviews, demos, retros are really killing any possibility of developers having a flow of uninterrupted time to do what they need to.And the burnout article linked in the OP makes a great point about inputs to development teams not being measured. At some places developers are left to spec out stories and others have Architects / Tech Leads do it - in either case that in itself is a large chunk of work that takes up huge amount of time that no one is rewarded for in any way!Mostly though keeping the churn going is what gets really tiring - do most orgs have work that a) needs to be done every two weeks and b) can be done in two weeks perpetually? The pressure leads to manufacturing bite sized requirements that can be demoed in two weeks - the real impact of that work is almost always never evaluated. Combine this pressure with time crunch that prevents people from spending quality time together to ponder bigger, high impact problems and collaborate on solving those within the meeting heavy Agile process and you are never going to get anything meaningful done.This is not to say Agile itself is bad - it takes effort and skill to use it effectively but managers seem to be taking the easy way out to create a factory line kind of setup where random requirements keep getting thrown and every two weeks you are supposed to roll out _a_ solution. The trouble is software / IT is not at all like rolling cars out on a factory line so it all falls apart.Edit: By Agile I meant Scrum really."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reads to me as yet another screed by someone who has never worked outside the tech industry. Software Engineering is IMO the best, most privileged job available in the US, and I suspect in much of the world. Life-long tech workers have no idea how much worse conditions are even for “knowledge workers” in other fields.Case in point, when we get a tired of the office grind we can publish a manifesto that slams tons of people we’ve worked with in the past (with no fear of consequences from those burned bridges), move to a resort wherever we want, and still expect to either make great pay with benefits while fully remote, or realistically start our own business with a great chance of success (and can easily raise funding to defray the risk if we want to).I’m grateful to work in software. It’s a wonderful thing that we have so much privilege. And so of course, at a time when the world has been quite stirred up and most of our lives affected, it’s great to see many engineers have the freedom to change jobs to fit their lives better, and that they’re exercising that freedom.But could we observe and write about all that without the anger and entitlement? For anyone who has worked in other fields, or even less in-demand jobs in tech, it just comes across as whiny and out of touch."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree this is a phenomenon right now, but I feel that article is vastly overcomplicating it, and not necessarily accurately.I&#39;d suggest simply:- software engineers are hugely in demand- software engineers have worked out they can work well remotely, and often prefer it for a combination of productivity and work/life balance reasons- software engineers are voting with their feet and finding work that suits their needs - and many firms are losing talent accordingly due to not meeting the needs of those staff"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The date of the video is the most impressive to me here. It says “Sept. 30, 2021” both as the date of the article and the date of the video. If this is not a mistake that means they managed to deliver the video from the hurricane to the internet in less than 24 hours.Why is this impressive? Either they beamed it out through satelites, which is notoriously hard from an unstable platform on big waves, or they recovered the saildrone and obtained the footage directly which is equally impressive in or around a hurricane.All around if the dating of the footage is correct it is very impressive to me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Coinbase made everyone whole, and the attackers stole the credentials (not because of Coinbase&#39;s fault) ahead of time, and the attackers had to perform a &#34;SIM swap&#34; type attack on the users. &#34;Breach&#34; may be the required term for the Californian government, but this wouldn&#39;t qualify to most people as a traditional breach (i.e., compromise of Coinbase&#39;s infrastructure).Edit: California, not Canada. My bad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;&#34;We will be depositing funds into your account equal to the value of the currency improperly removed from your account at the time of the incident. Some customers have already been reimbursed -- we will ensure all customers affected receive the full value of what you lost. You should see this reflected in your account no later than today.&#34;I sympathize with the &#34;Not your keys, not your coins&#34; crowd, but you have to admit that you are far more likely to be compensated in the event of an attack if you are using a large exchange. Not guaranteed, of course, but Coinbase has an image to maintain.I also believe, personally, that a large exchange has much better security than anything I could muster with a hot wallet. Yes, I know I can airgap a cold wallet but I like the ability to quickly sell some amount of crypto at market rates without having to transfer from a paper wallet. I also worry about physical security since my home has been burglarized before. Therefore, I keep my coins on exchanges and follow good practices with 2FA across my accounts (no SMS for any) and have withdrawal delays / whitelisting active."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this reflects very favorably on Coinbase. They&#39;re making everyone whole, and gosh - the attackers had the user&#39;s usernames, passwords and phone numbers. Hard not to be sympathetic to Coinbase in that scenario. How are they supposed to know those aren&#39;t the real users? Consider that if they are going to identify those cases as fraudulent actors, then they could easily lock-out legitimate users as well.I&#39;ll guess the users had the same usernames and passwords that they&#39;ve used for a hundred other sites, and one of those got breached at some point. Don&#39;t do that!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very interesting read. This seems to be implemented as a Bluetooth LE app running on the ultra-low power “always on processor” used for a variety of features, like “wake-up on motion.”Much like an Tile or AirTag is implemented. No comment on what this is capable in the future.. but for now this shows power usage / signal strength / proximity of other “actually on” devices are a limitations of this feature.What’s impressive is the mesh network effect of all these iPhones / iDevices to locate a “lost” device. I’ll be thankful if I manage to use this to retrieve a lost phone. I’ll be pretty shocked if I’m “spied on” with this style of device."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In some way this feature reminded me of Android&#39;s song detection functionality which is also on by default and is constantly listening in the background [1].So now tech companies normalized that:- the mic is always on.- the phone is always on, even when it&#39;s off. (thanks to AOP)- devices are always online even when they are offline.(thanks to company-operated p2p networks like Find My or Sidewalk)What could possibly go wrong?https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7535326?hl=en"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article is wrong about AOP being on while the phone is off. AOP is on while the phone is in standby. It powers down when you shut down the phone. Its job is to save battery by doing things like the Hey Siri and sensors processing without powering up the main cores at all. It does not stay on when the system is shut down.The part about the Bluetooth chipset staying on is correct. Think about it, why would they need the AOP when the Bluetooth chipset can run that applet autonomously and send the beacons?Nothing is listening to your mics while the phone is off. The stuff that runs while the phone is off is rather limited. Mostly things related to the NFC chipset, to support payment and transport applications while the battery is dead (which is a requirement of some of those systems) and, as we just saw, Bluetooth LE features."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wish we responded to situations more proportionally.In this case, someone made a joke about women not liking to reveal their true age as they get older. It&#39;s a boring cliched joke. Something I&#39;ve heard too many times in my life (and, most often from women). Is it sexist? I can see the argument. Is it professional to make such a joke on a ruby mailing list? I don&#39;t know, perhaps not.Does it warrant responses like &#34;Knock that bullshit off.&#34; or &#34;you made an ass of yourself&#34;... I don&#39;t know. Seems a little ironic to use unprofessional language in this situation. Maybe even worse than the joke itself? I don&#39;t know.Then, folks take the discussion to github and twitter (and, eventually reddit and hn). Presenting only their verdict: &#34;A newer member made a sexist joke, and was called out on it as being inappropriate.&#34; No links to the joke. No evidence that the joke is sexist. This makes it so much easier to imagine something really bad. No, we just get a verdict and we should all rise up against this sexism (which absolutely is bad, of course). Let&#39;s get our pitchforks. This amplifies one side of the argument and shuts down any useful conversation. Worse, it&#39;s used to rush through a CoC change without allowing any thoughtful discussion.Is this reaction proportional to the original joke? Is the reaction itself exemplar of how we would like to conduct ourselves?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Almost more surprising is that this was removed:&gt; When interpreting the words and actions of others, participants should always assume good intentions.In favor of this:&gt; Participants should speak and act with good intentions, but understand that intent and impact are not equivalent.Also changed yesterday:&gt; Behaviour which can be reasonably considered harassment will not be tolerated.became:&gt; Behaviour which can be considered harassment against protected classes will not be tolerated.The updated CoC is here: https://github.com/ruby/www.ruby-lang.org/blob/master/en/con...This is very weird because fundamentally it stems from a failure of the moderators. If someone makes a sexist joke you don&#39;t just let them because you&#39;re &#34;assuming good intentions&#34;, that clause means that you tell them it&#39;s not appropriate here, and if they apologize you assume they are sincere, and if they don&#39;t you swiftly boot them. But there is no substitute for good moderation, shifting words around won&#39;t help much.Aside: Open source discussion opening with &#34;My rationale for these changes are documented on Twitter: [link]&#34; also seems somewhat crazy. And I love Twitter, it just seems very odd to link to a thread of tweets instead of restating your case in the proper medium."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I realize CoCs were introduced to make certain supposedly marginalized groups more at home at conferences.  But my personal experience/feeling is the complete reverse.  I am a member of a minority as a person with a disability.  In all the years I was interacting with the community, I haven&#39;t had a single issue with someone I couldn&#39;t handle myself.  I never felt uneasy interacting with others.  But the day I saw the first CoC being used in a community I was interacting with, I started to feel uneasy.  I cant really say why, but I feel I dont want to interact with groups which need rules like these.  I also stopped going to conferences.  Gosh, I am even glad I didnt go to the DebConf where they invited Linus only to realize later that they are very unhappy with his speaking style.  I would have felt too much shame for being a part of such a group of hyprocrits."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"These changes look fantastic.If I may hijack the thread with some more general complaints though, I wish the Postgres team would someday prioritize migration. Like make it easier to make all kinds of DB changes on a live DB, make it easier to upgrade between postgres versions with zero (or low) downtime, etc etc.Warnings when the migration you&#39;re about to do is likely to take ages because for some reason it&#39;s going to lock the entire table, instant column aliases to make renames easier, instant column aliases with runtime typecasts to make type migrations easier, etc etc etc. All this stuff is currently extremely painful for, afaict, no good reason (other than &#34;nobody coded it&#34;, which is of course a great reason in OSS land).I feel like there&#39;s a certain level of stockholm syndrome in the sense that to PG experts, these things aren&#39;t that painful anymore because they know all the pitfalls and gotchas and it&#39;s part of why they&#39;re such valued engineers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"PostgreSQL is one of the most powerful and reliable pieces of software I&#39;ve seen run at large scale, major kudos to all the maintainers for the improvements that keep being added.&gt; PostgreSQL 14 extends its performance gains to the vacuuming system, including optimizations for reducing overhead from B-Trees. This release also adds a vacuum &#34;emergency mode&#34; that is designed to prevent transaction ID wraparoundDealing with transaction ID wraparounds in Postgres was one of the most daunting but fun experiences for me as a young SRE. Each time a transaction modifies rows in a PG database, it increments the transaction ID counter. This counter is stored as a 32-bit integer and it&#39;s critical to the MVCC transaction semantics - a transaction with a higher ID should not be visible to a transaction with a lower ID. If the value hits 2 billion and wraps around, disaster strikes as past transactions now appear to be in the future. If PG detects it is reaching that point, it complains loudly and eventually stops further writes to the database to prevent data loss.Postgres avoids getting anywhere close to this situation in almost all deployments by performing routine &#34;auto-vacuums&#34; which mark old row versions as &#34;frozen&#34; so they are no longer using up transaction ID slots. However, there are a couple situations where vacuum will not be able to clean up enough row versions. In our case, this was due to long-running transactions that consumed IDs but never finished. Also it is possible but highly inadvisable to disable auto-vacuums. Here is a postmortem from Sentry who had to deal with this leading to downtime: https://blog.sentry.io/2015/07/23/transaction-id-wraparound-...It looks like the new vacuum &#34;emergency mode&#34; functionality starts vacuuming more aggressively when getting closer to the wraparound event, and as with every PG feature highly granular settings are exposed to tweak this behaviour (https://www.postgresql.org/about/featurematrix/detail/360/)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One tip I have to make large-ish awk programs readable is to name the columns in the BEGIN section. Then, you&#39;d use $colname instead of $1, $2, etc. for instance:BEGIN{
     item_type = 1;
     item_name = 2;
     price = 3;
     sale = 4;
     #etc
}Now, in place of $1, you&#39;d say $item_type which significantly improves overall readability of the code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thanks for sharing this. I&#39;m the author.When I wrote my introduction to JQ someone mentioned JQ was tricky but super-useful like AWK. I nodded along with this, but actually, I had no idea how Awk worked.So I learned how it worked and wrote this up. It is a bit long, but if you don&#39;t know Awk that well, or at all, I think it should get the basics across to you by going step by step through examining the book reviews for The Hunger Games trilogy.Let me know what you think. And also let me know if you have any interesting Awk one-liners to share."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of great AWK tutorials in here that are more in depth, but I&#39;ll share another. I always go back to Brian Kernighan&#39;s personal help file:https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring19/cos333...Brian Kernighan has a knack for explaining languages very precisely and elegantly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In 2017 Cloudflare had an HTML parser bug that caused encrypted HTTP traffic to be leaked. Any website served by Cloudflare was vulnerable to having all of its traffic leaked into the HTML body response of the website that Cloudflare proxied. Given that Cloudflare is the proxy service for 80% of websites that use proxies, this affected a significant portion of the internet.Cloudflare served private HTTP traffic in response bodies, meaning that website results contained cookies, session data, encrypted traffic, all personally identifiable, and because it was served as response bodies, it was *indexed by search engines*, not to mention anyone else who was scraping websites during the time of the incident. It included credit card information, frames from videos, PII, the works, all linked to individual users.This was ongoing for *months.*Anyone savvy could use this information to hijack accounts, scrape personal information, view private browsing habits. Even when Cloudflare publicly announced it (and tried to blame others) when they thought they had cleaned up most of the data, you could still easily use search engines to find people&#39;s personal information by searching for the Cloudflare header strings that started the leaked session information.Many countries have legal policies around data breaches, including required disclosure policies and penalties. In the greatest blind eye turn of the history of the internet, Cloudflare managed to get away with a single blog post, and no other penalties. https://blog.cloudflare.com/incident-report-on-memory-leak-c...THAT is Cloudflare&#39;s disruption."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;More importantly, AWS itself is locked-in to its integrated approach: the entire service is architected both technically and economically to be an all-encompassing offering; to modularize itself in response to Cloudflare would be suicidal.&#34;Eh, somewhat. AWS is already modular in a lot of ways. You want S3? You got it, no matter where you are. (We&#39;re talking after them doing some sort of fee drop here.) You want to run exactly one EC2 instance? No problem. You want a message queue? You don&#39;t need anything else. You can integrate it with the notification service but it&#39;s optional.Sure, some of their services are integrated, but a lot of that integration is just &#34;this service pulls from S3 and writes to S3&#34;, not massive integration at every level.There is some stuff that is deeply tied in, yeah. But it&#39;s not like every single AWS service is deeply tied into half the other ones and the moment you open an EC2 instance you also are buying into a dozen other services. (It may feel like it if you put together a network and override the default block storage, but that&#39;s really just giving you knobs that are simply preset elsewhere, not really &#34;lockin&#34;.) A lot of it is already pretty modular."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cloudflare is truly amazing.They almost compete with everyone now.DNS: They eat simpledns lunch
Pages: They eat Netlify lunch
Worker: They eat serverless/lambda as in AWS/GCP lunch
R2: They eat AWS LunchAnd finallyEmail Forwarding: They eat ... my own lunch (I&#39;m founder of hanami.run an email forwarding service)That&#39;s being said, from a user perspective, if my domain is already on CloudFlare, I can just host everything on it.Right now, cloudflare workers is pretty great to add some dynamic stuff. And pages is great for static site."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It seems like a lot of people here have been in an ineffective large organisation and an effective startup. I&#39;ve worked at an effective large organisation and an ineffective startup, so perhaps I can shed some light on what these kind of processes are for:* You don&#39;t get to be a large organisation without accumulating generations of previous products. Well, unless you&#39;re google and can regularly fire your customers without going bust. but part from them, you start to need processes just to track what&#39;s going on. (The  ineffective startup accumulated previous product attempts too, and is still paying  for a lot of pointless infra because no-one still there knows which ones can be switched off).* At a large scale, it starts to be pretty difficult to maneuver if each dept of 30-50 people has built or contracted all their own infra &amp; services. Some divergence is useful for agility, but a lot of it is just waste and actually slows you down when you want two depts to work together on something - or even prevents useful collaboration. An effective organisation will make the tradeoff consciously.* When you complete dozens of projects per year, it starts to be possible to invest in researching and rolling out best practices in areas where a startup just has to go with the simple/obvious answer.  When my startup employer moved, it was pretty onerous, and there was a bunch of stuff we never found again. The large org had so many offices that it had a full time dept just for moving offices. (They weren&#39;t dumb, each move consolidated offices -but they kept buying other companies). When they moved us, it was like magic - we went home on a friday and went to work on a monday in the new office, and everything was set up. Well, we had to set up the lab ourselves, but"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s hard because it&#39;s meant to be hard.Once you have a large org that&#39;s making money, you don&#39;t really know exactly why it makes money. Sure, there&#39;s annual filings and there&#39;s still the elevator pitch of what the org does. But the actual how of how it works is difficult to describe in causal terms: if team X or Y was not there, the business would do better/worse? How does this team interact with that? It&#39;s really a bunch of informal relationships between different people, and both the people and the relationships change over time.So what you want to do when you know the whole sorta-works and you want to keep it that way is you pour glue all over it. You try to formalize processes, you give people titles and you make hierarchies. That way you attempt to stop the firm from inadvertently slipping into dysfunction.The side effect is of course that everyone who works there can see ways to improve things, but they can&#39;t see a way to get those improvements implemented."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Big mistake in the article to claim that a single engineer could build Amazon, Facebook, or Google. Amazon is the most egregious.&gt; . A software developer could write a simple e-commerce website in a few days; Amazon employs 1,335,000 people [source].Those 1.4 million people are not coding the e-commerce app but making e-commerce happen as package handlers, drivers, finance teams, etc. on top of that Amazon has many non e-commerce related projects: building hardware (Kindles, Alexa, etc) , AWS and support, and on and on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Cloudflare will charge per request over a certain threshold, like S3 does for API calls, so it won’t be just 13 cents depending on the rate of requests coming in.“R2 will zero-rate infrequent storage operations under a threshold — currently planned to be in the single digit requests per second range. Above this range, R2 will charge significantly less per-operation than the major providers. Our object storage will be extremely inexpensive for infrequent access and yet capable of and cheaper than major incumbent providers at scale.”Source: https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-r2-object-storage/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Now let’s remember that the internet is 1-to-many. If 1 million people download that 1GB this month, my cost with 
@cloudflare R2 this way rounds up to 13¢. With @awscloud S3 it’s $59,247.52.&#34;When I first saw this, my thought was it&#39;s highly misleading since you&#39;d normally be fronting S3 with a CDN, so you&#39;d only have to pay once to transfer a given resource every few days/weeks/months if the CDN is doing its job, and it can be served to millions of people at no or low cost (already been free on Cloudflare for a long time).Then I came to my senses and realised there&#39;s probably orgs who don&#39;t know/care about that and they&#39;re actually paying these fees for every request.Anyway, it&#39;s excellent to see this released. S3 is not just more expensive and tied to a single data centre. It&#39;s also bad DX, e.g. setting up permissions is way too complicated and the console is &#34;brutalist&#34; in both look and function. I hope this spurs some more competition in the area of storage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s amazing how much conversation Cloudflare has created with this without even releasing the product yet.I can&#39;t remember the last time there was this much interest in a new product launch - which gives an indication to the market need for pricing changes on this front. However, AWS re:invent is right around the corner and I suspect this will cause an announcement or two to come from the AWS side."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One important part of the chip shortage is the massive amount of price gouging going on.Every IC is being bought up by new 3rd party distributors to scalp to desperate electronics manufacturers.Take a look at this chip we are just now crossing as an example, click on &#39;Non-authorized stocking distributors&#39;:https://octopart.com/tps2052bdgnr-texas+instruments-699312?r...Win Source has a bunch, but you will pay 6x the cost. We have been quoted even 100x the list price for some ICs on our boards.Luckily as a small company we are nimble and can mostly cross to similar components, and have been for months now, but a whole board assembly run can be stopped with a single component being impossible to find out of hundreds on the BOM.Having scalpers in the mix raising the price for all components worries me that the chip shortage might not end for many years, as they can self-fund by raising their prices to stock up on new supply. Not to mention the higher number of random failures as counterfeits easily find their way into the supply chain without &#39;authorized&#39; distributors."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I&#39;ll never understand is why carmakers don&#39;t take advantage of this situation and address a market that&#39;s been literally BEGGING for decades for a new product:A simple, basic car, with the ONLY electronic control being for:- Valve timing
 - Fuel injection
 - Oxygen and throttle
 - EmissionsThere&#39;s a market for budget and privacy oriented customers that all carmakers seem to have ignored for two decades now. Give us a simple car with no GPS navigation, ass warmers, tire pressure sensors, telemetry, backup cameras, USB chargers, proximity detectors, traction control, keyless entry, remote climate control, etc.But instead of addressing this market, these carmakers have decided to throw up their hands and shut down production or pile up unfinished inventory waiting on chips. It makes precisely zero sense.I understand the re-engineering is a cost. But when you&#39;re simply removing existing features, this should be a fairly negligible one.edit: I wasn&#39;t aware any of these luxury features were mandated by governments.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I am not mistaken, Amplitude was the very first SV startup coming up with the idea of the 10-year post-termination exercise window, talked to lawyers who said it cannot be done, persisted and did it anyway late 2015, then open-sourced the approach for others to follow [1].Triplebyte made a splash by adopting a very similar policy months later in early 2016 (also discussed heavily on HN [2]) and all YC companies were recommended to adopt this approach off the back of Triplebyte starting from the W16 batch [3]. The rest, as they say, is history.Many companies on this extensive list of ones with 10-year post-terminiation exercie windows [4] might not have this policy if it was not for this know-how benefitting employees put out in the open - between Amplitude, Triplebyte and it spreading to YC, making this approach table stakes a few years later.Sir, I salute your for doing this not just for doing this for Amplitude employees (who no longer had a &#34;golden handcuff pressure&#34; after vesting their original grant - which is most companies actually see as a benefit, and a way to &#34;leak&#34; less equity thanks to leavers often not being able to exercise), but for a part in moving the tech industry forward.Legend![1] https://amplitude.com/blog/employee-equity-is-broken-heres-o...[2] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11198991[3] https://triplebyte.com/blog/fixing-the-inequity-of-startup-e...[4] https://github.com/holman/extended-exercise-windows"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"NFT always felt ridiculous to me, but I though I understood the mechanism: &#34;it&#39;s like baseball cards but in the blockchain&#34;.This week I learned it&#39;s not.NFT are Non Fungible Tokens, which means tokens that can&#39;t be divided, unlike crypto currencies like Bitcoin that can be divided in Satoshis. So you exchange the totality of it, or not. Basically it&#39;s a unique number in the blockchain you change ownership by applying cryptographic signatures during a transaction. Most of the time it&#39;s an ethereum smart contract address + a token id.But wait, where are the pics ? The gifs ? The videos ?I mean, opensea.io does allow you to mint (the term for magically turning a media into an official NFT backed by the blockchain) up to 100MB of content.So where is it? Not in the blockchain, obviously, it&#39;s already fat enough with tiny transaction data.Well, it&#39;s just stored in the centralized platforms like opensea, rarible, etc.Basically, the NFT is not even that piece of art, baseball card or whatever, it&#39;s just the number linked to the proprietary, centralized, privately own trading platform that hosts the content.The platform disappears, or bans you, or changes policy, or is blocked, or whatever, and your NFT is back to being a bare-bone blockchain contract number and a token id.It&#39;s even more bullshit that I though! You don&#39;t even have control on whatever you make believe to virtually own. It&#39;s madness.But you know what, the week I spent in this weird universe was also so much fun. There is an atmosphere of creative WTF, a mix of scams, community bonding, money laundering and genuine experimentation all bathed in some frenetic craziness that reminds me of the early days of the internet.Despite all that crap, I kinda like it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There’s a lot of confusion here about why NFTs are valuable if the buyer doesn’t get to own the image copyright. This should not feel mysterious - NFTs are just like baseball cards.If you buy a Barry Bonds baseball card for $1,000, you don’t own the artistic rights to the image on the card. All you own is the card itself, which has negligible manufacturing cost. It would be trivial for any card company to produce a million functionally equivalent Barry Bonds cards.When you buy a Barry Bonds baseball card, you hope that the card company won’t dump a million more on the market. You also hope that if another baseball card company springs up and prints their own Barry Bonds cards, people won’t be as interested in that brand of cards. Attention and scarcity drive value; the nuance is that other speculators must care about scarcity along the same dimension that you possess it (in this case: the brand of the baseball card company and the year the card was made). There are a hundred tokens functionally equivalent to Bitcoin, but none approach Bitcoin’s value - purely because Bitcoin sustains more consumer and media attention. This position is fairly stable because attention has strong positive feedback loops.There has always been interest in speculative collectibles. A purely digital collectible solves a lot of practical problems related to exchange: you don’t have to wait a week to receive the item in the mail, you don’t have to worry about its condition because it does not degrade with time or use, there is minimal counterparty risk due to online escrow contracts, and counterfeits are harder to fake (along the relevant dimension of scarcity, which is the origin address).People have been speculating on collectibles for thousands of years. Crypto just makes it easier to trade them back and forth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ok, let&#39;s see if I&#39;m following the discussion right. let&#39;s say you buy an NFT for using a GIF of the Techno Viking, from the Viking himself, and Reddit verifies it. Now you are the only person on Reddit that can have a Techno Viking GIF signature, yippee! Except I can make a new NFT of the same GIF and nothing in the NFT itself betrays that it wasn&#39;t issued by the real Techno Viking, so it&#39;s up to him, Reddit and you to call me out and reach for old school copyright laws to stop me from using it. Which is no different than me uploading a Techno Viking video to YouTube and getting sued by him or flagged by YouTube, is it?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The containership industry is a good illustration of the supply chain mess: as shown in the first chart, more than 70 containerships are stacked up outside Los Angeles/Long Beach ports waiting to unload. Idle containerships are back to just 3% of the total fleet, shipping costs are surging, manufacturing delivery times are extended and rail shipments are declining sharply from their summer peak, illustrating the far reaching impact of the delays.I&#39;m surprised that the article doesn&#39;t take up what happens when that logjam eventually clears.At some point those ships will clear out of LA and there will be no more pile up. All the goods will have been distributed. Meanwhile, the world&#39;s container ship capacity will have increased by some large factor (30%, 50%) to address the shortage.Fast forward 1-2 years and we have a world that&#39;s a mirror image of today&#39;s: surplus everything. Too much oil. Too much container ship capacity. Too many semiconductors. Too many employees.It&#39;s not like COVID increased overall world demand relative to 2019. Rather, it created a log jam getting everything back to normal.The current action in Washington DC around the budget sets the stage for rollback of the massive government transfers and deficit spending of the last 18 months. Eventually, those evictions will happen. Eventually.Demand shocks can work both ways."</p>

This article openly and unequivocally advocates for human misery and death in order to avoid upward pressure on wages."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; For all the clients that have asked me about the political and economic problems associated with the rise of autonomous vehicles and more unemployed truckers, I keep telling them they’ve got it backwards: the US has had a trucker shortage for the last few years, and it’s projected to get worse.In addition to the need to point out that &#34;shortage&#34; just means &#34;I don&#39;t want to pay market rate&#34;, a shortage of truck drivers does not negate the concern of automation causing mass unemployment of truckers.The concern is that the 450,000 truckers will lose their jobs. &#34;We want to have 500,000 truckers who would lose their jobs&#34; doesn&#39;t addresses that issue.To be clear, I&#39;m still very much in favor of automation, but people aren&#39;t &#34;getting it backwards&#34; here. These are two different problems."</p>

Talking to my doctor is what did it for me. He cleared up most of my concerns and pressed me that my remaining concerns were too nebulous to be useful. If he just said &#34;shut up and take it&#34; I wouldn&#39;t have.My mother only got vaccinated last month. She and my father are both medical professionals (she&#39;s retired and my dad got it early on since he&#39;s super high risk). Her main hangup was the lies and coercion. She believed that if the vaccine was actually as great as they&#39;re saying they&#39;d be able to make more objective goalposts and win arguments instead of stopping them because the other side is too stupid to make their own decisions.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve always wanted something like this extension, but where the brackets aren’t colorized, but rather change size depending on their nesting level, with the outermost brackets becoming increasingly large as the total nesting level of the expression increases — exactly the way brackets do in maths.Ideally, unlike in TeX, additions to nesting levels wouldn’t require a re-flow (i.e. typing a bracket wouldn’t make the code constantly shimmy around on the screen), but rather these would just be changes in the perceived size of these characters, while keeping them where they are on a monospace grid (since a lot of code assumes a pure monospace layout for indentation et al.)In my imagination, this would work by just having a set of bracket/paren/brace/etc. graphemes in each font, that have increasingly-long ascenders/descenders, while the base size of of the “functional” part of the grapheme remains constant. As if there were five versions of the letter g, with an increasing length of the stem on which the lower hook rests.As such, these magnified brackets would be rendered similarly to the way emoji are rendered in terminals: the grapheme would eventually “leak out” of its monospace box (in the emoji case to the sides; in this case above and below), to the point of eventually overlapping surrounding graphemes, rather than re-spacing the text to give it room."</p>

These farms aren&#39;t trying to &#34;spread chaos&#34; for its own sake.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the founders of Simula here.We&#39;re flattered that someone posted us to HN, but we were honestly not ready for this much publicity at this precise stage of our project.  It would have been better had this happened a few weeks from now, when we have more accurate footage of our actual prototype to show. Let me explain:1. *Video footage.* The video footage on the front page of www.simulavr.com is taken against an HTC Vive and an older prototype of our window manager. It doesn&#39;t showcase the higher resolution of the Simula One (more than 4x that of the Valve Index), or any of the new features we are intending on releasing with it (hand tracking, AR mode, environments, etc).2. *Prototype pictures.* The website doesn&#39;t have any actual photos of our headset yet!  That&#39;s because we are in the process of finalizing the design.  We have printed parts and plenty of renderings, but they are still changing every week.3. *Specs.* The specs are close to the final specs, but still placeholders. Between supply chain issues, stuff still under development, and issues getting support from manufacturers at our volumes, we might have to change things for the final prototype.One of the reasons we threw up this website in its current form was to get the ball rolling for manufacturers.  They won&#39;t supply us with parts unless we have some sort of product interest, but we can&#39;t generate any sort of product interest unless we have some sort of website. It&#39;s very much a chicken and egg sort of problem.We appreciate everyone&#39;s kind words, yet also understand the skepticism.  For people on the waitlist: expect updates to start to come from us in a few weeks, when we will show some previews of some of the actual goodies which makes our headset special."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s important to remember that this is on the way to being an MVP. It&#39;s not a finished, polished product. This is HN. Don&#39;t we like people hacking on startups any more?I think it looks like a really positive first step. Yeah, the resolution is too low but that&#39;s solvable with a better headset. It&#39;s a bit laggy, but that&#39;s probably due to recording video of VR being hard. The windows are weird sizes, but that might be user choice. Heck, I personally don&#39;t want to code things floating in space, but that&#39;s just a matter of choosing a different background. All those problems are solvable.There are loads more problems that are also likely solvable too. And maybe some that aren&#39;t. We don&#39;t know yet. I&#39;m glad someone is working on the problem to find out. That&#39;s far better than not having, maybe, one day in the distant future, a VR option to use for work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We once had a customer who would call us in a panic a couple of times a year saying our inspection equipment was experiencing unusually high false rejects and they were generating very high scrap rate. By the time we got a technician on site the next day, everything was working flawlessly and the customer couldn&#39;t reproduce the problem either. This went on for almost three years with various levels of escalation to the current management. Finally, one day a technician was on site for another project when the customer came up to him and said &#34;It&#39;s happening right now! Come fix it!&#34; The technician rushed over to the equipment and discovered that the sun was shining at exactly the right angle to cause a lens flare in one of our cameras. This happened twice a year as the sun moved along its trajectory. A strategically placed piece of opaque plastic fixed it permanently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The phase of the moon really can affect performance.  A friend of mine worked on wireless links in Scotland and was struggling with loss at certain times of day, but not exactly the same time every day.  When they graphed loss against time, the pattern was really periodic over many days.  The periodicity turned out to be 12 hours 25 minutes, which they eventually realized is exactly the time between low tides.  The problem was at low tide the reflected path off the water interfered with the line-of-sight path causing signal fading, whereas at high tide it interfered much less.  In particular, see figure 2 of their paper for the correlation between tide height and SNR: https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mmarina/papers/EDI-INF-RR-136...  As tide height really does depend on the phase of the moon, presumably their loss did too, if they measured for long enough."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I heard a great story a while back for a digitization project where historic content was being provided by many libraries around the world, including one in Russia.The quality of the scanned books was excellent, except for a weird distortion every so often where part of the page would be shifted partway through as if someone had shifted half the page in Photoshop. This was only noticed in books over a certain size so people were checking to see if there was some kind of mechanical problem with the scanner (these were robots with automatic page turners so it was plausible that there could be something which was only an issue past a certain position), trying to figure out of there was some way that the software had some kind of memory leak or other issue which would explain the long and inconsistent intervals.Eventually they were on a long-distance phone call to Moscow and not turning up anything when there was a loud rumble in the background. “What was that?” lead to the realization that the library&#39;s scan center was close to a subway tunnel. The vibration of a passing train was enough to cause a glitch but only if you happened to be scanning at the exact time it went by: the reason longer books were noticed was simply because having more pages meant that at any point in time a long book was more likely to be sitting in the scanner and the technicians running the scanner were apparently tuning out the trains as background noise. This was reportedly the first project they&#39;d done with one of the scan robots which can process an entire book unattended so it was plausible that smaller past projects simply hadn&#39;t been scanning frequently enough to hit this problem or that some previous technician had noticed and immediately redone the page."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I still haven&#39;t found the &#34;holy grail architecture&#34; for offline-first with backend sync where the backend isn&#39;t just a simple data store but also has business logic and interacts with external systems.Doing offline-first well implies that the app has a (sqlite or similar) local database, does work on that database and periodically syncs the changes to the backend. This means you have N+1 databases to keep in sync (with N=number of clients). Essentially distributed database replication where clients can go offline at any time. Potentially with different tech (for example sqlite on the client and postgres on the backend).When the backend isn&#39;t very smart it&#39;s not too hard, you can just encapsulate any state-changing action into an event, when offline process the events locally + cache the chain of events, when online send the chain to the backend and have the backend apply the events one by one. Periodically sync new events from the backend and apply them locally to stay in sync. This is what classic Todo apps like OmniFocus do.The problems start when the backend is smarter and also applies business logic that generates new events (for example enriching new entities with data from external systems, or adding new tasks to a timeline etc). Obviously the new server-generated events are only available later when the client comes back online.When trying to make the offline experience as feature-rich as possible I always end up duplicating almost all of the backend logic into the clients as well. And in that case, what is even the point of having a smart backend."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I played with rxdb about a year ago, it’s really clever and has some great ideas.It’s built on the incredible PouchDB (the original offline first db) which is a truly feet of engineering. However I feel it is somewhat neglected (not implying that the original maintainers have any responsibility to the users, this is free Open-source, the fact they gave it away in the first place is brilliant). When I last used it about 6 months ago there had been very little activity in years on the github and I am concerned about their use of automatically marking inactive issues stale after 60 days. There is so little activity the only issues that are open are ones from the last 60 days.I found a sync conflict[1] (basically a hash collision, the attachments are unintentionally stripped from the document before hashing) and submitted a ticket, unfortunately as there is so little activity the issues was marked as stale and closed automatically. It’s not a bug that many people will come across but is a legitimate issue for anyone using binary attachments.So, rxdb is really great but I would be cautious about using it when the underlying platform is looking a little neglected. I truly hope someone has the time to take it on as it is an incredible toolkit.1: https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/8257"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I do this for my mobile app, because the users are often working in remote areas without cell coverage or any network at all.I have a pretty simple strategy though:  I use SQLite on the mobile devices and when the device is back within network coverage, take a copy of the SQLite database, zip it up and throw it up to the server.  It ends up in an S3 bucket (all the device database backups end up with a UUID as their name), kick off an automatic process via a Lambda (triggered by S3) that imports the SQLite database into the bigger DB, job is done.It works pretty well, SQLite databases compress REALLY well.  The only tricky bit is having to check the version code of the database in case I have an old version of the app floating around in the wild (it happens)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As someone who has gone through a kidney transplant, this is actually a bit depressing since progress in this field is painfully slow.I have seen these articles pop up at regular intervals for a decade now, and if we&#39;re going to be honest: nothing much has happened during that decade.  This is still an under-funded area where nothing more than &#34;pre-clinical&#34; prototypes keep getting press - and then nothing.I used to be active on various forums for kidney patients (one of which had more than 27.000 members last I checked).  I&#39;m not very active anymore because it is too depressing to read about people who are less fortunate than me (I have good health, live in a country with socialized medicine and my total cost per year for keeping the transplanted healthy is less than $300).  For instance non-affluent people living in the US.I&#39;ve lost count of how many americans I&#39;ve known who have ended up in a place where taking their own life seems like the best option.  Either because they are tired of finding money for the medications that keep them alive, tired of navigating bureaucracy, because they don&#39;t want to drag their entire family into a financial hole, or because they are just physically exhausted.  (Dialysis is time-consuming and slowly ruins your body)Take some time to think about that.  Think about what it means that every so many months someone on a forum you frequent tells you &#34;I&#39;ve had it - I&#39;m going to give up and die&#34;.  It can be quite taxing if you allow yourself to care.So excuse me for being negative, but this isn&#39;t anything to be excited about.

That might work, but only if the person moves not much, because it does not seem flexible. And having a stiff smartphone in your body would mean moving like a old school robot. That still might beat the alternative, but would be a serious limitation. Maybe they get it smaller and more flexible - then I would be curious how long the bioreactor and hemofilter lasts, before they need replacement? Because that means dangerous surgery.So the first versions would be probably carried outside the body and connected to your arteries?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Before the launch of the XBOX 360, the company I worked for was one of their suppliers, and without going into enough detail to make me identifiable, the management of our two companies had arrived at sort of a stalemate: We didn&#39;t want to tell them exactly how our algorithms worked, and they didn&#39;t want to tell us exactly what they were doing with them-- think of it like a data compressor where, we don&#39;t want them to know the exact compression algo, and they don&#39;t want us to have their data.So, somehow, It is arrived at that a website will be created that encodes MS&#39;s proprietary data, but doesn&#39;t store it, but also our algorithm is implemented server side, so there&#39;s no leakage of proprietary stuff.A month later, the app is done and tested and I&#39;m decoding data from the website on real hardware. I move on to the next project.Three years later, the Xbox 360 is out, I decide I&#39;m tired of filling out reimbursement forms for Heroku and its got to be a security risk with no updates in 3 years... so I take a look at the apps stats to see if its feasible to shut it down--exactly zero users. Nobody ever attempted to use it, not even once.Ironically and unknown to me, the source code had been lost in a freak accident and when I deleted the Heroku account that was the only copy of the source left.Even worse, a year later someone claimed to have a use for the app and where was it please? And I had to explain we no longer had the source. I remember a very long e-mail about how irresponsible we were."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember a conversation with an inexperienced PM, who was still in the mode &#34;we need to add X because a customer asked for it&#34;.What I&#39;ve learned - although I&#39;ve never had a PM role - is not to blindly just give customers what they ask for, but to figure out what they really need. Their feature requests are often a proxy for something else they aren&#39;t able to articulate.Another thing to be careful about is adding that one thing a customer asks for but nobody else does. You end up wasting cycles and bloating the product with these one-off asks. Sometimes you have to stand your ground and say &#34;no&#34;, because the ROI just isn&#39;t there. Startups in particular are vulnerable to this because they haven&#39;t got a large enough customer base and capital yet to comfortably say &#34;no&#34;, and end up with features jammed into the codebase that are still there, years later, when the original customer that asked for them are long gone.There are exceptions of course - perhaps the feature is for some legal requirement e.g. &#34;we need to show this specific set of Terms &amp; Conditions before the user clicks Yes&#34; they must have and can&#39;t live without."</p>

I delivered it and, by coincidence, happened to be where the users were a couple of weeks later and I stopped by to say hello and saw that the user who had been asking for the feature every day was still using the product the &#34;old way&#34;.  I asked why and he didn&#39;t seem to follow what I meant, so I reached over and showed him the feature that he had been demanding I add and he said, &#34;oh, wow, that&#39;s awesome, that&#39;s going to be such a huge timesaver for us!&#34;"</p>

They would use content from our own blog or other people posts and mix it to fool the machine learning.Trained it again and was success.Once a while such content appear and machine model fails to catch them.It only takes couple of minutes to mark the bad posts and have the model get trained and redeployed and then boom, bad content is gone.The text extraction, slicing through good content and bad content, finding out symbols vs sane alphabet and many other thing was at first challenging, but overall pretty excited to make it happen.Through this we didn&#39;t use any platform to do the job, the whole thing was built by ourselves, little bit of Tensorflow, Keras, Scikit-learn and some other spices.Worth noting, it was all text and no images or videos.

Later changed to cover more edge cases and it got even simpler and easier. Contrary to the belief, the better it got, the simpler it became :shrug"</p>

Even if you just hosted audio, I&#39;m sure somebody will quickly come along with a steganography tool to hide their content on your site (and use your bandwidth).Similarly, if you make compute power available, people will use you to mine cryptocurrency. Even if all you host is text, somebody will come along to be abusive. When you put a computer on the Internet, it&#39;s open to the entire world, including the very worst people.If you&#39;re hosting a community, start from the beginning by knowing who your community is and how they will tell you who they are. If the answer is &#34;everybody&#34;, then know what everybody means -- it means some people won&#39;t want to be there, because some people will make life hard for them.It&#39;s no longer 1991, when you could assume that such people wouldn&#39;t find you. They will find you -- for money, or the lulz. You have to plan for that on day 1. You can&#39;t fix it after the fact."</p>

Having to look at all that stuff, some of which can be very disturbing or shocking (think death, gore, etc as well as the racy things) really takes a toll on the mind.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is interesting ...For the longest time we tried to convince people that they should have an off-amazon archive of their S3 data ... we even ran an ads to that effect in 2012[1].The (obvious) reason this isn&#39;t compelling is the cost of egress.  It&#39;s just (relatively) too expensive to offload your S3 assets to some third party on a regular basis.So if R2 is S3 with no egress, suddenly there is a value proposition again.Further, unlike in 2012, in 2021 we have really great tooling in the form of &#39;rclone&#39;[2][3] which allows you to move data from cloud to cloud without involving your own bandwidth.[1] The tagline was &#34;Your infrastructure is on AWS and your backups are on AWS.  You&#39;re doing it wrong.&#34;[2] https://rclone.org/[3] https://www.rsync.net/resources/howto/rclone.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really curious to see how this goes. If they live up to the following paragraph, that&#39;s pretty game-changing:&gt;&gt; This cheaper price doesn’t come with reduced scalability. Behind the scenes, R2 automatically and intelligently manages the tiering of data to drive both performance at peak load and low-cost for infrequently requested objects.  We’ve gotten rid of complex, manual tiering policies in favor of what developers have always wanted out of object storage: limitless scale at the lowest possible cost.The amount of effort it takes to understand and account for S3 Intelligent Tiering is somewhat mind-blowing so to get rid of all of that (and the corresponding fees) would be really nice and TheWayThingsShouldBe™ for the customer -- on top of that most users just don&#39;t even know S3 Intelligent Tiering exists so it&#39;ll be great if Cloudflare just handles that automatically.We at https://vantage.sh/ (disclosure, I&#39;m the Co-Founder and CEO) recently launched a cross-provider cost recommendation for CloudFront Egress to Cloudflare which was really popular and I can imagine doing something similar for S3 -&gt; R2 once it is live and we are able to vet it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know the Cloudflare team hangs out here, so thanks, and great job! This was absolutely necessary for my line of work. Couple of quick questions/confirmations:* R2 will support the same object sizes as S3? We have 500GB+ objects and could go to a 1TB per object. 
* R2 will support HTTP Range GETs, right?Egress bandwidth for objects on S3 is the biggest line item on the AWS bill for a company I work for, by an order of magnitude, and this will just wipe it off for the most part."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A tip: If anyone finds themselves in a tragic situation like this where they can’t work but also can’t afford to take leave, investigate your short and long-term disability benefits ASAP. Also read up on the documentation necessary to begin disability claims.Engage with a doctor early on who can document the severe depressive symptoms that are preventing work (which the author specifically cites in his anecdote). Do it as early as possible to generate a documentation trail. Don’t wait until you’re close to being terminated to begin documenting anything because that will make the claim much weaker compared to someone with months of doctor’s notes documenting the situation.I can’t speak to Amazon’s specific benefits, but most big tech companies I’ve worked for have provided some base level short and long term disability coverage as part of their core benefits, partially to avoid situations like this where employees are unable to work due to external circumstances but are unable to go on leave."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What sucks about stories like this is, while my heart breaks for what this guy went through, managers don&#39;t have the same luxury of defending their side of the story to Mother Jones.I worked as an EM at Amazon. I went into this ready to think he had a bad boss (because those definitely exist at Amazon), but after reading this I feel like there&#39;s another side to this that has more compassion than is being reflected here. He was at turns informally warned, encouraged to take leave, and offered severance. It sounds like he expected a pass on all this for his life circumstances until it was too late. Without more details from both sides as to what the performance issues were, this reads as using a tragedy to get more than he&#39;s owed.I can&#39;t even imagine what this guy went through. He had to watch his wife slowly die while raising two girls and providing for his family. Watching my father die from cancer after a long life was awful enough and affected me for years. His grief has to be phenomenal. I imagine part of his grieving process is lashing out at his boss for not being more understanding. That said, I think his story would be the same no matter where he worked. It&#39;s just more in vogue to bash Amazon.If he wants to lash out at anything, I suggest lashing out at a system that requires us to work while going through such awful life circumstances. That man shouldn&#39;t have had to work. He should have been safe to be unemployed while focusing on being there for his family. The idea that he felt compelled to work to avoid his family going bankrupt is lunacy to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Believe it or not, this isn&#39;t a rare attitude among managers at Amazon. A significant percentage of SDMs believe they must &#34;keep a high bar&#34; and remove any dissenting subordinates. Word has gotten out about it, mostly on the blind app, which forced Amazon to raise pay bands for engineers 50-100k. This is costing the company a lot of money.The difference going forwards for Amazon is that the stock is mostly stagnant, and so employees are no longer putting up with miserable harsh working conditions, the financial incentives are no longer there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As someone who is intimately familiar with the Chrome extensions internals and is not employed by a big tech company, I believe most of the changes seem like a step in the right direction.*I&#39;ve been working towards implementing greater support for Chrome extensions in Electron which has involved reading and interacting with Chromium code [0].- Using service workers instead of a hidden background webpage is more idiomatic for web developers.- Forced non-persistent extensions guides developers to a better implementation which relies on less resources.*The deprecation of webRequest&#39;s blocking behavior is what&#39;s most concerning. The implementation in Manifest V2 requires sending a message back and forth between processes with JS processing for each network request which seems to be in part why they redesigned it.However, that optimization costs so much for innovative ad blocking technologies as gorhill of uBlock Origin has mentioned. When ad blocking begins requiring new methods of detection or filtering, it&#39;ll now be up to Chromium maintainers to implement support for it in the new declarativeNetRequest API. This is a tradeoff of performance for reduced flexibility where it is absolutely needed.[0] https://github.com/samuelmaddock/electron-browser-shell"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a stupid idea. But first, a bunch of questions:- Can you legally advertise a product you&#39;re not affiliated with? Is this OK by the ToS of major ad networks?- Is it possible to target ads by user&#39;s browser?I&#39;m thinking, maybe we should crowdfund a public interest ad, targeted at people browsing from Chrome, with some attention-grabbing art or distracting colors, and a clear message: &#34;Want to stop seeing this ad? Stop using Chrome, install a different browser and an ad blocker. Click here to learn more.&#34;, which links to a site directing people to install Firefox and uBlock Origin (and linking to crowdfunding campaign to keep the ad going). Alternative for A/B testing: &#34;Don&#39;t click this ad, it costs us money.&#34;Come to think of it, maybe someone like EFF should do that - they&#39;re well-known and reputable enough that people wouldn&#39;t immediately assume it&#39;s some weird Firefox ad, avoiding the effect being the opposite from intended."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me (I imagine a lot of others as well), it&#39;s simple. If Chrome removes adblock, I&#39;m going back to Firefox.HN ilk don&#39;t represent a good target market. Can&#39;t really make money off traditionally tracked ads off of us.FWIW, I love Chrome, still do. I&#39;ve been here since those entirely useless but super viral and catchy speed test ad/vids. It worked on me. I love the debugger as a web developer, more so than Firebug.Overall, will be sad to go. Pour one out for Chrome when the day comes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A very nice and well-built tool. Excellent use of sequence numbers for stateless send/receive (SYN cookies): https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan/blob/master/src... (very well-documented source too, a pleasure to read).I once (2016) used it to scan port 22 on the whole ipv4 (had to experiment with rate limits to not trigger alarms and get complaints forwarded by my VPS provider; the clever ip+port randomization technique helps a lot with that). Then took the ~22m (iirc) IPs which responded and ran ssh-keyscan on them to extract and analyze some ~15m ssh banners and public keys (a bunch of them broken, through debianized PRNG etc.) I think most of the scanning + extraction was done overnight, via ~13 VPS rented hourly (whole thing cost &lt; $10, and very few complaints). Fun times :) I should write it up some time, and do it again."</p>

So tread lightly around massscan and its power. Our pentesters did the same 6 months later.

We haven’t published a “root” space as Matrix.org yet (as the “subspace” hierarchy feature is still in beta), but I cannot wait to kill off the public room directory for Matrix.org (which is a total tirefire atm) and replace it with decentralised hierarchies of rooms that the community can moderate and curate like any other content.Add in voice/video rooms, async comms (messageboards, forums, mailing lists, newsgroups), decentralised metaverse worlds like  thirdroom (https://youtu.be/e26UJRCGfGk?t=2263) and then you end up with a skeleton for a whole open universe of interoperable communication.Next up: decentralised search for discovery as well as decentralised hierarchies…"</p>

It would be great to either ability to sign into multiple accounts or an ability to sign into a single space using account other than the default one."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The swap of Meng Whenzhou for the two Canadian Michaels demonstrates why it doesn&#39;t matter if Huawei&#39;s equipment is trustworthy or not.Canada was obeying international treaties when it detained Meng.  The Chinese state took Canadian hostages and held them in questionable conditions until they were eventually able to force a swap.  It is now clear that the Chinese government expects certain Chinese executives and corporations to be above both international law and the law of foreign countries in which they operate.If your country permits Huawei to do business within it&#39;s borders, that puts your own citizens at risk of being taken hostage.  Let&#39;s not kid ourselves that national governments care more about people than economics, but letting foreign countries take your citizens hostage without repercussion can threaten your chances of being reelected.Thanks to this episode, public opinion in Canada is now overwhelmingly against letting Huawei operate in Canada.  Given this and pressure from its allies in the five eyes, it seems almost inconceivable that the Canadian government won&#39;t soon ban Huawei from participation in 5G networks.This episode has also raised questions about permitting the operations of other Chinese corporations that are too closely associated  with the Chinese government.  e.g. If a Chinese mining corp operating in a foreign country had it&#39;s operations shut down for environmental law infractions, would there be reprisals in the form of trade sanctions, etc. from China?This kind of lawless behaviour is going to have a chilling effect on all commerce with Chinese companies."</p>

I mean it surely is not easy - but I always only hear blame without proof.(And I don&#39;t need proof, that the ccp is not nice. I know that.)In either case, my takeaway is, that we need more open hardware, that can be easily verified to do what it claims."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The US has never proved that there is any kind of Chinese surveillance going on with Huawei equipment.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"With those comment counts, something dodgy is obviously happening.The interesting question here is whether Facebook is somehow accidentally amplifying it. Certainly it is not in Facebook&#39;s interest to allow this kind of data harvesting. If it hurts you to think that Facebook somehow isn&#39;t maximally evil, at least consider that this is data that could be only Facebook&#39;s. Allowing somebody else to harvest it is money straight out of Facebook&#39;s pocket.So, given FB should not be complicit, what mistake could they be making to allow the system to be haunted? The obvious guess is that they have a feedback loop in the ranking algorithm. It values comments very highly as a signal of good engagement, but they weren&#39;t prepared for &#34;content&#34; that is this good at eliciting low effort comments and have wide appeal demographically. As long as one of these reaches a critical mass, it&#39;ll be shown to tens or hundreds of millions of people just by any engagement feeding even more engagement.Is there anything less obvious?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This could be more benign than the article makes it out to be. Growing a content business in 2021 requires you to understand Facebook&#39;s algorithms and what will get your post amplified. Instagram famously only shows your posts to 10% of your followers by default [1]. The trigger points for your post to reach wider require certain engagement quotas, and if you&#39;re designing your post to get more comments then it&#39;ll hit them faster. Often accounts do these kinds of posts because their profile is about selling a single thing (like a book they wrote) or are dropshipping and focused on the marketing side.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"1.4 million comments on a single post? Holy crap! I was previously wondering on Reddit, what kind of vapid self-importance compels people to comment in threads that already have over 100-200 comments—when new ones go straight to the bottom and no one sees them afterwards. But this is on scale of some mental illness, unless I seriously misunderstand something about Facebook comments."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The thing about Scrum is the observations and principles make sense, but then to sell it as a course they&#39;ve turned it into very specific prescriptions.I went on a scrum course and the takeaway was basically that feedback is a big deal, and you should try to get some repeatedly and quickly. It&#39;s also common sense that you should have tasks written down somewhere, and that some of them are more important than others.You certainly need to think about how long tasks will take, but there&#39;s no reason why you need to do planning poker, that just seems to be one among many ways to think about how long something might take. Tracking velocity is another one of these things that seems replaceable.If you have a team of people that more or less adheres to a few principles, there&#39;s no reason you can&#39;t get things done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Engineers are encouraged to interact with the rest of the business and build relationships with non-engineers. In contrast, traditional companies often make it impossible for developers to interact with the rest of the business.In my experience “traditional companies” will often have a bunch of people in cushy “gatekeeping“ jobs whose main function is basically forwarding emails back and forth between devs and the business. If you try to get direct access to the business usually the business is quite happy but the gatekeepers get very upset."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really want to say this: SAFe is an awful process and a trend that will hopefully go the way of Unified Process/RUP. I won&#39;t go into it, but it&#39;s largely created and popularized by a vendor to sell their software. It is poison and exists to keep its practitioners employed. It attracts the highest-ego PMs like moths.I find it interesting that they author references Skype circa 2012. It sounds like classic &#34;uppercase A&#34; agile: they reframe success as shipping and hitting other invented agile milestones, while masking shipping lousy and incomplete product that is not succeeding in the market. That was right around the time Skype started being bad. It may succeed on some metrics because MSFT started bundling it, but anyone that actively used it at that time should know what I mean.The idea of an &#34;agile enterprise&#34; is intrinsically absurd. Teams are agile, not companies, and teams and products should be loosely coupled. That&#39;s why the big tech companies in this link have converged to similar answers to this problem (they are not &#34;agile enterprises&#34; but give teams some latitude to solve their own problems, and rather focus on results). Kanban is better in most ways for most teams.Also, Tuckman is a silly model that is only popular because it rhymes.PS: Strawberry-Jam-O-Meter and a Wrong-Order-O-Meter and their descriptions could hardly be more cringe inducing. Skype should be a part of the curriculum looking at less than ideal acquisitions and post-acquisition execution. https://www.wired.co.uk/article/skype-coronavirus-pandemic has is a reasonable overview if you&#39;re not familiar. They lost the consumer market and failed at enterprise (see Teams) and Teams in turn essentially failed in the general market- where most places that were free to do so went with Slack."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Google does this so they have click tracking data. But they don&#39;t need to mangle URLs in Chrome because it supports the `ping` attribute on &lt;a&gt; tags [0].The ping attribute basically adds click tracking as a native browser feature so you don&#39;t need to do URL redirects. It also makes these analytics much easier for the site and mysterious to the user. Looks like most vendors besides Firefox support it. (They were pretty opposed I recall)If you&#39;re a Chrome user, there&#39;s some extensions that disable ping requests/link auditing [1].

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find link mangling to be a great test for when a service becomes too powerful relative to its users, able to add friction to its product that serves no purpose for its users[1]. Google started doing this around 2004[2]. Facebook didn&#39;t do it until a few years ago. Slack and Discord don&#39;t do it. Yet.[1] Example: a search result that&#39;s a pdf. How do I share this link? If I click on it it downloads to my disk. If I rightclick on it I can copy a crappy URL.[2] http://akkartik.name/firefox.html"</p>

You can throw a g! at the end of your search if you don&#39;t like the results DDG gave and it will redirect you to Google.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Heya, author here. Fun to see this.I wrote the book after becoming hugely frustrated as an introverted technical founder trying to &#34;talk to customers&#34; but finding zero books about sales/interviews/etc that spoke to my context. That first company (yc s07) failed just as I started to figure it all out, but the casual approach proved useful (and comfortable) in my future businesses, so I wanted to document it for other folks like me.If it&#39;s helpful for anyone, I&#39;ve been answering reader questions with little youtube videos that touch on some of the common misunderstanding and sticking points.[1]Also, back when covid started, I also did a short series (5x 5min videos) about adapting the approach to remote interviews.[2][1] Q&amp;A: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvHabB7atz2uWPZN5m7z3...[2] Remote: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvHabB7atz2tOjQs1OMzj..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Best book on early stage startups period. And it&#39;s barely 100 pages long.My favorite quote from it:“Someone should definitely make an X!”“Have you looked for an X?”“No, why?”“There are like 10 different kinds of X.”“Well I didn&#39;t really need it anyway.”Long story short, that person is a complainer, not a customer. They’re stuck in the la-la-land of imagining they’re the sort of person who finds clever ways to solve the petty annoyances of their day."</p>

Ask &#34;which line is this?&#34;  Simply because the first version will make many people answer &#34;yeah yeah&#34; without even looking.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Imgur, great service, lasted this long, amazing. But I always wondered how any of these random image hosts afforded bandwidth (reminds of the other various ones like TwitPic who was saved from being taken offline by Twitter). I mean, I have a gallery of images in there, privately stored, directly linked to here and there around the net, without paying for anything for years. I think at one point I can&#39;t even remember now I did pay them a small fee and then they removed that option to go it alone with ads and refused to &#39;take my money&#39;. Which seemed crazy and still does. Does the small imgur community (Which exists as a bizarre also-ran of Reddit) sustain them enough on ad views?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting company. It was created in 2018 [1], and the CEO is Michael Heyward, who was a co-founder of Whisper. Some interesting shuffling happened with Whisper [2] and it&#39;s now owned by MediaLab. Since then they have acquired a number of other properties, the general idea seems to buy declining brands for cheap and extract as much value as possible on mobile. [3] There is no public information on their funding.1. https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/CBS/SearchResults?SearchTy...2. https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-whisper...3. https://www.assemblyexchange.com/about-us - their job ads feature this ad network prominently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hm. My bet would be that you can now count the number of years until imgur links go dead on one hand.This prompted me to check whether there were any backup efforts already, and how much data that would involve. Indeed, archiveteam has some good info: https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/Imgur&gt; Imgur serves a massive amount of traffic. In 2012 alone, 42 petabytes of data were transferred. Fortunately, the amount of images uploaded is much less, albeit still a lot. In 2012, around 300,000,000 images were uploaded; assuming an average size of 120KB, that&#39;s 36TB in one year. As of 2014, there were 650 million images with 1.5 million being added each day according to one source. An analysis in 2015 based on extrapolation from a sample of random image IDs estimated about 2 billion images with a total raw full-resolution image size of 376 TiB.Also makes me think about whether/how much I currently link to imgur in various places on the internet, and whether there&#39;s anything that I should prepare to replace. Do people have suggestions how to best approach this?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some (most?) tools that output data in columns and fit each one to the largest value in that column need to scan the whole file as a first pass just to start displaying data.Not only is it the case with this tool, but from what I&#39;m reading in main.rs it looks like it&#39;s also loading the whole file in memory. I was going to say that scanning the file was a deal-breaker, but if true this is much more resource-intensive.This looks like a nice tool, but these design choices seem to limit its use to relatively small files. It could be updated to have a read-ahead buffer instead and adjust its output as new lines are discovered with values of different width, although doing this without a jarring resize could be challenging.Could someone with better knowledge of Rust than mine confirm this?I see the full dataset being loaded here[1] and the column widths being computed here.[2][1] https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/blob/main/src/main.rs#L183-...[2] https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/blob/main/src/main.rs#L218-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is such a great post, and really covers the spiritual aspects of what it&#39;s like to work for prolonged periods in VR. Glad to see Immersed getting traction, and taking VR forward.  We all benefit from this.For Linux enthusiasts (possibly the OP as as well): SimulaVR (www.simulavr.com) is working on a portable Linux VR headset with office/programmer productivity as the #1 goal. It will offer the following advantages over the OP&#39;s Immersed setup:1. *More than double the text quality.* We are making a headset with more than double the PPD (pixels-per-degree) of the Oculus Quest 2.  This is extremely important for facilitating multi-hour VR sessions without eye fatigue.2. *Proper window management.* SimulaVR is a fully functional Linux window manager (built over Wayland/wlroots infrastructure).  Unlike Immersed, it isn&#39;t just emulating screens on another host OS.  This means you get an unlimited number of windows, popups can (when desired) behave as new windows, etc.  No hacks are required to get this sort of functionality.  It will also later on facilitate proper 3D/VR applications being able to share the same space with 2D applications.3. *Proper portability.* Our headset is going to be fully portable (with a detachable compute pack in the back), and won&#39;t require you to tether your headset to another computer over WiFi, or take along an additional laptop just to get your VR computer working somewhere else.4. *Proper hackability.*  Simula is built over FOSS, and is not tethered to the Facebook platform. If there&#39;s something you want to change or tweak, you&#39;re free to do so.One thing Immersed has though is immediate availability and scalability (there are an unlimited supply of Oculus Quests floating around :).  We&#39;re likely going to be constrained on the number of headsets we can produce, at least initially, and will have to queue first to the early users.We (and the industry at large) also have a lot of work ahead of us to improve upon a VR-centric UX (incorporating proper tiling management, and other things).  Very exciting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The most critical thing in this piece:Get a better head-strap! He mentions it in passing in the article, but 90% of the strain from wearing the Quest 2 for extended periods of time can be traced to the garbage default head-strap. You want something that properly balances the headset. If you want, you can even get one that gives you a bit of extra charge, too. There are plenty of options.Something critical that doesn&#39;t seem to be mentioned:You can manually alter the resolution of Quest apps; if an app is looking blurry it&#39;s almost always because it&#39;s set to a lower resolution than native. This is a problem with a lot of &#34;productivity&#34; VR apps, and the main reason why I ended up working on my own for a few months.The standard 90hz is comfortable for me for prolonged periods of time, but if you feel nauseous, you can turn it up to 120hz, though some applications will require manual adjustment.The Quest 2 is really cheap and offers a lot of different ways to do work; you can pretty much throw it in a bag with a USB-C mouse and keyboard (and splitter, so you could technically also bring along a USB-A mouse and keyboard just fine if you bought a 2A-to-C splitter) or a bluetooth keyboard and mouse combo and you&#39;ve got a full computing environment anywhere, assuming you set it up beforehand. And if you bring around a laptop or other small form-factor PC while traveling, it works really well to augment those, too.Literal years ago Palmer Luckey talked about using a Go, a significantly less powerful headset, as a replacement for any monitor setups while traveling with his computer. We&#39;re finally at a point where you can do the same on any operating system, and it&#39;s honestly a really good experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is a part of me that is disturbed. I like working at my big wooden table overlooking the city, nice natural light filtering in, the ability to detach from the screen and pace around to take a break. VR for work seems like a trap, you&#39;ll be consumed, ensnared by something that demands all your attention. You won&#39;t know freedom. Maybe this is the current state of headsets, clunky, like a chain with cables, bad tracking and screens. Maybe if it was seamless and I could slip it on as needed, like a pair of sunglasses.The other part of me is that having a giant whiteboard and endless space seems cool. Imagine if the entire virtual space had powerful programming environments, some more powerful version of Mathematica, I could gesture and run a some powerful. Maybe that would be worth it, but it doesn&#39;t seem there yet."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I work part-time for my university&#39;s help desk and I was both impressed and disappointed the first time I came across one of these--one the one hand, its highly customizable and supports SSH access. On the other hand, there is shockingly no way to get the MAC address without connecting via SSH, even though this is popular among academics who often need to get onto MAC filtered networks.In hindsight, we probably could have connected it to the guest network, gotten its IP and then had the networking group look up its MAC on their logs. What we wound up doing is telling the user to go home and check their own router for the MAC, which is obviously less than ideal service."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not trying to shill too hard, but it&#39;s rare I fall in love with a device the way I&#39;ve fallen in love with my Remarkable 2.I can&#39;t say it was 100% worth the price (half was paid as a gift), but everything about it is refreshingly elegant and simple.Great to know recovering from a brick is possible too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh boy do I have opinions with this one. This seems like a lot of work to avoid using a perfectly good package manager on the device.They could have used rsync without installing rsync on the device. The target device doesn&#39;t need to have rsync for rsync to be used.They could have installed the package manager and left it. It doesn&#39;t run anything in the background on my device. It&#39;s easy enough to verify you don&#39;t have a systemd service or timer running it. (cron isn&#39;t installed, iirc)They could have compiled rsync with all of the libraries bundled with it. (Maybe this is beyond their expertise?)Their solution is using Docker to use the package manager and then overwriting system files on the device in the worse possible way, without understanding what they are doing. At that point, they verified in Docker. Should be safe to run it on the tablet then, yes?What attack vector are they worried about? :/ Toltec is actively worked on, odds are someone would notice someone else fucking with repository.The cherry on top was completely not understanding how the remarkable works. There are two partitions for a reason. The inactive one is used for software updates. When the reMarkable downloads an update, it downloads it to the inactive partition. When you &#34;install&#34; the update, it flips which of the two partitions is active. 
If the update fails to boot, it flips back to the known good state. All they had to do was switch the active partition, the next update would overwrite the broken partition. https://github.com/ddvk/remarkable2-recovery/issues/6This looks like a bad case of tunnel vision, combined with a lack of understanding. I&#39;m glad they managed to figure out how to fix it."</p>

Have invested a lot of time in developing plex&#39;s plugin for youtube, twitch, and my favorite streaming services, paid a lifetime fee to plex. And now the whole plugins system is disabled.That&#39;s the only reason why I&#39;ve switched to Jellyfin. It&#39;s not better than plex.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In contrast to most people in this thread, I don&#39;t find Jellyfin to be an all-around great experience. Maybe because I run the JF client on a Google Chromecast, and the &#34;Jellyfin for Android TV&#34; app is very unstable. I get roughly one crash a day, mostly when restarting a movie-watching. The UI is okay, but there are a lot of small annoyances (why is there no &#34;restart from beginning&#34; button? Why can&#39;t I use the &#34;wheel/cursor thing&#34; on my remote to go forward/back?, why does it so often fail to automatically recognize/parse filenames, or download cover art? Why can&#39;t a folder contain both movies and tv series?).... All in all, it&#39;s mediocre at best, but I&#39;m still glad it exists: despite everything, I still use it over other alternatives, because it&#39;s open source and works well enough.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The blurring and then sharpening in spatial domain is equivalent to applying a band-pass filter, or rather a band-stop in the article&#39;s case, in the frequency domain. Blurring requires a lot of parameter tuning, in particular the size of the mask and the weight of each the mask element. The choice of parameter can be mapped to particular filter in the frequency domain, e.g. a gaussian filter or an ideal filter. Same for sharpening. Operating in the frequency domain allows you to skip all the trial and error of parameters, by eye-balling the frequency of interest, and suppress its presence.&gt; what you did is still the best out thereIt still is.I worked with a printing company before. The company impart anti-forgery pattern to packaging material by tuning the half tone-ing angle of the printer. The printing company then offer a seemingly transparent film, with special pattern printed on it, to company requiring brand protection. By overlaying the film on top of packaging material, a specifically designed moire pattern would occur. If you squint your mind enough, it is like public-private key encryption in the physical world. Whenever the brand receive dispute over authenticity of purchased items, a special team, a team having that transparent film, will be summoned to verify the authenticity of item in question. It is one of the many ways the brand in question protect their goods. The printing company was looking for a mobile solution instead of delivery the transparent film, that&#39;s where I get to learn more about the printing industry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article doesn&#39;t say, but te method described in the article is called a notch filter. Here are some links on it, [0], [1], [2], [4]. Instead of cutting a sharp edge on the frequency domain, it&#39;s better that the filter blur the edge to avoid introducing too much artifacts, and this is called a Gaussian notch filter.Anyway here is another method, that also targets peak regions on frequency domain for removal but is based on a median filter instead, [5][0] Removal of Moiré Patterns in Frequency Domain, https://ijournals.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/5.3106-Khanj...[1] Periodic Noise Removing Filter, https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.15/d2/d0b/tutorial_periodic_nois...[3]  Adaptive Gaussian notch filter for removing periodic noise from digital images, https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1049/iet-...[4] Adaptive Optimum Notch Filter for Periodic Noise

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nature will quite readily calculate the 2D Fourier transform and its inverse for us without the use of a digital computer.This is because lenses effectively do a Fourier transform at the focal point. With the right setup, you can apply filters at the focal point and get pretty much exactly what you would expect. An example of such a setup is the 4F Correlator. [0]Fourier optics is a whole subfield within optics, and it really is rather fascinating.Exposure to Fourier optics really helped develop my intuition around the Fourier transform.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_optics#4F_Correlator"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi,
I am the developer of the app in question, accessible hangman, as well as the other games I hve made for iOS.
I am a blind developer myself, that is why I thought htat making games for the blind would be the best approach for me. I chose Apple&#39;s platform, instead of Android, because of the way that SwiftUI lets me write the UI via code and change visual appearance of buttons, etc just by adding button shapes, icons, etc.Now, I do understand that every app needs to go through review every time it is updated, of course. But this is verion 2.5 of the app, this is in no way the first or second version.
So yes, Apple seems to find a new issue when someone just finds a little light in their brain clicking into place, the first version had no such issue. But after 4 or 5 versions, oooooh wait, your app does not comply with blah blah blah.
So, yes, I think this is unfair.
Anyway, I have some news regarding this whole hing, the update was pushed through and approved finally so I&#39;m a bit less worried, they still say I should talk to them on the phone so they&#39;re going to schedule a call with me.
Let&#39;s see how this turns out. Thanks all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple killed one of the best voiceover enabled single-player poker simulator about 2 years ago.  THETAPoker was absolutely great, and the author invested a lot of time and energy to make the game perfectly self-voicing.  Until Apple review falsely identified it as a gambling-app which needs to be banned.  The author tried to get someone to listen at apple, and was totally ignored.  Now, Apple has a similar poker simulator, called hold&#39;em, which is by far not as good regarding VoiceOver support.  It feels like a scam to kick someone from the AppStore who did a very good job just to make your own botched copy-cat app more prominent.That said, Apple VoiceOver is still one of the best shipped-by-default accessibility systems.  However, we have to thank Steve Jobs for this.  If it were only for Tim Cook, apple wouldn&#39;t even know how to spell accessibility."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At a previous company, when I was developing an iOS app, it was difficult to impress upon the business people that there was a very real risk of Apple simply cutting us off.  (When Apple wanted to compete in our space, or they cut a deal with a competitor of ours, or they came up with some new idea about &#34;security&#34; or &#34;experience&#34;, or simply Kafkaesque random bureaucratic whim with no appeal.)I then had to explain why &#34;the market&#34; hadn&#39;t already corrected that, and why regulators hadn&#39;t.Separate from my professional career, one of the more personal reasons that the reality of the iron-fisted mad-king Apple iOS app store made me sad is... I had hard-won skills at some tricky iOS things, and it would&#39;ve been very tempting to moonlight on some creative apps that did something new, while also generating side income.  But, for this and other Apple developer-hostile reasons, I&#39;d end up aggravated in my spare time, and always with the risk that at some point Apple will stab me in the back.  That&#39;s no way to spend one&#39;s spare time refreshing from the real job."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing that helped me is not to care so much about my employer&#39;s goals.It&#39;s almost heretical. But once you embrace this mindset, it does wonders. Or at least, it has for me so far.I think a lot of us want to be proud of the work we do, and we feel that if we slack off, then we shouldn&#39;t be proud. But it&#39;s the other way around. I think the slackers have it right.You&#39;re probably not going to get rich from working a day job. You&#39;re replaceable, and if you left your job tomorrow then you&#39;ll soon be forgotten. This is true for the majority of software engineers.In that context, why do so many of us take on so many unnecessary responsibilities? It&#39;s tempting to say &#34;Well, my employer assigned them.&#34; But how often do you tell them no, or try to present a different approach that just so happens not to involve you?I know someone who is a chronic yes person. They will almost never say no, and they&#39;re pretty stressed day to day because of it. Whenever I point out that they&#39;re taking on too much, they say that they disagree and that it&#39;s their career.That&#39;s true, but they won&#39;t get rich from that career, so I don&#39;t understand why they care so much about it.Just remember to say &#39;no&#39; for yourself from time to time. You often don&#39;t need to take on as many responsibilities as you have."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a 54 year old Software Engineer, who has had a nice IT career for over 26 years, I&#39;m spent.This is coming from someone who has always had a growth mindset and had a really hard time sitting still.  I used to loathe naps and felt like I was missing out if I took one.  Now, I take a one hour nap almost daily and I&#39;m finding that after 1pm I&#39;m basically fried (I start working around 7AM).I&#39;m not sure what to do about it, if anything.  If I could retire now, I would.I&#39;m trying very hard to get my earnestness about learning new things back and I&#39;m finding that my motivation has just tanked.I&#39;m afraid this is a permanent state now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it’s pretty clear we have an epidemic of burnout on our hands. I think it’s a new phenomenon. And I think immersive online experiences are the underlying cause.I’ve lived much of my life for the past 30 years in virtual spaces of one form or another, from MUDs to IRC to MMORPGs to early and then fully evolved social media. As commercial virtual space showed up, I noticed the engagement hooks and potential for addiction massively increased.As that happened, for my own mental health, I have distanced myself. I’ve left most social media, don’t play multi user games and have ramped up my real world social interaction.If you work hard and have pressing responsibilities, spending the little free time that you have on commercial addictive online pastimes will, in my opinion, guarantee your implosion.Find spaces to be in during the little free time that you have that don’t make someone else wealthy. Then take it a step further, and find things to do that are good for you."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The real reason they were so pissed off at Assange seems to be in two parts:
1) The Chelsea Manning State Department cables. The video was all the hype, but just dig through the &#39;SECRET&#39; cables on Iraq, Saudi Arabia, etc.  Zero interest in &#39;human rights and democracy&#39;, lots of interests in oilfields, pipelines, military sales contracts, etc.2) Those Vault7 CIA leaks are incredibly embarrassing, it&#39;s like so closet criminal organization - and with a program to run cyberwarfare attacks using Russian/Chinese signatures in the code to hide atttribution? That&#39;s kind of insanely deceptive and criminal I think.All told, those revelations make the State Dept. and the CIA look more like some kind of organized white-collar mafia outfit in the service of Wall Street shareholders than anything else.  That kind of raw exposure makes the corrupt insiders in the US government very sad.I&#39;d guess they&#39;ve got a lot more to hide, and are most worried about further eruptions of embarrassment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t see how anybody could read this and then pretend that Assange has any chance of a fair trial in America. Not only were his communication constantly monitored for years, already a breach of client attorney privilege, the US considered flagrant assassination as a potential way to handle him.I&#39;ve heard many people say that Assange committed actual crimes and it&#39;s time for him to face the consequences of those actions. While I personally disagree about whether he&#39;s done anything illegal,  even if he has it impossible for him to get a fair trial and justice to be served. Everything being done to him is an effort to get revenge on the person who embarrassed the military and intelligence communities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The interesting bit I didn&#39;t know was the article says that Wikileaks did not publish the complete contents of the Vault 7 materials they had. Not sure whether they just published shasums of the bits they didn&#39;t, or if they proved some other way they had parts they were holding back as leverage.It&#39;s odd to read what was really at stake. Pompeo&#39;s team was ready to assasinate Assange in London, and the only thing stopping them was the justice dept and only nominally the office of the President. What WL (and Snowden) did was show to the public the intelligence community, who was ostensibly accountable to them, for what they truthfully were. The news media took a bigger credibility hit for their history of spiking these stories and delivering hit pieces than the spies ever did.Most people saw how the sausage was made and decided they still liked sausage. Not only do we tolerate what these services do, but now that we know about it and have done nothing to change it, we have acknowledged it and rewarded them for it all. Snowden&#39;s story practically created the ability for retired generals to accept pulpits from tv news where they can armchair QB the issues of the day, and they should thank him for the minor television celebrity and speaker circuit fêting they now enjoy. Whether that undermines the credibility of their institutions is still to be seen, but all that plotting to kill Assange just to sustain some lame narrative about a bureaucracy seems like it was just a fatal distraction from the real unseating of western power that we are clearly into the endgame of today."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People think if a project on github hasn&#39;t been updated since 3 months then it has been abandoned!!Like, why don&#39;t we just let projects be &#34;done&#34;? Things don&#39;t need to be maintained and updated for eternity.In my mind, the best software engineering is where you solve a problem once and your solution just works and needs no configuration or maintenance or updates.This of course has a very low chance of happening if your system has to exist as a part of &#34;ecosystem&#34; where you expect/assume the presence of some external service that can change its API on a whim (or just disappear).Yes, to a certain degree it&#39;s impossible to design software that does not exist as a part of an ecosystem, which is why I put it in quotes.Some APIs are stable and are guaranteed to continue to exist for a very long time: CPU instruction sets, networking protocols (IP/UDP/TCP), operating systems (AFAICT: Linux (the kernel) works hard to not break user programs, and Windows is kind of known for bending over backwards to maintain compatibility with old programs), file systems, etc.What I&#39;m advocating for here requires that your program be compiled into a native executable binary file, and it must embed all its library dependencies (aka static linking)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been at my current company for maybe 6 years now, in an engineering role.In that time, the service-oriented code which has significantly outlasted anything else, with nearly no maintenance, has maybe surprisingly or unsurprisingly been: AWS Lambda functions.We have quite a few Lambda functions (written in Node) that I believe pre-date even my tenure at the company; the only modifications in the interim, maybe a few lines of obscure bug fixes, updating the lambda node version, we switched from JS to TS everywhere a few years ago, and keeping the CI updated on those repos (which is a rather ironic and wasteful investment of resources given they&#39;ve only changed a half dozen times in something like six years).Checking in on those dozens of functions handling millions of invocations every month, and seeing them just chug along with no maintenance, has convinced me, personally, that if a problem domain can be solved in a FaaS-like way, its the way to do it. Not every problem can, and I&#39;m not specifically advocating for Lambda vs Azure FaaS vs an open source kubernetes-based solution.More-so that, every deployment artifact has to draw an &#34;operations&#34; line, to the left of that is the rote, daily operations banality, and to the right is the ever-changing business problem space. The further right you can draw that line, to push as much as possible into operations, the better; it gives you optionality to outsource that left part, maybe to automated software, maybe to AWS, maybe to an in-house operations team. FaaS draws that line roughly as far right as I think a general purpose programming system can; further right would approach things like Excel, Retool, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The &#34;essentially no dependencies&#34; thing always fascinates me.Certainly, complex C code is a risk across OS versions but ... perl5 version 8.1 was released just over 18 years ago and after multiple years of annual major releases of perl we&#39;re now on version 34. Many of my chosen cpan dependencies produce the exact same output when on a 5.8.1 install as they do on a 5.34.0 install, and I can move them to a new machine/OS via rsync or tar of the local::lib structure (virtualenv like thing configured by setting a couple of environment variables) and it Just Works.Am I weird here? Is the author? Is python unusually bad? Is perl unusually good? This all seems quite strange to me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article conflates NFTs with cryptocurrency, in a way that looks to me to be intentional in order to bolster his argument that crypto is for rich people to conspicuously consume and to pump and dump on the plebs.NFTs aren&#39;t money, or currency and just because they can be created on some blockchains doesn&#39;t make them so.I also don&#39;t see a genuine effort from the author to really understand why proponents think that this technology will positively change the world. You might not agree with them, but at least then rebut their arguments instead of creating straw men.Bitcoin is open source, the original founder is nowhere to be found, there were no VCs involved in its creation or in the distribution of the coins and the entire network is run out in the open. The Bitcoin network is a commons.The permissionless, decentralized, p2p and stateless aspect of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is as revolutionary as it was 12 years ago, and in these 12 years &#34;normal&#34; (i.e. non-rich) people had access to them as much as anyone else. Heck, 10 years ago there were faucets that would hand out 5 bitcoins if you solved a captcha.The people who are today involved in the creation and distribution of fiat money have incredible power, a power which is largely hidden from view, but which actually drives and shapes a lot of what we see. Of course these people won&#39;t take an open source competitor lying down."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was involved in a blockchain (DeFi) startup. All the blockchain companies are mostly a huge pyramid scheme. The company I worked for has a lot of big claims, raised millions, wanted to solve world hunger, prioritized partnership, marketing, while having no working implementation. Others in the eco system are the same.The NFT scene is even more BS. It could destroyed uninformed people&#39;s life, just like gambling. However, this kind of gambling is public on the internet with little regulations.I hope more tech people speak about this instead of just ignoring them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel the IPFS blog post gave me a glimpse of how blockchain can be cool. In certain cases, the need for decentralization is so strong that it makes sense to build a blockchain system for it (or other secure P2P network thingy).For example, authentication/identity using blockchain technology seems interesting to me.[1] https://blog.ipfs.io/decentralizing-the-internet-s-root/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I won&#39;t claim it&#39;s more or less impressive, butLuis Antin van Rooten&#39;s Mots D&#39;Heures is at first glance abstract (bordering on the nonsensical) French poetry ..But is actually a homophonic translation of English nursery rhymes - that is, if you read the French aloud, it sounds as if you&#39;re reading the rhyme.Example:    Un petit d&#39;un petit
    S&#39;étonne aux Halles
    Un petit d&#39;un petit
    Ah! degrés te fallent
    Indolent qui ne sort cesse

(If you read it aloud you will recognize a well-known scrambled egg...)The effort is in making the French poetry make any sense, which van Rooten (a Hollywood character actor in his spare time) does admirably.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mots_d%27Heures?wprov=sfla1"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is so weird for me.Where I work (backend software development), we do video calls and meetings all the time. Probably an hour every day or more is spent in direct contact. I see this as absolutely essential to get people on the same page - but none of the reasons that people have listed in this thread for why people prefer personal meetings apply to me. For instance, I am extremely grateful if someone writes up meeting notes, I read text documents all the time, and I often require continuous uninterrupted time and respect it in others, and I still prefer voiced meetings.I think the primary reason is if I am trying to clarify an idea for a design or an approach, I will go to the people who have also touched that field of difficulty, and try to explain what I am trying to do to them in advance. The spoken medium in that case gives room for interruptions, immediate elaborations and feedback. A write-up either convinces or it doesn&#39;t; it can be edited but it has feedback cycles on the order of tens of minutes to hours. Spoken communication has feedback cycles of seconds, so even if I was going to write something up, I&#39;d talk it through verbally first, anyways."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author wants to educate people on the benefits of (more) text communication, but I don&#39;t believe it will change minds.Reading the sibling comment from papaf[1] and also a previous reply to me by jakubp[2] about talking things out instead of email, it seems like the higher meta-analysis is that some people have a predisposition to prefer synchronous (videoconference, phone call, cubicle visit) over asynchronous communication (email, chat).One group really prioritizes synchro comm for &#34;emotional nuance&#34; etc.  The other group prioritizes written text&#39;s dense information content and searchability.So if the company has folks like papaf and jakubp, it doesn&#39;t matter if you have a blog article recommending structured emails over video calls.  Some employees prefer not to communicate that way.  In fact, the blog article just makes them express their disagreement with it.  E.g. papaf saying we&#39;re not &#34;efficient robots&#34; and jakubp advising me that I should accommodate his communication style of in-person cubicle visits.To prevent clashing, I guess the higher-level advice is to hire a team where everybody likes to communicate the same way.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28651678[2] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20583427"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my experience, many people prefer meetings over asynchronous communication because they can&#39;t write. I&#39;m not referring to grammar or to spelling, but to being able to communicate effectively without a continuous feedback from the recipient of the message. When these people are asked to write documentation, the result is usually very sparse text with too many bullet points, table and images.
Good asynchronous communication requires a high degree of introspection, clarity of mind and empathy, that not everybody has. A meeting allows you to pass your message through successive approximations, as in adjusting what you are saying based on the reactions of the listeners and being pushed in the right direction by their questions. Unfortunately it is also much more time consuming, because everybody has to stop whatever they are doing and listen for 1-2 hours, while reading 2 pages of text would taken them 30 minutes and they could have scheduled it at their convenience.I don&#39;t see much of a difference between older vs younger generations nor between native and non-native English speakers.I&#39;m open to accept that it&#39;s just my own experience and that it doesn&#39;t generalize."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I tried a few of those Kinesis split keyboards. Too squishy for me. Not far enough apart. The CherryMX Kinesis split keyboard was is too clickey for calls and screenshares. Muscle memory made it difficult to switch.This is a really cool hack, and I’m happy that the author found a solution for their pain that works for them, but this bit confused me.Kinesis are keyboards with separated key clusters, but not split keyboards. When one says split keyboard I think they are normally talking about things like the Ergodox EZ/Moonlander which have two physically separate bodies, one for each hand. There are many different models of these with various shapes and sizes, and you can separate them as much as you like. The normal advice is to set them up around shoulder width apart so you aren’t rounding your back to bring your arms together.Most of these kinds of keyboards also support whatever key switches you prefer, and there are plenty of options that are sufficiently quiet for zoom (pretty much anything linear should do the trick)I have been using a Moonlander for a couple of years now, and an EZ before that. They are expensive at around $400 but I don’t think I can ever go back. Most of these split keyboards also run QMK so you can setup binds, layers, and generally configure them however you like."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are probably multiple different causes for RSI in programmers, but for me, a regular keyboard is fine. Even my slouch is fine. I type with my elbows on the table and it&#39;s fine.It&#39;s the mouse that killed me. A handful of years after graduating from college, I thought my programming career was over because the pain in my neck and shoulders was so bad I couldn&#39;t type. I went to a bunch of doctors, neurologists, physiotherapy, etc but nothing helped, not even medication.It turns out twisting my right hand outward in order to accommodate my mouse to the right of my keyboard was the culprit. I changed my entire set up so that my mouse is away from my keyboard when I type, and when I need to use the mouse, I push my keyboard away and have the mouse on the table in the center of my body, with my wrist slightly twisted so that it mimics writing with a pencil. That&#39;s also why Macbooks and similar laptops are fine with my because it&#39;s in the middle.Once I switched to this technique, my carpal tunnel went away. It&#39;s been over 25 years now with no pain. Like I said, different people probably have different causes of carpal tunnel, but for me this was the precise reason."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find it really odd that the OP is staring down the barrel of an RSI that&#39;s going to inexorably lock them (presumably) out of their career and passion, but the learning curve for a proper ergonomic keyboard seemed to high. I was up to an acceptable 40WPM on the Ergodox a week after switching, and his complaints about &#34;the Cherry MX&#34; switches fall a little flat since there&#39;s about a dozen different kinds, all with different noise and tactile characteristics.I just can&#39;t fathom all that unused space on my desk (two halves of two keyboards, going totally unused!) when the investment in some natural-feeling typing infrastructure was relatively small given how much pain I&#39;ve avoided, and will continue to avoid.Edit: clearer word order"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seems like the antebellum for an IP reckoning similar to what resulted in the DMCA in the United States in the late 90s. The technology is getting to the point where it makes the law as it stands pretty nonsensical in the face of what can be doneThe scope of patents in software and technology is already absurd, both because 12 years is an eternity for how quickly that industry moves, and because increasingly trivial &#34;inventions&#34; have been let through as the ability for patent officials to interpret complicated digital innovations according to patent law and policy has increasingly fallen behind the field. This is already a serious problem, but currently still takes expensive lawyers to take advantage of. Even if we make legal precedent that says that AI can&#39;t own patents, the advent of better purpose-specific text generation will quickly put patent trolling in the hands of laypeoplePersonally, I think the DMCA was a horrible mistake. The provisions it added to copyright created a ton of horrible precedent that led to the draconian control private companies exert over the lives of billions of people worldwide, justified in law by their intellectual property concerns. I believe that if Intellectual Property ever served a legitimate purpose, it has now run its course and needs to be dismantled. I hope that this new challenge moves us more in this direction, rather than some new awful legislative band-aid that attempts to preserve the status quo by destroying more of our rights"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The applicant recorded his AI as the inventor for some reason (*).  Had the applicant recorded himself as the inventor having used the AI as a tool to invent, then the application probably would have been allowed.Using a mechanical process to search a large possibility space to find a patentable subspace is not new. For example, testing chemical compounds to find a mixture with optimal properties or testing drug dosages to find the most effective treatment is common. The resulting narrow range of mixtures or dosages is patentable so long as it is new (not done before), non-obvious (inventive), useful, etc. Also, if I hire other people to do the lab work at my direction, then I am still the inventor, not the lab technicians. Similarly, AI is just another tool.Edit: (*) After looking into this more, the applicant here is on a crusade to have an AI recognized as an inventor. https://artificialinventor.com/patent-applications/. That web site contains nonsense like the following:&gt; Arguably, DABUS may be considered “sentient” in that any chain-based concept launches a series of memories (i.e., affect chains) that sometimes terminate in critical recollections, thereby launching a tide of artificial molecules. It is these associated memory sequences, and the accompanying simulated neurotransmitter rush, that are considered equivalent to subjective feelings in humans (i.e., sentience). In this way, DABUS has an emotional appreciation for what it conceives."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a research fellow at a large tech company and part of my job is to produce a certain number of patents per year. I have used AI as an &#34;aid&#34; to developing a patent several times but never thought for one minute it would make sense to list AI as the inventor. That is ridiculous. I have used Excel, R, Google Search, Mathematica, Python and several other modeling tools etc. to develop new IPR, obviously no one would list any of those. It was me doing the inventing, I am just using tool like any other."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Only had time to skim it, but even without all the details it is an excellent overview of the state of the art regarding secure boot chain. You can learn many of the points by looking into the Android boot sequence but this is a more generic and &#39;everything in a single place&#39; write-up. Especially the mechanisms behind dm-verity seem to be not widely known and - in my view- underappreciated.&gt; *This is all so desktop/laptop focused, what about servers?I know that some of the more powerful and Linux based automotive embedded systems use a similar design. While important for desktop/laptop and servers the mentioned points are crucial for systems where physical security of the hardware is limited.Oh, and BTW, if 0pointer.net i doesn&#39;t ring a bell: The author is Lennart Poettering."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If your attacker is both sophisticated and able to access your hardware directly, the game is over; nothing we can do can currently avoid this.What we can do is address the scenarios in which an attacker is either unsophisticated or remote.  Normal network security takes care of the latter case, and for unsophisticated attackers, a good FDE (Full Disk Encryption) system covers it nicely.  For laptops you can either live with typing in a password at every boot, or get a USB key of some kind.  For servers with FDE you might want to use something to enable remote and unattended reboots, like (shameless plug) Mandos¹.1. https://www.recompile.se/mandos"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An option that wasn&#39;t at all considered in the article is to have the initrd and (optionally) the secret key used for decrypting the disk on a separate device (or devices), for example on an 1 GB USB drive. This way the big disk can have full, real FDE (not LUKS). To an attacker not in possesion of the USB drive the big disk just looks like random data. And the USB drive can be kept on one&#39;s own person and easily destroyed if necessary.The main part is having the initrd on an external, small, device. The secret can be either a regular passphrase, or stored somewhere on the small device.Works fine on my Archlinux.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have an XPS 9500 and have found this infuriating.I think there&#39;s two separate things going on:As others have noted, S3 sleep isn&#39;t supported, only S1 &#34;sleep to idle&#34; sleep. But I don&#39;t think this is the direct cause of the overheating. In S1 sleep, the laptop can average something like 900mW of power usage, which is enough to annoyingly knock a few percent off your battery overnight, but not enough to make the laptop warm, even in a bag.The seems to be a second problem, specific to Windows, that when in S1 sleep sometimes the power consumption is high (of order 10W), and this causes the laptop to get very hot if not well ventilated. I&#39;ve never been able to figure out if this Windows actually doing something useful in &#34;modern standby&#34; like Windows Update, or whether it&#39;s a bug. Edit: And I should add, it&#39;s crazy that there&#39;s not a way to disable this if it is doing something &#34;useful&#34;.Either way, under Linux the latter doesn&#39;t happen, and the laptop sleeps very cool ... just with the annoying &#34;lose 5% of your battery overnight&#34; problem from sleeping in S1."</p>

These longer active intervals occur for a variety of reasons, for example, processing incoming email or downloading critical Windows updates. Windows components that are allowed to leave the SoC in the active power state are called activators because they are registered with the power manager as capable of blocking the transition back to the idle power mode. The durations of these activities vary widely but are controlled to extend battery life. The durations of the activities can be viewed with the built-in SleepStudy software tool or through Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)-based instrumentation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is slightly tangential, but it&#39;s Atlantic-cable-related, and I just learned about it. Let me set the stage. By the 1920s, analog fax technology was established and there were a variety of experimental and early commercial systems in use. One of the first uses of modems was to transmit faxes over the long-distance telephone network, turning a voltage into a pitch, and vice versa. The electronic marvel of the 1930s in the newsroom, aside from the teletypes, was that you could take a photo in San Francisco and have it published just hours later in New York.But how do you get a picture across the Atlantic Ocean? Those analog fax systems suffer from noise and in the experimental systems of the 1910s and 1920s long-distance was impractical. Shortwave to get over the Ocean was right out. There were no transoceanic telephone links. But there were submarine telegraph cables. Morse code or Baudot telex. Not very fast with no amplifiers along the lines yet. But you could send a telex across the Atlantic ocean.Enter the Bartlane transmission system. First, five photographs were developed from the original negative, at different exposure levels, using a conductive developer. So each point of the image is more or less conductive depending on its exposure. Each of these photos is scanned, as if it had pixels, and a 1-bit intensity value collected for for all five photographs, creating a five-level greyscale bitmap image on tape basically. (Five bits worked with existing Baudot code equipment.)This enormous tape was then sent over the wire. On the receiving end a printer, with intensity controlled by the level indicated, would then selectively expose a spot on a photographic plate to light, as it stepped through the tape. Six hours to send a small image. But digital was the only way to send a photograph from London to New York overnight from its early trials in the 1920s until the 1950s.http://www.hffax.de/history/html/bartlane.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cool.  We take it for granted, but the intercontinental data (and voice) connectivity cables are an impressive achievement for humanity -- technical, and for global community.  And globe.gl has me &#34;seeing&#34; for the first time a particular cable for which I have a much smaller personal story.One of those submarine cables being severed accounts for one of only two software/hardware downtimes for a B2B startup&#39;s launch MVP, which had been deployed in critical production overseas.Our station appliances at the facility needed to talk with servers (at the network-closest AWS AZ) multiple times a minute, for cryptographic security reasons.  The appliances had a boot-time check for network connectivity (which saw extreme latency and packet loss as network unavailable).  For reasons, the facility powered off all equipment at night.One day, the facility said the appliances wouldn&#39;t &#34;turn on&#34;, I quickly found they were having network problems, but facility insisted their LAN and Internet connectivity was fine.  I was able to carefully SSH in (with terminal responsiveness like a bad dialup to an overloaded timesharing system), and relaxed the timeout on the check that was in a retry loop, and the stations came to life (albeit network requests during operations much slower than normal).  The facility manager advised later that day that it turns out a submarine cable had been severed."</p>

The website imore reported earlier this year that 96% of people in the US had opted out of tracking.It’s almost as if no one wants this “feature” Facebook has been “providing” and given information about it and a choice have roundly rejected it.I can’t wait to see what some of Apple’s other initiatives like the anti-tracking features in Mail on iOS 15 and the upcoming iCloud Private Relay do to the industry.Hell, US intelligence agencies block ads at the network level because the ad industry is so infested with tracking/malware/spyware/exploits/etc. That’s a hell of an indictment.Of course any time someone looks into it they find that that click-rate fraud is at outrageous levels. So maybe no one needs Apple.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a slightly more cynical take on this than it seems most of Hacker News does.Facebook had found a way to monetize it&#39;s iOS app without Apple getting a 30% cut.Apple decided to cut that off to prevent Facebook from making money without Apple taking their cut. The fact that Apple can sell this to users as &#34;privacy&#34; is all the better for Apple.At the end of the day Apple is still a corporation. They are beholden to shareholders, not privacy advocates. Apple will maximize profits and has found a way to cut off revenue to competitor and breed goodwill at the same time.Judging by this comments thread, it is working very well."</p>

Instead he warns other not to discuss it. He does not include notes that research was done on modifying bat viruses to make them infectious to human cells.  These behaviors look like a guilty person, do they not?The wuhan and eco-health researchers had already started work on the furin cleavage sites and why would they stop when DARPA blocked it? Funding can’t only come from the US. Did CCP also block this research?&gt; there is published evidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was already engaged in some of the genetic engineering work described in the proposal and that viruses designed in North Carolina could easily be used in China."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"1.  There is no viral backbone anyone knows of which would have been used in this research2.  There is no spike protein anyone knows of which would have been used in this research3.  The PRRAR furin cleavage site is not one humans would have tried it is unlike any other known furin cleavage sites in coronaviruses4.  There are now many known related sarbecoviruses which have been found with furin cleavage sites5.  Furin cleavage sites have independently evolved in multiple different branches of coronaviruses, probably a dozen times that we know of now.6.  The furin cleavage site is short and can easily happen through recombination with another virus due to coinfection.7.  This is very likely what happened due to infection with the SARS-CoV-2 ancestor and an HKU9-like virus.It is not particularly suspicious that the thing which we were worried about happening and causing a zoonotic spillover event is the thing which actually happened."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Guys, two points here. One, this proposal was rejected. This did not happen! Two, their proposal was for genetic manipulation of an existing virus, which research on the existing corona virus shows was not the case.This has nothing to do with the corona virus strains we are currently dealing with, and more importantly, there has never been any credible research proving that Covid was made in a lab. The only paper that got any traction suggested it was non-manipulation based gain of function research, but that was disproved only a few weeks after the paper&#39;s release as well. I know we all want to know where it came from, but the odds against us ever having actual evidence of it being from a lab are virtually zero. And no, rejected research proposals do not constitute proof of anything."</p>
