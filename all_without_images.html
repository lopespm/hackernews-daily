								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Having done a short stint dealing with this stuff I am glad something is being done. NIST/NSF funded several studies that I was close to that were suddenly owned by a journal who did nothing but provide a place to put it.Public money should always mean public access. Not just for journals, but for anything. If one red cent of taxpayer money goes to it, the taxpayer should get it for free. Hopefully the trend continues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"US Federal grants are involved in almost all research done in the US, so this likely means that the vast majority of research papers will become open access.Open Access will mean that top quality research will no longer require membership of a University; anyone will be able to access research."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s only doable with a text-centric website. I&#39;m currently finishing a photography section for my personal website, and the gallery pages are several hundred kBs in size, while single photo page is almost 1MB in size (provided you load it on a 28&#34; screen; browser will load smaller variants on smaller screens). Most of that weight is the thumbnails (and almost-full-size photo in the latter case). The only JS I have is 6 lines (before minifying) on single photo pages which allow you to go to next or previous photo with keyboard arrows. I don&#39;t use any CSS frameworks, just a single hand-written CSS file. I don&#39;t have any tracking, analytics, social media features or anything of this sort.So if even a personal site being done with no deadlines, no pressure from management to include analytics etc. can&#39;t do it, because it wants to display a bunch of photos, then I don&#39;t think we can expect &#34;web-scale&#34; websites to achieve it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder if anyone has studied the impact of latency on user behavior while considering the impact of user expectations from their typical connection speed. Whenever I see an article about page speed optimization, the assumption is that a user will give up if a page takes too long to load, ans that everyone gives up after X seconds. Usually X is about 7s based on a Nielson article from years and years ago.The thing is tbough, a user who frequently uses satellite Internet or a 2G mobile connection will learn that pages take a while to download over that connection, and they will adjust their expectations accordingly. Satellite Internet users aren&#39;t giving up on pages every 7s. They&#39;re waiting because they know the page will load slowly.I suspect most users wait for a page if most pages are slow. So long as your website is no slower than the average then you&#39;re probably not losing many visitors.Obviously that&#39;s not to say you shouldn&#39;t make your website as fast as you can. You should. Everyone will appreciate the effort. But don&#39;t assume that knocking a few seconds off the TTI time will actually impact your conversion metrics. It probably won&#39;t (but only a proper study can prove it either way)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a sad day. Pricing changes are always hard, and having been through some of the earlier pricing changes at Heroku you can&#39;t make everyone happy. But, so many developers deployed their first app on Heroku and was a staple for so many bootcamps. Without it I&#39;m confident we&#39;d have less developers in the world.It is still one of the gold standards for developer experience. Years after its heyday companies and tools talk about and try to emulate that experience. I recall polling on twitter a few months back which the key feature was:- git push heroku master- Heroku add-ons- Heroku Postgres- Review appsAnd the reality is any one of those could standard on their own. But put together, Heroku simply lets you forget about ops and focus on shipping, and shipping is king.I fully get it&#39;s a business, but can&#39;t help but feel this is the writing on the wall for the future.Gonna pour one out tonight for Heroku.Edit: And may be trying to figure out how to offer free Postgres databases, cause shutting down databases with 3 months notice feels pretty short. Not sure if that means deleting the data itself or what, but ouch."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We pay Heroku many, many tens of thousands of dollars a year. And I still use free dynos, both personally and at work. For example, throwing up a quick app for testing (where I&#39;m happy with dynos that sleep or are limited per-repo). By pushing us off the Heroku ecosystem for some stuff, we might as well just move everything.The only reason we even use Heroku now is because I used it for free over a decade ago.I get why they made this decision, and I&#39;m excited for Fly.io, Render, etc who can run the same playbook Heroku did 15 years ago. But also a bit sad, from a nostalgic standpoint. Many of us are here because of Heroku&#39;s free tier, and I&#39;m very thankful for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fly.io has a dedicated process for moving off of Heroku. Auth via Heroku and they&#39;ll launch your app onto Fly. They also have a free tier.The process: https://fly.io/launch/herokuThe docs: https://fly.io/docs/app-guides/speed-up-a-heroku-appI haven&#39;t used it [the Heroku -&gt; Fly process] myself, but it&#39;s been around for quite some time!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Looks really good. A layer over Nix that makes it tolerable sounds like a godsend. I’ve had a TODO item for “somehow use Nix for our dev env” at Notion since 2019, but I keep kicking the can down the road because its better to tolerate a 500 line setup script than learn all the Nix stuff. Of course we could use Docker, but then on Mac our dev process would be 3x slower.Congrats to Daniel and the team! Excited to see what’s next after this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having a deterministic environment, but that is actually running on your laptop is so much better than working inside a docker container. Inside a container the file system is very slow, and you lose all of your other tools and shell aliases."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is shelling out to nix-shell (https://github.com/jetpack-io/devbox/blob/97c19c370287e203bb...) which means that it will only support bash AFAIK. I&#39;ve seen a lot of discussions around using nix-shell for dev environments, but read somewhere that is not really made for this purpose originally, rather for just building packages, bash being only one of the limitations.I tried to experiment myself with nix-shell, but I think it doesn&#39;t provide separation on the machine on which you run, it&#39;s not a chroot nor a docker container. If you are interested in some level of separation to make sure that a dev environment is &#34;safe&#34; to run on your machine without making side effects to things external to the project, then I&#39;m not sure nix-shell would be able to help, but I would be happy to learn there is an option to do otherwise."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article engages in my pet peeve, which is referring to entertainment as &#34;content&#34;.I don&#39;t have a problem with the word &#34;content&#34; in the context of content vs framing.  e.g. if you are designing a network protocol, you care about distinguishing the content of the message from the framing, and you don&#39;t care at all what the nature of the content is, it could be video, image, text, etc, and it could serve many different purposes (entertainment, personal communication, employee training, archival/backup, etc).However, this sort of language has crept into discussions of online entertainment, for no good reason.  &#34;I&#39;m not an online entertainer, creating entertainment  for people to enjoy, I am a content-creator creating content for people to consume.&#34;  I think people don&#39;t like to think about what they&#39;re creating or consuming as entertainment, because society has already attached a connotation of triviality to the term &#34;entertainment&#34; (for good reason IMO).Someone who talks about &#34;content&#34; is adopting the terminology and framing of a businessman, who cares little what purpose the &#34;content&#34; serves, just that it can attract attention, and thus money.To be fair, once the internet is entirely taken over by bots, maybe it will be appropriate to call the stuff that bots create and consume &#34;content&#34; without a whiff of irony."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The end result of all this fakery is a growing doubt and distrust of the world and the information presented to us. Bots on twitter, corporate reddit moderators pruning discourse, astroturfed discussions, deepfakes, AI generated news articles, AI art, it all waters down the assumption that what we see before us is real. Leading us to doubt everything we read, see and hear. Much of this bot driven noise online is only possible in large, public online communities.I think we will see a shift towards much smaller walled gardens of community online. It&#39;s already happening with the mass exodus to discord and smaller chatrooms. I think we can all safely assume that our 30 discord friends are real people... for now.The country club exists for the wealthy to enjoy the pleasantries of community and pastime without interruption by the masses. I think the internet will move to mirror the real world as we segregate apart into the places we most enjoy... or have the connections and money to afford. Authentic and vibrant human communities with novel content curation will be a luxury, while the &#34;public pool&#34; for the masses will be an internet of data pollution and grime."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s another route to an industrial revolution that might have happened - steel.The British industrial revolution was built from iron, not steel. Mass production of steel didn&#39;t appear until the 1880s, with the Bessemer converter. This was half a century after the deployment of successful railroads.Iron and steel was known to the Roman empire. The steel wasn&#39;t very good, even by the standards of antiquity, but it was good enough for short swords and some tools. They got as far as the &#34;bloom&#34; process, but no further. Despite this, there was a modest iron and steel industry.A Bessemer converter is a simple thing. It&#39;s a big iron vessel lined with brick attached to a furnace and blower. Roman ironworkers could have built one. It&#39;s the metallurgy that&#39;s hard. Bessemer built the thing, but steel quality was random at first. Robert Mushet, a metallurgist, after about 10,000 experiments, figured out how to get consistent quality from the process. The basic idea, from Wikipedia, is to apply enough heat and air to burn off almost all the carbon in iron ore, leaving pure iron. Then add  &#39;spiegel glanz&#39; or spiegel eisen, a &#34;double carbonate of iron and manganese found in the Rhenish mountains&#34; which was iron, 86…25; manganese, 8…50; and carbon, 5…25.  Controlled amounts of manganese and carbon are thus put back into the molten iron, and steel comes out.A number of cultures figured out steel by accident. Thus, Japanese steel, Damascus steel, etc. 
Various trace additives - vanadium, molybdenum, etc. were used. The Roman empire got as far as mediocre steel. But the process was neither understood nor reproducible at scale. Mass production required enough analytical chemistry to do quality control on the ingredients.So an interesting speculation is what might have happened if an early culture had some people really into finding out what stuff is made of. That leads to analytical chemistry. Some Roman philosopher might have discovered that if you grind rocks to a powder, mix with water, and spray into a steady flame, colored light comes out. If you look at that colored light through a prism, you see sharp lines, in the same places for the same materials, which indicate the elemental composition of the material. If they&#39;d happened to talk to someone in the Roman army responsible for a sword factory having yield problems, they might have gotten some samples of the minerals being used. That might have led to the beginnings of metallurgy quality control. As there is in a modern steel plant, there would be somebody in a little room not too far from the furnaces doing analysis on the raw materials.Steel would still be somewhat expensive, but with a repeatable production process, swords and knives would get better. Then agricultural implements and other tools. If you need to plow hard or rocky ground, a steel plow is a big help.The next big breakthrough in an an agrarian society with some steelmaking capability would be a reaper. The McCormick reaper was the first machine that really boosted agricultural production. That&#39;s what kicked the world past sustenance-level agriculture.So that&#39;s an unlikely, but not impossible, alternative path to an industrial revolution."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The basic argument is that without a clear use case to overcome the version 1.0 troubles of (steam) engines, there was no incentive to work out the kinks and pumping water out of coal mines was the big &#34;killer application&#34; of such motors. That is, pumping water out of coal mines was the &#34;early adopter&#34; market for engine technology:&gt; As we’ll see, this was a use-case that didn’t really exist in the ancient world and indeed existed almost nowhere but Britain even in the period where it worked.I remember reading a blog post by TechnicsHistory [0] (which was on the front page of HN at one point) that makes the same argument.The acoup.blog article goes on to give a reason why coal wasn&#39;t needed earlier as the need for heating fuel became scarce when wood became scarce:&gt; Consequently wood as a heat fuel was scarce and so beginning in the 16th century we see a marked shift over to coal as a heating fuel for things like cooking and home heating.I&#39;m still skeptical of why it took so long. Were there no other places in Europe, Asia or the Middle East that didn&#39;t have the same deforestation issues? Was it the combination of deforestation and population density?[0] https://technicshistory.com/2021/07/13/the-triumvirate-coal-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great article. Thought provoking.Maybe an industrial revolution could not have happened in the times of the Romans, but I think maybe, just maybe, it could have happened 1000 years before them.The bronze age was followed by the iron age not because iron is a better metal (initially it was not), but because bronze requires trade routes (copper comes from some mines, tin from some other mines), and those disappeared after the Bronze Age collapse.Now, imagine that the Bronze Age had lasted a few hundred years longer. Just one hundred years before the Bronze Age collapse there was the battle of Kadesh [1], where tens of thousands of soldiers squared off. There were 5000 to 6000 chariots altogether.Which means the late Bronze Age empires needed huge quantities of weapons, therefore of bronze. Egypt does not have a lot of trees, and trees are quite scarce in other places in the Middle East. Just like Britain ran out of trees and needed to resort to coal, a few hundred years more of bronze age would have forced Egypt to look for a substitute for charcoal. It would not have been coal, because there are no easily accessible veins of coal in the Middle East.It would have been petroleum. Petroleum was known during those times [2]:  More than 4000 years ago, according to Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus, asphalt was used in the construction of the walls and towers of Babylon; there were oil pits near Ardericca (near Babylon), and a pitch spring on Zacynthus. Great quantities of it were found on the banks of the river Issus, one of the tributaries of the Euphrates.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I agree with the article in general, but the wrinkle comes when you encounter a bug in a large, popular open source project (naming no names, but any of the major web frameworks for example) that you&#39;re using for a work project.Fix it? Sure, except despite their ostensibly open nature, many of these projects are run as internal projects of large tech corps, and the bandwidth and interest of the team in reviewing and merging external PRs is limited to nonexistent. I&#39;ve submitted small, obvious bug fixes, complete with test coverage, to projects and had them sit unreviewed for years.Fork it? Well there is a big, big difference between spending an hour fixing a bug and submitting a PR, and forking a large and complex dependency. You&#39;re committing yourself and your team and employer to the ongoing maintenance of the fork and merging of upstream changes, just so you can merge a bug fix. Usually, that&#39;s just not practical.Fuck off? Many third-party dependencies in mature projects are non-negotiable. Removing them would require a complete rewrite. You may not even have been the person who chose them, but you&#39;re stuck with them, and then your boss asks you to implement a feature or fix something that relies on a change or fix in a dependency. Being blocked due to upstream intransigence is very frustrating, and there is often a professional cost to saying &#34;no&#34; to a request, especially a bug fix, no matter how convincing you argue that it&#39;s not your fault or under your control."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As an OSS maintainer for a large project I disagree. Sometimes people did fuck off and it didn&#39;t do the project any favors.I needed people to communicate clearly and with volume why I should change some opinions. Ultimately, my mistakes led to a competitor that was indeed unsuccessful but sucked a lot of the mindshare so we both got screwed.We&#39;re smart people but we all need to learn humility occasionally. I do agree we need manners but I don&#39;t agree that people should just fuck off. I want complaints. That&#39;s how I can gauge improvement. A culture of ignoring complaints is bad. I know that is not what the article is about exactly, but it&#39;s where these things lead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s (at least) four Fs, and the first in the list should be &#34;File it&#34;.Not every open source user is a developer who can Fix it or Fork it, but a well-written bug report (and other forms of high-quality feedback) is a godsend. Even as a developer, everybody benefits if I file a bug and then spend my energy on my own open-source work rather than spending that same amount of time trying to learn the codebase of every piece of software I use."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t quite understand the argument &#34;0-based being easier for pointer arithmetic is nonsense because the language doesn&#39;t have pointers&#34;.Whether or not the language presents the concept of &#34;pointer&#34; to the user is independent of whether or not it uses pointers internally. And if it exposes arrays as a concept, it has to implement them somehow.The simplest possible implementation of arrays is having a start address and putting all elements next to each other in RAM. To get the address of a particular item, this layout naturally leads to the formula &#34;base address + index * element size&#34;, with &#34;index&#34; being 0-based. If you want to expose other indexing schemes in your language, you&#39;ll have to add more logic to convert the user-visible index back to 0-based before you can obtain the address.All of this is completely independent of the fact whether your language exposes pointers to the user or not.Even the yacht story sort of hints at this:&gt; To keep people from having their jobs cut short by yacht-racing, Richards designed the language to compile as fast as possible. One optimization was setting arrays to start at 0.If all indexing schemes were equal, why would this change even be an optimisation in the first place?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Other advantages of zero based indexing, beyond being &#39;closer to the machine&#39;:It works better with the modulo operator: `array[i%length]` vs `array[(i+length-1)%length+1]`. Or you would have to define a modulo-like operator that maps ℕ to [1..n].It works better if you have a multi-dimensional index, for example the pixels in an image. With 0 based indexing, pixel `(x,y)` is at `array[x+widthy]`. With 1 based indexing it is at `array[x+width(y-1)]`. You might argue that programming languages should support multi-dimensional arrays, but you still need operations like resizing, views, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Because otherwise you would be wasting a perfectly good number for no reason, which means you need to use more bits to do the same thing.To write 4 numbers (including zero) you only need two bits    0: 00
    1: 01
    2: 10
    3: 11

To write 4 numbers if you avoid using the number zero, you need three bits    1: 001
    2: 010
    3: 011
    4: 100

If you extrapolate that a little bit, you&#39;ll realize that you&#39;ll need two bytes (1 Byte + 1 bit from another byte) to store the indices of an array with 2^8 elements, which is just dumb.Some of you might be thinking: you don&#39;t need to store it the same way it&#39;s written, you can just substract 1 from whatever the user typed and convert it behind the scenes.Yes, you could subtract 1, but then you would be making the whole system more complex, opaque, and unelegant, while hiding information from the programmer for no good reason."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Think folks are missing the point here.The idea of this thread isn’t that bicycles are uniquely singled out for ridicule.These article snippets all come from a time when the bicycle was just invented and usage was growing fast (eg like any new tech). In fact, I think they were taken from a defunct Twitter account called pessimists archive.The point is that mass media will always court controversy and bemoan any new change in behavior regardless of what it is.Those headlines look silly now, but they are the Industrial Revolution’s version of “AI/smartphones/social media/video games/ridesharing/etc are ruining everything” articles."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not surprised in the slightest at these newspaper headlines in the linked tweets. They seem par for the course where I live.I sold my car at a profit two months ago and have been walking, cycling, and riding the bus where I need to go. Occasionally my trip calls for an Uber/Lyft. Wow, I have become a pariah in some people&#39;s eyes. People have made comments to my face about how it&#39;s odd I don&#39;t own a car and how it would be best that I get another. Someone scoffed when I answered their question of how I got to their place from mine when I told them I took the bus on a direct route.People do seem to be publicly supportive of me biking for short trips and for exercise, but they&#39;re mostly still in the phase of being introduced to the idea that someone could survive only biking. Biking as a primary form of transportation is still a foreign concept to them. I live in a very central part of the city, but this is a car dominated Texas city.Unfortunately, biking infrastructure and car etiquette is extremely poor around here. I find myself having to carefully choose my routes and am unable to reach certain places by bike that are quite close because it&#39;s not worth the risk. I hope cars begin to open more to the idea of bicyclists being around. A lot of great people I know have expressed negative sentiments towards bicyclists, so I have to believe there&#39;s a larger cultural issue at play."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"And somehow this translates to some drivers deciding that it is OK to kill cyclists because they will be 20 seconds late to the next red light stop."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I was carefully looking for prior art to invalidate the patent, I&#39;d look at Verizon&#39;s patent portfolio:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hum_(system)Their Hum product seems to do exactly what the patent troll claims to own a patent on.  It plugs into the OBD2 port and calls emergency services after a collision.Also, Nissan patented something very similar in 2004:US Patent for Vehicle emergency notification system and related method Patent (Patent # 7,323,972)https://patents.justia.com/patent/7323972"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In every western country - except the US and England - the loser pays for the cost of the trial (all parties&#39; lawyer fees + the court).Just this reduces frivolous lawsuits. If you have a good case, sure, go ahead. If your case is weak, you run a real risk paying not only for your lawyers but the other side as well.(Note that there are disadvantages to loser-pays as well. Image you legitimately want to sue corporation X because they did something atrocious. Big corporation X can now run up lawyer cost that you have to pay if you lose.)Edit: Sorry I was wrong about England (which leaves the US only).
Edit 2: In the US you can file for your lawyer fees to be returned, but that in itself is risk (I have some lawyer friends)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This doesn&#39;t surprise me and matches my own experience. Rust literally makes a codebase nearly void of most bug classes with the exception of logic bugs (Unfortunately, in a huge codebase, there can still be tons and tons of logic bugs).Still, when I migrated my Python codebase to Rust I got rid of whole classes of bugs and honestly code faster in Rust on a &#34;per debugged line of code&#34; basis. In Python, every line MUST be run or could trigger an exception (and so many do and it is hard to see). This now requires a test harness that tests every single line which is a huge pain. In Rust, the things that can obviously panic are pretty easy to see and are limited (unwrap, expect, indexing, etc.) making it much easier to write robust code, even with a more limited test suite."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Dev velocity, which was supposed to be the claim to fame of Python, improved dramatically with Rust.I don&#39;t doubt this in the least. I&#39;ve been a professional Python developer for 15 years, and I can&#39;t believe Python ever had the reputation for &#34;high dev velocity&#34; beyond toy examples. In every real world code base I&#39;ve worked in, Python has been a strict liability and the promise that you can &#34;just rewrite the slow parts in C/C++/Numpy/etc&#34; has never held (you very often spend at least as much time marshaling the data to the target language format than you gain by processing in the faster language and you have all of the maintainability problems of C/C++/Numpy). Python trades developer velocity for poor runtime performance.I don&#39;t think Rust is the paragon of high dev velocity languages either, but it seems to be more predictable. You don&#39;t have something that works as a prototype, but then you run into a bunch of performance problems (which virtually cannot be worked around) when you go to productionize, nor do you get all of the emergent quality and maintainability issues that come about from a dynamic type system (and last I checked, Python&#39;s optional static type system was still pretty alpha-grade).I strongly recommend avoiding Python for new projects. Use Go if you&#39;re looking for an easy GC language with max productivity and a decent performance ceiling. Use Rust if you&#39;re writing really high performance or correctness-is-paramount software. I&#39;m sure there are other decent options as well (I&#39;ve heard generally good things about TypeScript, but I&#39;d be concerned about its performance even if it is better than Python)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So I was one of the 3 hackers who wrote the LSM that predated Rocks at FB, and as a result I distinctly remember when Rocks overtook it in features by trading off performance, and again when it met and exceeded the performance while keeping the greater capability. RocksDB kicks ass and has for a long time, I’d recommend it to anyone in the market for that sort of thing.FAISS is also great, and has been for years. I don’t doubt that someone has done a meaningful rev on it.But as someone who likes Rust and wants to like it more: don’t lead with that. The software speaks for itself. Or should."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"More details here:https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/08/code-speech-and-tornad...&gt; In keeping with our longstanding defense of the right to publish code, we are representing Professor Matthew Green, who teaches computer science at the Johns Hopkins Information Security Institute, including applied cryptography and anonymous cryptocurrencies. Part of his work involves studying and improving privacy-enhancing technologies, and teaching his students about mixers like Tornado Cash. The disappearance of Tornado Cash’s repository from GitHub created a gap in the available information on mixer technology, so Professor Green made a fork of the code, and posted the replica so it would be available for study. The First Amendment protects both GitHub’s right to host that code, and Professor Green’s right to publish (here republish) it on GitHub so he and others can use it for teaching, for further study, and for development of the technology."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Person that has worked on the defensive side of Money Laundering here.The Tornado Cash sanction has been fascinating to watch and my key takeaway has been that there are two camps: that TC is a Money Laundering service or a Privacy service. Both are talking past each other, when it can in fact be both. Each camp see the service as their primary concern and consider the other camp as an unintended secondary.I am seeing a lot of bad takes. &#34;Money laundering requires all three aspects&#34; particularly irks me because you can just point to KYC regulations to disprove that. 
&#34;Code is just code&#34; is another, but that is just because the code isn&#39;t why someone would be sanctioned or arrested. In the same way that The Pirate Bay was just code, its is how complicit they were in the offence that will get them.Ultimately, the dichotomy feels like a problem unique to public blockchains, and will only be solved with a ZK L1 chain, whatever that looks like. The solution would require the blockchain equivalent of end-to-end encryption, one where intermediaries have zero knowledge but doesn&#39;t require co-mingling of dirty and clean money.While I think money laundering is a more serious crime than piracy (at least the predicate offenses can be). Watch this play out like Megaupload, never ending legal issues for the first parties, and a technical solution like Mega."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I found the source article much more illuminating: https://lab.sciencemuseum.org.uk/colour-shape-using-computer...I don&#39;t find the headline graph that convincing. Firstly, it&#39;s only based on items in this museum&#39;s collection, which is quite a biased set as it says in the article.Secondly - if you actually look at the colour chart closely, you can see that although there is a trend of more grayscale objects in the collection, within the coloured section there&#39;s also a trend away from almost everything being some shade of yellow, orange or brown towards a much broader range of hues. Blues, greens and purples seem much better represented.It looks to me like ~70% of the colours were basically &#34;brown&#34; in the 1800s, and now ~40% are white/gray/black. Seems more a reflection of modern objects being made more out of metal and plastic and less out of wood than anything else. Again, this is putting aside the clear bias in the samples here.I&#39;m sure there are trends going on (and the car colour one seems legit to me) but I think this overblows it a little. Fashion ebbs and flows."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is exactly what the engineers behind FoundationDB (FDB) wanted when they open sourced. For those who don&#39;t know, FDB provides a transactional (and distributed) ordered key-value store with a somewhat simple but very powerful API.Their vision was to build the hardest parts of building a database, such as transactions, fault-tolerance, high-availability, elastic scaling, etc. This would free users to build higher-level (Layers) APIs [1] / libraries [2] on top.The beauty of these layers is that you can basically remove doubt about the correctness of data once it leaves the layer. FoundationDB is one of the most (if not the) most tested [3] databases out there. I used it for over 4 years in high write / read production environments and never once did we second guess our decision.I could see this project renamed to simply &#34;fdb-sqlite-layer&#34;[1] https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-document-layer[2] https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-record-layer[3] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJb8A6h9jQQ"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People have been noticing this a lot recently but what nobody seems to know is that this is a form of money laundering/“scamming.” I know because I used to be active on crime forums and talked to some of the people who engineered this scheme.People will set up fake Spotify artist accounts with stolen identities and bank accounts, pay a musician for songs that pass as music, and then bot millions of streams on them. At this point there are so many of these fake profiles and songs that the music, which is simple “mood music” normally (which happens to be easy to make), is appearing on real playlists and being recommended to real listeners."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the “Release Radar” generated for me last week, there was a 40 second song consisting of rhythmic mechanical noises with a strange title and album art of an alien head. I didn’t like it at all. I think it was recommended to me because the publisher listed its artist as “Fanny Mendelssohn” — a classical composer whose work I definitely enjoy and have probably pressed “Like” a few times on — even though the song had nothing to do with her.You’d think, she shouldn’t be releasing any new works, you know, on account of being long-deceased and all. Therefore Spotify could block releases claiming her as an artist. Unfortunately, there are new renditions of her work being performed, recorded and published regularly, by many different groups. All of them have the right (perhaps even an ethical duty) to put Fanny Mendelssohn as one of the artists. These are works I’d like to hear, so Spotify’s recommendation algorithms are on the right track.How on earth can Spotify distinguish real Fanny from fake Fanny?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The post was interesting, but I also noticed something in the blog that had the same flavor.
Even though the link was for a specific post, the page layout neatly flowed into another post. So smooth I thought the second post&#39;s title was a subheading of the original article. A strange thing, but maybe that&#39;s just me making connections that aren&#39;t there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Millenials and GenZ may have no idea who Mudge is. I, however, almost lost my first job out of college at a bank because I ran l0phtcrack against our Windows NT 4 server to see if it could crack passwords. I showed my boss, and he pulled me aside into another room and tore my head off for irresponsibly running this tool against a production server. He said I could have been fired if this got out, but he covered my ass, sent out an email requesting everyone reset their passwords, and let me continue working. I learned a good lesson because even though my intentions were good, and it did expose security issues, it was a bit immature and should have been done in a more controlled manner along with the proper clearances.Mudge knows the implications of &#34;whistleblowing&#34;. He has been a security consultant and even testified to Congress. He&#39;s not some noob that doesn&#39;t understand security or how systems work together to provide services like disclosure to FTC. The idea that Twitter PR can pooh-pooh away his concerns is shockingly stupid.I think Twitter is in real trouble here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I learned a lot about Mudge by reading &#34;Cult of the Dead Cow: How the Original Hacking Supergroup Might Just Save the World.&#34;For anyone wanting to explore 90&#39;s security nostalgia, it&#39;s worth a read. For anyone wanting to learn where hacktivism comes from, it&#39;s worth a read. For anyone wanting to learn about how security consulting has evolved over the years, it&#39;s worth a read.Mudge is a very cool and capable individual. I am slightly surprised that Twitter would ignore someone of his talent and respect, and choose to air their dirty laundry in this manner. It&#39;s as if they have no idea who they hired. That, or C-levels think they can outpay $$$ any PR against Twitter to control the narrative. Either way, if Mudge is whistleblowing, there&#39;s probably some bad shit going down."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The whistleblowing case is a new dimension. To me as an outsider it implies Agrawal may have also been the manager in his previous technical role for a lot of the tech problems Zatko identified, and what made Agrawal CEO was his ability to leverage these problems to play ball with all the interests in that company and board, while sustaining through neglect some of those concerning practices within the organization. Twitter&#39;s product isn&#39;t technology, it&#39;s an uncertified  slot machine that pays out in political influence, and there are a lot of big interests depending on their cut of it. They needed a steady hand who wouldn&#39;t be vulnerable to being swayed by principle, and that&#39;s the one thing you don&#39;t keep hackers around for, imo.If I were betting, nothing is ever really systemically broken in large orgs, it just works for someone you can&#39;t see. This is a factor everywhere and not necessarily at Twitter. Shitty process? Cui bono. Unverifiable systems? Cui bono. Deniable and unaccounted-for access to God-mode data? Cui bono. Repudiable numbers reporting? Cui bono. Bizarre political posturing? Cui bono, etc."</p>

Some others I showed it too thought I should.  But I never took it too serious.  I was just bored over a couple weekends when I had access to some beefy GPUs.  And y&#39;know, it&#39;s quasi-porno.I opted for dudes not gals.  Part personal preference, partly because I happened to get my hands on an enormous dataset of hot shirtless guys taking selfies.The initial results were rather poor: https://i.imgur.com/npzDcCL.jpgThat&#39;s around when I realized how important the training data really is.  Too much variation in pose. So I trained a model that detected the face, nipples, and belly button, and aligned them vertically with that.  Then I briefly skimmed over the dataset manually, and deleted anything that just varied too much from the median, in a rather arbitrary way.Results were better: https://i.imgur.com/bS7ERC6.jpgSo I just let it churn away for a week, heating up the basement.  Some final results with narrow truncation and style transfer: https://i.imgur.com/rhnWnpK.jpgOne thing I find intriguing is how bland those men are, really.  Oh, beautiful, but too classically beautiful.  In a sense, StyleGAN is a compression algorithm, and highly truncated outputs are something like a median of the inputs.  So the above reflect a sort of &#34;average&#34; idealized image, that contains the traits most commonly found, in the media I trained it with."</p>

Here&#39;s a typical reply that I give to them:  I am philosophically opposed to &#34;investing&#34; in real estate, as your industry exists entirely to snatch up affordable housing from actual homeowners as a get-rich-quick scheme, benefiting those who are already rich at the expense of those who would otherwise be rising up out of their own financial situation.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Key piece of information from the article:&gt; The CoreLogic data shows that what it calls “mega” investors, with a thousand or more homes, bought 3% of houses last year and in 2022, compared with about 1% in previous years, with the bulk of investor purchases made by smaller groups.So the mega investors only make up 3% of that 25%. I&#39;d love to see data on what the remaining 22% are, but my guess is:* flippers* middle class individuals buying a second property as an investment* small time property management firms run by local businessesAlso the Inside Economics podcast&#39;s recent episode Cooling Inflation and Confounding Housing Riddles[0] adds even more interesting color to the dialog. They explain that a lot of this is driven by demand for single-family home rentals. Roughly half of Americans will want/need to rent a single-family home at some point in their lives! Many people want to live in a home on a short-term basis, like when a family with kids moves to a new city and wants to familiarize with the area before committing to a full mortgage. And COVID combined with the changing demographics has caused a huge surge in demand, so surprise prices have also gone up.[0] https://moodys-talks-inside-economics.simplecast.com/episode..."</p>

The stated aim: To prosecute child pornography. [1]Yeah, that will go down well, a central government checking our private conversations for &#34;suspicious content&#34;. Of course they would use the &#34;think of the children&#34; trope, they could also have gone with the &#34;think of the bad terrorists&#34; trope, but that would have been too American, too cowboy-ish, we need to feel special, we&#39;re Europeans, after all.Minus some street protests I don&#39;t think we can actually stop this, and, even then, I have my very big doubts. It so happens that I live in the EU periphery (I still need to present my ID card if I want to travel to Budapest or West from there), and it sickens me to see that my privacy depends on countries and electorates on which I have no say (like Germany, with all due respect to the Germans who still care about their privacy). Why should my privacy be made fun of because of decisions taken by some people from half way around the continent with which I have no direct connection and no shared past? Did they have a Securitate-like thing? Many of them didn&#39;t, and even those that did (like the same Germans), it looks like it doesn&#39;t matter at this point, they&#39;re all too happy to see their private political conversations be scrutinised 24/7.F. that, the only viable solution I see for my country is an exit from the EU, but the money (still) coming in from Bruxelles is too good to leave aside for pesky political principles, so of course that no serious politician from around these parts puts the problem that way.[1] https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/posts/messaging-and-chat-co..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only &#34;good&#34; thing is that the current German government is very skeptical about this and two of the current governing parties (the Greens and the liberal party) have also long been opposed to more surveillance.This was different with the previous government where the &#34;law &amp; order&#34; mentality was much more entrenched, and which did nothing to prevent e.g. upload filters (despite promising to do so).So I try to maintain some hope that at least Germany as a member state could tank this awful bill.edit:Here&#39;s the list of 61 questions that the German government sent to the EU concerning the bill (at the end of the article, in English): https://netzpolitik.org/2022/chatkontrolle-bundesregierung-l...From a cursory reading, it reads to me like the diplomatic equivalent of &#34;what you&#39;re proposing doesn&#39;t make any sense&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It doesn&#39;t matter how low the error rate is. The fact that the European Commission wants to have a third (robotic) participant listening in on every digital communication is absolutely ridiculous.Saying that this is about child protection is a blatant lie. This serves only as a stepping stone to introduce other screening criteria later. And with opaque ML models it will be very tedious to determine what the model is supposed to find."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been working 100% remotely for about 6.5 years now. Overall I love it.  However, there are very real drawbacks that have taken me awhile to fully realize.For me, the primary one is that it&#39;s _way_ too easy for everyone to get deeply frustrated with each other.  Social interactions and chit-chat lead to a better understanding of people and a more accurate mental model of what people actually mean when they say something.Written text is the majority of remote communication.  That&#39;s both good and bad. It&#39;s a much lower bandwidth form of communication than face-to-face in terms of being able to pick up intent and understand the context of someone&#39;s mood/etc in what they&#39;re saying.  The same goes of communication over webcam.  It&#39;s higher bandwidth than written text, but still lower than in-person.When you&#39;re fully remote, you&#39;ll much more commonly misinterpret folks intent. You&#39;ll also more commonly have your intent misinterpreted.At least in my experience, this tends to lead to a much higher rate of frustration and more frequent extreme misbehavior when everyone is remote.I don&#39;t have an easy solution.  Occasional in person meetings help a lot, but they&#39;re hard to do well, and easy to do poorly.  Having 200 people in the same room for 2 days doesn&#39;t really help the situation, as there&#39;s zero time to get to know anyone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Your remote team is my company&#39;s opportunity.&#34;Purely anecdotal based on my own experience, but at my company we have some people who work in an office and lots more that work remotely.  The in office staff contribute more ideas, work, fixes, and functional software than the remote teams by a factor of 4 or 5, or sometimes, depending on the in office worker, 10 times.  Those are hard numbers right out of our project management system.  It&#39;s simply easier to hash out hard problems in person that it is on a remote team, and the context is key.  You have all the little asides, ah ha&#39;s! and comments collected up that provide a better picture than any remote team can get unless they have their headsets on the whole time.Not that you couldn&#39;t have a good remote team - I just think the methods of communication available are not best suited to our monkey brains.  We&#39;re social animal, and we work best socially.What this has allowed us to do is beat out other development teams, both inside and outside the company.  Hasn&#39;t gone unnoticed - we also get the most important projects and are paid the most.  When it matters, the in-house people get the work.YMMV, of course, this is just one place, but I think a lot of people who want to work at home aren&#39;t interested in their success as making their work life easier."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;A study conducted on the main campus of a Fortune 500 company found that just 10 percent of all communications occurred between employees whose desks were more than 500 meters apart. This suggests that once companies span multiple floors, buildings, or campuses, they’ve already lost much of the collaborative value of being “in the office” together.&#34;This point often seems to get missed. If you&#39;re at a large company, you&#39;re often working with people on different floors, buildings, offices, countries. I want to be co-located with the people I work with often just isn&#39;t an option at larger companies even if many people come into an office."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is why my old hosting company changed its auto disconnection code to work at 11am on a Monday morning, never at a weekend.That way it&#39;s the bill-payers that notice and get in touch, not the poor tech on the out-of-hours rota.Also, it only firewalled the customer&#39;s public IPs from the Internet - it didn&#39;t stop servers. That way when the account is settled there was often nothing for the techs to do.Also it was only ever done after the bank reconciliation was marked as complete, just in case...We relied on goodwill and recommendation of engineers for our growth, so were keen not to make their lives harder for someone else&#39;s bureaucratic (or cynical) mistake."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few years ago I was working at a startup and we had just started moving some stuff over from AWS to GCP. Things were going pretty good with GCP until one day they pulled the plug on everything with no explanation. It turns out that our company credit card details had been fraudulently used without our knowledge. The criminal had decided to use the card to buy Google Ad Words or something like that - this is the same card we use on our GCP billing account. Anyway Google just took prod down with no notice on grounds of fraud. Could happen to anyone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A suggestion for engineers that lack business experience. As soon as your project grows beyond the non-hobby scale and starts making real money, invest some time to reach out to company providing the services that keep it alive and find an account manager that will take care of you.We&#39;re a Google customer and of course we had our fair share of issues (btw: it&#39;s the same with Azure, based on our experience), and we always escalate to our account manager. That usually starts turning the wheels much faster.Also, do not be afraid to ask your account manager for additional discounts. Everybody in sales has some wiggle room to get you a better deal. With Google their account manager actually suggested that we work through a reseller and we&#39;re getting % off the list prices.Dealing with Google, Amazon, etc.. is not like dealing with code. It&#39;s not only transactional and you need to invest some time in the relationship even if you&#39;re the customer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The most interesting part, to me, of a release like this is the amount of &#34;please don&#39;t abuse this technology&#34; pleading. No licence will ever stop people from doing things that the licence says they can&#39;t. There will always be someone who digs into the internals and makes a version that does not respect your hopes and dreams. It&#39;s going to be bad.As I see it, within a couple years this tech will be so widespread and ubiquitous that you can fully expect your asshole friends to grab a dozen photos of you from Facebook and then make a hyperrealistic pornographic image of you with a gorilla[0]. Pandora&#39;s box is open, and you cannot put the technology back once it&#39;s out there.You can&#39;t simply pass laws against it because every country has its own laws and people in other places will just do whatever it is you can&#39;t do here.And it&#39;s only going to get better/worse. Video will follow soon enough, as the tech improves. Politics will be influenced. You can&#39;t trust anything you see anymore (if you even could before, since Photoshop became readily available).Why bother asking people not to?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Played with it for a bit in DreamStudio so I could control more of the settings.  So far everything it generates is &#34;high quality&#34;, but the AI seems to lack the creativity and breadth of understanding that DALL-E 2 has.  OpenAI&#39;s model is better at taking wildly differing concepts and figuring out creative ways to glue them together, even if the end result isn&#39;t perfect.  Stable Diffusion is very resistant to that, and errs towards the goal of making a high quality image.  If it doesn&#39;t understand the prompt, it&#39;ll pick and choose what parts of the prompt are easiest for it and generate fantastic looking results for those.  Which is both good and bad.For example, I asked it in various ways for a bison dressed as an astronaut.  The results varied from just photos of astronauts, to bisons on earth, to bisons on the moon.  The bison was always drawn hyper realistically, which is cool, but none of them were dressed as an astronaut.  DALLE on the other hand will try all kinds of different ways that a bison might be portrayed as an astronaut.  Some realistic, some more imaginative.  All of them generally trying to fulfill the prompt.  But many results will be crude and imperfect.I personally find DALLE to be more satisfying to play with right now, because of that creativity.  I&#39;m not necessarily looking for the highest quality results.  I just want interesting results that follow my prompt.  (And no, SD&#39;s Scale knob didn&#39;t seem to help me).  But there&#39;s also a place for SD&#39;s style if you just want really great looking, but generic stuff.That said, the current version of SD was explicitly finetuned on an &#34;aesthetically&#34; ranked dataset.  So these results aren&#39;t really surprising.  I&#39;m sure the next generations of SD will start knocking DALLE out of the park in both metrics.  And, of course, massive massive props to Stability.ai for releasing this incredible work as open source.  Imagine all the tinkering and evolving people are going to do on top of this work.  It&#39;s going to be incredible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"FWIW, it is still possible to get TVs without this stuff, albeit at a premium. TVs are still made for business usage in areas like conference rooms, wall displays etc. They&#39;re often found under labeling like &#34;commercial digital signage&#34; or &#34;business display&#34; or the like, they seem to often try to avoid using &#34;TV&#34; (if being cynical maybe to make them harder for normal people to discover and confuse them if they do). But they&#39;re often nice panels aimed at serious running hours, without this sort of junk (which would give enterprise IT conniptions) and can have very useful feature support like 802.1x authentication which so many devices still lack. Players like NEC will even advertise their use of an RPi compute and wink at lack of spyware [0] for some of their products, but lots of major &#34;smart TV&#34; providers also have a commercial lineup.I think they&#39;re well worth considering, particularly for the HN crowd, granted I suppose for people who truly want built-in netflix or the like without connecting something like a Roku or Apple TV maybe it&#39;s less optimal. But even they might change their tunes back to the concept of separate boxes and normal panels if they dislike all the ads and data tracking.----0: https://www.sharpnecdisplays.us/products/displays/me501"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Some may argue that there&#39;s no need to be dramatic and that there&#39;s nothing wrong in seeing an occasional ad every now and then.Oh, no, I am very dramatic about this. I will go to any lengths not to see advertising. I will entirely forgo any platform that shows me even one ad, especially when I pay them. Amazon Prime video is already pushing it with their preroll previews. The second it&#39;s something else I&#39;m canceling and going back to P2P. Fuck &#39;em."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At home, I&#39;ve never connected my TV to my network.  The few firmware updates I&#39;ve needed to do were applied using a thumb drive, and I use an AppleTV as my interface.When I travel, I bring along an AppleTV and plug the HDMI port into their set.  This lets me keep the services I subscribe-to and use them with their display.  This has worked great until my most-recent rental, which had a RokuTV -- presumably setup on Wifi.When content was streaming from my AppleTV, Roku would overlay a panel along the bottom-part of the screen proposing that I can watch what I&#39;m currently watching from a variety of other providers.  This must mean that the TV set is analyzing the video or audio signal to fingerprint what the content contained, then matching it against a library of content to feed into its profile of my use.This is the first time I&#39;ve seen something like this.  I&#39;d always assumed that if you used the TV&#39;s UI and if it was connected to the internet, then you&#39;d probably be subject to their ads and data analysis, but it never crossed my mind that they&#39;d perform the same data-analysis over any signal passing through its silicon.Is this commonplace or is Roku the first of what&#39;s likely to be many doing the same?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So, in a conventional reactor, you use nuclear fission to heat/pressurize water and then use your hot, slightly radioactive steam turn a turbine. This mostly works because moving even very hot, very high pressure water around is kind of a solved problem in industry.In a molten salt reactor, you use nuclear fission to melt various corrosive salts into a fluid, and this is good because molten salts store a lot more energy per unit (volume, presumably?) at low pressures, so you can transfer heat indirectly to nearby turbine-turning water without irradiating the water or relying on high-pressure water to cool your reactor. Cool.But I was under the impression that the main stumbling block for molten salt reactors was that high-energy corrosion resistant materials for containing / moving molten salt simply don&#39;t exist (yet). I suppose this is less of a problem for a research reactor, but it doesn&#39;t sound like there&#39;s been a materials breakthrough here that&#39;s allowing them to get started. Are they just plowing forward and they&#39;ll need to replace the containment infrastructure every few years?"</p>

Continuing to work on such tech just because it could theoretically be used for non-evil purposes is morally bankrupt, and something the industry needs to establish ethical standards to prevent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve recently watched Brazil, and the film has one of the most chilling dystopian views I’ve ever seen because it’s easy to see yourself as part of the machine doing your best just trying to get by.Similarly, I can see how the people working in this software slipped into this- they identified a need in the market with WFH, tried prototypes that were well received on the market, and keep iterating. Many of them legitimately are interested in time tracking and optimization, but of course the market for personal tools like that is very small and lots of employers want to pay you for this because they want more productive employees. Meanwhile the people buying them don’t really know what they are buying, they want to believe they have found a solution to the problem they are terrified of, employees pretending to work and milking them. And the employees exposed to it aren’t in a position of power to change it. And next thing you know we have a dystopian monster with enough funding to be responsible for people’s jobs itself, where no one individual has incentives to buck the curve or much ability to fight back.What’s the solution then? Doctorow mentions unions, and I’d agree that could work. I think there must be another faction to join that doesn’t ruin you, something to compete with the monolith in case the monolith gets sick in this way. Being able to quit and find somewhere else only works if that somewhere else is mostly differentiated by the fact that it doesn’t do these programs you disagree with- many people will put up with this and worse if there is a large pay differential between it and the next option, or if they would have to move and uproot themselves. And if a government gets sick in this way it might not let you quit the country. You have to be able to form collective groups that can bargain with the behemoth, like a union, or political party, or other action that relies on people for it’s power and not capital. That’s one reason why money in politics is so worrying to me, because the way I see it, it messes with this crucial release valve of political action."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great article. On the surface, it&#39;s about Snowflake. At a deeper level, the article is about the perverse incentives motivating SaaS businesses to do seemingly dumb, inefficient things and avoid seemingly obvious optimizations by default.Many SaaS businesses are perfectly happy to let customers shoot themselves in the foot if it generates more revenue. The BigQuery example (presently, by default, `select * from table limit 10` obediently scans the entire table at your expense!) is spot-on.As the article so well puts it, every SaaS company has a vested financial interest &#34;to leave optimization gremlins in.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Snowflake is not expensive. Snowflake is super cheap, IF you know what it is for and how to use it. Compared to if you had to solve the problem on your own.The best way to describe Snowflake is that it is a brute force method to run complex queries without creating indexes.If you have a more traditional database, you will notice you need to set up indexes to be able to get anything from it in finite time. What if you don&#39;t know the indexes upfront? What if you want your users to be able to ask arbitrary queries and get answers before bedtime?That&#39;s what Snowflake is for. It automates using ENORMOUS amount of hardware to get your query executed fast, very inefficiently.It is not for free though. That inefficiency will cause a lot of resources used for queries. It is meant for those few queries when your users try to get some insight into your data and you can&#39;t predict indexes beforehand. Sometimes this is exactly what you want, like when you let your data people in to figure stuff out. Or when you have very rare functionality that allows the user to build their own queries -- which you should avoid like hell (and there are tricks to make it index pretty well) but can&#39;t always avoid.For everything else, whenever you can predict your indexes, you always want to use more traditional database that can be very efficient on queries properly supported by indexes.The issue is a lot of people try to use Snowflake as a database or to support frequently executing queries of the same kind. This is bad and it will cost you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m the author of the article. Didn&#39;t expect it to blow up. Let me clarify a few points:1. I like Snowflake and I think they brought several innovations to the field: Instant scale out/up, time-travel, unstructured data query support. 
2. Snowflake obviously makes innovations and performance improvements, otherwise they would not be the market leader they are. But I&#39;m also suspecting that they make just enough performance improvements to be at par and then use the vendor lock in features to make switching hard.My argument is that their rate of performance innovation has considerably gone down and DataBricks, Firebolt, and open source alternatives just seem more attractive from a cost/performance ratio. I agree that Snowflake is still the best data-warehouse to start with if you have 100k, but not if you truly plan for a multi-year horizon and your usage expands.- Redshift also brought a lot of innovation that allowed people to execute analytical queries 100x-1000x faster than any OLTP that existed out there. I&#39;ve used Redshift for four years and they kept ignoring performance and features until Snowflake came out. All of a sudden because of competitor pressure, they put more effort into the product to maintain and gain market share. My hope is that Snowflake finds a solution to their innovator&#39;s dilemma, since competitors are hot on their tails.- Some people point out that 70% usage growth just shows that Snowflake is useful. Nobody disagrees with that. The issue is that majority of the companies don&#39;t experience a 70% revenue growth to catch up with the growth in costs. At some point, you have to clamp down on costs, which means that you have to look for alternatives to run things more efficiently."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I went to college, having already done full-time software work and countless hours of programming in my spare time, I went to a departmental advisor confidently requesting to test out of the introductory CS classes aimed at first-time programmers. I nearly got laughed out of the room. I pushed the department on this, but it was clear: they simply did not do this. Everyone takes intro to CS. Everyone.It sucks, but there are people out there no smarter than you yet more powerful, and sometimes they impose a speed limit.If you get the opportunity though, I&#39;d still suggest doing what the author did. No harm in learning something twice, particularly from two different perspectives."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read this article a while ago and recently re-listened to his interview on Tim Ferriss&#39; podcast: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnk4sgOFjBQ He talks about how maniacal he was at practicing music at a young age. His friends gave him a hard time because all he wanted to do was practice scales over and over. The dude was exceptionally motivated from a very early age.The gist of this blog post is that the average pace is for chumps and that he was able to finish Berkelee school of music in much less time than the average person takes thanks to studying ahead of time with a mentor and reading the books and testing out. He wasn&#39;t a &#39;chump&#39; and the lesson is that you shouldn&#39;t be either.I remember reading this advice 10 years ago and really taking it to heart. I didn&#39;t want to be a chump afterall and became convinced I could do everything faster than the chumps. But the problem with this is that it can make you beat yourself up and/or always feel rushed if it does take you a normal amount of time to do something. Like I&#39;ve had to admit that I&#39;m a really slow programmer. It took me forever to learn it. And I beat myself up a lot in the process.But now I&#39;ve taken to listening to more Alain de botton and Oliver Burkeman for my self-help/self-development. These British authors advocate for a much gentler version of self help. In one Alain de botton interview, he mentioned how we&#39;ve come to worship exceptionalism and see being average as being bad. Oliver Burkeman&#39;s 4000 weeks book plainly states that you can&#39;t do it all. This has been super refreshing for someone like me who took Sivers&#39; stuff seriously in my early 20s and then beat myself up for merely being average at many things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is good advice to be taken sparingly. I went through the US Navy Nuclear program in which &#34;no speed limit&#34; was taken for granted. I never stopped operating that way until, one day, I had a mental health breakdown (I lasted about ten years). It took two years of therapy to deprogram that mentality from my mind.So yes, it can get you far, but there is a cost to be considered if you don&#39;t keep it under control."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I tried teaching high school CS for the best part of two years in a private school.  Everything to do with the pupils was amazing and I loved every moment.  I am a natural with behaviour management and although it was stressful, every time the bad kids acted up it presented a teachable moment.  You could really feel the impact on their lives and behaviour, well behind the Python and the TCP/IP and while loops.But everything to do with working with other teachers was utter misery.  Never have I met such a cantankerous downtrodden passive aggressive bunch of backstabbing political jobsworths.  Actually, it was probably only one third of the staff that were the hyper negative old timers, but they had such a dismal impact on me it felt like everyone was cut from the same cliquey snobby cloth.  Imagine the worst, most power hungry, little-napoleon office manager you’ve ever had and then imagine one in three of the staff have that mindset.It drove me mad and I’m now a SWE again but also volunteering at a youth center in our most deprived part of town and loving it.  I can have impact with the kids, and as a volunteer I seem to command much more respect from parents than a lowly teacher.So now I am tainted too — if I hear you are a teacher then I will see before me someone who at best tolerates that level of crappiness in their workplace, and at worst actively takes part in it.  Neither leave me with much respect for you, but I know why you do it: the kids."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am an early-retired EE and I thought that I could have a second career in teaching HS physics.  I got the MA Teaching in Maryland, and did my one year student teaching assignment.  My thoughts:1. The degree program was decent, although a certificate program would be better for prior professionals if the law allowed it (lower cost, too much wasted time in redundant classes).2. Teachers are sad.  Very sad.  They are underpaid and overworked, even at the better suburban high schools.  Parents treat them poorly, even when they are veteran teachers with lots of experience.3. In general, the public resents that teachers get “3 months off” in the summer.  I believe that this is the justification for lower pay.  It is silly, because teachers work more in 9 months than most professionals and they also pay for things out of their own pockets.  They also counsel and tutor students after school.  It’s a difficult job.4. In my job interviews, the first and most important qualification was “classroom control.”  Math, science, engineering, life experience were all distant seconds.  Teachers—-even in advanced math and science classes—-are first and foremost caretakers.  Think about that for a second…5. What is the current model for education based on?  There are several competing historical arguments, but the salient factors like student-teacher ratio, subjects, grades, facilities, etc. are based on economics and legal requirements.  The quality of either a student’s experience or a teacher’s experience is not very high on the list.  Education is about checking a box on a list of requirements that was developed 150+ years ago.Ultimately, I decided to tutor rather than to teach in a classroom.  I consider this a personal disappointment, although I learned a lot from the educational experience.  I wish there could be a “town hall” type of discussion to consider ways to improve the situation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Former HS math teacher here. It was the hardest job I’ve ever had. I still have nightmares about being back in the classroom 18 years later. I was easily working 12+ hours a day doing class planning, grading, etc. not to mention the actual teaching. Returning to programming my pay doubled and my stress level dropped profoundly. Teacher pay should easily be double what it is.(And about that summers off—with the exception of teachers who had non-teaching spouses or those in the back third of their career, everyone worked summer jobs to make ends meet.)"</p>

					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32529113">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To clarify what this means, since things can get confusing with subtle differences in wordings:* stage1 is when zig is built from C++ code[1] (the &#34;bootstrap&#34; compiler) using system C/C++ compiler toolchain.* stage2 is when zig is built from Zig code[2] using stage1.* stage3 is when zig is rebuilt from the same Zig code[2] using stage2.Before today, zig would give you stage1 by default, and you could opt in to stage2 using `-fno-stage1`.
After today, zig gives you stage3 by default, and you can opt in to stage1 using `-fstage1`.In all three cases, LLVM is being used. Although Zig has started to fully self-host by providing backends that have no dependency on LLVM, none of these fully self-hosted backends are complete.Why bother self-hosting? Because:* Zig produces smaller, faster binaries than C++ that use less memory[4]. Case in point: the new self-hosted compiler is 1.5x faster than the C++ implementation and uses 3x less peak RAM.* Development velocity in Zig is much faster than C++, and debugging is a breeze in comparison due to Zig being much safer than C++ and having better debug tooling. Similarly, comptime features let us add more assertions and debug checks that are not possible in C++.* Zig compiles much faster than C++.* Zig cross compiles better than C++ making it easier to create builds of the compiler for every target.* The self-hosted compiler does not need a softfloat library dependency to support f16 or f128 operations.* Zig&#39;s std lib data structures are incredibly useful, especially compared to the C++ STL.There are still many known bugs; not every project will be able to upgrade immediately. See the full upgrade guide [3] for help deciding when and how to upgrade.[1]: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/tree/master/src/stage1[2]: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/tree/master/src[3]: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/Self-Hosted-Compiler-Upg...[4]: https://media.handmade-seattle.com/practical-data-oriented-d..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Memory usage is improved by a factor of about 3x. For Zig, building itself went from using 9.1 GiB to 2.7 GiB.Pretty impressive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I never understood why &#34;self-hosting&#34; is considered a good thing.
Sure, the compiler developers can write in their favorite language and I guess it means the language is stable enough to be used in a complex project; however requiring an (older) compiler to build the compiler seems a significant complication for software distributions.You either have to set up an ever increasing chain of compilers, as the complexity of the language and the features required to build the compiler grows, or rely on pre-existing binaries. Either way, it seems like a nightmare compared to keeping it in plain old C and building with any compiler of your choice.
Just Imagine if any project did this, like, building Firefox now requires an existing Firefox installation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I understand the problem here and I sympathize with professors in these circumstances. Learning the fundamentals will remain important. But as others have pointed out: if students are unwilling to learn, or are taking shortcuts, it will ultimately hurt them in the long run.One thing tho is that things like Copilot put the lie to the hypothesis (propagated mostly by the Google-style job interview) that intensely coding clever for-loops to perform algorithmic magic (for things usually already in the standard library) is the best measure of the competence of a software developer. If it can literally be done by a machine, maybe we should be measuring based on something else. Especially since this kind of thing is best done on the job by looking in a good textbook or using the standard library. Probably grading at the university level needs to consider this also.I haven&#39;t used Copilot. I doubt I&#39;m its intended audience. After 30 years, actually writing code is perhaps the easiest part of my job. The mechanics is the easy part. The big picture thinking and figuring how to get it all together into a system is the hard part (and honestly there are plenty of people far better at it than I am). Now, if we get a Copilot for that ... then our profession is in trouble."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While it is true code pilot is quite amazing and can produce some very decent snippets, if the exercice you give is specific enought (using a special database schema, file format, or API), with objectives that are not common (ask the user specific questions, and draw conclusions out of it or react to events), then it cannot produce a fully working program. I use code pilot regularly now, and it does speed up my work, but I can&#39;t do anything with it without understanding the problem at hand.There is nothing wrong with the student assemblings and fixing parts of code that exist. Doing that requires understanding those parts, how they interacts and what you can do with them. It&#39;s not killing tests. Plus as professionals, we all do that anyway. Heck, I learned doing that. I&#39;m paid doing that.However, there is something wrong with academic exercices that I see in the wild. Things that are very abstracts, requiring way more than programming knowledge, or stuff that are asked out of context completely. Students are both understimulated, and given too hard bites to chew. It&#39;s a terrible way to learn, and to be tested IMO.Tests nowaday don&#39;t tests for knowledge, they test either for compliance, or act as a filter instead of a feedback loop. This is not education.In fact, I&#39;ve yet to see school IT course that I didn&#39;t find deeply flawed, and I completely understand the students for cheating at them to that they can suffer as little as possible. They are not given a chance to prove themself or progress, they are not respected. They are forced fed junk and asked to spit it back all shiny.I remember when I was a student, and I went to 11 different schools because of my twisted life. They all sucked. And I say that as I spent half my student life at the top of my class grade ladder.I regret having cheated so rarely now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cheating is getting easier by the day, but the bottom line is that if the student is cheating, they&#39;re probably not absorbing the coursework (or if they are cheating and absorbing the coursework, there might be something wrong with the coursework).The most effective policy might not be to try and mechanically prevent cheating, but to explain that, this is information that you&#39;re going to need if you actually want to go into the field and if you&#39;re using copilot here you are damaging yourself in the long run.Maybe it&#39;s not fair to give as good grades to students who are cheating on assignments as those who are actually doing the assignments, but at the end of the day is the purpose of the course to measure the student or to teach the student?"</p>

				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32509268">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The trouble with TDD is that quite often we don&#39;t really know how our programs are going to work when we start writing them, and often make design choices iteratively as we start to realize how our software should behave.This ultimately means, what most programmers intuitively know, that it&#39;s impossible to write adequate test coverage up front (since we don&#39;t even really know how we want the program to behave) or worse, test coverage gets in the way of the iterative design process. In theory TDD should work as part of that iterative design, but in practice it means a growing collection of broken tests and tests for parts of the program that end up being completely irrelevant.The obvious exception to this, where I still use TDD, is when implementing a well defined spec. Anytime you need to build a library to match an existing protocol, well documented api, or even an non-trivial mathematical function, TDD is a tremendous boon. But this is only because the program behavior is well defined.The times where I&#39;ve used TDD and it makes sense it&#39;s be a tremendous productivity increase. If you&#39;re implementing some standard you can basically write the tests to confirm you understand how the protocol/api/function works.Unfortunately most software is just not well defined up front."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"TDD use would be a lot different if people actually bothered to read the entirety of Kent Beck&#39;s _Test Driven Development: By Example_. It&#39;s a lot to ask, because it is such a terribly written book, but there is one particular sentence where Beck gives it away:&gt; This has happened to me several times while writing this book. I would get the code a bit twisted. “But I have to finish the book. The children are starving, and the bill collectors are pounding on the door.”Instead of realizing that Kent Beck stretched out an article-sized idea into an entire book, because he makes his money writing vague books on vague &#34;methodology&#34; that are really advertising brochures for his corporate training seminars, people actually took the thing seriously and legitimately believed that you (yes, you) should write all code that way.So a technique that is sometimes useful for refactoring and sometimes useful for writing new code got cargo-culted into a no-exceptions-this-is-how-you-must-do-all-your-work Law by people that don&#39;t really understand what they are doing anymore or why. Don&#39;t let the TDD zealots ruin TDD."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The main reason TDD hasn&#39;t caught on is there&#39;s no evidence it makes a big difference in the grand scheme of things. You can&#39;t operationalize it at scale either. There is no metric or objective test that you can run code through that will give you a number in [0, 1] that tells you the TDDness of the code. So if you decide to use TDD in your business, you can&#39;t tell the degree of compliance with the initiative or correlation with any business metrics you care about. The customers can&#39;t tell if the product was developed with TDD.Short of looking over every developer&#39;s shoulder, how do you actually know the extent to which TDD is being practiced as prescribed? (red, green, refactor) Code review? How do you validate your code reviewer&#39;s ability to identify TDD code? What if someone submits working tested code; but, you smell it&#39;s not TDD, what then? Tell them to pretend they didn&#39;t write it and start over with the correct process? What part of the development process to you start to practice it? Do you make the R&amp;D people do it? Do you make the prototypers do it? What if the prototype got shipped into production?Because of all this, even if the programmers really do write good TDD code, the business people still can&#39;t trust you, they still have to QA test all your stuff. Because they can&#39;t measure TDD, they have no idea when you are doing it. Maybe you did TDD for the last release; but, are starting to slip? Who knows, just QA the product anyways.I like his characterization of TDD as a technique. That&#39;s exactly what it is, a tool you use when the situation calls for it. It&#39;s a fantastic technique when you need it."</p>

As a Lisper I’m always intrigued by Clojure but as someone with no knowLedge of or desire to learn to JVM I stayed away since I figured eventually I’d hit JVM questions/issues I frankly didn’t feel like dealing with.Is it really 100 percent compatible with Clojure or is that just aspirational.Also, is it the case that lots of libraries/workflows outside the core language in Clojure assume Java integration?  I always thought a big Clojure selling point was the awesomeness of Lisp while having full access to the libraries of Java."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the most interesting applications of ODEs (in my opinion) is the field of control theory, which empowers autonomous systems/robots/vehicles to guide themselves. Brian Douglas has some fantastic introductory videos on the subject [1].I don&#39;t think I agree completely with section 5 (Forget About Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions). For an ODE in the form xdot = f(t,x), existence and uniqueness on an interval follows if f is continuous in t and Lipschitz continuous in x [2]. This often isn&#39;t too difficult to demonstrate for a given system. In addition, if you can&#39;t prove uniqueness of solutions then you likely have to treat the system as a differential inclusion [3]. I personally find differential inclusions fascinating, but the math can be much more dense.[1]: https://engineeringmedia.com/videos[2]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picard%E2%80%93Lindel%C3%B6f...[3]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_inclusion"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; 7. stay away from differentialsI always had issues with this. My undergraduate math classes were very formal and well thought, every object was defined, almost all theorems were proved in class.In particular, we were taught differential equations theories, some general theories like systems of differential equations with constant coefficients, Cauchy&#39;s theorem, and a bunch of recipes.In a separate class, we were also taught differential forms (e.g. a.dx + b.dy being a linear combination of base elements dx and dy - if I remember well).But then came the physics class, why we could go from dy/dx = f(x) to dy = f(x).dx and integrate both sides remain a mystery. &#34;dx&#34; suddenly became an infinitely small things, when it used to be a notation for a linear form OR a notation for f&#39;(x) === df/dx.Generally speaking, I had a lot of issues in physics because the maths used in that context were not formally defined and seemed to obey to some unwritten set of rules that you were supposed to find out by yourself during your final exam..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find the following remark by Rota interesting:Insofar as the Laplace transform goes, two radically different uses of the word “function”
are dangerously confused with each other. The first is the ordinary notion of function as a
something that has a graph. The second is the radically different notion of function as density, whether mass density or probability density. For the sake of the argument, let us agree
to call this second kind of function “density function.” Professional mathematicians have
avoided facing up to density functions by a variety of escapes, such as Stieltjes integrals,
measures, etc. But the fact is that the current notation for density functions in physics and
engineering is provably superior, and we had better face up to it squarelyI&#39;ve suggested to mathematicians that the notation  ⌠             
  | f(x) dμ(x)
  ⌡             

in measure theory where μ is a measure should be replaced with  ⌠             
  | f(x)⋅μ(x) dx
  ⌡             

where the measure μ is treated as a density function. What I&#39;ve found is a mixture of either not understanding the logic, or the response &#34;What&#39;s the point?&#34; So it&#39;s interesting seeing Gian-Carlo Rota suggest the same idea AFAICT.As a bonus, the Radon-Nikodym &#34;derivative&#34; would be written as μ/λ instead of dμ/dλ. The RN derivative then doesn&#39;t appear like a derivative - it looks simply like division."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Shazam is one of the very few apps in the past 20 years that STILL &#34;wows&#34; me. I have no idea how the tech works, and I even sort of like not knowing, to be honest. It&#39;s one of the very few apps out there that still in exist in a &#34;magical&#34; way to me. I am constantly impressed with how fast/easy it works, even with very obscure music. What an amazing app.Fun quick related story, about 10 or more years ago there was a back tracking song on a TV show (Scrubs) that I really liked that was only in the Netflix version. It was just an instrumental song with some French sounding words speaking in it so there was no easy way to search for it. However, it was distinct enough that it didn&#39;t seem like something made just for the show. It was also pretty quiet and under some talking in the tv show scene. I had posted on reddit asking if anyone knew it, and never got any responses. I searched all over the web, but no source had the track details. It drove me crazy every time I would hear the song in re-watching the show, and I still could not track it down every few years when I tried again. Back then, Shazam had no cataloging of it so it wasn&#39;t in there either yet. However, when re-watching it a few years back again, I tried Shazam again and to my surprise it finally worked. I was blown away that Shazam was finally able to solve this 10+ year mystery. It was one of the coolest feelings every to scratch that itch finding this rare French song and hearing it in full. It was truly magical.EDIT: Oh sorry, I didn&#39;t think anyone would actually care about the song itself lol It was called &#34;Sans Hésitation&#34; by the French-Canadian band &#34;Chapeaumelon&#34;. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju4d3YQhByU - It&#39;s also interesting cause now the song does in the episode in tv music database sites. Very cool."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a relevant story here. The inventor of the Shazam algorithm, Avery Wang, gave me a demo of it within a couple weeks of it being created. Here is the backstory (partly from personal knowledge, partly relayed by Avery).Avery had gotten his PhD from CCRMA at Stanford under Julius O Smith. His PhD had been on the topic of automatically (&#34;blind&#34;) recovery of individual vocal/instrument tracks from a final mix. From there he joined a startup, Chromatic Research, where I was also at. He created lots of code and patented some algorithms related to resampling and MIDI synthesis, stuff like that. Avery was (and is) a super nice guy, humble but incredibly smart -- he could work not only with the high level mathematics but was also equally excited to fine tune assembly code.After Chromatic folded, Avery had been struggling to get his own startup off the ground. About the same time, the Shazam guys had the idea for the product but didn&#39;t know how to create the algorithm. They approached Smith at CCRMA looking for someone capable of creating something that worked. Smith suggested they try Avery Wang.At first Avery said, &#34;Hmm, that seems difficult, but let me think about it.&#34; Within a week he had a demo running on a few thousand songs he had gathered from CDs. I&#39;m sure a lot of refinements went into it after that, but the core idea took him a weekend.[ All factual mistakes above are due to me and 20 year old memories -- if I misrepresented something it certainly wasn&#39;t due to Avery telling me something that wasn&#39;t true ]EDIT: A blurb about Avery

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; August 2002: Shazam launches as a text message service based in the UK. At the time, users could identify songs by dialing “2580” on their phone and holding it up as a song played. They were then sent an SMS message telling them the song title and the name of the artist.Incredible! Curious to know what exactly happened backend after it listened to the audio, and what hardware it ran on."</p>

If you don&#39;t have more than 6U or so of equipment, it&#39;s really the way to go because of its minimal profile and amazing load-bearing ability: it is load-bearing parallel to the direction of gravitational pull (vs regular rack cabinets where the load is perpendicular to the posts), and then that weight is all redirected towards the wall, so even the heaviest servers or whatnot that would normally sag unless it comes with rear-mountable rails for 4-post racks (which, for some reason, very few do) work amazingly well. I&#39;ve bought a few of this StarTech one [0] over the years, but I&#39;ve also seen people weld together a couple of metal struts to accomplish the same.[0]: https://amzn.to/3QTmVee"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just opened one 2 weekends ago. I bought a kit (because of the really nice bottles), but then ignored the instructions and found significantly better recipes online. First time I&#39;ve fermented one, and it came out gloriously.I&#39;m proud of the result because it tastes nothing like other hot sauces I&#39;ve had (and there have been very many!), but also doesn&#39;t taste the least bit strange or out-of-place. I expected it to taste like Tabasco, but it came out more like Hunan because of a much darker flavour.I also make regular hot sauces with fruits and herbs that I forage from the neighbourhood. My current dipper is a slightly smokey medium heat made with morita, cascabel and guajira peppers, plum-like damson fruit and some wild mint that I lovingly call &#34;ditch-mint&#34; because that&#39;s where I found it. It would probably work fermented, but I&#39;ve only tried fermenting once so far.Once you get the connection with how certain ingredients alter the taste and texture when combined, you can pretty much wing it as you go. The more complex, the better. There is a balance, and you quickly learn flavourful vinegars / citrus, and sweeteners (brown sugar/honey/maple) will balance out just about any amount of spices and herbs. It&#39;s very rewarding if you like hot sauces, dips, marinades, etc, and the results will pretty much always make you feel like an old pro."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I started making fermented hot sauce during COVID in 2020. There&#39;s a fancy grocery store near me that sells scorpions, ghosts, and reapers, as well as burdock, tamarind, mango, etc. I usually fermented for a week, and I&#39;ve tried longer with little difference. I made an entire spreadsheet full of recipes that I tried, but ultimately I thought the fermented sour flavor overwhelmed everything. So, I started making them without fermenting, but with a little cooking to help break down some of the fruits and veggies and blend the flavors, and suddenly everything tasted 10x better. I was surprised, because for some reason I got it in my head that hot sauce must be fermented, when that&#39;s totally not true. Anyway, my $0.02 on fermenting hotsauce."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A link to a great resource for learning about peppers and fermentation, replete with many good recipes: https://m.youtube.com/c/Chillichump (Chilli Chump)Edit for intriguing experiment of mine: I originally began experimenting with fermented chillis due to a suspected h-pylori infection. My reasons were a) h-pylori seems to swim away from capsaicin, possibly encouraging it to develop an excessive biofilm, thus contributing to its own isolation, b) capsaicin, despite its apparent burning effect, can be helpful with ulcers due in part to encouraging healthy mucous formation and c) the lactobacillus and other probiotic factors involved. I believe this was critical in abolishing a rather nasty ulcer that nearly debilitated me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is delightful! I believe these sums-of-powers formulas can be derived fairly easily with discrete calculus techniques (it&#39;s in Knuth&#39;s Concrete Mathematics, IIRC), but to see a purely geometric approach succeed is fascinating.To understand why this technique works with sums of arbitrary powers, the key is to show that summing together rotations of simplices gets you a simplex of constant values. The following geometric argument works:1. Think of the numbers in the simplex as a function f(x) of the coordinate vector x for the space the simplex is embedded in. Observe that f is linear.2. A linear function on a simplex is determined uniquely by the values it takes at the vertices. Specifically, the value at any point is a weighted average of vertex point values.3. If we create a &#34;sum simplex&#34; by summing together all possible rotations of the simplex, the result will also be a linear function on a simplex, and the values at all the vertices will be the same by symmetry.4. Therefore, the linear function giving the values of the sum simplex is constant.A rigorous proof could be developed by considering the standard simplex generated by the coordinate unit vectors, but scaled by a factor of n. For example, the equilateral triangle is the 2D simplex generated by connecting the vertices at (n,0,0), (0,n,0), (0,0,n). On this simplex, the integral points (x,y,z), where the coordinates x,y,z are integers, are the points assigned numbers in the blog post. &#34;Rotations&#34; are done by switching coordinate axes (actually a reflection), which preserves the integral points."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The importance of this subject is underestimated and applies as well quite independently of whether humans eat the insects directly or not. Consider the cuban tree frog for example, which has long since initiated its campaign in Florida to host and spread throughout the food chain the rat lungworm nematode. Rat lungworm (angiostrongylus) holds its own in the burgeoning presence of hideous and hostile parasites. It is highly infectious to many species and no picky eater, as it favors the entire body of the host, the brain and all. Burmese pythons are another up and coming host in Florida, and while they might prefer a provincial life in the everglades, many other species will meander north and onward. There are other nasties from nematodes to cestodes and more, gaining new ground. Baylisascaris procyonis is another terrible nematode found almost anywhere in the US, mostly in racoons, but in other species (humans included) with more varying and less frequency and it&#39;s often incurable. A study showed that, if I remember correctly, 40 out of 250 wildlife rehabilitation personnel had been exposed, but symptoms varied by exposure load. Both rat lungworm and baylis ascaris are resistant to environmental elements that normally break things down, with baylis even surviving UV light, formaldehyde and extreme cold. Rat lungworm can be deposited on surfaces (eg vegetables),  and snails are common vectors. Lungworm is very difficult to remove by washing while baylis is so adhesive that wildlife control authorities advise disposing of rather than washing shovels or tools exposed to racoon latrines. The list goes merrily along with other nasties, but it would require time to refresh my memory and accurately describe more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Larger animals can be inspected individually to find pathogens or diseases.Insects are so small that it&#39;s practically impossible to inspect each individual organism. You can do sampling of the batch, but the odds of missing bad ones are still high.Same with the fruits and vegetables, some are easy to inspect, others are almost impossible, or impossible to clean. There are kosher (insect-free) versions of lettuce and some berries which are much more expensive than non-kosher ones.Lastly, disgust is a part of the human immune system. Religious dietary laws and cultural taboos are probably partly developed from disgust, and partly from trial-and-error."</p>

I’ll have to go in deeper later to really understand the implications of each parasite, but my main takeaway is that my intuition here was way off. I expected insects to pose far fewer risks from parasites to humans.I wouldn’t have taken a chance based on that assumption, and cooking bugs seems like it would eliminate most of these pathogens, but still. I figured it would be safer.I’d need to read a lot more to draw some kind of comparison between insects and animal agriculture (both seem to carry plenty of baggage), but it’s great to see research like this so it’s possible to begin doing so."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love technical content like this. Not only is it incredibly interesting and informative, it also serves as a perfect counterpoint to the popular &#34;why does Netflix need X thousand engineers, I could build it in a weekend&#34; sentiment that is frequently brought up on forums like this one.Building software and productionalizing/scaling it are two very different problems, and the latter is far more difficult. Running a successful company always requires an unlimited number of very smart people who are willing to get their hands dirty optimizing every aspect of the product and business. Too many people today think that programming starts and ends at pulling a dozen popular libraries and making some API calls."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have some experience serving static content and working with CDNs. Here is what I find interesting / unique here:- They are not using OS page cache or any memory caching for that, every request is served directly from disks. This seems possible only when requests are spread between may NVMe disks since single high-end NVMe like Micron 9300 PRO has max 3.5GB/s read speed (or 28Gbps) - far less than 800Gbps. Looks like it works ok for long-tail content but what about new hot content everybody wants to watch at the day of release? Do they spread the same content over multiple disks for this purpose?- Async I/O resolves issues with nginx process stalling because of disk read operation but only after you&#39;ve already opened the file. Depending on FS / number of files / other FS activities, directory structure opening the file can block for significant time and there is no async open() AFAIK. How they resolve that? Are we assuming i-node cache contains all i-nodes and open() time is insignificant? Or are they configuring nginx() with large open file cache?- TLS for streamed media was necessary because browsers started to complain about non-TLS content. But that makes things sooo complicated as we see in the presentation (kTLS is 50% of CPU usage before moving to encryption offloaded by NIC). One has to remember that the content is most probably already encrypted (DRM), we just add another layer of encryption / authentication. TLS for media segments make so little sens IMO.- When you relay on encryption or TCP offloading by NIC you are stuck with that is possible with your NIC. I guess no HTTP/3 over UDP or fancy congestion control optimization in TCP until the vendor somehow implements it in the hardware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of the reasons they&#39;ve had to build most of this stuff themselfs is because they decided for some reason to use freeBSD.The NUMA work they did, I remember being in a meeting with them as a Linux Developer at Intel at the time. They bought NVMe drives or were saying they were going to buy NVMe drives from Intel which got them access to &#34;on the ground&#34; kernel developers and CPU people from Intel. Instead of talking about NVMe they spent the entire meeting asking us about howt the Linux kernel handles NUMA and corner cases around memory and scheudling. If I recall correctly I think they asked if we could help them upstream BSD code for NVMe and NUMA. I think in that meeting there was even some L9 or super high up NUMA CPU guy from Hillsborough they some how convinced to join.The conversation and technical discussion was quite fun, but it was sort of funny to us at the time they were having to do all this work on the BSD kernel that was solved years ago for linux.Technical debt I guess."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This sucks... I&#39;m sorry you had to go through this. The App Store review process is just pretty bad. It&#39;s especially frustrating when you see downright shitty apps on the store. The &#34;black-box&#34; aspect of it makes it that much more kafkaesque too.When I first submitted my app on there, they rejected it and complained that I used HealthKit but didn&#39;t mention it in the app description. The thing is, I did. My app description had a list of &#34;highlighted features&#34;, one them being &#34;Apple health integration&#34;.I was about to file an appeal, but then I saw a couple other apps with &#34;Integrates with Apple Health&#34; on its own line in the description. Figured that&#39;s probably what they were looking for (even though the guidelines don&#39;t explicitly say that) so I changed it and boom, the app was approved. I hate it, but it&#39;s not worth my time or the risk to fight it.For what it&#39;s worth, I think your app looks really good!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yep, I got this rejection when I made this tipping app (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tip-69/id1460610078).I went on to add OCR detection for receipts so you don&#39;t have to type in the amount, I added more tipping modes, I added split bill functionality, and eventually added an entire social network with the ability to share your receipt for the world to see, like or comment on.Must have spent months trying to get approved by Apple.I&#39;d rather no one ask me why."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They&#39;ve done this since the early days of the app store. Mostly-content apps without really broad appeal have long carried a high risk of rejection.&gt; Homescreen widgets: utterly useless, but can&#39;t get more iOS-y and less webapp-y than this, right?This especially, but really the whole post reads like the system working as intended.Granted (as the author notes) way too much shit gets through anyway, but that&#39;s not an excuse to do even worse. I do, as a user, wish they&#39;d tighten up the rules a lot and improve enforcement. I&#39;m quite sure it&#39;d improve my experience on the store (and probably on the web—imagine how much better the Reddit site would get, probably overnight, if their app got pulled over not being well-justified)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At a previous job, I was the engineering manager for a new neo-bank and was on call 24/7 for it. I have a beefy Lenovo P52 that I hated carrying around and leaving in my car lest it get stolen. So I got a GPD Pocket. It fit very well into my back pocket.Not only did it work great for emergency situations (I ran Ubuntu MATE as well) when I needed to SSH into machines, check stuff on Datadog, edit code to make a quick fix, push code to our K8S environments and more, but I actually found myself frequently at coffee shops and bars coding away happily on it. It brought a certain amount of freedom and cool factor with it. It was a delightful little device with a very sharp and crisp screen, a surprisingly useful keyboard that combined well with my i3 environment, that I could actually be productive on (save for running our test suite which took around 30 minutes and sucked the life out of the battery). It also got a lot of onlookers asking questions about it, leading to those ever so fun random conversations that can lead to night long friendships over wine and coffee.I genuinely miss it and will probably pick up another one now that I just got hired as a CTO for another project with equally demanding on-call schedules and uptime requirements. Although I don&#39;t drink anymore so none of those fun conversations. Ce la vie."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Micro PC is a really cool device, but owning one I couldn&#39;t really recommend it outside a very small niche.Form factor, ports, and performance are all great. The firmware is very frustrating though. Mine shipped with a newer firmware (4.18) than was available to download, and it was miserable. The machine would power on to blank screens, and have random crashes. I was wary of downgrading because I couldn&#39;t put the &#34;newer&#34; firmware back on.Finally gave in and stability was much improved on 4.13. Boot issues still happen though (less frequently). They seem possibly exasperated by Linux. It can require 3 or 4 attempts at holding the power button to force a reset. Unplug anything that could be back-feeding power so it will actually reset (not confirmed). Just all around annoying if you power it on and off a lot.Other issues to consider. The hinge support is somewhat fragile. I try to be gentle opening and closing. I think I also put some epoxy around the plastic screwhole pillar. The battery has a permanent over-discharge cutoff that a number of users have hit so I&#39;ve been careful to keep a charge on it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Had one for three years. Use it nearly every day, but I work with embedded systems in robots/industrial machinery. One handed operation, tons of IO, dual boot, fits in back pocket etc. have made this indispensable.One dead battery, replacement part from alibaba via GPD rep given link. Easy to disassemble via screwdriver and spudger. Works great now. Injection molded piece that held the threads where the hinge attached also failed. Drilled a little pinhole and added a small machine screw, nut and threadlocker. No more problems. Nut goes under the plastic hinge cover. The fix is literally better than original.Other than that, the only issue I&#39;ve had is getting grub to see the screen as landscape. Grub config options seem to get ignored. Oh well. Standard rotation is sorted with boot scripts and the OEM Windows 10 side works great."</p>

I did some Ruby-on-Rails development back in the day, and yeah... It&#39;s all completely un-runnable now. But that mostly seems to be a Rails-specific issue, where the ecosystem was downright hostile to calcification of APIs, workflows, and core tools. A person could publish a whole book and have 50% of its recommendations obsoleted within two years. That has to be demoralizing for an educator and communicator. Contrast that massively with Windows binaries that still run that were built against operating system versions that existed before college graduates were born.Various other ecosystems lack the high-speed code churn problem. I think even the Ruby ecosystem has cooled from its white-hot molten state a decade ago."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m very optimistic for near-term AGI (10 years or less). Even just a few years ago most in the field would have said that it&#39;s an &#34;unknown unknown&#34;, we didn&#39;t have the theory or the models, there was no path forward and so it was impossible to predict.Now we have a fairly concrete idea of what a potential AGI might look like - an RL agent that uses a large transformer.The issue is that unlike supervised training you need to simulate the environment along with the agent, so this requires a magnitude more compute compared to LLMs. That&#39;s why I think it will still be large corporate labs that will make the most progress in this field."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As someone who has recruited hundreds of candidates at this point I would urge caution with lists like this.By all means read the list, but rather than trying to grind through as many of the questions as possible, try to use it as inspiration and think of what you&#39;re actually curious about and which might tip you over one way or the other if you&#39;re on the fence. It&#39;s far better to have a good conversation about 1 thing which might affect your decision than a superficial sprint through a bunch of topics you don&#39;t actually care that much about.Secondly, consider that if you do well you are likely to have multiple rounds of interviews.  Think about which questions are likely to be most enlightening when you ask each interviewer.  Don&#39;t shy away from asking 2 people the same question if you think you&#39;ll get different perspectives. If you ask a peer engineer the diversity questions you may well get quite a different answer from asking the HR/recruiting person for instance (eg one might give you a cultural insight vs the other might just give you the policy/factual answer).I once interviewed a candidate[1] who had printed off a whole list like this and insisted on grinding through the whole thing.  It was weirdly offputting, but he was such a monster programmer that he was already a clear hire. It gave an insight into the thoroughness of his nature though and showed that he was absolutely perfect for the (critical) role we were hiring him for where mistakes were extremely costly.[1] Hi Fluffy! If you see this I hope you&#39;re doing well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m obviously cherry picking, but if an applicant asks me a series of questions akin to &#34;what source control tool do you use and why&#34; I&#39;m going to begin doubting that this person can focus on actually shipping product. There&#39;s this whole scene of people who do performative, almost theatrical, quality programming but nigh on forgot how to actually ship features, and questions like those are a hint they might be in that camp.EDIT: to add some context, i run a small startup, we need the whole team able to ship. I can imagine that in certain bureaucratic bigcorps, performatively obsessing on code/process quality can be useful, because the distance between the programmer and the customer/user is so long."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of the comments in here are reacting to the large list of questions being very off-putting. There&#39;s a deeper issue here that we still don&#39;t have a good answer for: it is incredibly hard to tell what a company is like until you start working there, and asking questions either leads to very surface-level answers or just flat out catfishing candidates. Companies being transparent and detailed about how they operate is the exception.The company gets to spend 3+ hours finding out information about a candidate, but the candidate has little option to discover company culture for themselves. They can snoop around on LinkedIn but this doesn&#39;t answer much about culture unless there is someone who is prolifically producing content inside the company. There&#39;s glassdoor which might answer part of it but generally the reviews there are extremely shallow and biased by the skills, mindset, and treatment of whoever wrote the review.So what&#39;s the answer? I think &#34;ask targeted questions&#34; is fine as long as it is not &#34;ask 100 general questions&#34;. I haven&#39;t seen a single article on the meta of how to pick what questions to ask or how to get past shallow answers. I also think the entire industry is performing pretty terrible in this space and we don&#39;t have a good answer for how to handle it that is common or even well-known. This leads to lost candidates or (intentionally or unintentionally) catfished candidates who will leave after joining."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So I&#39;m just at the tail end of a project where I&#39;m attempting to build a collaborative text editor, and it&#39;s been absolute hell. I figured it would be a tricky problem, but I had no idea how far down the rabbit hole goes. I kept thinking, gosh, there&#39;s gotta be a backend service that bakes this in, if there isn&#39;t it would be a great business opportunity.I almost want to scrap all of my code and move it to Supabase. Congrats to the team on this launch, very cool.edit: actually, after thinking it through, I&#39;m not clear on what Supabase is calling multiplayer. Presence is one thing, but when I think multiplayer, I&#39;m thinking conflict resolution. Is this an OT/CRDT implementation? Or is it just presence?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"hey hn, supabase ceo herewe&#39;re excited about this release - it adds a few neat features to our Realtime server[0]. For those who don&#39;t read the post (it&#39;s quite long), our Realtime server was initially built for subscribing to Postgres changes via websockets. We&#39;ve added Broadcast functionality (for &#34;ephemeral&#34; messages that don&#39;t need to be persisted to Postgres) and Presence (similar to Broadcasts, but it retains an eventually-consistent state between users).We were planning a larger write-up with all the technical details but it became a bit long. Some highlights:- Realtime is built with Elixir an Phoenix[1]- We&#39;ve moved to a single, global cluster
- We&#39;re using `Phoenix.Tracker` to globally distribute the Erlang PIDs of all of our Postgres connections. This guarantees there is only a single connection to each database.- We&#39;ve implemented a &#34;leaky-bucket&#34; rate-limiter using Erlang&#39;s `:counters` module[3] for &#34;per tenant&#34; rate-limiting. We&#39;ll move this to a global rate-limiter in the future- We&#39;re currently seeing ~2000 concurrent connected users - it will be interesting to see what this spikes up to now that this is on HNIt&#39;s still in heavy development, and we&#39;ll make sure to detail all the choices we take as we continue solve problems. A few of the Realtime team will be here answer questions - @chasers, @wenbo, @abc3erl.[0] Realtime: https://github.com/supabase/realtime[1] Phoenix Framework: https://www.phoenixframework.org/[2] rate limiter: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket[3] :counters: https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/counters.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really neat, I have been keeping an eye on Supabase, this (presence) is the feature that will finally push me to build a side project with it. I have one in mind.Anyone from Supabase here, do you have any plans to build in support for CRDT toolkits such as Yjs or AutoMerge for these features? It would make working with them so much easer if there was a plug and play backend.The one other thing I would love to see next from them is an offline sync product, so you could partially sync a users dataset to their device and save back any changes later (bonus points for then combing that with CRDTs). Maybe the WASM Postgres yesterday [0] could be a foundation for such a product.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32498435"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m not OP, but the timing context of this post is important:Today, California has issued a FlexAlert, and Powerwalls in PG&amp;E and SCE will start discharging at 6pm to help reduce load on the grid. It&#39;s not a daily action, but it&#39;s emergency support when the grid needs it the most.And the time window when it happens is important: Powerwalls are contributing to  to reduce load when the grid needs it the most. It&#39;s not meant to support the entire grid, just directly attack the problem at the time where every Watt and Watt-hour counts.You don&#39;t need to own Powerwall to benefit from this, just like how you don&#39;t own the peaker plants that typically spark up at these times. You benefit because there&#39;s a big chance that there won&#39;t be rolling blackouts in California this afternoon—distributed assets like this can be dispatched.Dispatch Info: https://twitter.com/AlexGuichet/status/1559748677626777600A VPP tracker in the Tesla community: https://www.lastbulb.com/virtual-power-plantSome technical details of how Tesla VPPs work, as organized distributed systems: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggdYts4muu0CAISO Grid Outlook: https://www.caiso.com/TodaysOutlook/Pages/default.aspx"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m contemplating enrolling in this.Right now I&#39;m a net generator, even with our 100 deg days, but I am not 100% off grid. The Panels charge the Powerwall during the day, the Powerwall is drained overnight.The batteries currently do not survive the night. Even though the house cools down, it retains enough heat that the AC still kicks on, thus draining the battery. Note my AC is 78 all day/night. We got a thing from the power company &#34;do these things on this day and get power credits by lowering your usage&#34;, and, of course, we already do all that...no credits for us!So typically during transition at dawn, I pull in grid power.But I&#39;m still a net generator, they get more than I take.The concern was simply if I enroll in this, then the batteries kick in and drain even before the evening, and I go to grid power sooner.But, thinking about it, &#34;I don&#39;t care&#34;. It&#39;s an offset. They&#39;re draining because they need the load NOW, and I can provide it. Later, when things settle down, I&#39;ll pull it back.I think this works out, simply as a &#34;be a good citizen&#34;, use my battery to prevent someone in Fresno&#39;s AC browning out late in the heat of the afternoon.Maybe I&#39;m just being whimsical, but I&#39;m still thinking about it.Also thinking about bolting on another battery, I already have two."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Quick math shows a long range Model 3 has about six times as much battery capacity as a Powerwall. I’m willing to bet more people have Model 3’s than Powerwalls. And I’m willing to bet 16% of your car’s battery capacity will impact you far less than 100% of your Powerwall.F-150 Lightning called it right: EV’s should ship with grid-tie inverting."</p>

There is little to no constitutional protection for free speech in Australia and defamation is routinely employed successfully in fairly speculative situations (for example, politicians, as public figures, suing journalists they don&#39;t like). Every time a question comes up like this it is genuinely an unknown what the court will do and no clear precedent suggesting they weigh potential broad impact of decisions heavily in their judgement.So this could easily have come down the other way and we could have a precedent suggesting potential liability for literally anybody who links to anything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hyperlinking can still be constrained by other laws. So, this has high specificity as I see it. The specific constraints applied in the suit which led to the High Court have been found not to apply.I don&#39;t have a list of what do, I just hypothesise there could be other constraints. Private agreements, CSAM laws, IPR laws, which go to why you cannot provide a hyperlink.Not a Lawyer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Low profile ergonomic mechanical keyboard is a pretty deep hole to dive into.
You can design your own PCB, order it from manufacturer and build the exact keyboard you want (split, wireless, with knobs, any form and key count).
It is not for everyone and might require soldering, but possibilities are endless.Additional resources:- r/ErgoMechBoards: https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/- Low Profile Discord: https://discord.com/invite/dBSRZ2a- Collection of split low profile mechanical keyboards: https://kbd.news/tag/low-profile/- &#34;A Tiny, Ultra-Affordable Keyboard You Can Build Yourself!&#34; video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqpBKuEVinw"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks fantastic!A thought-experiment that may interest you coming from someone (me) who already has happily spent several hundreds of dollars on mechanical keyboards and uses them every single day:Let&#39;s imagine the keyboard could be bought today as-is with a simple &#34;Buy Now&#34; button and price was no concern.The two main reasons I would _still_ hesitate to hit that button are:1. I absolutely and undoubtedly need to know what it SOUNDS and FEELS like. Is it linear, tactile, clicky? How much? I turned my speakers to max because I assumed you&#39;d have some audio-track running but to no avail. Did I miss something?2. I wish there was a &#39;blank&#39; version with zero typography anywhere. Just all black. I touch-type and have not looked at my keyboard in 15 years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I guess this is a good place to share my open source large format laser cutter design for sewing projects. It’s cheap to make, works pretty well, and the whole gantry assembly slides right off leaving just a sheet of plywood with low profile 3D printed rails on the sides. So I throw my rug over it and it becomes my floor when not in use. Important because the laser cutter can cut a full 60” wide piece of fabric two yards long. It’s basically 5 foot by 6 foot, and I don’t have space in my apartment for a dedicated machine that takes up all that space. But since this doubles as my floor it works great! Also includes a raspberry pi camera on the laser head which serves as a pattern scanner. I really want to finish my video on this thing, I’ve just been busy. But please take a look and considering building it! If you have any questions open a GitHub issue and I will do everything I can to help. I think it’s a great starting point (designed in three weeks) and I’d LOVE for other people to reproduce it and extend the design! The machine has a few hiccups but I use it all the time for my sewing projects and it is SO nice to get all the cutting done repeatably and automatically. You can even scan existing clothes often without disassembly and turn those in to digital patterns!https://github.com/tlalexander/large_format_laser_cutter"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Didn&#39;t expect to see sewing patterns on HN, but not complaining, this looks really cool!While on the topic, my girlfriend recently showed me this site: https://freesewing.org . It&#39;s fully open source and all the patterns are actually parametric, meaning you can customize the patterns to exact body measurements. Their custom JS framework for designing patters as well as the rest of the platform is MIT licensed [0] and the patterns are all Creative Commons.[0] https://github.com/freesewing/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the British Army every subunit is entitled to train someone in sewing and using sewing machines so that they can repair the subunit’s clothes and webbing equipment, including in the field. It’s a very creative course and people come back able to build you all kinds of rigs and pouches and things like this from webbing and Cordura that are extremely robust. The soldiers are all super keen to get on the course and to learn to sew."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really appreciate this post and how it highlights the power of becoming involved in occupation. I use that term in the context of the fact that my spouse is an Occupational Therapist by trade. In that field, the term occupation refers to a collection of activities of daily living, not a &#34;job&#34; per se. Rather than seeing patients through a framework of diagnosis or disability, they look at activities and people&#39;s ability to perform them, and intervene where there is lack. In practice that may involve helping an amputee learn how to put on socks, or helping an autistic child participate in education. More broadly, a central philosophy of their field is that meaningful occupation is a powerful motivator that has cascading effects across the many component activities in somebody&#39;s daily life. OP&#39;s post described how becoming involved as a Guix contributor effectively organized and motivated other areas of their life as well. The fact that we all are here hanging out on a VC&#39;s forum tends to color our idea of what value means. I think this post inspires that there is value to not only the community but also the individual as well in just &#34;doing cool stuff&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not a developer but I totally relate to this. Most of my creative pursuits are weird, niche, sometimes avant-garde. If I didn&#39;t make my artifacts, nobody else would, and it is so intrinsically rewarding to see my visions instantiated, even if they pale in comparison to my first imagining of what they might be. Because I have fringe-y interests, most people don&#39;t necessarily &#34;get&#34; it. (Probably true of everyone else on HN as well.) But the people who do get it, I found them on the internet, and I thank God for that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I believe already some 2 decades ago Bill Gates said that the biggest failure in software is the lack of productivity gains in software development.Just to cherry pick a dramatized example. In the late 90s, one of my first programming experiences was in Delphi. It&#39;s a very visual way to program. You drag and drop a UI together from standardized elements. You could data bind things like input fields to a data source. You&#39;d double click a button and it takes you to the already created &#34;onclick&#34; event where you do the actual coding. In a way, this is still similar to how you can &#34;program&#34; Microsoft Access today.In this same period (I was in a computer science study) I was moaning to my teacher how tricky programming in C was. I made tiny memory management errors crashing the entire PC, with zero debug output.His words: &#34;Don&#39;t worry. By the time you get to work, you&#39;ll just do modeling&#34;.Now I work on the web. It&#39;s been 30 years since Delphi and instead of productivity gains, we&#39;ve taken steps in the opposite direction. There is no standardized UI library. JavaScript has no standard library. There&#39;s no single unified architecture. There&#39;s no standard tool chain. It&#39;s all very low level after which we stitch together fragile semi-abstractions.I know it&#39;s an imperfect comparison, but I hope it gets the point across. It&#39;s all far too low level and fragile.This doesn&#39;t just hurt productivity, also accessibility. It&#39;s simply not beginner friendly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great post - the one word missing, &#34;maintenance.&#34; Most programming work is done maintaining/enhancing existing code. The greenfield work is a piece of cake by comparison.You want to do the hard stuff? Maintain existing code you&#39;re not familiar with.The problems around maintaining unfamiliar code are huge, largely unsolved, expensive and risky. There&#39;s a little branch of computer science called Program Comprehension and no one pays any attention. Though most programming money is spent on maintenance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been programming for over 30 years, and never been as productive as before. Need to load and decode a jpeg/png, I grab stb_image.h. Need to decode an ogg file, libogg. Need to decompress, libz. Need to decode video, libavformat. Need physics, libbullet. Need truetype fonts, freetype. Need a GUI, Qt. Need SSL, libssl.My day becomes selecting libraries, integrating them, and testing integration. My business code is &lt; 20% of our entire codebase. And I’m much more productive in 2022 than in 1992."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Aside from running Ceph as my day job, I have a 9-node Ceph cluster on Rasberry Pi 4s at home that I&#39;ve been running for a year now, and I&#39;m slowly starting to move things away from ZFS to this cluster as my main storage.My setup is individual nodes, with 2.5&#34; external HDDs (mostly SMR), so I actually get sligtly better performance than this cluster, and I&#39;m using 4+2 erasure coding for the main data pool for CephFS.CephFS has so far been incredibly stable and all my Linux laptops reconnect to it after sleep with no issues (in this regard it&#39;s better than NFS).I like this setup a lot better now than ZFS, and I&#39;m slowly starting to migrate away from ZFS, and now I&#39;m even thinking of setting up a second Ceph cluster.  The best thing with Ceph is that I can do a maintenance on a node at any time and storage availability is never affected, with ZFS I&#39;ve always dreaded any kind of upgrade, and any reboot requires an outage.  Plus with Ceph I can add just one disk at a time to the cluster and disks don&#39;t have to be the same size.  Also, I can move the physical nodes individually to a different part of my home, change switches and network cabling without an outage now.  It&#39;s a nice feeling."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Man, Ceph really doesn&#39;t get enough love. For all the distributed systems hype out there - be it Kubernetes or blockchains or serverless - the ol&#39; rock solid distributed storage systems sat in the background iterating like crazy.We had a huge Rook/Ceph installation in the early days of our startup before we killed off the product that used it (sadly). It did explode under some rare unusual cases, but I sometimes miss it! For folks who aren&#39;t aware, a rough TLDR is that Ceph is to ZFS/LVM what Kubernetes is to containers.This seems like a very cool board for a Ceph lab - although - extremely expensive - and I say that as someone who sells very expensive Raspberry Pi based computers!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I will once again lament the fact that WD Labs built SBCs that sat with their hard drives to make them individual CEPH nodes but never took the hardware to production.  It seems to me there&#39;s still a market for SBCs that could serve a CEPH OSD on a per-device basis, although with ever increasing density in the storage and hyperconverged space that&#39;s probably more of a small business or prosumer solution."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Housing in the US has gotten to where it is due to horrible laws effectively allowing total tax avoidance for landlords.Take some investment property. You buy it at some basis price, let&#39;s say 500k. You rent it out for 15k a year. Each year you can offset your rental income against deprecation of the property and property taxes - meaning, you pay no income tax on your rental income.~30 years later, you&#39;ve deprecated it down to an effective value of $0, so you hypothetically would have to start paying taxes on your rental income(of course, you can still deduct property taxes against that). What do you do? Well, there&#39;s something called a 1031 exchange - this lets you sell an investment property, and as long as the funds go directly into another investment property, you pay no capital gains taxes. So guess what? You can buy a brand new investment property with a new(albeit adjusted) cost basis, and you can start the entire cycle of depreciation and deduction all over again on your new, more expensive, property.So, you&#39;ve now held this property your entire life, and you die and pass it to your kids - well, great news, unless your estate is over 12 million dollars(and double that for a married couple), you pay no estate taxes.  And even more fun - when you inherit property, the cost basis is &#34;reset&#34; to the present day value of the property at time of inheritance - So your children can now rent the property out, deprecate it, and pay no income tax on the rental income either, and continue the cycle.The net result is that rental properties generate a ton of income for the owners, who pay almost nothing in taxes. Even if they do pay property tax, property tax rates are generally much lower than income tax rates."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a simple problem, we turned housing into an investment.  Now everyone who owns a home is incentivized to ensure their investment is maximized and that results in a lot of NIMBYism.  The simple solution is we need more housing in cities and suburbs.  How we get there is an exercise that&#39;s taken on by local housing authorities and they are not incentivized to solve the problem.  That&#39;s because they work for voters who are currently living in the area opposed to future people who aren&#39;t contributing to the vote.States are going to have to step in and override cities that aren&#39;t being effective, this cannot be solved from the federal level.  They are going to have to say, these permitting processes are too restrictive, homeowners can add backyard units or convert their homes to duplexes/etc, and make it easy for apartment builders to buy a few homes to make small apartment complexes even if the neighborhood hates it or the city has been stalling on that kind of development."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fraud protection of credit cards is the root of modern e-commerce. In some ways, Visa and Mastercard are the privatized court systems of the internet.If I end up on a random, self-hosted ecommerce site and decide to make a purchase - what guarantee do I have that the item will show up or be as-described? If I bought something through a bank transfer, reversing that purchase would be incredibly difficult. And, suing a merchant is prohibitively slow, expensive, and arduous.Also, modern B2C SaaS is built on credit card subscriptions. The ability for a merchant to pull payments on a recurring basis from a credit card requires an incredible amount of trust. If consumers had to push payment every month or year to continue subscriptions (instead of having it automatically debited), then churn rates would skyrocket and modern SaaS multiples would crash - taking company valuations with it.So, I&#39;m sure online merchants are happy to keep paying their ~3% fees as long as sales continue. Nobody wants to go back to &#34;Cash on Delivery&#34;, and nobody wants to hire workers to knock on doors asking for bills to be paid."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Living in New York City, I&#39;ve noticed that there are a whole lot of businesses that are either cash-only or card-only.I always understood the cash-only ones. If you can get plenty of customers who are willing to pay in cash, why would you want to pay credit card fees?The card-only ones were harder for me to understand, until I realized that handling cash costs money, too. Somebody needs to count it all at least once a day, if not more. Employees can steal it. Robbers can steal it. You need a safe. You need cash registers. You need to get the cash deposited in the bank, by paying someone to go do that. You need to maintain an inventory of smaller bills and coins to make change. You need to train people on all of this.Even just the accounting costs might make up the 2-3 percent in fees. &#34;Your register said you made $150 in cash that day, but the deposit that night was only $135.&#34; That&#39;s what you pay accountants to deal with, rather than just exporting from your Square account to Quickbooks or whatever.I had this realization because I went to a new coffee shop that had opened up. It appeared to be owned and operated by just one lady, and she was really nice. So, as I normally do for the nice local business owners in my neighborhood, I got out some cash instead of a card, thinking it would benefit her business. But then she told me they were card-only and it dawned on me: she&#39;s just one lady running a store by herself, _of course_ she doesn&#39;t want to deal with cash.So, I&#39;m not sure the 2-3 percent fees are all that bad, though I could be convinced otherwise. Plenty of small business owners seem pretty happy just setting up a Square reader and not dealing with the headache of cash. I think there&#39;s a lot of value in that for them."</p>

It breaks up one of the &#34;long poles&#34; in the project schedule.Hardware buttons and switches have to be designed, tested, re-designed, and validated very early in the process of designing a new model so that there is time to figure out how to manufacture / source all the parts, how they integrate with the rest of the car&#39;s systems, and how they&#39;ll be wired and assembled.  Just imagine what the impact would be if late in the process a new feature needs to be added!  Pretty much forget about it, add it in the next major model refresh.With a touchscreen all those dependencies go away.  The hardware team just says &#34;there&#39;s going to be an iPad sized capacitive touch screen here for climate/infotainment, and another custom sized display here for the instrument cluster&#34;.  The software guys can independently do the design of the UI, changing things down to the very last moment, or even after the last moment if the car can be updated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1121372_why-mazda-is-pur...Mazda learned it already and prefers HUDs. Tactile interfaces (buttons, wheels, keyboards...) perform generally better when well arranged. Mercedes did a good job about that thirty years ago. Logical layout, one button one task, LEDs within a button representing the status and the buttons arranged in the layout of the seat.I wonder how a complete industry just assumed that touchscreens are somewhat better just because their widespread in smartphones. Smartphone are small devices, require visual attention, every app is different and distracts the users, touchscreens are cheap and - therefore working on them is slow. Apple and Lenovo tried both the add a &#34;TouchBar&#34; but the tacticle keyboard has proven to be better. Apple tried also a touch area in Apple Remote, the current one is back to tactile buttons ;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I drive a 2007 pre-touchscreen car, and have told the dealer every time I go in for service (yeah, yeah) that I will hold on to this car until the bitter end because it has physical buttons. I tell them &#34;I can &#39;touch type&#39; this car&#34; i.e. I never need to take my eyes off the road in order make a critical adjustment.I&#39;ve driven a LOT of rental cars in the last 5 years, and the de-standardization of the interface elements -- even how to shift!, increasing distraction and eye-aversion has made the highway driving experience much worse - both as a driver and someone who has to share the roads with distracted people baffled by their cars."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks like not a reskin of an existing FreeBSD or Linux windows system, but an actual reimplementation of macOS. Very interesting if they can pull it off!I wonder though, why start with old Objective-C cocoa APIs instead of Swift?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really hope they build some kind of application registry, including listing projects that don&#39;t yet work on RavynOS, so that the community can see which packages are most in-demand, what % of apps that people want are supported, reviews from others on stability for the platform, etc.Could bootstrap this by looking at everything in Homebrew (including casks) and sharing whether it seems to work on RavynOS yet (or whether it&#39;s ambiguous, and how you can help disambiguate)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Personally I find this kind of idea to be a dead end, since so much of what makes macOS special is really beyond the capabilities of anyone other than Apple. For example, total vertical integration, e.g. calling up kernel team and ask them to make a change for WebKit. SerenityOS also does this because Andreas Kling worked at Apple, realising that vertical integration is fundamental. But then there are other things, like incredible hardware integration with things like the trackpad and CoreAudio, as well as precise control over the CPU and power. I&#39;ll be interested to see if this goes anywhere but in my opinion there are better places to go, such as for example SerenityOS, which I think is a kind of operating system that is far more suitable for the space of people who don&#39;t want to buy Apple.I&#39;m generally a bit sceptical of this &#34;copy macOS&#34; idea. It isn&#39;t a particularly amazing operating system, it is mainly just very well supported by third parties considering that it is a unix. You won&#39;t have that if you recreate it in this way, and I&#39;m not sure if you will be left with a very good experience."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Craig here from Crunchy. Pretty excited to ship this. It started with one of our engineers showing up in slack 6 weeks ago &#34;So I did something crazy over the weekend...&#34; from there it evolved into much more.The post explains a lot of the high level, but we&#39;re going to being doing some deeper dives as well including the build process, but also some of how the tutorials are powered by an internal notion doc which allows us to easily iterate and collaborate on the tutorials themselves.Perhaps our favorite easter egg is that you can bring your own SQL into it for example: https://www.crunchydata.com/developers/playground?sql=https:..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is so awesome for two reasons, Postgress isn&#39;t exactly easy to setup, this makes it so much easer for tutorials, anything that makes teaching it quicker is good!It&#39;s also an amazing demonstration of the power of WASM, I am utterly convinced that DBs running in browser via WASM on top of the &#34;coming soon&#34; filesystem/block store api [0] will be the future of all offline first apps. I think it&#39;s going to be SQLite that really sines here (it will be a smaller package), but if you can run Postgres in browser, you potentially have a close alignment between your server and browser implementations.I love the idea of running Django in browser via PyScript with Postgres!0: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileSystem - This API doesn&#39;t grant access to the users file system, but a local virtual one just for the website. It will operate at the block level so can be used to provide efficient persistent storage for WASM DBs.—Edit rather than replying individually:It’s so important when teaching people a new thing, like sql, to hit the ground running. A lot of these people will have no experience with Docker, package managers or compiling from source. It’s so important to make technology accessible to all. This does that! Imagine high school kids having a lesson on SQL and running Postgres’s just by opening a webpage!We shouldn’t assume that someone learning Postgres, or just SQL via it, is a developer with experience of other areas of development or system administration."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sometimes non-accounting people get hung-up on the words &#34;debit&#34; and &#34;credit&#34; and think they have to do with &#34;owing&#34; or &#34;being owed&#34; money. The effect of a debit or credit on the business depends on the accounts in the transaction and debit and credit don&#39;t have anything to do with the &#34;direction&#34; of a flow of money.My 100-level accounting instructor summarized it as: &#34;A debit is the entry in the left column, and a credit is an entry in the right column.&#34; Without the context of the specific accounts being debited or credited the terms themselves mean nothing.Aside: A 100-level knowledge of accounting can confer near &#34;super powers&#34; when it comes to dealing with finance and accounting people. Double-entry bookkeeping is one of the oldest and longest-practiced &#34;IT&#34; disciplines. Your work probably touches revenue / expenses for your employer and someday you&#39;ll need to interface with accounting or finance people. Being able to speak the language, even poorly, has helped me gain trust and credibility that I don&#39;t believe speaking only in IT terms would have."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Any time the idea of double entry bookkeeping comes up there is nothing but unanimous advocacy for it. This thread echoes the same sentiment where there&#39;s several comments about the importance of double entry. And yet like all previous endorsements I&#39;ve heard, I&#39;ve not been able to take away why it is so important. The reasons are always around error tracking, tracing source of funds, standing the test of time etc. and yet in my head I&#39;m not able to envision the specific problem double entry can solve that single entry cannot.Somewhere in my head I feel a double entry system makes sense if you have two different parties making respective entry. But if it&#39;s all with a single party, single entry system should be equivalent to a double entry system. My accounting concepts are weak so I&#39;m unable to justify. Hoping someone with more expertise can shed some light here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s good to see Martijn Braam fought the good fight on things like the PinePhone Pro bootloader in eMMC, and I&#39;m sorry to hear the situation became untenable.After Pine64 went to all the trouble to make a series of branded early developer editions for various distros, and ongoing community goodwill outreaches, I didn&#39;t expect something like this to happen.IMHO, any handheld hardware right now wanting to be open and sustainable Linux should probably start by making sure it&#39;s solid with PostmarketOS configured with a mainline kernel, as a good test.  (PostmarketOS is a litmus test for purity, and has had a bunch of work to make bringing it up easier than the usual server/desktop purity test of Debian.)  Working Phosh and Plasma userlands running atop PostmarketOS are good further tests.  Supporting additional distros, userlands, and hacking is also important.(Even if the hardware is something like the Purism Librem 5, which has invested heavily in lots of good distro work, if PostmarketOS with mainline kernel boots cleanly and runs solidly, that&#39;s a good sign.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unless PINE64 changes course hard, I think this will be the moment they died, so to say. They may keep making SBCs etc alongside other vendors but the phones/tablets/laptops/watches/etc would continue being novelties and realistically majority e-waste. Really quite sad. If I&#39;d name one single person in the FLOSS community who&#39;s done the most good for mobile open source, it&#39;d be OP. Thank you so much for your service, work, and patience up until now.I fail to understand the reasoning of PINE64 on stuff like this recently. It&#39;s like they became a spiritually fundamentally different company. Can&#39;t see how this is supposed to make them money either.&gt; Now I can just focus on making postmarketOS work better. On the PINE64 hardware, and all the many other devices supported by postmarketOS...Maybe not so terrible after all. For a while there I almost thought pmOS was"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just wanted to say thanks to Martijn Braam for all the work he&#39;s put into PostmarketOS along with the other pmOS devs. I was lucky enough to snag a pinetab when the first batch was released, and I was blown away by the quality of pmOS.This was my first taste of mobile Linux, and pmOS was easily the best distro I used on it in terms of documentation, install tools, performance, and package selection. pmOS has the advantage of being more mature than other mobile Linux distros, but all the work they&#39;ve put in over the years has really paid off and helped make the ecosystem more viable, so thank you!I&#39;m really sad to learn about this with Pine64, I had a hint of this when I saw there has never been a second batch of pinetabs and no communication about it (at least that I saw). I had no idea it was this bad though and this makes zero sense why they would kill the ecosystem they spent so long building. It sounds like the decision was made purely based on reducing user support requests? Even though someone that buys one of these is likely to be a tinkerer/hacker with prior experience with *nix and distros already have their own community support channels and would already be doing most of that work for free?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One topic I&#39;d like to see more discussion around is how best to set up staging environments for Docker Compose projects.Ever since the V2 migration, I&#39;ve been banging my head against multiple bugs in Docker Compose itself, which has severely damaged my trust in it as a production-ready utility. I no longer feel like I can safely update Compose without running extensive testing on each release.For example, my journey since migrating to V2 has been:* Originally on 1.29.2  - Stable and I did not encounter any issues.

* Swapped to 2.3.3.  - As part of the migration from V1, docker-compose lost track of several networks and started labeling them as external. Not a huge deal.

  - docker-compose stopped updating containers when the underlying image or configuration changed (#9291). This broke prod for a while until I noticed nothing was getting updated.

* Updated to 2.7.0, which was the latest release at the time.  - This introduced a subtle bug with env_file parsing (#9636), which again broke prod in subtle ways that took a while to figure out.

* Updated to 2.8.0, which was the latest release at the time and before the warning was put up.  * This broke a lot of things as it renamed containers and generated duplicate services, etc.

* Finally swapped to 2.9.0. No issues yet, but I&#39;m keeping an eye out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like to divide up my compose files into three:1. A `docker-compose.yaml` for basic configuration common among all environments2.

A `docker-compose.prod.yaml` for configuration overrides specific to productionThen I have `COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yaml:docker-compose.dev.yaml` in my `.env` file in the root of the project so I can just run `docker compose up` in dev, and `COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yaml:docker-compose.prod.yaml` in a `prod.env` file so I can run `docker compose --env-file=prod.env up` in production. Sometimes also a `staging.env` file which is identical to `prod.env` but with a few different environment variables.It&#39;s been working pretty well for me so far."</p>

Nothing fancy or tiring, I stop just before I feel any type of resistance or &#34;burn&#34;.This happens 5-8 times a day. On weekends I do none of that.Of course It&#39;s anecdotal but my body has FOR SURE changed.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked at a company where this was an issue at one point (granted this was one situation among a lot of employees).  A manager was pretty much dismissive of everything anyone of a lower caste did / wouldn&#39;t communicate with them effectively.HR absolutely struggled with the issue.  The HR folks tasked with dealing with discrimination issues largely had spent their time constructing company wide emails and classes that revolved around white folks discriminating against others / concepts of privilege, absolutely froze when faced with a discrimination issue outside that stereotype.Long story short legal eventually was the brave one and decided that yes it was discrimination and the manager in question was asked to move on.  The folks he refused to work with were compensated and their status in the company (pay scale, etc) was corrected.As one of my Indian college&#39;s observed about the manager in question &#34;If he was white this would have been dealt with sooner.&#34;Credit to my Indian coworkers who really pushed this issue with HR and made legal act in the end.  They wanted nothing to do with this kind of  behavior."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Out of curiosity, for Indians working in America, how hard is it to hide your caste or pretend to be of another caste altogether?Is this something that comes up in conversation among Indians? Do names tend to correlate to you caste? And if so, do people change them as a way of hiding their family caste?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My dad once told me of how at his work (in the 1980s or early 1990s, I think), they had a team of two Indians assigned to a project. One turned out to be of a much &#34;higher&#34; caste than the other, and refused to work with the other, making him utterly useless to the project.It&#39;s good that Apple, IBM and other tech companies are taking steps to prevent this sort of discrimination. It&#39;s a shame that Google seems be going in the opposite direction."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My 2c (not exhaustive for what you want to do, probably):1) Get some statistics/probability basics. It&#39;s full of people (you can see a lot of analyses on Kaggle) that &#34;do machine learning&#34; but make very silly mistakes (e.g. turn categorical data into a float and use it as a continuous variable when training a model).2) take a look at traditional machine learning approaches. Nowadays you&#39;re swamped by DL (a lot of good suggestions on this thread, I won&#39;t chime in), and you miss the fact that, sometimes, a simple decision tree, or dimensionality reduction approaches (e.g. PCA or ICA) can yield an incredible value in a very short time on huge datasets.I had written a fairly short post about it when I finished my georgia tech path https://www.franzoni.eu/machine-learning-a-sound-primer/3) It can take a lot of time to become effective in ML, effective as in, what you _manually create_ is as effective as picking an existing trained model, fine tune it, and use it. This can be frustrating: low hanging fruits are pretty powerful and you don&#39;t need to understand a lot about ML algorithms to pick them up.4) Consider MOOCs or online classes. I took Georgia Tech OMSCS, I can vouch for it and some classes force you to be a data scientist and read papers as well, and you can have &#34;real world&#34; recognition and discuss with your peers, which is useful!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work in ML - I might make 3 buckets for ML careers right now:1. ML/DL Researcher2. Data scientist - 20/80 engineering vs modelling3. ML Eng - 50/50 (or 70/30) engineering vs modellingPeople suggesting working in engineering to support ML are right that there&#39;s a lot of demand, but it&#39;s not what you&#39;re asking for.Becoming an ML/DL researcher working on novel techniques or new models will be hard without academic research experience. Few companies are big enough to support true research, and the ones that are have a very high bar even for people with PHDsWhat I call &#34;data scientists&#34; apply math/ML to real problems. The people I see here have a quantitative background like physics/math/CS. Often they have more general quantitative skills that go beyond ML. People like this will might work on things like fraud where an eng pipeline exists and small improvements in the model are valuable.There are more of these roles than &#34;true research&#34; and they exist at small companies because it&#39;s applied. You can get into this with demonstrated evidence in side projects + a convincing background, but professional education might be the most sure way.Finally - there&#39;s a lot of demand for engineers who can do both modeling and the requisite engineering. A model is a small part of what goes into a production ML feature - you need a data pipeline, automated retraining/prediction, a place to deploy the model, monitoring on eng stats + data stats, and the usual application backend/frontend to do something with the results.You might be able to get into this with some demonstrated experience in side projects assuming you&#39;re a SWE already, and depending on your standards for where you want to work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can I suggest a longer, but (I think) better route?Try the Data/ML Engineer route. Instead of going directly into ML, try to work as a “supporter” of those doing ML. There’s a HUGE gap there, specially if you’re a good programmer.There are a lot of people in the “pure” ML space, people with science background, with phDs, etc.But there’s not enough people to support them: taking their models to producing, building their pipelines, etc.If you get into Data/ML engineer, you’ll be working with these people and learning from them.It’s a longer route for sure, but I think it can yield the highest success rate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can provide some details regarding the times things did break that I mentioned in the article.* In September 2014, X broke, and I created an `/etc/X11/Xwrapper.config` file with the lines `allowed_users = anybody` and `needs_root_rights = yes` to get it to work again. I don&#39;t remember and don&#39;t have notes on why that helped. It sure does sound like a pretty terrible hack. I don&#39;t have that Xwrapper.config file anymore, and I also don&#39;t know when I deleted it.* In June 2017, audio stopped working, but all I had to do was add my user to the `audio` group.* In May 2018, X broke a second time. This time I downgraded the `xorg-server-common` and `xorg-server` packages. A few weeks later, I ran another system upgrade, and this one went fine.These weren&#39;t the only problems, but they were the most disruptive. Generally, things like TrackPoint driver updates changing how the cursor responds or Firefox changing its UI have been far more annoying than Arch Linux issues :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I always reinstall from scratch although I could just Debian &#34;dist upgrade&#34;.  My thinking is this: if, ten years ago, I somehow missed a security patch or some 0-day owned my machine before it was patched, then I&#39;d potentially have been copying / dd&#39;ing / rsync&#39;ing a rootkit for ten years.By installing from scratch at every new stable (or unstable) release, I get rid of a lot of potential security issues.Now as an anecdote: ten years with the same install is nice but...  I&#39;ve got a dedicated server at OVH with 3400 days of uptime.  You read that correctly.  Nearly ten years of uptime.  Once in a while I give temporary ssh access to people here and there just so they can type &#34;uptime&#34; and see.  Kids: don&#39;t try this at home.  Yes, it&#39;s insecure (although there&#39;s a firewall and only the SSH port open).  No, it doesn&#39;t do much nor is it very useful.  But it&#39;s fun to think I own one of the computer in the world with the biggest uptime.I plan to kill it once it reaches ten years \o/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I stuck with Ubuntu (eventually Kubuntu) for many years because I thought it was the best for a no-fuss distro for folks who wanted things to just work (TM). I was afraid of things randomly breaking and interrupting my daily work. One day I eventually bit the bullet and installed Arch instead. The experience has been phenomenal, and if anything it feels more stable than Ubuntu. I was underestimating my own Linux knowledge, and it really isn&#39;t difficult to setup/configure at all if you have a reasonable understanding of how Linux works. The initial installation can be done by just following one of the many YouTube videos that break down the process step by step - you may even learn something if you don&#39;t already know it. I can&#39;t ever see myself going back."</p>

And the fee increases every month that they don&#39;t tell us. This is a pretty good deterrent.Is it? It sounds like a pretty good deterrent to being honest...!Anyway, I can&#39;t argue with the figures, if true."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s kinda funny how strategy and tactics can cross over between totally unrelated businesses.We&#39;ve taken a pretty similar approach to keeping companies honest. What we realized was that in niche markets, trust drives transactions and people are often aware that burning relationships for short-term gain has a drastic impact on lifetime value, especially if there are strong network effects.Fortunately, we&#39;ve only had to threaten to use the contractual stick a handful of times, and in each case, the mere appearance of the stick in the conversation served to recalibrate things, bringing the dialogue back to the fair center.The cold start problem is real and one that really took us a lot of time and effort. The time spent to understand the mechanics of our marketplace manually paid itself back later on, when we realized that it helped us understand churn, and specifically how to mitigate it.Enjoy the read!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So they went from scaled down Concorde configuration :https://www.airway.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Boom_Ov...to a very scaled down Boeing 2707-300 configuration :https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_2707(that tiny fin tho...). While reducing cruise speed to 1.7 mach.
I see no visible changes to deal with the sonic booms problem.
So operation would be like Concorde I suppose, subsonic (or hi-subsonic) over land and
Supersonic over ocean only. Unless the super-rich manage the regulation to change.EDIT : ah yes :) &#34;2x FASTER OVER WATER&#34; and &#34;20% FASTER OVER LAND&#34;...Also : Maybe good to remember that 18 airlines had once placed orders for Concorde, with only the 2 national carriers flying it in service eventually. And that The Boeing 2707 was ordered by 27 airlines before the program being canceled…"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Overture is being designed to carry 65 to 80 passengers at Mach 1.7 over water — or twice the speed of today’s fastest commercial aircraft — with a range of 4,250 nautical miles. Optimized for speed, safety and sustainability, Overture is also being designed to fly more than 600 routes around the world in as little as half the time. Flying from Miami to London in just under five hours and Los Angeles to Honolulu in three hours are among the many possibilities.Probably will be very expensive but it&#39;s exciting for future possibilities"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Strong FOMO settling in. Premium transatlantic routes routes like NYC-LHR are super important to the bottom line of the big legacy carriers. If one airline has supersonic and others don’t that could be a huge blow to the others.Of course things didn’t work out that way with Concorde, which was not commercially successful and more of a spectacle than something founded in business fundamentals. But if Boom can make supersonic passenger travel economics work out it would certainly be hugely disruptive."</p>

You got a newbie interested in the field!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is the first I have heard of Raft, but enjoyed the animations and ideas. I work on multi-node radio communications for ag automation. I had two questions after watching this:- Is Raft alone in this space, or are there other popular algorithms/libraries that fill the same space?- What happens when the node count gets larger than a handful? What happens when you hit hundreds or even thousands of nodes, that are trying to achieve consensus? In particular, the part where all of the nodes respond (semi) simultaneously to a broadcast node. In a radio spectrum world, that would be a disaster. N:1 communication slots are choke points for timely communication."</p>
