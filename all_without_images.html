								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Along with this, vertical scaling is severely underrated. You can do a lot and possibly everything ever for your company with vertical scaling. It would apply to 99% of the companies or even more.Edit:
Since people are confused, here is how StackOverflow handles of all of its web operations. If SO can run with this, so can your 0.33 req/minute app which is mostly doomed for failure. I am only half joking.StackOverflow architecture, current load (it will surprise you): https://stackexchange.com/performanceEverytime you go to SO, it hits one of these 9 web servers and all data on SO sits on those 2 massive SQL servers. That&#39;s pretty amazing.I want to be clear though, Horizontal scaling has a place in companies that has a team of corporate lawyers. Big. And in many many other scenarios for ETL and backend microservices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author is not lying. I&#39;ve been learning docker and it is certainly nice to pull and docker-compose up for local dev, but there is a lot to learn when you factor in orchestrators. And when I mean learn, I mean actually learning the nuts and bolts of a Dockerfile and not copy/pasting shit from the internet. While it&#39;s all helpful, its certainly not needed for the project we have at work, nor the &#34;microservices&#34; that our lead thinks we need even though they aren&#39;t even microservices. All we&#39;ve done is split our application into seperate mini applications that don&#39;t talk to eachother at all, essentially 4 web services. Great! Sigh.So why am I learning all this instead of just programming? Programming is what I really want to do all day, just writing code and thinking through software architecture. Because the industry tells me if I don&#39;t learn this stuff I will be decommissioned. Fun stuff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s super simple and it works for you - yeay! great!
If it will continue to work for you - double yeay!However, as soon as I read, I saw a lot of red flags:- Do you really want to copy from a development computer to your production?  No staging at all? (&#34;go test&#34; doesn&#39;t mean that you have 0 bugs)- Are you really sure that everything works exactly the same on different versions of GoLang? (Hey, a new guy in your company just installed unreleased Go 1.17, build on his notebook and pushed to production)?- That VM with systemd died at 1am. No customers for you until 7am (when you wake up)BTW. I am not saying that you should do Docker or CICD. The thing which I am saying that when you cut out from your process too much, you are increasing risks. (As an example, you didn&#39;t remove unit tests part. Based on &#34;Anything that doesn’t directly serve that goal is a complication&#34; you probably should have. However, you decided that it would be way too much risk)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can&#39;t speak to the 4700u or the pangolin specifically, but I can offer this perspective on PopOS/AMD:I&#39;ve been using System76&#39;s PopOS with my Asus Zephyrus G14 (4800hs) as a daily driver and I really like it. (freelance/web)The battery life is comparable to Windows (on integrated graphics mode, it has graphics switching available)at 7-10 hours with 70% brightness and balanced power settings using VScode and firefox.The g14 has a 75wh battery vs the pangolin&#39;s 49wh, so I would expect less battery life from the pangolin despite the 4700u having a lower default tdp, since the 4800hs likes to sit at around 6-10 watts when doing non-intensive tasks anyway.In 2021 I&#39;m not missing any major programs. It&#39;s pretty incredible how much is cross-platform now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll give System76 (and their hardware partner) this: They&#39;re getting closer to something I&#39;d buy.This looks like a good option for a 15.6&#34; laptop.My issue with it is that they&#39;re still shipping with those barrel plugs AC adapters, and don&#39;t appear to support USB-PD for charging on the USB-C ports.The lack of Australian support also makes it a difficult purchase - a former colleague bought a System76 laptop a few years back and it died a few months after purchase. Having to ship it back to the US, and the associated delays means having to buy a second laptop to continue working while it&#39;s being repaired."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Technically, what&#39;s going on here?&#34;CAID&#34; isn&#39;t a public iOS technology, and the article doesn&#39;t say what it means.Some googling returns: https://mmachina.cn/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MMA%E4%B8%AD%...Apparently it means &#34;CAA Advertising Id&#34;, where &#34;CAA&#34; appears to be the &#34;Creative Artists Agency&#34;, some sort of Chinese advertising group. (edit: wrong organization, it&#39;s actually &#34;Chinese Anonymization ID&#34;, not a group.  the group behind it is https://trackingio.com/)Searching &#34;CAA Advertising Id&#34; yields more Chinese PDFs.From what I can tell here, &#34;CAID&#34; is a partnership between Chinese industry and Chinese government to track users across apps for better tracking.The issue here does not seem to be that they&#39;ve bypassed a technical restriction, but that the developers of major apps are using a shared identifier that Apple doesn&#39;t like.In the US, the analogy would be if apps had tracking SDKs in them, that fingerprinted users across apps, in order to better target them for advertisements, and then the US government can pick up that data and do whatever they&#39;d like with it.The strange part to me, is that this actually is the situation today in the US.I don&#39;t want to shill for China, but why is this a story?  This has been a US industry since at least Doubleclick was invented.edit:It&#39;s a story because they&#39;re using the iOS keychain API to persist and share the tracking identifier.  As far as I know, this is a new technique in the wild, but has been theoretically possible since iOS launched.  It&#39;s only now being seen as necessary because of the iOS14 privacy changes.It&#39;s curious that American ad companies seem to understand Apple&#39;s intent and are opting not to risk their business by expanding their SDKs to use keychain sharing techniques, even though they&#39;re surely aware you can do this.  Chinese ad companies seem ok with risking their clients apps being banned on the app store.Apple can mitigate this by giving users control of the data and sharing related to keychain services."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s additionally concerning that the US has little exposure to China-sourced data. This imbalance where the CCP knows far more about the average American than the US knows about the average Chinese person is deeply concerning. The more that is known, the larger the training data set, the more people can be influenced in ways that suit an openly hostile[0] government.[0] https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/20-02832-El..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"+ using Google for search in 2000 and being amazed at how much better the results were than AltaVista and Yahoo Search.+ Google Maps in 2004 and dragging the map interactively around.  This was a quantum leap beyond Mapquest&#39;s page reload and reset with cumbersome arrow buttons.  This was a paradigm shift that let me explore a geography better than any book atlas.  I gave away all my atlases+ MS Window Media Player&#39;s ability to cleanly accelerate playback to 2x,3x,4x of audiobooks and tutorial videos for slow speakers.  MS Windows 7 had this long before Youtube&#39;s player had a 2x playback option.+ SQLite library : more than 10x improvement since I came from old school of writing custom formats for persisting data.  No more dumping memory structs to disk or writing b-trees in C Language from scratch.+ C++ STL in late 1990s.  Instantly reduced need to write custom data structures like linked-lists or in-house string libraries for common tasks+ VMware in 2000s : more than 10x productivity enhancement because I can play with malware in a virtual software sandbox instead of tediously re-imaging harddrives of air-gapped real physical machines+ Google Chrome in 2008 : 10x quality-of-life since misbehaving websites crashing don&#39;t bring down all the other tabs in my browsing session like Firefox/Opera.I probably have more than a hundred examples.  Some software tech 10x improvements are more diffused.  Reddit+HN websites are a much better use of my time than USENET newsgroups.  Youtube with recordings of tech conference presentations I can watch at 2x+ is a better used of my time than physically traveling to the site."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Firebug.Every developer from around 2006-2008 knows what I&#39;m talking about. Debugging JS in IE6 was like trying to build a house blindfolded with both arms tied behind your back. Firebug is when JS went from just a web augmentation toy that could silently fail and your web page would still mostly function to becoming a critical function for a web page (many will see this as all a big mistake)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here are a few that I did not see listed by others:1. Automatic device discovery and driver installation (e.g., with USB devices (also USB device categories, etc.)). Instead of trying to find a driver, things just worked.2. Automatic updates.  Keeping everything updated, largely, fell into the background.3. Graphical integrated development environments (IDEs) for software development.  I realize editors can be contentious, but tab completion of variable names, automatic identification of methods within scope, syntax highlighting, easily dropping breakpoints, etc. are, in my experience, wonderful improvements on productivity.4. What you see is what you get (WYSIWYG) text / image editors.  Thankfully, I did not spend much time in the prior era, but it was, at times, maddening to get something to format correctly.5. Ad blockers / reader modes. Again, I know these can be contentious, but, for me, these reformatting services are sometimes the only way to make some websites practically readable.I strongly second:-The rise of memory-managed languages (e.g., JAVA, C#, etc) with pretty robust default library sets, especially for string manipulation, graphics, and network operations.-Moving map software, especially for mobile GPS mapping.-Spreadsheet software.-Being able to easily search for answers to fairly technical programming problems, compiler errors, etc. along with better access to online documentation."</p>

Instead, their marketing keeps on comparing apples to oranges and just keeps on playing the privacy angle, which is intellectually dishonest because DDG and Google have completely different goals.Boy do I hope for some real competition in the search engine market. Brave and Neeva can&#39;t launch soon enough. I&#39;m so sick and tired of giving DDG changes upon changes only to switch back to Google because the results haven&#39;t improved much."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I guess the majority of people on HN already know this more or less. The problem is still this: We still don&#39;t have good alternatives to Google&#39;s products and services.1) Android: Google still owns all our phones. Even on rooted phones it hard to remove google services that god know send so many requests containing whatnot to the eeee addresses. Just install no-root firewall and you will be amazed the amount of pending requests that accumulate in 1 hour.2) Google search: I guess I can manage with DDG but when it&#39;s not that straight forward search, subconciosuly I&#39;m still thinking that let&#39;s just do a quick google search to see if i&#39;m not missing anything. And often I find better results. While adblocks makes sure I filter most of the crap.3) Gmail: Yes there are alternatives but switching emails is hard. It&#39;s a big commitment for most people to switch a 10 year old gmail address. And it still works great at filtering spam and whatnot.And same for maps, youtube and all their services.They really have a big leverage on everyone.Quiting facebook and instagram was child&#39;s play in comparison.

As the mayor (who did not particularly support the measure) pointed out, it&#39;s not like this was a high priority to begin with.A proper decriminalization or perhaps even legalization would have passed, but DC citizens lack the same rights over their own local laws that any other American living in a state would enjoy.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing that always seems to be missing from these videos (in general, because there are many of them) is step 0: how do you go about acquiring the land and the permission to build a log cabin on this land? I can&#39;t imagine that there&#39;s many countries in the world where there is no build code or other legislation regarding how or where buildings can be built. The last thing I&#39;d want to do is spend an entire year building something that I would then be legally obliged to tear down.If you&#39;re felling a large amount of trees in a forest, at the bare minimum you need the blessing of the land owner (if that isn&#39;t you). Most likely, you&#39;ll also need in addition to this a permit to fell trees to begin with, because land owners in most countries aren&#39;t free to simply fell any amount of trees they wish just because they own the land.It&#39;s obviously an impressive feat to build a log cabin from scratch, but since this step is so often completely omitted, I have to ask myself whether this is because it&#39;s considered too boring, or because there are people out there who think that as long as you go far enough into the woods, you can do whatever you want because no one will notice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A great excuse to drop a link to this legend:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_ProennekeRichard Louis Proenneke (/ˈprɛnəkiː/; May 4, 1916 – April 20, 2003) was an American self-educated naturalist, conservationist, writer, and wildlife photographer who, from the age of about 53, lived alone for nearly thirty years (1969–1999) in the mountains of Alaska in a log cabin that he constructed by hand near the shore of Twin Lakes.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another argument against the &#34;going dark&#34; claim is that before smartphones and the internet, the only conversations the FBI could monitor was through phonelines and mail. These were known to be easily monitored and I doubt there was much more criminal activity happening through those then than now.I would argue that the conversations that have gone online are the interactions that were previously happening in-person (at least in term of criminal activity), to which the FBI didn&#39;t have access before.There is something Orwellian with the idea that there shouldn&#39;t be a word that can be pronounced in the country that the government cannot record and listen to after the fact. The limits of what is legal or not have always moved (see homosexuality, drug and alcohol consumption, etc). So a 100% enforcement of the law is counter-intuitively undesirable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I dont understand why the US people still trust these agencies. FBI, CIA, NSA have all shown to act against the democracy in many cases. If they could be trusted, they could be trusted with a backdoor. Since they cannot be trusted, the backdoor only makes them a more dangerous enemy of the people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article&#39;s title is a little misleading, but I agree with their overarching message.Law enforcement should never be given the easy way out in terms of breaking encryption. Asking for backdoors to be installed in every device is extremely lazy police work. I&#39;m sure there are other ways of breaking encryption like the rubber-hose technique (of course with valid arrest warrant).Arguing that law enforcement should stop attacking encryption because it jeopardises privacy seems a little naive to me. What about criminals that profit from creating spyware? In fact, allowing law enforcement to actively research new ways to break encryption can be productive for improving security in the long run. Stop using weak passwords people."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very interesting, these kinds of articles are (to me) some of the best content we get on here.I&#39;m no expert in any of the languages used except maybe C, at least I&#39;m quick to form opinions about C code. In C, I&#39;m not so sure that there is a well-established &#34;idiomatic&#34; concept, since C is not so tightly bound to a community as more modern languages. At least that&#39;s my feeling.That said, I was shocked to see that the example code did heap-allocations to store integers. Single integers, one per allocation, per &#34;counting bucket&#34;. I would store the count in the data pointer without a second thought, I just &#34;can&#39;t&#34; make 4/8-byte heap allocations and still sleep at night. Especially after all the concern about processing the input in large blocks for performance! Casting an integer to/from a void pointer should be pretty safe according to my gut feel. If that turns out to be false, I would dump the libc&#39;s hash API altogether, since it makes me do heap allocations to store single integers.I tried making the change locally, and the time taken (as measured with the OP&#39;s benchmarking program) dropped from 0.11 to 0.10 on my system (a Dell laptop running an Intel i5-7300). That&#39;s at least something."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is definitely the most interesting part of the article for me:Incidentally, this problem set the scene for a wizard duel between two computer scientists several decades ago. In 1986, Jon Bentley asked Donald Knuth to show off “literate programming” with a solution to this problem, and he came up with an exquisite, ten-page Knuthian masterpiece. Then Doug McIlroy (the inventor of Unix pipelines) replied with a one-liner Unix shell version using tr, sort, and uniq.http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2011/12/more-shell-less-egg..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Knuth-McIlroy comes up a lot.  Previous discussion [1].  For this example I can make a very similar Nim program [2] run almost exactly the same speed as `wc -w`, yet the optimized C program runs 1.2x faster not 1.15x slower than `wc -w` - a 1.4x discrepancy - bigger than many ratios in the table.  So, people should be very cautious about conclusions from any of this.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24817594[2] https://github.com/c-blake/adix/blob/master/tests/wf.nim"</p>

Almost none of them could get a job as a software engineer at their own company, if they had to, because they would be completely unqualified. And I&#39;m not looking down my nose at anyone: I have an undergraduate degree in CS, but I got it 16 years ago and then went to law school, and there is not a serious place on earth that would let me touch their codebase. But if I started a really valuable company tomorrow (maybe I should), I would code as a software engineer on this list.I mean, come at it from the other direction: Why are there so many software engineers who are not successful CEOs? My God, they have the secrets of for loops, S-expressions, they know about vim---and yet they aren&#39;t running Pfizer? Why not?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, talk about assuming correlation implies causation.I think the obvious lesson here is when society becomes reoriented around a new field (in this case software), people with experience in that field are going to do well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What this seems to show is that CEOs in a particular sector often have expertise in that sector. And that Tech is currently the most highly valued sector as measured by market capitalisation. To find evidence of Software Engineers being the best CEOs overall you&#39;d really need to find examples of them running non-tech firms successfully or examples of non-Software Engineers running tech firms poorly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I use this feature. On a large monitor, Firefox wastes quite a lot of space with the default layout. To be honest, I wish there was an option to make it more compact than the &#34;compact&#34; layout. There used to be an XUL extension to do this, before XUL was killed off.Seems like every time I see coverage about Firefox, it&#39;s Mozilla removing or crippling some feature I care about.Why bother using FF at this point? Most sites don&#39;t work as well, and Mozilla seems actively hostile to my use case. If I&#39;m going to use a browser that is hostile to me, I may as well get better website compatibility out of the bargain.Not surprised their market share keeps shrinking. At this point, what&#39;s the sell?Edit 1: worth noting, there is a lower-down comment thread[0] with relevant links - Mozilla does not care if you like this feature.0 - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26464973"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t get it.  The wording of the bugzilla specifically says&gt;  The &#34;Compact&#34; density is a feature of the &#34;Customize toolbar&#34; view which is currently fairly hard to discover, and we assume gets low engagement.So not only do they not have telemetry for that, they aren&#39;t even attempting to make it more discoverable to test if there&#39;s a correlation between &#34;hard to discover&#34; and &#34;low engagement&#34;?I would use this but never knew this could be changed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think Mozilla has a clear vision of what they want to achieve. They&#39;ve been randomly removing features, or even plain butchering their  products (eg the recent Firefox mobile update) for several years, and all they probably achieved is to lose more and more users.Yet with their tiny market share they aren&#39;t exactly in a position to lose users."</p>

It is without a doubt the best source of this information and the app being unavailable significantly affects the day to day lives of a significant portion of the South African population who use it to plan around these power outages.While the app also has a &#34;chat&#34; feature, it&#39;s really tangental to the primary purpose of the app and I expect that most users of the app, like myself, don&#39;t use that feature at all and only care about knowing when they will be without electricity.In case you&#39;re wondering why they hell we have load shedding, it&#39;s because Eskom is grossly incompetent. Their incompetence is hugely exacerbated by nepitism and corruption where government has historically appointed people to Eskom management positions solely as &#34;favours&#34;, rather than on qualification for the job."</p>

This structure results in very large but sparse graphs, and there are factor graph optimization libraries that take advantage of this sparsity (e.g. g2o or GTSAM.)

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a hopeful but possible take. But the 501Y.V2 (B.1.351) and 501Y.V3 (P1) lineages have the mutation within the conserved region for coronaviruses near the spike protein cleavage site. These show massively (1000x) decreased monoclonal antibody binding for original genetic sequence designs. It&#39;s better for the mRNA vaccine produced human-body-made antibodies which show only 5-10x reduction in binding.But antibody binding isn&#39;t the full story and there may be T-cell stuff helping too. The data seems to indicate updated spike protein designs will be needed but if there&#39;s other stuff going on we don&#39;t know about old spike vaccines could still work. I can&#39;t say it will definitely help because the vaccine rollout is so slow and air travel is so fast that this negative pressure will probably provoke more variants as long as host numbers remain high.ref: &#34;Antibody Resistance of SARS-CoV-2 Variants B.1.351 and B.1.1.7&#34; [pdf] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03398-2_reference... https://i.imgur.com/8co1IoL.jpg &#34;SARS-CoV-2 VoC B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 neutralization evasion&#34; table.https://covariants.org/variants/S.501Y.V2 https://covariants.org/variants/S.501Y.V3"</p>

But my friends and I noticed the changes around 2015. Less sunflower stars and star fish. After some red tide events, the abalone die offs were crazy. Coves that used to have abs stacked on top of each other were almost empty. Finding a 9” abalone became a chore. The thinner kelp forests meant less fish, less life. It’s been difficult to watch first hand. I get sad thinking about the reality that my children will most likely never see the underwater forests that filled my soul and gave me a deep love of the ocean.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In terms of single-player games, the figure is more like 85%. You can probably get an additional 5% to work with various levels of tweaking, but compatibility is remarkably good these days. Many games perform better on Linux than they do on Windows (Borderlands, Overwatch), while others give you a chance to have a flawless experience with games that are pretty busted on modern Windows (Diablo 2, Fallout: New Vegas). As another commenter mentioned, the big issue is with anti-cheat: any game implementing EAC will outright not work, full stop. That makes it about a 50/50 chance that multiplayer titles will work on Linux, with some unfortunate casualties like Rainbow Six Siege and Halo MCC&#39;s online multiplayer.With that being said, I truly and honestly believe Linux is the way to go if you&#39;re not into multiplayer. Valve&#39;s commitment to Linux is nothing short of herculean, and it&#39;s heartwarming to see them give back to the open source community in such a remarkable way. If it weren&#39;t for Proton (and DXVK), I&#39;d still be using Windows on my main computer, which made development hell. Now, I feel comfortable moving to a system where I can enjoy Overwatch, Titanfall and Team Fortress on a regular basis without dual-booting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know it&#39;s not the topic here so apologies for the digression, but the Mac compatibility on this list is somewhat misleading. Games like TF2 don&#39;t actually work on the Mac any longer unless you stay on or downgrade to Mojave. And even then, the performance and bugginess leaves much to be desired.If you&#39;re using this article at all to make decisions around a Mac for gaming, dive a little deeper to make sure the game you want to play works on Catalina+ (generally requires a full 64 bit port).Back to the actual topic: I had no idea Proton got this good. That&#39;s quite an achievement for Linux gaming. What&#39;s the state of modern GPU support?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was really annoyed when Rocket League dropped native support for Linux, but it turned out it runs much better on my potato under Proton. My only concern now is that they&#39;ll add anti-cheat to it (even though there&#39;s there no real need for it) and Linux will become flagged. The fact that they moved the game to only be available to new players via the Epic client has me worried they&#39;re moving in that direction."</p>

In this aspect Rust is a much more mature language than C.&#34;Yes. Today, I integrated two parts of a 3D graphics program. One refreshes the screen and lets you move the viewpoint around. The other loads new objects into the scene. Until today, all the objects were loaded, then the graphics window went live. Today, I made those operations run in parallel, so the window comes up with just the sky and ground, and over the next few seconds, the scene loads, visibly, without reducing the frame rate.This took about 10 lines of code changes in Rust. It worked the first time it compiled."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; C libraries typically return opaque pointers to their data structures, to hide implementation details and ensure there&#39;s only one copy of each instance of the struct. This costs heap allocations and pointer indirections. Rust&#39;s built-in privacy, unique ownership rules, and coding conventions let libraries expose their objects by valueThe primary reason c libraries do this is not for safety, but to maintain ABI compatibility.  Rust eschews dynamic linking, which is why it doesn&#39;t bother.  Common lisp, for instance, does the same thing as c, for similar reasons: the layout of structures may change, and existing code in the image has to be able to deal with it.&gt; Rust by default can inline functions from the standard library, dependencies, and other compilation units. In C I&#39;m sometimes reluctant to split files or use libraries, because it affects inliningThis is again because c is conventionally dynamically linked, and rust statically linked.  If you use LTO, cross-module inlining will happen."</p>

Documentation for which fields is entirely in scattered forum posts from users.- Booleans in the API are `true` or `undefined`.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m one of the maintainers of one of the implementations of eth2 live today (https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm) and can help offer more context on this. Ethereum proof of stake has been live since December 1st and it currently secures over 6 billion USD worth of value https://beaconcha.in/. Currently, this is a chain that lives in parallel to the proof of work chain we know as Ethereum today. The idea is that over this coming year, the entire state of Ethereum will be &#34;merged&#34; into this new chain that uses proof of stake consensus via a docking process. &#34;Escalating the eth2 merge&#34; means there is more expedited work from researchers and developers when it comes to performing this critical decision. Since eth2 consensus is already live and running correctly with a large set of validators, miners cannot censor this new chain and therefore cannot really stop the merge."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regardless of the current issues with the updates, gas prices, different opinions on the community, devs vs miners vs users...Am I the only one who thinks people underestimate Ethereum and its EVM invention? In 2013 this guy (who I think is a visionary) wrote a document with a proposal that led to the creation of a world-wide turing-complete distributed computer. And still, people are just starting to realize its potential. This month a layer-2 solution called optimism will launch a virtual machine called OVM (optimism vm) on top of ethereum smart contracts that can solve most of the current scalability issues (and there are other solutions being tested in parallel: zkrollups...). We are also starting to realize the potential of Dex and Defi (distributed exchanges and finance), DAOs (distributed organizations), NFT (non-fungible tokens) and a bunch of things more that 7 years after are appearing out of thin air. So even if Ethereum wasn&#39;t updated at all (although, we probably all agree that PoW is not environmental friendly and should be replaced with a better alternative: PoS) it could still thrive in the long term thanks to its most fundamental design choices (turing-complete...). I am truly amazed by this technology and Vitalik. I wish I knew a little bit more of the underlying fundamentals. What do you think?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not an expert, but if 51% of the existing hashpower doesn&#39;t want a change, it sounds less a 51% attack and more like miners voting against something that isn&#39;t in their interest. The whole point of blockchains is that the incentives are supposed to be aligned between miners and users. If that isn&#39;t the case here, it sounds like a problem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So many of these start or end with an `x*`, `(x|y)`, `[xy]` or `[^xy]` that I only see two characters I can fill in before I need to start looking at multiple constraints for the same cell and either doing combinatorics or guess-and-check.This might be fine for hard mode, but as someone who considers themselves a regexpert it&#39;s not very approachable as a first puzzle IMO.A more gradual introduction to the format would be to give a few clues that give you confidence on specific characters, that then let you lock in some other characters in other hints, and so on.For instance, replacing `.*H.*V.*G.*` with `.{3}H.*V.*G.*` would go a long way because you could confidently place an `H`.  And say that intersected with `(DI|NS|TH|OM)*` on the `H`, you could then place a `T` from the second clue because of what you learned from the first clue.It could just be that I&#39;m missing something or not as good at regex as I thought, and please let me know if that&#39;s the case.   Either way though, when I&#39;m trying a new kind of puzzle I&#39;d like to feel like I made some sort of progress after trying for 5-10 minutes, and here 2 chars does not feel like progress."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Database startups suffer from an extreme case of an important truism in startups generally: the product you think you are selling is not the product the customer thinks they are buying. No one buys a database per se, they are just a means to some other end.People that love database technology — that would be me — tend to start database companies. It is very difficult to sell a database. It is much, much easier to sell a compelling solution to a somewhat boring but very valuable business problem that just happens to require an amazing database capability behind it. That’s your moat, the customer doesn’t actually care that there is an amazing database engine behind it but it makes it difficult for competitors to replicate.Filed under “lessons I learned the hard way”."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is akin to everyone’s dream to start a cozy, atmospheric coffee shop. These types of coffee bars fold very quickly or at best give founders years of servitude below minimum wage. The reason is that the type of behaviour this kind of establishment encourages - lounging, book reading, laptop work is exactly the opposite of the quick serve model that is  conducive to high revenue. The customer loves this model, the owner hates it.Analogous to it, the nosql DB market is the exact wrong market to enter. Large companies willing to pay big bucks for enterprise features will pay established vendors for the stodgy but battle tested stuff like Oracle or DB2. The hipster startup market pays nobody for anything as there is a myriad of free choices in every common flavour and the few that will pay will mostly do so to purchase managed hosting. And that’s only if their PoC built on your new and untrusted database ever makes it to production. And then it’s probably your cheapest tier. Don’t be selling to paupers!"</p>

Screen capture is a hassle too. I was trying to capture only a part of my screen and had to do an hour worth of research to finally decide to just switch to X.org and get the job done.

It&#39;s like a self destroyable notification that can be read only once. Why? For the instance if I share some confident information with someone that I know is going to open very soon, then once he/she opens the message it will be destroyed, so that if somebody accesses either my or my friend&#39;s machine, it will be impossible to read the secret message.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is the biggest takeaway for me:&gt; We saw this dynamic metastasize in the wake of George Floyd’s murder, when well-intentioned claims of “silence is violence” (recalling the powerful 1987 ACT-UP “Silence = Death” campaign) spiraled into calling out individuals with even a small following who hadn’t come forward with a timely public statement of solidarity or remorse. Yet public posts were subject to popular scrutiny and judged based on sincerity, originality, and tone. Not surprisingly, many people defaulted to posting a somber plain black square. But this generated criticism of its own by clogging the feed with an informational blackout during a moment when community resource sharing was critically important. Amid a chaotic time, the platform functioned exactly as designed: amplification of emotions, uptick in user interaction, growth in platform engagement and data cultivation. Cha-ching, the platform cashes in.In other words, any large movement or discussion on &#34;clearnet&#34; spaces gets subverted by the algorithms and profit motive of the platform they live on.However, where I disagree with the author is considering mainstream &#34;dark forest&#34; platforms like reddit or 4chan to be countercultural. In fact, I&#39;d argue that mainstream social media can never be countercultural. While there may be no &#34;algorithm&#34; controlling the narrative you see on 4chan (or a straightforward and ostensibly fair one on a site like reddit), the content you see (and by extension, the narrative) is shaped by profit motive: From well-compensated marketing teams, to hordes of self-interested proselytizers (see: bitcoin), to propaganda teams looking to influence public opinion, mainstream dark forest sites simply shift the balance of power from the platform itself to the most motivated and well-funded members of the platform"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Still reading the article, but this is an interesting blurb if nothing else:&#34;To be truly countercultural today, in a time of tech hegemony, one has to, above all, betray the platform, which may come in the form of betraying or divesting from your public online self.&#34;I hadn&#39;t thought of boycotting much of popular online space as being counter-cultural.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"My reading from the outside is, the left needs to realize (I&#39;m sure it applies to the right equally as well) that scolding people into guilt is not a viable approach to affect action or to change perceptions when you&#39;re dealing with adults.Neither does boxing people into this, that and that category do any good. Like if all you want to do is dehumanize those guys so you can happily insult / hurt them without hurting your conscience, go ahead, that&#39;s choice.. you have different goals.. but remember that instinct that wants you to scream at this-this-this type of person is a confrontational approach that deep down falls in the pattern of, eliminating the other tribe.. if you choose to do something about it and what you do is your responsibility and problem.I just think the solution should lie in :
1) dialog 2) lawsI think beyond those 2 lie some really wrong answers.."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you cannot censor away opinions, if suppression of ideas doesn&#39;t work then why in exactly these kinds of articles do people bemoan it as dangerous?I may agree that most censorship is wrong but it does work. It worked for centuries to help maintain systems of inequality.It worked for centuries to maintain familial control and enforce sexual monoculture in many countries. Information control works so well, it prevents people from even understanding themselves or what they really want in the face of ideologically imposed values.We are steeped in a culture of Hollywood telling us what the lessons of history are about. One of the off repeated &#34;hopeful&#34; messages we are fed is that you can&#39;t kill an idea but my reading of history has led me to the other conclusion entirely. That controlling the conversation, its constraints and determining the status quo are profoundly powerful tools."</p>

RFC3339 timestamps are already well designed, since if you stick to UTC (and if you don&#39;t store timezone data separately you deserve those problems), lexical order is temporal order, but queries which would be rendered in English as &#34;return all accounts where last payment is ninety days prior to `now`&#34; isn&#39;t really possible with string comparisons.Also, with the JSON library, you can use a check constraint to fail if a string isn&#39;t valid JSON, another affordance I would love to have for datetimes.Grateful for what we just got, though!

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting read, especially as someone poking w/ writing a parser in zig for fun :)One area of improvement worth mentioning in this area is that currently zig errors cannot be tagged with extra information, which tends to be important for surfacing things like line numbers in parsing errors. There was a proposal[0] to improve this and it&#39;s not the end of the world for me anyways (as a workaround, I&#39;m toying with returning error tokens similar to what treesitter does)On a different note, there&#39;s another cool zig thing I found recently that is mildly related to parsing: a common thing in parsers is mapping a parsed string to some pre-specified token type (e.g. the string `&#34;if&#34;` maps to an enum value `.if` or some such so you can later pattern match tokens efficiently). The normal way to avoid O(n) linear search over the keyword space is to use a hashmap (naively, one would use a runtime std.StringHashMap in zig). But I found an article from Andrew[0] about a comptime hashmap where a perfect hashing strategy is computed at comptime since we already know the search space ahead of time! Really neat stuff.[0] https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/2647[1] https://andrewkelley.me/post/string-matching-comptime-perfec..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I absolutely love parser combinators, and years ago I did a huge rewrite of my compiler compiler so that it&#39;d have the easiest possible parser combinators: simple string concatenation. grammarA + grammarB = grammarC. You can play with that here (https://jtree.treenotation.org/designer/). You still need to make a line change or two (good design after all, requires some integration), but it just works. Haven&#39;t seen anything beat it and not sure if that&#39;s possible.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A modern circuit simulator, that has a fully featured programable API, that can be run from a real modern programming language, would be a dream.
Every simulator i have used has been pretty limited in that way, or at least those features were not well advertized.
Even the insanely expensive ones.
I mean the most expensive ones (like $100K liscense type deals, like Cadence) are if anything even less modern from a user interaction perspective.My first academic paper 
(https://www.oxinabox.net/publications/White2015PsoTransistor...) was based on doing a search over parameters for the transistors being used in a circuit.
The way that whole thing work was by string mangling the netlist file to update the parameters.
Triggering the simulator on the commandline.
Getting it to output a CSV of the signals.
Parsing that CSV, and detecting edges and then measuring timing that way.
Then throwing it at a particle swarm optimizer to fine a new one.
That sucks from a user experience.
It&#39;s a super cool way to  solve problems though.
that would be so easy with a real API.Further, with julia being a differnetiable programming language, rather than having to use a particular swarm optimizer to search, I could have been differentiating it, and using some sophisticated gradient descent like LBGFS etc.I hope that some of the general tools like this will be an outcome of this project."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems very promising to me
One big part of circuit simulation is solving differential equations.
That&#39;s the whole inducer, resistor, capacitor thing.
Julia has hands down the best toolkit for differential equation solving.
Most circuit simulators today are going to be using old methods invented in the 60&#39;s-80&#39;s.
Neglecting the state of the art developments.Someone made a blog post recently comparing the time to simulate with LTSpice vs writng and solving the system in Julia
https://klaff.github.io/LTSvDEQ_1.jl.html
this is a very simple circuit, and they still got a 100x speed up.
Sure that is neglecting the time it takes to actually extract the differnetial equetion from the circuit.
But from what i hear that kind of thing is something this DARPA project will be working on.
And sure LTSpice isn&#39;t state of the art.
But still I find this indicative and promising."</p>

If you try to measure the effect of your writing using only an audience that has selected your writing voluntarily, you are not measuring your effectiveness, you are measuring the degree to which your writing pleases people who already like your writing.Absent a properly constructed empirical approach, we might as well be discussing hemlines and necktie widths."</p>

It&#39;s said to be readable by 100% of the literate general public, which is only 85% of the full general public.But, out of the 507 words and 38 sentences, 4 sentences were flagged as &#34;very long&#34; (over 30 syllables) and 15 as &#34;long&#34; (over 20 syllables).Two &#39;hard words&#39; – over 12 letters or over 4 syllables – were flagged, somewhat ironically: &#34;unnecessarily intellectual&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When something feels easy to read, it&#39;s not just a matter of using simple words. To maximize scanability, you need to use a mix of long and short words, and also mix long and short sentences, until you achieve a kind of &#34;flow&#34;. Famously, Dovlatov&#39;s prose (in Russian) avoids having words that start with the same letter in the same sentence, which is unnoticeable to the reader but makes the words just fly off the page.Another trick I&#39;ve found is making sure each word has unambiguous function. Here&#39;s some examples from other comments:I had this impression recently while reading the Akbarnama, which is a sort of court-approved biography of the Mughal Emperor Akbar, written by his Grand Vizier -- Was the Emperor written, or was it the biography?There are some cases in which your work demands a certain level of precision -- It could&#39;ve continued like &#34;in which your work demands are excessive&#34;, so you don&#39;t know if &#34;demands&#34; is a noun or a verb until you read on.That &#34;simple&#34; writing lasts longer is disproved by many works of literature that have made their way to us through history -- It could&#39;ve continued like &#34;that simple writing is not so simple&#34;, so you don&#39;t know if &#34;that&#34; is a conjunction or determiner until you read on.These are small things, but somehow the more I notice them, the clearer my writing becomes."</p>

Otherwise they&#39;re way too vague. For instance, the chicken parm recipe:- There should be a photo of how to slice the chicken breast. Saying &#34;through their width&#34; isn&#39;t good enough. I had to explain what &#34;lengthwise&#34; was once because my friend cut all the vegetables the exact opposite of it.- Pound with what? A lot of people will come up with very bad answers to this question.- How much flour? How much egg? I&#39;ll bet that plenty of beginners will use a tablespoon of flour or a singular egg- Ditto with oil. Beginners do not know how much oil is necessary to fry stuff- How high heat? You probably want to turn down the heat after the oil starts smoking.- Is there a single mention of adding salt? Sounds like a pretty bland recipeI don&#39;t mean to be too harsh but recipes are hard. There&#39;s a reason why professional recipe developers have developed certain standards like measurements, terms (folding batter, shimmering oil, etc.), and development procedures (cross testing)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Am I the only one who thinks that this concept is perfectly good, and all the things the site doesn&#39;t have are just great further development of the idea?What&#39;s wrong with a &#34;wikipedia for recipes&#34;? I would LOVE that.All the complaints about the quality of the recipes or the lack of more in-depth explaination of each one, some kind of  voting/reputation system for the recipes and for the submitters and the voters, Yes those are all good ideas to make the db more useful than just a db.But you have to start somewhere. How is the core idea here of a public cookbook not fundamentally awesome? I mean hello... GIT. Recipes that are living documents that can be honed over time, complete with viewable history of what changes have been made so you can decide if you agree with them. Branches and forks for all the hundred variations on any given thing. Revisions by better experts than the original submitter of some recipe.So, today on day one it doesn&#39;t already have the benefit of years of contributions and incremental improvements and revisions, Quelle Suprise!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The info about salt is plain wrong. Kosher salt is used for curing meat and as a mainly decorative addition to baking, you don&#39;t need to use it for cooking, it doesn&#39;t dissolve noticably slower in liquids. In fact when most recipes specify a volumetric measurement of salt they mean table salt and if you were to use kosher or sea salt you would be under seasoning due the reduced volume, nothing to do with how quickly it dissolves.You should definitely not be using large grain salt in baking for this reason, unless it is to decorate a finished product.Iodine deficiencies were and are very, very real. They&#39;re also on the rise due to food deserts and rising poverty. Iodised salt largely eliminated iodine deficiencies so people with poor knowledge of the history think they just went away. Most processed food does not contained iodised salt, so table salt is an essential source or iodine for a great many people around the world.Idosing salt was and is one of the greatest public health success stories of the 20th century, do not talk about it like some conspiracy by government."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Plastic card distribution can be extremely frustrating, because the only time you need it to happen is when you don&#39;t actually want it to be needed (fruad, loss, damage, new account, whatever). You just want to fucking buy things, not deal with shipping incompetence, you know?This reminds me of a time I was traveling and had to cancel a lost credit card. I told the card company that I was not at home,was definitely outside of the country, not going to be home, definitely staying at an address that was not the home address listed on the account, wanted the card to be sent to _me_ and not my _home_, gave them my foreign delivery address 5 times over as many weeks, got 5 separate promises that the card was definitely going to reach me at my outside-of-the-country-and-not-at-home location in just a few business days, and the card never showed up. So I just gave up. And then, when I finally went home there were 5 goddamn cards in my mail slot.Honestly this reason alone makes Apple&#39;s purely digital credit card my favorite. Need a new card number? Just push a button. No incompetent shipping divisions with 5 hops and as many business days between you and your ability to buy things when your card number is breached."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I live in the Netherlands, a country that primarily uses debit cards. I do have a credit card that I rarely use. Only when I buy something in the USA for example.Some years back I moved to a different city. About a year later I wanted to make a purchase with my credit card. I found out it had expired. I rang the bank and asked for a new one. They promised to send it to me. It never arrived. Rang again, got the same promise, and still no card. When I called them the third time, the employee found out my old address was still in their database. Turns out the credit card department had a different client database then the debit card department (who had my new address).To change my address, I had to log in to their site. They weren&#39;t allowed to change it on the phone. As soon I tried to log in, I noticed I forgot my password. When I clicked &#39;reset password&#39;, there was a new surprise: they send the new password by snail mail.... to the old address of course!So I had to go in person to the house I used to live in and explain the situation. I asked them to ring me when the letter with my name on it arrived on their doorstep. Luckily the people who now live in my old house were very nice and gave me the letter!"</p>

Never use what&#39;s built in to the TV, not just for privacy reasons but because it always seems to be a terrible experience compared to running Hulu, Netflix, etc. on anything else.

Only software update if your set has a bug that the advertised firmware actually fixes, as newer updates tend to add more &#34;features&#34; - adverts, slower apps etc etc. Use something like and AppleTV or a Roku device connected via HDMI if you really need smart features - but be aware even the likes of Roku / Nvidia Shield / FireTV will at some point in the future also be serving you adverts.I&#39;ve also heard that some sets are trying to find open wifi networks - if you are really that worried, cut the traces on the wifi card inside the set and hope that manufacturers don&#39;t start to use ethernet over HDMI."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Back in the late 90s, I implemented the first systematic monitoring of WalMart Store&#39;s global network, including all of the store routers, hubs (not switches yet!) and 900mhz access points.
Did you know that WalMart had some stores in Indonesia? They did until 1998.So when https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_1998_riots_of_Indonesia started happening, we heard some harrowing stories of US employees being abducted, among other things.Around that same time, the equipment in the Jakarta store started sending high temperature alerts prior to going offline. Our NOC wasn&#39;t able to reach anyone in the store.The alerts were quite accurate: that was one of the many buildings that had been burned down in the riots. I guess it&#39;s slightly surprising that electrical power to the equipment in question lasted long enough to allow temperature alerting. Most of our stores back then used satellite for their permanent network connection, so it&#39;s possible telcom died prior to the fire reaching the UPC office.In a couple of prominent places in the home office, there were large cutouts of all of the countries WalMart was in at the time up on the walls. A couple of weeks after this event, the Indonesia one was taken down over the weekend and the others re-arranged."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A bigger problem in my opinion is that Rust has chosen to follow the poll-based model (you can say that it was effectively designed around epoll), while the completion-based one (e.g. io-uring and IOCP) with high probability will be the way of doing async in future (especially in the light of Spectre and Meltdown).Instead of carefully weighing advantages and disadvantages of both models, the decision was effectively made on the ground of &#34;we want to ship async support as soon as possible&#34; [1]. Unfortunately, because of this rush, Rust got stuck with a poll-based model with a whole bunch of problems without a clear solution in sight (async drop anyone?). And instead of a proper solution for self-referencing structs (yes, a really hard problem), we did end up with the hack-ish Pin solution, which has already caused a number of problems since stabilization and now may block enabling of noalias by default [2].Many believe that Rust async story was unnecessarily rushed. While it may have helped to increase Rust adoption in the mid term, I believe it will cause serious issues in the longer term.[1]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/62149#issuecomment-...
[2]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/63818"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not totally sure what the author is asking for, apart from refcounting and heap allocations that happen behind your back. In my experience async Rust is heavily characterised by tasks (Futures) which own their data. They have to - when you spawn it, you&#39;re offloading ownership of its state to an executor that will keep it alive for some period of time that is out of the spawning code&#39;s control. That means all data/state brought in at spawn time must be enclosed by move closures and/or shared references backed by an owned type (Arc) rather than &amp; or &amp;mut.If you want to, nothing is stopping you emulating a higher-level language - wrap all your data in Arc&lt;_&gt; or Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;_&gt;&gt; and store all your functions as trait objects like Box&lt;dyn Fn(...)&gt;. You pay for extra heap allocations and indirection, but avoid specifying generics that spread up your type hierarchy, and no longer need to play by the borrow checker&#39;s rules.What Rust gives us is the option to _not_ pay all the costs I mentioned in the last paragraph, which is pretty cool if you&#39;re prepared to code for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like to joke that the best way to encounter the ugliest parts of Rust is to implement an HTTP router. Hours and days of boxing and pinning, Futures transformations, no async fn in traits, closures not being real first class citizens, T: Send + Sync + &#39;static, etc.I call this The Dispatch Tax. Because any time you want more flexibility than the preferred static dispatch via generics can give you - oh, so you just want to store all these async fn(HttpRequest) -&gt; Result&lt;HttpResponse&gt;, right? - you immediately start feeling the inconvenience and bulkiness of dynamic dispatch. It&#39;s like Rust is punishing you for using it. And with async/await taking this to a new level altogether, because you are immediately forced to understand how async funcs are transformed into ones that return Futures, how Futures are transformed into anon state machine structs; how closures are also transformed to anon structs. It&#39;s like there&#39;s no type system anymore, only structs.That&#39;s one of the reasons, I think, why Go has won the Control Plane. Sure, projects like K8s, Docker, the whole HashiCorp suite are old news. But it&#39;s interesting and telling that even solid Rust shops like PingCAP are using Go for their control plane. It seems to me that there&#39;s some fundamental connection between flexibility of convenient dynamic dispatch and control plane tasks. And of course having the default runtime and building blocks like net and http in the standard library is a huge win.That said, after almost three months of daily Rust it does get better. To the point when you can actually feel that some intuition and genuine understanding is there, and you can finally work on your problems instead of fighting with the language. I just wish that the initial learning curve wasn&#39;t so high."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really think that Windows 2000-era Windows Forms had the user experience nailed perfectly.  It wasn&#39;t the prettiest UI paradigm ever, but it was the most functional and easiest to teach.  Nothing was omitted, and the user was shown everything they needed to see in order to get a complete idea of the state of the application.I don&#39;t think that efforts to hide UI elements that aren&#39;t in use is going to prove to be a good idea when we look back at today from the future.Here&#39;s a good rule, in my mind: Don&#39;t hide UI elements from the user.  End of rule.  I do not care if it looks better without whatever UI element.  The toolbox in my garage would look better if I could only see the tools I needed at the time I need them, and I would return that toolbox (or never buy it in the first place) because it is constantly lying to me about the state of the toolbox, which is absolutely insulting position for a toolbox designer to adopt."</p>

But everyone using infinite scroll broke that, not apple."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An interesting output of this is, if you keep scrollbars visible, you&#39;ll find that a lot of websites end up with weird extra scrollbars on random elements.What often causes this is some HTML element overflowing by one pixel, but no one saw it during the QA process because all the webdevs were using Macs, which have invisible scrollbars by default.

Broad strokes, these are the two groups to focus on. I know most adults commute earlier than 9, and most students are up earlier than 8, but it&#39;s safe to say that most Americans are up-and-at-&#39;em from 8-5.On the shortest day of the year in Boston, sunrise is at 7:10am and sunset is at 4:14PM. Including civil twilight (&#34;it&#39;s still kind of daytime&#34;) extends it to 6:38am to 4:46PM.Even on the shortest day of the year, if you wake up even before 7 you&#39;re waking up in daylight. But, sunset is super early. Every working adult is commuting home in actual nighttime.Shift that forward 1 hour, and it gets light at 7:30AM and gets dark at 5:45PM. While slightly darker for students in the morning, it&#39;s immensely better for working adults, who at least get some daylight in the evenings, and not actual nighttime before 5PM."</p>

The practice was unpopular and promptly repealed after each war; however, lobbyists from the petroleum industry lobbied to restore DST, as they had noticed it actually increased fuel consumption.&gt; Permanent DST in the US was briefly enacted by President Nixon in 1974, in response to the 1973 oil crisis. The proposal was initially supported by an estimated 79% of the public; that support dropped to 42% after its first winter, owing to the harshness of dark winter mornings that permanent DST creates. An estimated six school children were also killed by motorists due to the new law.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_time_observation_in_...On the eastern edge of the enormous Eastern time zone, I&#39;m sympathetic to permanent DST, but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s a good idea nationwide.

He wanted the CD to be 11,5 cm instead of 12 cm and was disappointed Sony sold the first CD and invented the concept of a walkman instead of Philips.His opinion about cassette tapes and vinyl having a revival because of the analog experience?&#34;I am not a psychologist, but that music experience is of course all nonsense. Nothing can match the sound of the CD. It is absolutely noise and rumble free. That never worked with tape. But who am I to say what&#39;s better, I&#39;m over ninety and have old ears. I have made a lot of record players and I know that the distortion with vinyl is much higher. But some people call it &#34;warm audio.&#34; I think people mostly hear what they want to hear. But there are always madmen who want to look back to the past. There is always a market for that.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s fascinating that someone, within their lifetime, can invent something, watch it become a household item in the entire world and then fade so far into obscurity that new generations only find out about it from encyclopedias."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The cassette tape really is an astounding invention, or I guess a great packaging and convenience improvement, compared to existing tape formats.A revolution in music portability, distribution (both licensed and DIY), home recording, you name it. All kicked off by &#34;little boys who had fun playing&#34;.Tape trading is still big in certain circles, especially within the punk and black metal milieus. Some albums, EPs and demos get their only physical releases ever on limited edition cassette tapes, both because it is inexpensive, easy to DIY and fits the lo-fi aesthetics.Where vinyl has a strong presence among audiophiles (for various mostly imagined reasons) and was always a format for those with money to spend, the humble cassette tape was the format of choice for the youth, the working class and people on the go, and it still carries that down-to-earth appeal today.I know at least for me growing up in the 80s and 90s in a family with just enough money to get by, hand-me-down cassette tapes were how I experienced music, not to mention how we experimented with recording our voices and playing them back at different speeds, and learned what happened when you play the same bit of tape over and over again because it had a really funny bit on it. Getting my first CD and CD player was exotic and felt like science fiction in comparison to the trusty old cassette tape.I keep a drawer of a few old and obsolete physical formats that meant something special to me. My cassette tapes of Deep Purple In Rock, Machine Head, Sgt. Pepper&#39;s, and The Triumph of Death are there, next to the 3.5&#34; floppy disks and Minidiscs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Absolutely worth it, however I&#39;d offer a few short tips:1. Try to stay in one place for a few months, minimum. If you can stay a year or two, do that. Jumping from city to city every week seems exciting at first, but it quickly makes everywhere feel the same.2. To quote Lao Tzu, when your work is done, forget it. If you work remotely, actively disconnect at the end of the day. It&#39;s too easy to be constantly plugged into the English-speaking media world and ignore what&#39;s right in front of you.3. Try to blend in and adopt local clothing, culture, foods, etc. Read books by local authors, watch local films. A bit obvious, maybe, but I&#39;ve met many people who insisted on only eating Western food, reading Harry Potter, and watching Netflix while abroad. At that point, why even bother traveling?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I quit my job and went travelling I used this framework:1. Go via land. You see everything in between all the places you should see as a tourist. You immerse yourself in how a place actually feels. You meet people who aren’t just trying to extract money from you. I cycled, because I like cycling, but any form of transport works.2. My algorithm was something like “Go east. Stay somewhere if it’s interesting, until you get bored. Continue going east.” I didn’t have a fixed itinerary, but I did have some framework.That was the basis of it, I think. I cycled from London to Italy, stopped for a while in Italy, cycled on to Greece, then fell in love (with the place and somebody in particular). I met some of my best friends, worked on side projects, volunteered for charities, and ended up staying there for several months. I skipped forward to India on a plane, cycled across India, then returned back to Greece.My partner in Greece wanted to visit the Middle East and Central Asia, but she wasn’t quite as excited about cycling through the desert as I was, so we bought a van and drove — to Central Asia, and everything in between.My framework worked extraordinarily well. If I have one regret, I think it was not making an effort to interact with more people. You do that a lot more naturally when travelling by land, but you still need to put in effort to make it happen.For example, I was up late in a bar in an Italian village, and met one of the locals. It was a long cycle ride back to the place I was staying so he offered me his spare room. Turns out he lived with his parents and the next day his elderly Italian mother cooked us pasta for lunch. Possibly one of the best meals of my life.I wish I had done more of that. Just hanging out in bars and making friends. And not tourist bars — real bars. Knowing the local language better would probably help."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Did not quit my job, but instead went full remote in 2018 (age 55 at the time).Still doing it, but the pandemic forced me to stay in one country for just about a year now.In that year I put down roots, got long term visas and maybe will spend another few years there while we see how things shape out this and next year.But ya, 2-3 months minimum in a place is what you need, with just a small backpack.Make local friends.Don&#39;t hang around or go out with other tourists or expats. This is the kiss of death.Make it a rule to eat only the food of the city or the country that you find yourself in.Learn a few words of the language &#34;hello&#34;, &#34;thank you&#34;, &#34;bathroom&#34;, &#34;stop&#34;, etc.Don&#39;t think people are less than you. They&#39;re not. They want the same things as you.As an introvert, being forced to make friends with people who speak another language and look the opposite of me (black guy in Asia), was exactly the ticket.Well recommended to do it.The main thing I would say - is have a mission when you travel. Seeing the sights and drinking the bars and mingling with other tourists and shtupping the local girls is fun, but not a mission.You will get bored after some time of doing that.Have some particular work or meaning to each day to keep you grounded, and you can do the moving around for a super-long time.You will find that you&#39;ll set some schedules for work, play and discoveries - regardless of where you are.Just don&#39;t quit your job. Instead go remote (even if you have savings). Ok?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I once wrote a negative review of a business on Google, and it went up, but when I went to look at the business&#39;s reviews under my wife&#39;s Google account, it was not there. I waited an hour and checked. Then a couple hours and checked. Then a day. It never showed up.I posted the review under her account and did the same checks for my account. It never showed up.I do not know why it didn&#39;t show up, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the business had been able to pay money to Google to be able to check reviews before they went live and mark them as spam.Edit: Because some commenters did not seem to get the implied message, what I am actually implying is that in this context, or any context, I don&#39;t trust Google. I have no evidence of what commenters said I have claimed. (I have not claimed anything; I just said I wouldn&#39;t be surprised.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My personal experience as a business owner. We do not care about reviews since we are a B2B software house. Our customers are mid- to large-size companies so they do not play reviews but lawyers if our service wasn&#39;t of highest quality :) My personal preference would be to prevent 3rd party companies like google from publishing reviews if the business owner doesn&#39;t want them.Anyway - no customer gave us any review on google and our website is full of recommendation letters. But at some point google started nagging our employees to put reviews since they visited our office.Guess what happened. We got our first review from an employee we were not happy with and planned to gracefully close our cooperation with.This is against Google policy. So we complained. We had to spend significant time to get to a real person at Google and get this removed.After a year similar situation happened. I thought ok - this should be easy the second time. No way - this time all the emails we knew did not respond, we could not reach anybody. We flagged the review several times. We could not do anything about that.It is like a person can just put a shit on your office wall and you could not clean it. And shit owner - Google doesn&#39;t care.We were forced to play by the rules and we bought 50 reviews to paint our wall. The company that provided this service was a Google partner. They explained that 80-90% of reviews of everything is written for money.And the best thing - once we started getting our reviews, the flagged reviews were finally removed. Seems like AI decided the we are a good company.Do you think we did something wrong? Immoral? Or just played business on a not leveled field?And to summarize. I do not care about reviews. And we have money to fight back with lawyers or PR. But it is sad that some businesses don&#39;t have this option and somebody (Google) can harm them through reviews they did not ask for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An interesting thing about paid reviews - you can prove that the reviews are fake, but you usually can&#39;t prove that the business itself actually paid for those reviews. In a hypothetical world where companies with fake reviews are regularly discovered and lambasted in public, it&#39;s easy to imagine a sinister metagame where unscrupulous small businesses can buy bad good reviews (i.e. 5-star reviews that are obviously fake) for their competitors to make them seem sketchy. The folks selling the fake reviews certainly don&#39;t care who&#39;s paying. There&#39;s no obvious solution to me for that potential problem aside from stopping fake reviews before they&#39;re posted (which feels like the kind of thing that&#39;s much harder than it sounds); thankfully it doesn&#39;t appear to be a very common thing yet."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why do giant companies do so many hilariously dumb things?As organizational complexity increases, design debt and responsibility becomes diffused among larger and larger groups of people. Leading to the bizarre situation where no individual has power or responsibility over anything specifically.Any individual interface element might have taken input from as many as 100+ different people over many years, each with competing interests and goals (no, I&#39;m not joking). Combine this with the precedents and decisions made on projects in the past (design debt), and you end up with stupid outcomes like this.As a multiple FAANG alumni, I&#39;ve seen this firsthand hundreds of times.I think it&#39;s cute that people think IC designers or engineers have the power to make any real decisions inside large organizations.What&#39;s more likely, is these stupid icons were part of some design system somebody created 7 years ago (have to stay consistent of course!). The circular floating buttons were a precedent somebody set 5 years ago on a completely different product (god forbid it feels &#34;off-brand&#34;). The colors were set 6 years ago on some project where this kind of application was never thought of.And finally, the order &amp; placement of the icons was changed 15 times by some PM, then the PM&#39;s boss, then the accessibility guys, then the brand team, the brand team&#39;s boss, then the director of marketing, etc. etc. The tie breaking vote going to whoever is perceived as having more soft power inside the org at the time.Hence, the inevitable outcome of big company stupidity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just had an idea that might explain why this happens.Firstly, I&#39;ve observed a phenomenon when I talk to a programmer about a problem I want to solve. They might get excited, learn a bit of the problem domain and then go off and build something that kind of solves part of my problem. But then I&#39;m stuck in a endless cycle of explaining the rest of the problem, to someone who isn&#39;t really interested, then waiting for a new iteration and then evaluating how it doesn&#39;t completely the solve the problem until the programmer gets bored and goes off to find something new and exciting to do with computers. Programming the computerwas always the end for them. They don&#39;t actually care about the problem. I care about the problem. So for me computers are a tool to solve my problem. I might as well write the program myself because it&#39;s less work to become a mediocre programmer than to intimately understand the problem.My theory is that something like this happens in interface design. There are  designers who love to create beautiful designs, and we love that, but beauty is the end of it for them. They don&#39;t actually care about the problem that the program (website, app, whatever) is supposed to solve. If they were stuck in a job filling out forms all day they would quickly learn the lesson to put the reset button out of the way. If they were intimately familiar with the problem, the better design would be obvious. And so it is that people with no &#34;design skills&#34; can point out the obvious mistakes of the designers.It&#39;s also true that good design is hard. Starting with a blank sheet and creating something, let alone something good, is daunting. Perhaps the hardest part is having the humility to admit, &#34;I don&#39;t understand the problem sufficiently&#34; and the empathy to care about the problem enough to learn it well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Phoenix is practically built with this idea in mind.My startup is built out of a single phoenix monolith. Only external dependency is postgres.Despite this, I&#39;ve managed to completely avoid all the typical scaling issues of a monolith. Need a service or background worker? I juts make a Genserver or Oban worker and mount it in the supervision tree. The Beam takes care of maintaining the process, pubsub to said service and error handling in the event of a crash.I&#39;m basicly getting all the best advantages of a monolith* one codebase to navigate, our team is TINY
* all functionality is in librariesAnd all the advantages of microservices without the associated costs. (orchestration, management etc)* bottleneck use cases can live on their own nodes* publish subscribe to dispatch background jobs* services that each focus on doing one thing really wellWe&#39;ve accomplished this all through just libraries and a little bit of configuration. At no point so far have we had to..* setup a message broker (phoenix pubsub has been fine for us. we can send messages between different processes on the server and to the clients themselves over channels)* setup external clusters for background workers. (Oban was drop in and jsut works. I&#39;m able to add a new worker without having to tell devops anything. the supervision tree allocates the memory for the process and takes care of fault tolerance for me. That leaves me to focus on solving the business problems)* setup a second github repo. Its a monorepo and at out scale, its fine. We have one library for communicating to the database that every system just uses.Eventually we&#39;ll probably have to start rethinking and building out separate services. But I&#39;m happy that we&#39;re already able to get some of teh benefits of a microservice architecture while sticking to what makes monoliths great for mvps. It will be awhile before we need to think about scaling out web service. It just works. Leaves me more time to work on tuning out database to keep up!"</p>

It&#39;s like saying, &#34;If you have to get somewhere, running is better than walking.&#34; Sure, in the case of a race or escaping a predator, running is probably the best option. But what if you want to take in the sights or you can&#39;t sweat in your clothes? Running would be a bad choice, even though it&#39;s faster. There are just too many variables in the real world to make any sort of blanket statement about which approach is &#34;better.&#34;"</p>

Many randomized algorithms have a &#34;with high probability&#34; guarantee, which for linear systems might look like:    for any ε &gt; 0 and 0 &lt; δ &lt; 1, using poly(dimension, #nonzeros, condition, 1/ε, 1/δ) floating-point operations, our algorithm finds a solution having less than ε error with probability 1 - δ.

The way I install a Linux system these days and then immediately download ripgrep or fd reminds me of how the first thing I used to do on a Solaris system was install bash and the GNU coreutils. There&#39;s a rich history of doing this - BSD Unix started as a bunch of utilities and patches to the AT&amp;T version, it only became a freestanding distro with its own kernel later on. And the GNU coreutils go way back before the Linux kernel - you just installed them on a commercial Unix to make it more usable. In both cases they went beyond just drop-in replacements and started adding lots of new features and flags. Things have been pretty static for a long time so it&#39;s good to see some innovations coming."</p>

They&#39;re a fantastic way to onboard new players who might not have the inclination to spend hours with the rule books before they even start playing. It does all the calculations for you and gives you some buttons like &#34;roll athletics&#34; and doesn&#39;t let you add more spells than your character can have with their stats.I recently persuaded some friends to give FATE a try and built analogous push-button character sheets with google sheets [0]. It was quick and simple. With conditional formatting, you highlight bad states (rules say you can&#39;t have more of X than Y!). With the script editor, you can add full on buttons for dice rolls and other state changes with whatever logic you want (anything you can code up!). Checkboxes are obvious but super useful. And the transparency of the calculations is helpful for teaching people the system (this stat is &#34;min(A4, B1+C5)&#34;).Without google sheets, it would be a serious endeavor to build a stateful, database backed, live collaborative GUI that can be added to and customized on the fly by my users. With google sheets, it was a quick fun afternoon hack. Excel/google sheets is an amazing piece of technology.[0] Screenshot of the &#34;app&#34;: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imh/public_images/main/Scr..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hadn&#39;t used Excel in years and now that I do, there&#39;s some things about it that drive me nuts:- It forgets what you&#39;ve copied to clipboard. Copy something. Insert another row so that there&#39;s space for it. Paste. Nothing happens. Huh? It lost my copy. It does this for a large number of operations and it drives me crazy. I&#39;ve never seen any other program do this.- You can&#39;t open two spreadsheets of the same name. This is because spreadsheet formulas can refer to cells in other tables. But I don&#39;t use that feature - can&#39;t I just open the second spreadsheet with a warning that this feature won&#39;t apply to it?- (This one applies to too many pieces of Microsoft technology.) You can&#39;t use common keyboard shortcuts properly. Ctrl-backspace deletes a word in any useful text box. Not in formula editing in excel. And ctrl+delete deletes the rest of the line instead of just the next word. Why?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Excel, and more importantly, the spreadsheet is the best way to build intuition for a dataset, hands down. The alternatives, especially when it comes to Python and the default pandas output in a Jupyter Notebook are horrendous.Where Excel falls short, is data size limitations + auditability. Putting more than 1M rows of data into Excel is not possible, and once you get into the low 100K&#39;s, it becomes almost unbearable. And handing off an Excel workbooks to a colleague is handing them hours of cell dependency tracing. On the other hand, data size + auditability are the super powers of Python data analysis.I&#39;ve been building a Python package, Mito (https://trymito.io/), its an interactive spreadsheet that automatically converts your spreadsheet analysis to the equivalent pandas code. You can write spreadsheet formulas, merge datasets, create pivot tables, etc. And because its implemented in Python, you can manipulate datasets with 10M rows of data with no problem. Our goal is to bring the intuitiveness of Excel data manipulation to Pandas."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Finally this is getting some attention. Somewhat related, Healthcare startups are struggling with this because the standards they have to comply with (for developing medical software) cost up to 280 EUR (for a pdf!). [1]One common workaround is to go to &#34;the Estonian site&#34; which offers the same, English version of standards for a much lower price [2].  Being a bit cynical, I would say that Estonia prioritises open information much more highly than.. other developed countries. I created a price comparison on my website [3].But: The core problem of standards being openly available is still not solved. Why is this not possible? For me, standards are very comparable to the law: A large number of people should comply with it. For that, they must be openly available to everyone. Everything else doesn&#39;t make sense. Is that unreasonable?[1] https://www.iso.org/standard/38421.html
[2] https://www.evs.ee/en/
[3] https://openregulatory.com/accessing-standards/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The price of standards makes me angry. They&#39;re essentially a form of legislation in many countries - to sell anything in the EU you have to comply with the relevant safety standards. Yet they&#39;re kept under lock and key - to read the rules which you need to follow to sell something in your own country, you need to pay a 3rd party hundreds of Euros.And when you read the standards, they reference other standards. Eventually you have to build a graph of standards to which you must comply, each one costing hundreds of Euros. It&#39;s a complete racket.The worst thing is that the standards themselves tend to be written by 3rd party organisations with an interest in that domain, so they have a strong incentive to make the standard match with whatever they&#39;re doing. So not only does a new startup have to spend months reading hugely expensive dry safety standards, you also have to build something which is essentially a worse version of the incumbents."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The value of standards is in their adoption.Tim Sweeney correctly observes this, then continues to talk about &#34;millions of hobbyist programmers&#34;. I do not believe that ISO targets, or even has any remote interest, in this market.ISO is comprised of nation-state members who will inevitably mandate ISO standards as part of legal compliance. Various stakeholders actually participate in standardization efforts and thus also both already know the standard and are able to push it through. All of these categories (government, industries in highly regulated sectors and large stakeholders) have large amounts of capital. The amount of money required to fund a purchase of an ISO standard barely even factors in on a balance sheet.Hobbyist programmers arguably make a lot of open source software that builds the foundation for today&#39;s and tomorrow&#39;s platforms. However, when the big bulldozers from the previous paragraph roll in, hobbyist programmers give way to highly paid employees of these giants; be it by merging a patch or be it by being worked around with a greenfield project or fork.On the other hand, ISO has an incentive in charging money for their standards because this adds perceived value: If something is freely available, it is easier to dismiss it as a non-serious effort when debating whether it is worth to bind personnel for participation in the standards committees; the standards come across as valueless, worthless.Looking at this vector of interests of the various parties involved, I see little reason for this state of affairs to improve."</p>

There already is a Wikipedia equivalent, all it takes is a little research. Once you find it, you will know. I won&#39;t shill here, as I don&#39;t want that to dilute the points of Bitcoin&#39;s increasingly problematic issues due to its growing scale.That being said, the cryptoverse is drowning in sh*tcoins, and I completely understand anyone even remotely mentioning an alternative to Bitcoin being inevitably categorized as a shiller and therefore not worth listening to."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just the other day I was in my logistics class and the professor started deviating into something that I believe was pure nonsense.He started the lecture by analyzing how many pieces a machine could manufacture per day. Fair enough. He extended the model to measure different ratios of capacity. Makes sense.Then he tried to extend the model to all machines, including humans. His example was: &#34;How do you measure the capacity of a legal team?&#34;. I thought it was a trick question, so I answered (paraphrasing) &#34;You can&#39;t answer that question the same way you answer for the machine. You can&#39;t give a single metric.&#34; He told me I was wrong and that the _right_ measure would be (total number of working hours/day).I was tempted to try to convince him otherwise. The analogy was deeply flawed. He certainly measured the machines in (number of pieces / day) but measured the legal team in (hours/day). So, in analyzing a machine, you take into account its efficiency, but you don&#39;t do the same thing for humans.I believe that is exactly the same thing that is going on in the post. Managers/Logistics/Economists are very susceptible to this kind of generalization pitfalls.Edit: Given that this answer has generated some discussion I feel the need to expand on it. The legal team was not expected to sell their services &#34;by the hour&#34;. In fact, any discussion about how their services were sold was shut down by the professor. From his point of view, the lawyers were machines and he was asking the question &#34;how much can this machine produce?&#34;Yes, other students also suggested taking the number of billable hours/revenue into account, but that&#39;s not the answer the professor was looking for.I don&#39;t criticize whether his answer is not technically right, but I feel it holds no real-world meaning. It was a purely academic question that leads nowhere instead of having a debate about how you measure the productivity of a group of human beings. And on top of that, his final answer was definitive and (from his point of view) was irrefutable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sharing other people&#39;s amazement that such a tiny amount of code plays so well (I&#39;m an inexperienced, infrequent player and it beat me once and drew once), I was pondering that there&#39;s no absolute reason to think that small programs inherently must play games poorly. For many abstract strategy games, you could write an explicit game tree search in a relatively small amount of code and it would, in principle, play perfectly if you somehow gave it enough time to search the whole game tree. (That wouldn&#39;t be feasible for most abstract strategy games that human beings like to play, but would for small games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Hexapawn or Octapawn, Nine Men&#39;s Morris, maybe Hex on a small board.)In GOFAI (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_artificial_intelligen...) there&#39;s a clear pattern where &#34;intelligence&#34; in abstract strategy games represents, in part, being able to prune game trees well without having to search them exhaustively. In some cases that means having a good evaluation function for positions, and in other cases having a cleverer search strategy in another way.Thinking about this made me realize that it&#39;s not just impressive that this program plays decently while being tiny, but especially that it plays decently and quickly while being tiny."</p>

If ever something went catastrophically wrong with youtube this could be reactivated via the feed* He has a large email list which he uses to reach people directly and drive traffic to videos if people request these updates* He is also prominent on twitter etc and maintains secondary youtube channels, useful if main one taken down* He runs a large subreddit for his followingSo it is layers and layers of redundancy, built on a mix of other platforms and also two he controls directly (email and rss)Still faces a youtube risk but it would take a an earthquake across platforms to truly wreck his income streams.As someone who runs an online business and follows him it’s been impressive to watch how diversified he has made his comms channels."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Linus SebastianSomething to understand, for those who might have just seen some youtube videos of him being goofy, is that he&#39;s an actor. The guy on camera doing stupid stuff is a stage persona. It&#39;s an intentionally cultivated image and media persona to get as many video views as possible.I sort of see him as one possible aspect of the low/medium budget TV production stuff which is common in his home city, Vancouver BC. People who&#39;ve met and worked with him in person report that he&#39;s a much more normal, calm, rational individual off screen.I won&#39;t judge him for being goofy on camera because it&#39;s hard to make a living as a working actor. For every person who gets a job in a vancouver-produced TV drama that might last 2 or 3 seasons, there&#39;s dozens more people who are working as restaurant servers while trying to get their big break."</p>

I can build a computer from parts which I can choose, and have a choice in which operating system to install on them. Laptops are slightly more closed, but even on those I can choose the OS myself.Modern smartphones however, seem like walled gardens in which I have no control at all. I cannot choose any of the parts, and even doing simple reparation tasks like replacing a battery is a nightmare these days. I am locked into a single OS on my smartphone, which either spies on you or is locked down even more. Every iteration a bit more control is taken away from the user. And its increasingly hard to step away from them, since a lot of normal interactions such as banking almost requires you to have such a phone.Both Android and iOS suck. I&#39;ve made my own Android phone tolerable with F-Droid and trying to ungoogle it as much as possible. But unfortunately I find myself locked into using google play services since solutions like MicroG just don&#39;t cut it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"NFTs make perfect sense for representing a claim on things that can be used, like event tickets or in-game virtual goods. But as certificates layered on top of collectibles... I&#39;m not so sure.With something like CryptoKitties, you can do something with the tokens (play a virtual pet game). But with something like CryptoPunks you&#39;re essentially paying for digital beanie babies, which are worse than real ones since anyone can display and enjoy the image you paid for.You can brag about owning such-and-such an image, but only as long as enough other people desire images from that particular set. When a set&#39;s popularity wanes, so does your token&#39;s value, and your ability to show it off.I&#39;m always happy to see artists being paid for their work, and if they can make some money during this craze - more power to them. Beyond a few creators being rewarded, it seems like this is going to be 90% bubble (with plenty of hucksters), and 10% real use cases that stand the test of time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pretty bad take on NFTs.There are numerous configurations, networks, and commercial structures that can be created for NFT offerings that can mitigate &#34;problems&#34; described in the OP and accommodate for different tradeoffs.A simple retort would point to the many alternative NFT networks that don&#39;t use POW-based consensus algorithms or the NFT offerings that enable value add offerings very differently than purchasing art or baseball cards.Evaluating the capabilities of NFTs against the value offerings of something like rare art is an apples to oranges comparison. Of course the market for digital assets offered via NFT is immature and speculative; this is a new market, based on an alternative technology paradigm, that has a long way to go before it settles into a more usable and valuable structure.Ultimately, the idea of using key-pairs pegged to widely accessible peer-to-peer public networks as a mechanism for tracking ownership of digital (or near digital or at times even physical) assets is incredibly novel. It turns the conventional model of third-party hosted digital assets on its head and enables really interesting mechanisms of distribution, ownership, access, and value consumption and creation that does not compare well with traditional mechanisms. And in saying it doesn&#39;t compare well I mean to acknowledge its limitations and its potential at the same time. However, the critique in the OP is pretty bland and doesn&#39;t seem to acknowledge the full scope of the situation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Having distinct types for P0 and P1 is deliberate and is what is called &#34;type state programming&#34; in the embedded rust book [0]. The advantage is that you can prevent misconfiguration at compile time  (ensuring that a given pin cannot be used in multiple places). In the Zig example, it seems to me (and I have zero knowledge of Zig, so sorry if this is inaccurate) that you can potentially introduce bugs where the same pin is used twice.For a generic led driver, it should not use these types, but instead the trait types from the embedded_hal crate, such as &#34;OutputPin&#34; that is implemented by the different chip-specific HALs. There is an example of a generic led driver that uses these traits at [1].In general I recommend everyone who wants to try out Rust on embedded to read the embedded rust book, because it clarifies a lot of the reasons and advantages of its approach.[0] https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/static-guarantees/typest...[1] https://github.com/drogue-iot/drogue-device/blob/main/rt/src..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s another example of the coolness of Zig&#39;s comptime code execution:https://github.com/ziglang/zig/commit/0808d98e10c5fea27cebf9...That&#39;s a generic container class (similar to vector in C++ or List in C#). But! With a twist!It stores structs in &#34;column major&#34; order in memory (e.g., if a struct had two fields A and B, then in-memory layout would be A...AB...B), and you can idiomatically and efficiently get a a slice of the values of each column.I.e., it&#39;s a datastructure that automatically applies the struct-of-arrays optimization:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AoS_and_SoA#Structure_of_Arr...And the code to do it is straightforward, normal Zig.Pretty awesome stuff!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Zig&#39;s design is so radical, that it completely rethinks how low-level programming can and should be done, rather than improve on one of the existing low-level programming philosophies (C or C++&#39;s). That the result is such a simple and easy-to-learn language that, despite being so radical, doesn&#39;t feel foreign is truly an accomplishment.&gt; In particular, that much of the complexity I’d unconsciously attributed to the domain — “this is what systems programming is like” — was in fact a consequence of deliberate Rust design decisions.I also thought that, and, to be fair to Rust, it is following the tradition of C++ and Ada, two low-level languages that would also easily make the top five most complex languages in history alongside Rust. Until Zig showed up, I, and I think many others, didn&#39;t believe that an expressive low-level language could be made so simple, certainly not one that values safety."</p>

He gave a lecture at my university on ethics, and the IEEE council got to take him for lunch afterwards.He was not shy at all about saying whatever was on his mind. It was pretty awesome to hear him dunk on his VP, right in the middle of lying to the Rogers commission&#39;s face. He was also really open about the fact that nobody at Morton Thiokol trusted him for the better part of a decade after he did that. He said something to the effect of, &#34;It definitely made my career harder, but on the bright side, I never had any major crises of conscience for lying about it.He also didn&#39;t give a single fuck about getting a lunch beer at a student gathering. I wish I&#39;d joined him in drinking beer at noon on a Tuesday on IEEE dime."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The film “Challenger: The Final Flight” on Netflix includes interviews with the most important participants in the launch decision, including McDonald. (It also has interviews with many of the astronauts’ families and does a great job at putting their experience front and centre.)The guy whose job it was to send the fax because he happened to be the one who knew how to operate the fax machine is to this day utterly devastated; weeping.The MTI VP who signed off (although the decision was made above his head) admits that he agreed with it at the time, but acknowledges it was a mistake. He’s being interviewed in a large room full of very expensive furniture.The NASA manager who bullied them into agreeing to launch because they couldn’t prove that it was unsafe basically says that if he had his time over he would kill all of the astronauts again.

It appears that there are enormous differences of opinion as to the probability of a failure with loss of vehicle and of human life. The estimates range from roughly 1 in 100 to 1 in 100,000. The higher figures come from the working engineers, and the very low figures from management. What are the causes and consequences of this lack of agreement? Since 1 part in 100,000 would imply that one could put a Shuttle up each day for 300 years expecting to lose only one, we could properly ask &#34;What is the cause of management&#39;s fantastic faith in the machinery?&#34;

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Switzerland has an awesome electoral system [1].  Instead of being ruled by a president or a prime minister who can be polarising, divisive, or selective, Switzerland has an Executive Council.The 7 member Executive Council is composed of the top 7 candidates from each election.  The chairperson of the executive council rotates each year, so that the top 4 vote winners each get a turn at being chairperson.This means that different social and political priorities get implemented in turn.  It also means the way the government works is more cooperative, because each council member, including the chairperson, knows there will be a new chairperson next year.So, if a pro-business candidate places 1st, and an environment candidate 2nd, and a social welfare candidate 3rd, and a libertarian candidate 4th, it is in all their interests to cooperate and create legislation that serves all of their interests as much as possible.  Instead of disregarding the environment, the pro-business council member is encouraged to develop green business initiatives that will be supported for the full 4 year term under the different chairs.The system creates a leadership team that looks for win-win, rather than a sole victor who can abuse majority rule.[1]. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Council_(Switzerland)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; [Julia] was a bold-looking girl, of about twenty-seven, with thick hair, a freckled face, and swift, athletic movements. A narrow scarlet sash, emblem of the Junior Anti-Sex League, was wound several times round the waist of her overalls, just tightly enough to bring out the shapeliness of her hips. Winston had disliked her from the very first moment of seeing her.&gt; Better than before, moreover, he realized why it was that he hated her. He hated her because she was young and pretty and sexless, because he wanted to go to bed with her and would never do so, because round her sweet supple waist, which seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm, there was only the odious scarlet sash, aggressive symbol of chastity.1984, George Orwell, 1949"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was a fun read, especially as someone who grew up with those 80s and 90s movies.That said, and as the author touches on, the action/super hero of today is a PG-13 one. Studios need to reach the widest audience possible to make the most money, so it&#39;s a safer bet.Sure, back in the day studios had the same imperative, but the licensed toy game was still young, so they didn&#39;t realise that maybe if they made Die Hard PG instead of R they could sell some John McClane action figures to younger viewiers.Nowadays, that&#39;s basically the starting point; what we can we sell outside of the movie? how can we milk the franchise for as much as possible?And that&#39;s where a lot of the sex appeal is lost. Marvel movies can&#39;t be as raunchy as a result.Another topic that the author touched on was the way the ideal aesthetic has changed in not just our bodies but where we live or what we do in our spare time.I agree that more and more we are optimising for artifice; fitness classes, extra curricular activities, holidays, concerts and events we attend, just to keep up an appearance online or in person. And in those activities we often don&#39;t get the true value out of them because we&#39;re doing them for the wrong reason.Anyway, it&#39;s a complex and interesting topic and I&#39;d love to read more about this perhaps from even further back (50s or 60s) if anyone has something similar to this post?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seriously? Selective sampling and click bait.Two recent programs come to mind and I&#39;m sure this list is not exhaustive. &#34;The boys&#34; and &#34;Orville&#34;. Both chock full of &#34;heroes&#34; who in-between being heroes are preoccupied with banging each other, getting drunk, eating or failing themselves. The last episode of &#34;The Boys&#34; ends with Homelander jerking off while perched on a ledge over the city and raging at the unfairness of life. It&#39;s certainly a comment on the blandness of the Marvel universe and Orville is a superior and cutting rip off of Star Trek which has become bland and inoffensive in it&#39;s latest incarnations. Orville cuts pretty close to the limit for whatever rating it has. The two &#34;gay&#34; aliens and the holodeck porn episode come to mind. It was done fairly well. Stressed out officer on a star ship gets a holodeck porn addiction and is no longer able to relate to or face his life partners demands for attention. It&#39;s not heroic and not glorious but relatively human. Orville&#39;s officers like to fuck. They order booze from the matter synthesizers and they get depressed and do stupid things. Of course it is still &#34;star trek&#34; and there are always happy endings  and everybody learns a lesson at the end. It doesn&#39;t drift too far from the genre.However the article takes a selective slice of current cinematic culture and tries to pretend there are no other options out there whilst at the same time looking back at 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s cinema as if it was the age of body positive cinema."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Been following the creators for awhile and very much happy to see them democratizing their difficult skillset.Most designers -- think anyone using figma -- are effectively locked out of modern interactive and animated visuals due to not knowing hardcore shaders + effective js coding. To get a feel for how hard that is, look at the public timeline of Shirley Wu, another wonderful award-winning designer and experienced js coder, to pick this kind of stuff up. Nodes makes it a lot more accessible, similar to Max/msp for musicians. Once you look beyond the over-claiming, which is clearly nails-on-chalkboard for most engineers and scientists as you are seeing in the comments -- this is a wonderful and enabling project.Extra impressive is they do not seem to try to &#39;dumb it down&#39;. They are a consultancy and (seem to) try to use it for their own bespoke advanced installations. I don&#39;t know how well this will translate to others, but the success of Max msp and super collider make me optimistic that it can grow to those levels. Cycling 74 supports 20+ employees and empowers many musicians, and as Nodes can be used for commercial art (web+tv ads, music videos, landing pages, ...), I can see them being even bigger."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks like a new assembly of old ideas that’s different enough it might do better for some purposes. Very exciting.I was about to start prototyping some tool ideas I had in it, but I can’t find it’s source or license info anywhere. By Googling, I found the GitHub repo [0], but it’s empty of code and looks to be used for issue tracking only.I can’t see something that’s trying to be an ecosystem being very successful without being open (see: every closed-source language/runtime ever).I couldn’t even find any example code. I tried clicking the examples on the home page. I even tried clicking “Playground” and it wasn’t a link. The only CTA I could find was “Download Nodes”![0] https://github.com/nodes-io/nodes-io"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, somehow looks similar to another site that I discovered few weeks ago: https://cables.gl/I googled and found this: https://nodes.io/story/#background&gt; When we set off to create a tool of our own, there were already plenty of different node-based or visual scripting/programming tools and environments; VVVV, Houdini, TouchDesigner, Cables.gl, Vizor Patches, Lichen, MaxMSP, UE4 Blueprints and Origami were among the most popular."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s an avalanche of people commenting on this who didn&#39;t bother to check the article before raising their methodological objections, so let&#39;s get these out of the way here.- Yes, they controlled for objects appearing in the pictures that might indicate political affiliation. The images are tightly cropped around the face. See Methods.- Yes, this is significantly better than both a coin flip and a human classifier. They gave the same test to humans, who did much worse than the model. See Abstract, Introduction, and Results.- Yes, this is doing more than just detecting a person&#39;s race, age, and/or gender. The classifier is still accurate when they compare people with the same race, age, and gender. See Results.If you want to discuss actual limitations in the study, here are some the author points out:- &#34;A more detailed picture could be obtained by exploring the links between political orientation and facial features extracted from images taken in a standardized setting while controlling for facial hair, grooming, facial expression, and head orientation.&#34;- &#34;Another factor affecting classification accuracy is the quality of the political orientation estimates. While the dichotomous representation used here (i.e., conservative vs. liberal) is widely used in the literature, it offers only a crude estimate of the complex interpersonal differences in ideology. Moreover, self-reported political labels suffer from the reference group effect: respondents’ tendency to assess their traits in the context of the salient comparison group.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This isn&#39;t a study that shows that people&#39;s faces indicate their political leanings.It&#39;s a study which shows that pictures that people select to represent themselves publicly have features that indicate political leaning."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the key line is how much better this system is than humans attempting the same task:&gt; Political orientation was correctly classified in 72% of liberal–conservative face pairs, remarkably better than chance (50%), human accuracy (55%), or one afforded by a 100-item personality questionnaire (66%).This isn&#39;t a matter of &#34;recognize that old white people are conservative&#34;, because people will do that already, and they know all those biases. And the system doesn&#39;t lose much accuracy when comparing otherwise similar people.This system is picking up on things we don&#39;t notice. Maybe it&#39;s the photos themselves (they are self-selected), maybe it&#39;s micro expressions in the face, maybe it&#39;s something else entirely.But damn it&#39;s neat and maybe frightening. Imagine if your next hiring manager had a quiet little camera in the corner and chose you based on your predicted approval of unions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Just 100 cars will be made available with the technology in Japan, and they will cost the equivalent of $101,900. None of these Legends will make their way to the U.S.&#34;I&#39;m assuming if it won&#39;t come to the US it won&#39;t come to the UK, Canada or Australia either.Is 100 units really a &#34;production car&#34;? I don&#39;t agree.Also:&#34;It does all this with zero input from the driver, who Honda says can &#34;watch television/DVD on the navigation screen or operate the navigation system to search for a destination address.&#34;and yet:&#34;Please do not overestimate the capabilities of each Honda Sensing Elite function and drive safely while paying constant attention to your surroundings. Please remain in condition where you can respond to the handover request issued by the system, and immediately resume driving upon the handover request.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What is notable is level 3. Not the features, but the legal aspect of claiming drivers can now be distracted with your mode.Tesla &#34;auto&#34;pilot does more, while pretending to enforce an always alert driver. This has resulted in a couple wrongful deaths no one at Tesla has been prosecuted for.Honda meanwhile is taking advantage of the Japanese governments legal changes which make level 3 legally tenable. Drivers need not watch the road, but they must respond when the car asks them to. This means Honda is promising your Honda will not silently drive you into a wall as the Tesla autopilot is known to do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s not mentioned in all the othe english based articles is that Honda&#39;s system only works on highways at speeds below 50km/h. It&#39;s a system specifically designed for dealing with traffic jams on highways, and is not comparable to, say, Tesla&#39;s autopilot.https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Honda-launches-...&gt; It can free drivers from driving in congested traffic on an expressway when travelling slower than 50 kilometers per hour.&gt; The system automatically accelerates, brakes and steers while monitoring the vehicle&#39;s surroundings, using data from high-definition mapping and external sensors."</p>
