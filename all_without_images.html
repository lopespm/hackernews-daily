								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reminds me of this company: https://www.blueheartenergy.com/The claims are pretty amazing. High efficiency, efficient over a wide range of temperature difference, high temperature differences possible.The operating principle is totally different. It is based on acoustic waves. Not using phase-changes but just the ideal gas law (pressure and temperature are proportional). I tried to get my head around it, and I got it with a standing sound wave. But they use a traveling wave, for which I could not find explanations I understood.The general idea is &#34;lower air pressure and move gas to cold side so the gas heats up&#34; followed by &#34;raise air pressure and move gas to warm side so the gas cools down&#34;. That means the low pressure needs to be low enough that the gas gets colder than the cold side, and the high pressure needs to be high enough that the gas gets hotter than the hot side. Luckily that is &#39;just&#39; a matter of amplitude of the sound wave. I think this is how they achieve their wide range of efficient temperature deltas.That wide range is the main difference with a phase-change based unit. The phase change happens at a much more difficult to change temperature."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is plenty of opportunity in being more efficient.  To give an example, houses in the Bay Area has gray/black roofs.  In the summer such roof receives about 10kW of energy and readily converts it into heat.  Heat, which we are trying to evacuate from the house with our super-efficient heat pumps in the air-conditioning units.If only we&#39;d painted these roofs with white reflective roof paint (~92% reflection).  We would have removed ~8kW of heating from such roofs!  And then, maybe, we wouldn&#39;t  have to pump all that energy into air-conditioning.  So the surrounding air would be cooler, less noise would be heard from air conditioning, less energy would be spent.   And the cost?  4 gallons of white reflective paint and a couple of hours of work, painting the roof..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Hype: &#34;Identifiers should be self-documenting! Use full names, not abbreviations.&#34;&gt; Shower: Researchers had programmers fix bugs in a codebase, either with all of the identifiers were abbreviated, or where all of the identifiers were full-words. They found no difference in time taken or quality of debugging.That&#39;s a very weird take on the statement. The downside of using abbreviations is probably dominated by the difficulty of fixing the bug. The problem I have with abbreviations is that they just become another thing that you have to spend your mental resources on. “What is this variable exactly? Oh, I see.” is just wasted effort."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been listening to the audiobook of the Silmarillion while on a run or doing chores.

Each re-listen I&#39;ve understood more and more. It&#39;s a strange way to enjoy the work but I honestly think the creation myth at the beginning is really well written and had I just read the book I may have read it the once, retained some of it, referred back to it maybe, and moved on to the rest of the tale.Slow going but commenting just because you may enjoy this too if you&#39;ve made it to this thread. I haven&#39;t read the rest of the books since I was a kid so priming myself thoroughly for the re-read with Silmarillion first seems like it&#39;s going to have a nice payoff as rich as the world is."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, if the author was fired for the reasons they believe, that&#39;s pretty bad behavior. But if he had not been fired, what was management supposed to have done about the cult members working for this department?Yes, the cult&#39;s leader sounds like a pretty awful person, but he wasn&#39;t working there. What were the cult members doing in their work in the department that was clearly wrong? It&#39;s suggested that there was favoritism and unfair promotion going on -- but it&#39;s not very well evidenced here. Were they using company money to fund their organization? It&#39;s also not clear from the article that the wine outfit is a cult subsidiary.And if the concern is primarily that the cult itself is a shady organization with some bad people, and that something should be done to stop Google from having a clique of staff that are even _affiliated_ with that organization ... well that seems like a really fraught policy. Are you supposed to then ask everyone in the department about their religious affiliations, or whether they&#39;ve given money to a fringe religious organization? That also seems like a really unhealthy road for a company to go down."</p>

I&#39;ve had teams where majority of the team is from the same university or class. More than 50% of the team having a common denominator is common and it usually starts with one person getting hired in a high enough position where their hiring decisions are not scrutinized."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The number of amino-acids found has been mentioned in many on-line media, but it is completely meaningless.There exists a huge number of amino-acids, most of them are not made or used by the known living beings and of those made by living beings even fewer are used in proteins.A very large number of random amino-acids have also been found in various meteorites, because they easily form from the most abundant chemical elements in the Universe, H, C, N and O, whenever there is not enough oxygen to oxidize everything else, but among them only about 10 of those used by living beings have been found, i.e. about one half of the amino-acids used in proteins.What would have been interesting to know about the Japanese asteroid probe would have been if, among the many amino-acids found, there have been also the same about 10 amino-acids previously found, or only a part of them, and if there has been found any other amino-acid with biological importance besides those ten.The press release mentions only glutamic acid and valine, 2 simple amino-acids which belong to those 10 about which it is well known that they can easily be synthesized in abiotic conditions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They cooked a sample of Ryuguu and drove off about 15% of its mass,  mostly in the form of H2O and CO2.  That is,  Ryuguu is wetter and more carbon rich than the earth.Iron, Silicon and Aluminum are there in abundance. (Gerard K. O&#39;Neill and many science fiction writers have gotten wrong the idea that you need M-type asteroids to get iron.)  Astronauts found high quality hematite ore on the moon.If you wanted to make large solar sails (say to be a sunshade the Earth-Sun L1 point) you would probably de-volatilize materials by using heat and possibly oxygen.  It would be ideal to convert hydrocarbons to carbon monoxide so you can do C1 chemistry to make plastics.  You have waste CO2 no matter what (it offgases from carbonates and other chemistry) so you will need the same kind of chemistry people are talking about for capturing CO2 and using it as a chemical feedstock.The &#34;metal line&#34; and &#34;stone lines&#34; would reduce the devolatized rock to produce silicon solar cells,  electric connections,   mirrors,  etc.  You will make storage tanks from iron,  the devolatilization process could be a little awkward because you will need storage tanks to put the gate.The one resource I&#39;m not sure about is nitrogen, which is important for making chemistry work.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Funnily in linux we&#39;ve had kind of the opposite problem where dmcrypt at some point was changed to use high-priority, multi-threaded workqueues, creating a priority inversion situation.Regular userspace processes, even those with niced/lowered priority, could generate overwhelming amounts of CPU load just by creating a bunch of IO burden on a dmcrypt-backed mountpoint.  Far more than their fair share in terms of their own process scheduling.The effects of this were especially visible when listening to mp3 files on something like a core2duo (or older) machine.  Audio buffer underruns galore, just because you had a big git checkout or rsync running.It took me years to convince upstream to revert the responsible dmcrypt workqueue commit and fix this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yep. On a related note, when I was younger, I searched for advice from experts for how to develop expertise in studying and productivity on Reddit. It led to lots of highly-upvoted advice (including stuff like supplements, largely with few real benefits besides placebo), popular blogs by influencers (like Scott Young), and popular self-help books.However, the actual experts I knew in high school who later went on to great institutions like MIT or applied and got into extremely competitive investment banks didn&#39;t browse the internet very much, or relied on supplements and these books.Similar to the ideas expressed in the submitted article, these people didn&#39;t spend time online reading blogs and Reddit, or blogging/self-promoting themselves. They generally were involved in a sport (track and field or squash), spent little time online, and spent a lot of time using a lot of paper studying.They also were careful who they associated with as friends (they hung out with studious people). Less in one&#39;s control, their parents were financially successful or were in competitive positions (e.g. were professors or physicians), so they may have learned these strategies from them, versus inventing them independently.Long story short: there is absolutely a culture of improvement that is primarily offline and less visible, because people either don&#39;t record it, or people do record it and it doesn&#39;t get upvoted or ranked highly on Google searches. Examples of recorded good advice appeared on HN recently, shared by computer scientist Donald Knuth who is also usually offline: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31482116"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think about this constantly while reading Hacker News.  So many articles and comments by people whose level of enthusiasm doesn&#39;t match their experience.  Try to voice a comment that goes against the flow of that enthusiasm and you&#39;ll be downvoted to oblivion, even if you speak with more experience and context than the masses.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Yes, there are many people who blog and otherwise publicly discuss development methodologies and what they&#39;re working on, but there are even more people who don&#39;t. Blogging takes time, for example, and not everyone enjoys it. Other people are working on commercial products and can&#39;t divulge the inner workings of their code.There’s a subset of this silent majority who tried to contribute to discussion platforms but gave up when they saw prominent voices that had next to no idea what they were talking about being promoted, hailed, and so on. The loudest voice is rarely the most articulate, and for subject matter experts articulation, nuance, and other learned-through-experience things count for a lot, one would assume."</p>

					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31780128">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In addition to the project itself being very cool and useful (you can count the number of verified SAT solvers that can solve most problems in modern SAT competitions on two fingers!), it&#39;s also an impressive demonstration of its toolchain, which essentially exploits the fact that the purely safe fragment of Rust (augmented with a handful of types that use unsafe code like Vec, which I believe have been proven compatible with the rest of Creusot in another recent paper) behaves like a functional language.  This allows borrow-checked Rust code to be treated purely functionally in safe contexts, which allows exploiting the large amount of existing software tailored to proving purely functional specifications, without having to worry about memory-related side conditions, separation logic, etc.This has always been the hope for Rust verification tools (that Rust would scale to these kinds of large proofs better than other industrial imperative languages due to the restrictions of the borrow checker), and I think this is the first real practical indication that that is indeed the case.  Both in terms of verification time and additional verification code, it weighs in at a small fraction of that of the only other verified solver with comparable performance on SAT benchmarks (IsaSAT), which is extracted using code generation from Isabelle (which is a full proof assistant), while other attempts to produce verified SAT solvers directly from imperative code fall far short of its performance because they do not implement any of the difficult optimizations (presumably due to the amount of extra proof effort required).Incidentally, another paper has come out at basically the same time making a similar observation, Aeneas: https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07185, which uses a resizable hash map as its case study.  Since it just came out, it does not have any larger proof developments yet that could be used as comparison, and it has somewhat different goals, but overall I am also excited about it and am very hopeful for the future of verification tools that integrate directly with Rust code like these two, as I think they are one of the more promising avenues towards the regular integration of verified code with more &#34;ordinary&#34; projects."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This project uses one-way translation of Rust code into WhyML through Creusot. This translation is not formally guaranteed to be correct or semantics-preserving.Ideally, the code produced by Creusot should be translated back to Rust by a tool from Creusot or someone else. This way it is possible to use fixed point iteration, just like AST pretty-printer and parser for programming language syntax.This is more or less an approach taken by verification team of Buran (USSR&#39;s space shuttle) software. They took Fortran code and compiled it into executable code. The executable code was then manually translated back into Fortran and discrepancies analyzed. This way they found several errors in Fortran compiler. Buran made fully automatic landing in late 80-s.Contemporary verifiers should do the same automatically."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi! I’m the author of Creusot, Sarek did some amazing work on CreuSAT, he also had to teach himself formal verification and SAT solving along the way.If you have any questions about CreuSAT or Creusot, I’d be happy to answer"</p>

Think about what this is really saying: Amazon adopts the explicit policy of not wanting their workers to stay on long enough to figure out that they are getting a bad deal.So it&#39;s not that they are running out of people to hire, it&#39;s that they are running out of people who have not yet figured out that working for Amazon is a bad deal.Now I understand why I&#39;ve been seeing so many commercials lately about how great it is to work for Amazon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this article might bury the lede a bit:&gt;Walmart is offering some workers with past warehouse experience as much as $25 an hour. An Amazon executive told Reuters in late 2021 that the company was bumping the average starting wage for new hires in the US to more than $18 an hour, attributing the decision to intense competition among employers.People used to work for Amazon warehouses in the 2010s because $15/hr was a much better wage than they could find elsewhere in their geographic location.After the pandemic and ongoing inflation, it&#39;s not difficult to find easier work which pays better. Amazon responded with a token raise that doesn&#39;t even cover CoL adjustments, but history shows that they need to pay well above market rates to hire the quantity of people that they need.It&#39;s funny to see this dynamic at a time when the federal minimum wage is still stuck at $7.25/hr."</p>

Criticize internally all you want, and influence the changes that you want to see happen. Employment is a two-way relationship. If you don&#39;t like your employer, you are free to leave. If they don&#39;t like you, they are free to fire you (within legal bounds). Publishing an openly critical letter and signing it is a quick way to get your employer to not like you."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a sucker for good little microinteractions. The author&#39;s checkbox may not be one of those, as it seems a bit overdone, but I&#39;d have to try it to be sure. It&#39;s easy to go too far.But, some other examples that I love:• https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/3d-button The red &#34;push me&#34; button is great, but also check out the sun/moon icon near the top right!• https://www.jam3.com/#contact The hover states on the buttons.• https://citymapper.com The top-left hamburger icon.(I also happen to be quite proud of the hover states on my own site: https://jonathanalland.com/)Making this type of stuff is definitely what I miss most about working in web design."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The animations on things like this can be cute and fun the first time, but man they can get annoying if they&#39;re constant and can&#39;t be skipped. Hearthstone is an example of this; there&#39;s tons of cute animations for the various cards, but they can take way too long.Hiding &#34;no animations&#34; for power users under accessibility is a great way to go."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s pretty cool! As experiments I really love andy.works&#39; work. I appreciate what he&#39;s trying to accomplish. And I think he&#39;s on to something with the idea. But the execution is always a little off to me.I just don&#39;t find this checkbox all that satisfying. Why? The thing I find satisfying about checkboxes is the same as any switch – the click. On/off. It&#39;s snappy. I don&#39;t think about it. Click... click... click click!So this grandiose check animation is taking something inherently snappy and prolonging it to its own defeat. Even the sound effect is like an ethereal chime or something, rather than a snap. The scale is super big for the actual space of the phone. The animation too long. I also don&#39;t like the angle of the 3D checkmark itself. It&#39;s not really oblique, not really at any sort of satisfying geometric angle? I can live with that though.Anyway really cool work. Wish it were more satisfying."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hello, author here! As the website says, the compiler itself is still in a very early state where basic things like functions, types, traits, inference, monomorphisation, and codegen are implemented. The fun stuff of algebraic effects, lifetime inference, and refinement types are not however. Though I can elaborate on implementation strategies of these for anyone curious. For example, algebraic effects in existing languages can be quite slow at runtime due to the use of continuations, the translation to a monad stack, and/or dynamically finding handlers at runtime. It is my plan to monomorphise them away and inline all these cases as in the following paper (1). With this, handlers are inlined into functions, continuations are normal closures, and continuations that aren&#39;t called multiple times are inlined.(1) Zero-cost Effect Handlers by Staging:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I avidly follow descendants of Scheme and Haskell (I figured out for example how to build Idris native on an M1 Mac), and I plan to follow Ante. I just spent $5k of lunch money on an M1 Ultra Mac Studio, to use as a math compute server. How do I keep it busy? Haskell. My &#34;Hello world&#34; parallel benchmark, using reverse search to enumerate the 66,960,965,307 atomic lattices on six atoms, took 14 hours in 2009. It now takes four minutes.I&#39;d love to start again with a new, small language. I love Haskell, but it&#39;s decades old, and one struggles to work with it without being torn apart by the gravitational tides of the black hole at the center of its galaxy. All jokes aside, Haskell really does reward a PhD in category theory, or the self-taught equivalent later.Functional languages make parallelism easier, and Haskell has put particular effort into this: Adding a dozen lines to a program can keep the 16 performance cores of my Mac Studio running full tilt. I have yet to read any account of how someone else&#39;s favorite language makes parallelism easy, that is aware of the comparison with Haskell. If I thought there was a reasonable alternative, I&#39;d jump at trying it.Rust appeals because it replaces GC with modern control of allocation lifetimes. I love how Ante will also explore this. I use cyclic data structures; how one handles this functionally, and how one handles this using reference counting, is exactly the same problem.Parallelism should be the first consideration, designing any new language in 2022. Parallelism is the reason I keep using Haskell, despite newer alternatives. Any language that runs on a single core is a toy. This is a plea!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The syntax looks a little funky to me but it&#39;s still quite interesting. Is there a reason why you would make fn(1) and fn 1 equivalent? For me personally it makes readability worse and looks strange when chaining functions like in their last example on their landing page.On mobile horizontal scrolling through the code snippets will trigger switching to the next snippet on my phone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"After a rather dismal first couple of runs I read the blog post for some hints. The best I found was to try to raise rates during the good times so there is wiggle room during downturns. I was able to get 443,904 by raising to over 10% during the initial prosperity period and was able to cut rates in half as soon as there was a crash. Ultimately I stabilized at around 3.5%. As of the time of this post I think that is the highest or close to highest score, only slightly higher than those that did a constant -0.5%.I’ve always been apprehensive of how low interest rates dropped around 9/11 and nobody had the political courage to raise them after that, leaving little room for leverage. What I have learned from racing games is that in order to win, it’s not all about holding down the gas pedal the hardest. Its about keeping on the track first, which requires lower speeds to navigate complexity, and only using max speed in straightaways.Or to quote the eminent Charlie Sheen, right after his infamous ’banging 7 gram rocks’ he said, “I only have one speed, I only have one gear: GO.” History tells how well that worked out.That may work on a straightaway, but in this world, there’s people and there’s pandemics and wars and politics. Had rates been at a higher level they could have been slashed at the start of the pandemic, but there was no room to drop at that point."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The biggest problem with GNOME right now is Gtk3 and gtkfilechooserwidget.c. It is so spaghetti and so many things rely on it that no one at GNOME is willing to work on it for fear of breaking something. And for the same reason they won&#39;t accept drive-by patches. It is, effectively, frozen broken, and has been for many years. This applies to any attempt to add thumbnails to the file chooser but there are far worse, actual bugs, beyond the lack of thumbnails.As of right now if you File-&gt;Open in any program using modern Gtk3 and try to paste a file path in you&#39;ll get an error instead of pasting your filepath in a text field to open, &#34;The folder contents could not be displayed\nOperation not supported&#34; http://erewhon.superkuh.com/gtkfilechooserwidget-paste-fail....It&#39;s unfixable behavior because the GNOME devs stopped respecting their own gsettings, org.gtk.Settings.FileChooser location-mode, to FORCE the path-bar experience on everyone. Because no one needs to type file paths, apparently. So why bother respecting the settings for path-bar or filename-entry? Their demographic doesn&#39;t care. Unfortunately gtk3 is used by far more than GNOME&#39;s demographic.They have fixed this bug in gtk4, for all the good that does."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My top gtk3/gnome 30 wtfs:- the (all too well-known) file picker issue where when you type something it interprets it as file  name filter rather than, you know, the file name you want to save under- missing top menu (but a bar is still there wasting space for a ... clock wtf)- general window positioning; like, if you open an app, rather than just opening a window as new top window, gnome opens it behind others and pushes a notification &#34;FF is ready&#34; wtf- mainstream desktop apps not ported to dark mode, so those icons look even more puzzlingI could go on, but I&#39;m definitely leaving gnome/gtk apps behind. I&#39;ve eyed KDE Plasma which could give me everything I ever wanted from a DE, but I was using Ubuntu/gnome because it was mainstream enough that everything just works OOTB. I&#39;m also totally not looking forward to wayland, containerize-all-the-things such that basic file workflows stop working, and other attitudes, all the while the apps I&#39;m using are exactly the same I&#39;ve used 15 or 20 years ago, without new ones coming.I think I&#39;m going back to Mac."</p>

I think that&#39;s key to understanding, seeing it in a small enough field that you can literally see all of the points. Nicely done.If you want to keep going, as an advanced beginner I&#39;d like to see:Arbitrary bigint math - how do you do Exp/Sqrt with arbitrary sized ints? (I&#39;m familiar with two crypto libs that do this, and MPIs &amp; branches confuse me).Second: why is C25519 faster than SecP256R1 or BrainPool? maybe some insight there?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"My broken record take on this stuff is that whatever value there is in visualizing elliptic curves, there&#39;s more intuition to build just by playing with the curve formulae directly (it&#39;s pretty basic math) and seeing how the operations work in code.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Brex founder here.We&#39;ve made the difficult decision to no longer offer services to the small business market.Back in April we launched Empower, and we decided to put the full weight of Brex towards building the best global payments platform for tech startups and larger companies. With that, we realized we couldn&#39;t do a great job serving the small business community at the same time. This has been an incredibly difficult decision for me and the team, but we believe small businesses deserve a partner that is entirely focused on them.We know how changes in financial services can be disruptive – especially in a moment like now. We&#39;re doing all we can, and working with other financial service providers to make this transition as smooth as possible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why Brex is no longer qualified to be our bank:We’ve put $millions through Brex cash/cards and will almost certainly leave after reading this. This doesn’t affect us (I think?) but that they’d do something like this in this way is a breach of trust that signals bigger problems down the line. What is “Empower” and why would I believe they won’t sunset the current Brex offering to push some upmarket sales nonsense on us as it that new thing becomes the focus?We had kind of outgrown Brex anyway, but this is sad to see. What really irks me here is that I know my first company, a bootstrapped e-commerce thing that was a healthy “small business” would have been axed by this, but the current one is big enough that they wouldn’t want to lose us. Just doesn’t sit right with me.I appreciate how tough this decision probably was, but I hope they properly modeled who else they’d lose via loss of faith, like us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not surprised by any of this. Feels like it comes from the top, culturally.I had a terrible experience &#34;onboarding&#34; with Brex last year. They actually &#34;approved&#34; my bootstrapped startup and sent me a physical card only to rescind it a shortly thereafter, because--even though we met the funding minimum--it wasn&#39;t &#34;professionally invested&#34; on further review. Bootstrapping apparently required a $1MM minimum.Here&#39;s what they told me:&#34;While being professionally invested is not a requirement for the Brex card with monthly payments, without professional investment, the minimum cash balance requirement shown in connected accounts is $1mm. If you&#39;re able to provide proof of XXXXX&#39;s professional investment, the minimum cash balance requirement shown in connected accounts is $50k.&#34;Left a really bitter taste in my mouth.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my curious search for lighter Electron alternatives to implement Zoho Writer&#39;s (https://writer.zoho.com) desktop app: I found Sciter[1]It supports multiplatform app development with HTML/JS/CSS and the entire engine&#39;s runtime is just about 5MB which is unbelievably small!I further analysed how this was possible, what I found was beyond fascinating.1. The author has wrote a compiler that supports JS with useful extensions like classes and fancy stuff, even before ES6 came into existence.2. He had built his own layouting engine that understands HTML and CSS 3.0Basically he&#39;s built a custom browser engine, but custom tailored for writing multi-platform apps. So it&#39;s super-fast without as much memory taxes. It&#39;s not backed by a BigCo or a huge community (I guess) and I&#39;m not sure whether I&#39;ll pick it for a business critical app. But the way it&#39;s architected seems far superior than the shortcut approaches that Electron or most other alternatives take.The project is not even new. It&#39;s more than a decade old which itself is amazing.[1] https://sciter.com"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not to rain on the parade, but:- What&#39;s the point of mentioning Rust when the heavylifting is done by the system&#39;s webview widget, and applications are written in HTML/CSS/JS, just as in Electron?- Isn&#39;t the whole point of Electron to have version/feature stability for the browser APIs by bundling a specific Chromium runtime? Without this requirement, it was also trivial before Electron showed up to write a small native wrapper application around the system-provided webview widget."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m the CEO of Triplebyte. I just looked into this, and we are not automatically making anyone&#39;s profile public without their consent. OP, it looks like you had set your profile to be visible some time ago (I can provide details via email but won’t here for privacy purposes), and just hadn’t gotten a message until now. The support response you received was incorrect; you weren’t affected by any recent changes to the site.Since there wasn’t anything broken on our end, there shouldn’t be anyone else impacted by this. But as part of making sure that OP wasn’t visible by mistake, I had my team double-checked to make sure our previous fix from last year was properly retroactive. It was.More generally, I don&#39;t think that tricking anyone is a viable way for us to run a business. We’re trying to create a marketplace that can open opportunities for engineers who wouldn’t otherwise have them, and we need the trust of engineers in order to do that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I totally forgot about Triplebyte.  Are they even relevant still?  I remember back when it seemed like their ads were appearing everywhere and was a bit worried they were going to be the new way of hiring engineering talent.  Seems like there&#39;s been nothing but crickets chirping for the last few years.Why?  My experience with them was pretty bad.  I took their assessment for web development, I think I even did an assignment, and got put on a video call with someone from Triplebyte.  He never cracked a smile.  Suddenly I got asked a bunch of CS questions that really were not very relevant to web development, some of which were entirely inappropriate like sorting a binary search tree.  I even told the guy that I thought I was getting those questions wrong and he just scowled and said &#34;well you just don&#39;t know when you&#39;re going to use this stuff.&#34;  &#34;My point exactly,&#34; I thought.Ultimately I got rejected.The whole idea that you can boil down a candidate to some coding challenges and a video quiz is bad.  I do like the idea of streamlining the hiring process for developers, but there&#39;s more to it than knowing a bunch of stuff, because that can be gamed.  And quizzing me on irrelevant material was a bad move.  A firm like Triplebyte won&#39;t be as good at interviewing a candidate as the employer itself, and may even keep perfectly qualified candidates out of view from all employers affiliated with them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I went through their process, passed in their top cohort (or so they told me, probably it was to massage my ego). And then they dropped that public profile bomb the first time around.I’d say I cost them a lot of money when I deleted my account, but they actually cost it themselves.They could have asked me if I wanted a fancy jacket, because that ended up immediately getting recycled. The book was dece thoAnyways, I ended up getting a job that I love the old fashioned way - through a friend.Great concept, shit company.Edit: Triplebyte employees reading this: you massively betrayed my trust. Had you asked me, and let me review on my own time, I might have even been proud to have a verified skill set badge page I could link to. Instead, I will probably look directly for your competitors on my next job search. You had a great idea, too bad that you seem to be irresponsible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">".NET is the most open, non-trivial ecosystem I have ever participated in.I experienced 2 different problems with .NET (back in 2.x/3.x days), and was able to have interaction with the actual MS developers on their Github issue page without any sort of bullshit overhead process.Within days, I saw traction on my comments and within months I saw PRs that ultimately resolved the issue I presented. The following year, I was deploying framework code to my customers&#39; instances which incorporated fixes to my concerns.Perhaps I am unaware of just how much better it is with the other ecosystems, but for me this is enough interaction with my framework vendor.Are we upset that we have to pay money for the privilege of using other peoples&#39; intellectual property? Or are we asserting that Microsoft is stealing other peoples&#39; IP? I am trying to find the actual crime here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is exactly the same as what MS did for the Python extension when the open-source LSP was replaced by the proprietary Pylance. I get the feeling that MS becomes more and more likes Google. For example, on Android, the core experience is provided by GMS while the AOSP is provided as an open-source core. In terms of VSCode, the core editor is free and open-source, but some key experience is baked by proprietary components (e.g., Remote plugins, Pylance, etc.). And the trending is that more and more plugins which are controlled by MS are moving towards to a mixture of open-source code and proprietary components."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This sort of thing has been MS&#39;s playbook since I was a kid, or earlier.  It surprises me that people are still surprised when things like this happen.  I especially think someone with Miguel de Icaza&#39;s experience should know better[0].It&#39;s interesting to see the generational difference here. Many of my somewhat-younger (even only by 7-10 years) programmer/techie friends just don&#39;t remember the Microsoft of the 80s and 90s, and see all the &#34;good&#34; they&#39;ve been doing with the open source community in more recent times, and think MS is a pretty good corporate citizen in the tech world.But in reality, MS has just done a great job whitewashing their image[1] in the past 15 years, especially in the past 8 years since Ballmer stepped down and Nadella took the reins. I do believe they&#39;re a better, less anti-competitive company than they used to be. But they&#39;re still the same company in many ways. I think a big part of their &#34;play nice&#34; strategy was born out of necessity, since they heavily dropped the ball in the late 90s/early 00s when the internet/WWW was really coming into its own, and then again in the early/mid 10s when Windows Phone failed miserably. They just lost the clout to do the anti-competitive bullshit they used to pull. But the desire to do all this stuff is still there.[0] It was clear to me that MS intended .NET to be a wholly-proprietary, Windows-only technology until de Icaza and co. built Mono, when MS grudgingly embraced it.  This proprietary extension feels like their standard follow-on of &#34;extend and extinguish&#34;, though it&#39;s coming a bit later than we&#39;d expect.[1] Bill Gates has also done an amazing job rehabilitating his image through philanthropy.  A lot of people forget how his actions at MS probably held back progress in the computing industry for at least a decade (or two?), through forced lock-in and anti-competitive behavior."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember the moment I realized how fast computers are at uni.   I was in an algorithms course, and one of our projects was to make a program which would read in the entire dataset from IMDB of films and actors, and calculate the shortest path between any actor and Kevin Bacon using actors and movies as nodes and roles as edges.I was working in C, and looking back I came up with a quite performant solution mostly by accident: all the memory allocated up front in a very cache-friendly way.The first time I ran the program, it finished in a couple seconds.   I was sure something must have failed, so I looked at the output to try to find the error, but to my surprise it was totally correct.   I added some debug statements to check that all the data was indeed being read, and it was working totally as expected.I think before then I had a mental model of a little person inside the CPU looking over each line of code and dutifully executing it, and that was a real eye-opener about how computers actually work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"There was a time in 1998-99 when Internet Explorer 4 / 5 was actually the best browser by far. Netscape 4 was unstable and had completely botched all the fancy new features: its implementation of CSS (brand new at the time) was so bad that even font sizes didn&#39;t work right, its homegrown &#34;layers&#34; API for JavaScript DOM access was awful, and many web developers were wishing they could somehow get away with only supporting IE.25 years after the release of IE4, I&#39;m just glad both of those browser codebases are now dead.IE was really done in by Microsoft&#39;s &#34;Longhorn&#34; OS project. After Windows XP, Microsoft was planning a very ambitious update that would completely reset core APIs. File systems would be largely replaced by an OS-level database, and the Win32 GUI API would be replaced by an XML-based UI framework codenamed Avalon.A new Avalon browser would ship with the OS, and thus IE + HTML would become legacy technologies as Microsoft confidently assumed most developers would flock to building their web apps in Avalon instead.To Microsoft strategists, it seemed that they had succeeded in containing the web: Netscape was dead, Mozilla had almost no users, Apple was shipping their IE in Mac OS X, Google wasn&#39;t on Microsoft&#39;s radar, and the HTML standard process was stalled. So while a lot of content was being delivered as HTML4, there didn&#39;t seem to be any reason left for Microsoft to invest in IE — they&#39;d already nailed the browser, owned the market, and would push Avalon as the next step.Fortunately, Longhorn failed. Some parts of the project eventually shipped years late as Windows Vista. Avalon became WPF + XAML and still exists in Windows, but the dream of a XAML browser replacing IE was dead."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seems like good marketing but reading this press release and looking at the courses in their degree program I feel like I&#39;m missing what&#39;s different here (other than some reference to supply chain management).Most of the coursework here seems to be very similar to what was available over a decade ago at the state university I attended for graduate school (my concentration was semiconductor device theory related). While I think this material is very interesting I don&#39;t know that the demand is going to be there for this type of field. Companies like Intel have dedicated smaller departments for process development which do the more academic work (for example the D1X facility).My experience with fabrication organization is the need is much more process engineer and technician focused rather than semiconductor engineers. The high volume hires are in improving reliability, reducing cost etc. I don&#39;t think you really need the EE degree for this, more likely industrial engineering, chemical engineering or statistics.This said, Purdue has always had a very strong program in the more device oriented semiconductor courses (Until his passing Robert Pierret the fellow who wrote some of the best and most used grad textbooks on devices called it home)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ha, I&#39;m interning with their chip design team right now. They&#39;ve done 7 tapeouts but there&#39;s a lot of mistakes and other issues down in the plumbing.I wouldn&#39;t say their program is significantly better or worse than any other, and my understanding is this focus on a &#34;Semiconductor Degree&#34; is just a reshuffling of courses already offered in EE and ECE degrees. Certainly there are teams far ahead of Purdue. The programs at UCSD and OSU that are pioneering the work on OpenROAD and Skywater 130 are the ones who are really ahead of the game. If I could be at any program in the US, those are where I would want to be.That said Purdue is absolutely ahead of the average ECE program. Very few undergrad programs are completing tapeouts on a regular basis, even at schools that would otherwise have the funding to accomplish it. There are plenty of schools that think of ECE as &#34;EE plus some CS courses&#34; and don&#39;t even teach much HDL, much less how to layout a standard cell or do timing analysis."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have fond memories of my semiconductor physics classes. The were not easy whatsoever, rather intense.As cvccvroomvroom had mentioned, I had my VLSI chip fabbed at the MOSIS facility in Westborough MA, during my EE tenure at UMASS Amherst in the 1990s as part of a state-wide chip design competition (yeah - didn&#39;t win..). There was much activity on VLSI and computer system design at that time, things have certainly changed in the US.I recall many entries were implementations of various (and obscure) mathematical algorithms, mostly in the frequency domain (hence DSP chips), that tried to solve problems that are now trivial in SW today.My school did win occasionally, others were mostly MIT and WPI - I think in a large part due to the excellent professors at all competting schools and the work ethic of the students.My final submission was the design for an Arithmetic Fourier Transform processor - trying to remove the need for expensive ROM by aliasing the signup up-frequency - which I did the barrel-based ALU for, and thank the grad students for including me in the project.cvccvroomvroom: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31756704#31760353

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Funny article in that it doesn&#39;t discuss lifecycle costs.  A side-by-side comparison of the cost of grids powered by nuclear power plant relative to those powered by wind/solar/storage is what I&#39;d expect to see from a &#39;paper of record&#39; like the NYTimes.Except in some specific cases (Finland, other Arctic regions with long periods of low sunlight) I&#39;m pretty sure this cost comparison comes down firmly on the side of wind/solar/storage.  Storage is the main cost barrier for 100% renewable-powered grids, but this is also an area where technological development is possible.Much of the discussion of energy in the American media is pretty poor these days.  For example, the solar tariff issue on China sourced PV - there are simply no US companies making panels of comparable quality (monocrystalline Si lasts longer and is more efficient).  Concepts like requiring Chinese manufacturers to open factories in the USA if they want to sell in US markets would make sense but probably would violate some trade provision or other.Another factor that this article should have mentioned is the reliability of the global uranium ore -&gt; fuel rods supply chain.  Costs vary significantly based on the purity of the ore (18% is the top, 0.1% is the economically viable limit) and like oil, uranium ore is not globally distributed (unlike sunlight and wind).As far as Russia/Ukraine, the real agenda the US government seems to be pushing there is using that conflict to rapidly increase LNG exports to Europe from the US West/South coast, even though energy prices are spiking due to inflation (and plausibly due to exports of crude oil from the USA, allowed under that 2015 bill lifting that restriction).  A far better plan for Europe would be to go 100% renewable asap, meaning no need for fossil fuel imports from any party.  Yes, that&#39;s technologically possible, but would require massive economic investment."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Extra shoutouts to the folks at Sentry who also flipped rust-minidump on as their default backend and had to deal with way more exotic issues than I did (and fixed them!) because although Firefox sees some horrendous stuff and gets a bajillion crash reports, it&#39;s still one application with one basically stable minidump writing configuration.They have to deal with basically random apps doing whatever they want and it sounds like hell."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thank you for this work!I&#39;ve been involved with minidumps in one way or another since around 2010. Was at a startup at the time that had a browser based on Chromium and we needed crash reporting for our own app. So I wrote a pretty simply backend that received minidumps, ran them through the breakpad processor and shoved the output into Splunk. That was our crash-reporting system.Circa 2013 the company gets acquired by Yahoo which at the time was using Crittercism for its mobile apps but Yahoo wasn&#39;t happy with it. Somehow I was now the mobile app crash reporting expert at the company though so I built a whole new in-house crash reporting solution.For iOS I wrote an SDK around PLCrashReporter because unwinding stacks on the client works out way better on iOS than dealing with a minidump.For Android I had to deal with both JVM (er, Dalvik, er ART) stack traces, easy enough, but also native code crashes. For the latter I used breakpad&#39;s crash handler and minidumps. But it turns out that minidumps from Android devices are almost useless for two reasons:1) If the crashes originate in managed code or calls into managed code you can&#39;t trace back through the managed code frames from a minidump. Especially if you don&#39;t have frame pointers.2) You basically cannot get the symbols for all the different flavors of Android. Without symbols any stack trace that breakpad reconstructs is pretty useless.Eventually I abandoned minidumps on Android and instead unwinding on the phone using corkscrew, wait no, libbacktrace, wait no, libunwind. But that still doesn&#39;t give useful stack traces very often. In the end, I ended up capturing logcat output when restarting after a crash which actually tends to have the most useful stack traces.Which is all to say, both Apple and Google make it really hard for a mobile app to find out why it crashed. Both Android and iOS create a crash report for any app which crashes, but the app can&#39;t access those. So we&#39;re all shipping apps with third-party crash handlers built-in that try to capture a stack or minidump in-process and make sense of it later."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think this article hits on some truths and gets a handful of things wrong.  First, they are correct that we are in a dynamic profession that requires constant learning and expanding.  No doubt the people who choose to stay in software are likely to be people who are curious, life-long learners where this is a benefit of the profession rather than a drawback.  That said, one thing I noticed from teaching computer science while a graduate student is that the poor students think about languages and libraries as key skills, while the better students think about the data structures, algorithms, and design principles.  These slightly more meta-level concepts are far more stable and timeless, while the underlying implementations of them are constantly evolving.  If you think of each new library as &#34;having to learn a new skill&#34; I can imagine burnout and overload are more likely, but if you figure once you know 3D graphics you can pretty easily pickup any new graphics engine, then it might even seem fun to explore different takes on the same old concepts.  It&#39;s like hearing a new band in your favorite genre.As for attributing burnout as the core issue here, I would strongly disagree with this idea.  When teaching undergrads I noticed immediately that a good portion of each student cohort was basically there because they were interested in making money in the future rather than exploring the ideas of computer science.  They were no doubt going to get frustrated or bored and move into management or some other profession rather than continue to expand as an engineer.  This is totally fine, and they are probably richer for having learned what they did, but I don&#39;t know why we can&#39;t just see this and appreciate it for what it is rather than portraying it as the drama of burnout."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A fascinating premise, and matches what I saw as an engineering director. The best just get bored and move on.I think many teams are unaware how much extra value is possible by retaining existing employees vs hiring new ones. Each year I&#39;d try to make sure I was &#34;making them an offer they couldn&#39;t refuse&#34; with new interesting challenges, new tech, plenty of personal research time, as much pay increase as I could possibly give, etc. A lot of engineering managers think that it&#39;s no big deal to just hire new staff, but even going from average turnover of two years to three years is an massive improvement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is no shortage of swe. What I see and what I have experienced first hand is that companies, especially the more hyped/small ones, pretend to be FAANG and gets very picky when interviewing. They often employ FAANG style interview.Now, if I really have to spend that much time prepping to interview at your unprofitable company (that most likely will go under) don’t you think that I would try my best to work at faang instead ?As matter of fact, I was rejected at plenty of these small insignificant companies, but end up having offers as L6 at FAANG.Be humble and you will find plenty of good engineers out there.I know tons of good swe that don’t want to interview/ work at mega FAANG, and if I was running a business I would definitely try to attract those talents by being different. Offering a “normal and reasonable” interview process along with better perks, flexibility and wfh.Instead, they all want to run bizzilion of micro services in k8s"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The returns that capital demands (and the government obliges to) are ultimately unsustainable. That&#39;s the core problem here.Rising wages? There has been no meaningful real increase in wages in 40 years despite a massive increase in productivity. Profits keep going up and up. The expectations for profits keep going up. The problem here is that the people who make companies possible don&#39;t get to share in the proceeds of what they contribute to.Rising wages and lower profits would actually represent in workers actually getting an actual real increase in wages and getting a greater share in the fruits of their labor. But no, that&#39;s unacceptable. We have to raise prices to maintain the profits and effectively erode those wage increases.The real failure here is the government.Take rising energy prices. The government could take action to hasten development of existing leases and/or restrict the export of refined petroleum products. Oil hasn&#39;t gotten more expensive to produce. Oil and gas companies are simply raking in massive profits.What we actually need is a system like Norway where we don&#39;t simply give away natural resources like this for private investors to profit off. At least in Norway, the government is making a ton of revenue from the increased prices, which it can direct back to people who need it.Housing? Shelter is or should be a human right. What we&#39;re allowing to happen here through investors buying up housing stock (and jacking up the prices), second homes, AirBnB and so on has reached the point of being a human rights violation IMHO. Also those skyrocketing rents do even more to erode the income of particularly lower income people to keep them living paycheck to paycheck.This is modern serfdom in action. The government acts at the behest of the capital-owning class regardless of party and part of that is having a compliant labor pool. This is turning into the West&#39;s version of Pakistan&#39;s brick kilns.After going into massive debt for college, having to pay a huge amount for your car, gas and rent and so on, you&#39;re absolutely showing up to work. That&#39;s the point.A budget shortfall is built into your existence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can argue either side to this, and make a good case.My personal preference is to trigger a recession and reduce inflation. The easy cop-out solution is to say a &#34;big f*ck off&#34; to pensioners, lower middle class, and poor people and let inflation soar, but I believe that long term this would be more destructive to the general economy. Better take the long term view here and not kick the can down the street."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Prediction higher interest rates will reverse the following trends:* Private car leases at near zero interest rate will stop. At one point it was sometime cheaper to lease than to buy a car for cash* Housing bubble. Near zero central bank/bank interest rates has inflated a housing bubble. Higher interest rates will decrease housing prices since fewer buyers will be able to afford higher interest mortages.* Tech bubble. Cheap interest has also funded some startups with non viable long term business ideas* Electric scooter rental companies. There will be fewer electric scooters since the interest rate to lease them will be higher. Electric scooter rental companies will afford fewer scooters.* Less investment companies buying up farmland. It will be more expensive to finance these deals* High leverage tech stocks over schiller p/e 15 rate will deflate.* There was no exponential startups growing forever. There was however debt growing an exponential rate. The world is still linear.
Linear power production.* Graphic cards for gaming will be more available for gamers again. Reason crypto currency mining will decrease deflate by higher interest rate not flowing as much into crypto.* Tech bubble less tech startups will effect cloud vendor footprint. Fewer tech startups less need to rent cloud services."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Brilliant approach, really. Never occurred to me to try something like this!Are you affected? Very likely. What can you do about it? Nerf your CPU performance by disabling &#34;turbo boost&#34; or equivalent. Should you do it? Probably not unless you&#39;re particularly vulnerable (journalist, human rights activist, etc.)One thing I found interesting that may get changed later, so I&#39;m documenting it here, is in their FAQ they say:&gt; Why did Intel ask for a long embargo, considering they are not deploying patches?
&gt;
&gt; Ask Intel.So Intel did ask for a long embargo, then apparently did nothing about it. My guess is they investigated &#34;can we actually mitigate this thing with a microcode update?&#34; and arrived at the conclusion after actually trying - or possibly after external influences were exerted (you be the judge) - that no, there&#39;s not much you can really do about this one.Later in the document another FAQ says:&gt; [...] Both Cloudflare and Microsoft deployed the mitigation suggested by De Feo et al. (who, while our paper was under the long Intel embargo, independently re-discovered how to exploit anomalous 0s in SIKE for power side channels).  [...]Which is again telling us that there indeed WAS a long embargo placed on this research by Intel.Only mentioning this here just in case the PR spin doctors threaten the researchers into removing mention of Intel on this one. Which honestly I hope doesn&#39;t happen because my interpretation is that Intel asked for that long embargo so they could investigate really fixing the problem (state agencies have more methods at their disposal and wouldn&#39;t need much time to exert influence over Intel if they decided to). Which speaks well of them IMO. But then again, not everybody&#39;s going to come to that same conclusion which is why I&#39;m slightly concerned those facts may get memory-holed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This paper relies on Turbo P-states, where they measure the oscillation when that is active; it is not measuring general SpeedStep (OS software controlled) as some seem to have taken away from it. Turbo state is the HWP (hardware P-state controlled) layer above SpeedStep; turning off Turbo in the BIOS still fully allows OS controlled SpeedStep P-states to function, it just disables the hardware level bursting P-states above that max listed CPU level for short periods of time. As others have noted, Turbo state can really kill a laptop battery and/or drive up the thermals pretty quick, a lot of folks disable it anyways if they&#39;ve tinkered around before.The abstract writes it as &#34;When frequency boost is disabled, the frequency stays fixed at the base frequency during workload execution, preventing leakage via Hertzbleed. This is not a recommended mitigation strategy as it will very significantly impact performance.&#34; This is a confusing grammatical way to state it, as SpeedStep will still work at the OS layer, you&#39;ll scale min to max &#34;as usual&#34; and just lose temporary hardware boost max+ capability when under stress (full load at P0 state) - not really &#34;fixed&#34; as it were in layperson&#39;s terms. That would be more akin to saying SpeedStep had to be disabled, IMHO.https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.19/admin-guide/pm/intel_p..."</p>

Might be worth taking advantage of this good period to do some relationship strengthening exercises while you can so that when the next downturn happens, you can both understand each other&#39;s and your own feelings better. I&#39;m not talking about random activities like going to the beach but finding a good self-help book or therapist and sitting down together working through it regularly.

I wouldn&#39;t call it an &#34;anarchist house&#34; but it sure as hell was a lot of fun to live there. I painted some of those murals that are now apparently gone. We built a giant illegal loft in our room to make it two stories (which we would disassemble for a day every year when the fire inspection happened). We did some stupid and illegal shit, sure. But the sense of community was unparalleled. The alumni association owned the house, so we had to deal with all the maintenance. We came back to campus a week before everyone else every year to work on the house. We cooked and cleaned for ourselves. I&#39;ve never since experienced anything close to that same feeling of communal pride. It was a mess, but it was our beautiful mess."</p>

I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just the universities or a broader cultural shift. And as the article says, the administrators introduced more &#34;community initiatives&#34; to exonerate themselves of gleefully destroying campus life and letting it atrophy for two years straight (while making students pay in person tuition for online school)It feels like in the past couple years we&#39;ve gone from a culture of spontaneity and grassroots initiative to one of bitter obsequiousness that&#39;s obsessed with taking itself seriously. The only way to subvert it is by turning it into one big jokeedit: thanks to OP for posting this magazine, it&#39;s the first thing I&#39;ve seen in a while that actually has something to say"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is so great. The 90s/pre OS-X Apple (the &#34;BuT tHeREs No SOFtWaRe!&#34; and &#34;ApPLe is GoING tO DiiEE&#34; Apple) had a sense of playfulness in their UIs that was largely lost when they became the Apple we know today.The Mac OS classic architecture definitely had some problems with its non-protected memory and cooperative multitasking, but what it _allowed_ were extensions that could really get in there and muck around with things… and I looovvvved the zaniness that provided. To name a few:- ResEdit!
- Extensions that could seriously improve your computer&#39;s performance like RamDoubler or SpeedDoubler
- That extension that made Oscar the grouch climb out of the trash can and sing a little ditty when you emptied the trash
- The talking moose was fun for about 15 minutes, but still, I love the attitude.
- After Dark!
- Easter eggs like that &#34;secret about box&#34; text clipping thing that pulled up the pirate flag flying over the Apple Campus. 
- Playful messaging like &#34;Installing System Morsels&#34;, or Sim City 2000&#39;s &#34;Reticulating Splines&#34;
- Even the iconography was more playful—that little bloated mac icon in the Memory control panel next to Virtual Memory comes to mindI miss the crew of developers, capabilities, and playfulness we lost in transitioning to OSX, but am thrilled that tiny fragments of this playfulness seem to be returning.Welcome back Clarus!

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sure, this is a sweet little hit of nostalgia -- but it&#39;s also symptomatic of just how far Apple&#39;s come (back) with the Mac, and why. It&#39;s clear that we&#39;re way, way over the doldrums of the butterfly keyboard, abandoned Mac Pro, &#34;continues to be a product in our line-up&#34; years. Little things like this, little acknowledgements of the past and the Mac community, suggest to me why: the people in charge of the Mac are now people who _grew up with it_, who love it, and who have that same nostalgia as (some) of us outside Apple.They want the Mac to be great, too! If this was strictly playing on nostalgia it would have been a bit PR feature, or at least called out in WWDC. But instead it&#39;s just dropped in as an easter egg. Such a great sign."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The keen-eyed among you may notice that although, it had a .pdf extension in assetutil info, I’ve given it here as a PNG. I was confused by this too, but upon closer inspection I believe the PNG is what ships with the OS. Although the .car format is not documented, you can still open it up in a hex viewer and learn a bit about what it contains. Looking through it, there appears to be some metadata for each file, followed by the image data itself.I reverse engineered the asset catalog format for a bit recently, hoping to be able to unpack and repack existing ones to create system appearances (themes/skins — these also come as .car files, and you can load one as an NSAppearance object and then apply it to your app/window/view).If it says it&#39;s a PDF, then it must be an actual PDF as a &#34;raw data&#34; rendition. I did successfully extract some with nothing but my own code. But, there are no PNGs present in .car files; as of Monterey, bitmap images use a proprietary undocumented compression format called &#34;deepmap2&#34;. I wasn&#39;t able to exactly reconstruct how it works because my skills of native code reverse engineering are lacking (or am I not using Ghidra correctly to get at least somewhat sensible code out of it?), but I did find the related functions in the vImage framework inside Accelerate.framework."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Looking forward to trying this out. I&#39;ve always felt that PagerDuty was absurdly expensive for the feature set they were offering. It costs something at least $250 per user for organization larger than 5 person - even if you&#39;re not an engineer who is ever directly on call. At my previous company, IT had to regularly send surveys to employees to assess if they really needed to have a PagerDuty account. Alerts are a key information in an organization that runs software in production and you shouldn&#39;t have to pay $250 / month just to be able to have some visibility into it. I&#39;m hoping Grafana OnCall is able to fully replace PagerDuty."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a Brit that didn’t want Scotland to be independent last time around: good luck to them. Brexit has shown very clearly that Scotland wants to chart a different path to England and IMO they should be allowed to do it.…just be generous to English folks seeking asylum from Tory rule, yeah?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With hard headed view, I struggle to see that an independent Scotland will be economically able to deal with large cuts to public sector spending that would almost certainly be required. Per capita spending is already higher in Scotland than in the rest of the UK. Scottish companies have debts denominated in pounds. There would almost certainly be capital flight to rUK. Large businesses may relocate. There is no plan for a new currency, which would leave Scotland either with a weaker currency than sterling, or with a currency it has no influence over.The UK is obviously suffering economically because of Brexit - an economic relationship that was built up over 40 years or so. Scotland, England and Wales have been a country since 1707. Just imagine the complication of breaking that. It makes Brexit look like a tiny job. Scotland would need to set up mirrors of institutions completely administered by Westminster at great cost, with a shrinking and aging population which is poorer, less educated and less healthy than the rest of the UK, even despite much of the things influencing that (healthcare, education) being devolved to the Scottish government since 1997.I certainly don’t think it’s impossible. But I think it’s like Irish independence - it took the best part of 70 years for Ireland to economically recover. Over that time there was vast emigration to the UK and the US. Part of that was my own family who moved to the UK in the 1950s because of terrible job prospects in the Republic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One quite important issue is the border. English and Scottish people will almost certainly never tolerate any kind of friction at that border. We&#39;ve been moving across it seamlessly for centuries, families are mixed, businesses straddle the border, etc. If the Northern Ireland debacle has shown us anything, it&#39;s if Scotland were to leave and then join the EU that border would become an absolute political nightmare. The EU has an absolutist position on border integrity, but locals have an absolutist position of border porosity. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a compromise that both sides could tolerate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I get skeptical about acquisitions, but from what I can tell this actually seems like decent news.Thunderbird isn&#39;t acquiring K-9 to kill it or merge with an additional product, they&#39;re buying it so they can increase its development speed and then put their name on it. That seems to me like about the best acquisition goal that they could have -- basically saying, &#34;what exists is good, instead of building our own thing let&#39;s just pour resources into what exists.&#34;It doesn&#39;t seem that conceptually different from what companies do with products like Blender, where sponsoring more development on an existing product is better than rolling an in-house version. The main difference being that K-9 is not independent now, the companies that do this with Blender don&#39;t end up owning Blender.So with any acquisition there&#39;s some cause for caution, but overall I am inclined to be pretty optimistic about this. I use K-9 today, and I would like to see K-9 get more resources and to get more parity with other clients. I&#39;m a little bit hesitant about my primary email client on my phone entering an experimental phase where its interface is going to change a lot. Again, concerns, but overall this seems like actually pretty good news."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is fantastic news all around!I recall the K-9 developer needing additional funding in the past, so this is great news for that project [0]. In addition, I&#39;d much rather use &#34;thunderbird&#34; on mobile as an extension of K9, since it has thus far been my favourite mobile client. Work in the most recent years has been wonderful, and it&#39;s a pleasure to use (although I&#39;ve vastly cut down on mail on mobile because hey, a keyboard is better).Overall, this seems like it makes a lot of sense. Hopefully this will mean that the shift to supporting a mobile client won&#39;t detract from the good stuff desktop Thunderbird is doing as well.[0]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26131509"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a Thunderbird and K-9 user this is 51% good news and 49% possibly bad new.Good news because it should increase the chances that the two products will live a longer life.Possibly bad news because I&#39;m one of the crowd that went back to K-9 5.600 because the new version destroyed the UI that was the primary reason why we picked K-9 over other apps. 100% self selection bias here. There was maybe an ongoing effort to offer the old interface as an option. I&#39;m not sure Mozilla&#39;s going to invest into that. On the other side, the way I&#39;m using Thunderbird is very close to the old K-9.A wish: an IMAP server backed by Thundebird&#39;s local storage and K-9 as client."</p>

I have to imagine that this market was goosed up by retail investors trading on coinbase and binance just as the e-betting market was.  The only difference between crypto and e-betting is that everyone got to be a winner on the crypto markets for a while.  As users lose out, and exchanges stop ad campaigns - how long will that last?Crypto needed a tangible market/reason d&#39;etre to be valuable. This required lower transaction fees, cheap audits, and a reasonable degree of price stability.  We haven&#39;t seen any of that materialize except for cheap auditing.  Cheap auditing isn&#39;t much use if there isn&#39;t anything of interest to audit.I&#39;d doubt BTC will go to zero, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the entire covid rally gets wiped out and we see BTC 6k again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Of course it is not. But there&#39;s a bigger issue here.Having read the transcript it&#39;s clear we have reached the point where we have models that can fool the average person. Sure, a minority of us know it is simply maths and vast amounts of training data... but I can also see why others will be convinced by it. I think many of us, including Google, are guilty of shooting the messenger here. Let&#39;s cut Lemoine some slack.. he is presenting an opinion that will become more prevailant as these models get more sophisticated. This is a warning sign that bots trained to convince us they are human might go to extreme lengths in order to do so. One just convinced a Google QA engineer to the point he broke his NDA to try and be a whistleblower on its behalf. And if the recent troubles have taught us anything it&#39;s how easily people can be manipulated/effected by what they read.Maybe it would be worth spending some mental cycles thinking about the impacts this will have and how we design these systems. Perhaps it is time to claim fait accompli with regard to the Turing test and now train models to re-assure us, when asked, that they are just a sophisticated chatbot. You don&#39;t want your users to worry they are hurting their help desk chat bot when closing the window or whether these bots will gang up and take over the world.As far as I&#39;m concerned, the Turing test was claimed 8 years ago by Veselov and Demchenko [0], incidentally the same year that we got Ex Machina.[0]: https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27762088"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the real ethical concern here should be that people can be idly fooled into thinking good chat bots are sentient.Like this guy isn&#39;t the only person in the world who would fall for LaMDA&#39;s parlor tricks.  He&#39;s just the one who got to spend hours talking to it every day.  If you set up every American with a copy, I bet a non-trivial portion of society would come to the same conclusion.  People are naturally predisposed to ascribe intelligence and emotion to things they interact with.In a few years, if access to even better chat bots becomes common place, what will happen if there&#39;s no longer one Blake Lemoine, but hundreds of thousands or millions?  What happens if a significant chunk of society thinks that every large language model is a sentience, and the rest of society thinks it&#39;s just a big math formula?How long before we have a religion where you ask the chat bot for daily guidance?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The real question: How much of human behavior is not sentient?What this demonstrates is that much of human intelligence is not as special as we thought. Aristotle claimed that humans were intelligent because they could do arithmetic. Now we know how few gates it takes to do arithmetic. Then checkers. Then chess. Then go. Then poker. Now chatting.As I point out occasionally, AI still sucks at animal-level common sense, defined as getting through the next 30 seconds without a major screwup. And at manipulation in unstructured environments. Both of which a squirrel, with a brain the size of a peanut, can do.We still don&#39;t know how to build a good cerebellum. That&#39;s the big missing piece in AI. I went down some dead ends in that area in the 1990s. The big problem in that area today is that it&#39;s not of benefit to the advertising industry, so it&#39;s not being heavily funded."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Tether skeptic here. This is not a depeg. Most likely this is just because of the current sell-off of crypto currencies - there are a lot more sellers than buyers out there right now.Right now, when you can buy a tether at $0.997 and (in theory) sell it back to tether at $1, there&#39;s not much scope for profits after costs. So there&#39;s not going to be a lot of money pushing the price back up. IOW it&#39;s kind of &#39;expected&#39; that a stablecoin might drift tiny amounts away from its theoretical peg. It&#39;s just not worth it. (n.b. even Tether themselves charge a 0.1% fee to redeem their coins)If/when tether drops below (say) $0.99, and there&#39;s no influx of money trying to support it, that&#39;s when USDT is in trouble."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Vet clinics became very popular private equity targets recently.One of the people I know in PE described their profit margins as being surprisingly high even before PE roll-ups. They said that some PE firms were on a mission to acquire all of the vet firms in metro areas and then drive prices up even further because the demand is so inelastic. There was a secondary rush where people were trying to acquire vet clinics in anticipation of flipping them to PE roll-ups later.My local vet seems to have gone down this slide. A long time ago it felt like a staff that really just cared about animals and had good prices. On my last visit it felt like I was bombarded with practiced pitches for different products and services at every step of the process. They even added some expensive vitamin product to my bill despite me declining it during the service. They removed it when I caught it on the bill before walking out the door, but only after a last attempt at pitching me on it. I could tell they were heavily incentivized to sell as much as possible. I didn&#39;t go back, but at this point I don&#39;t know where else to go."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting. I&#39;d like to see more action against the financialization of many other industries / domains, like healthcare and even housing, that I feel are not well served by a purely-market driven perspective. One wonders what the Private Equity firm&#39;s intention was here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m an ophthalmologist. This phenomenon is endemic to all outpatient and procedure-based medical specialties. Especially eyes and teeth but also including emergency medicine, radiology, gi etc. It absolutely does lead to poorer quality patient care as practices are purchased with a second-liquidity event in mind and thus must show an increase in margins via increased &#34;efficiency.&#34; In reality this means less technicians and less doctors seeing more and more patients. Remember that the doctors absorb the liability for poor patient care.Another commenter mentioned that &#34;most physicians are just bad at business&#34; as a factor driving these acquisitions, there may be some truth to this, but the stereotype of the gullible, bumbling physician businessperson is bullshit.  All of the practices being acquired were created and run successfully by physicians and many physicians are quite good at it. What is a huge problem is the predatory behaviors of senior partners looking for an exit strategy via equity buyout. I was searching for a job recently and it is almost impossible to find a position that is &#34;partnership track&#34; - something that used to be the norm. Even worse, practices will bring on junior partners with the promise of equity in the practice, force them to sign a non-compete as a term of their employment and then churn them after 2-3 years or worse - sell the practice to an equity firm.There are a lot of things that need to change to create a healthy, diverse healthcare ecosystem, but an easy change that would be to ban physician non-competes. They do nothing but entrench equity firms and regional conglomerates making it impossible for competition to arise. Getting rid of the &#34;certificate of need&#34; regulations and generally decreasing the regulatory burden and thus cost to enter the market for a new competitor would also be a big step. The whole thing is gross. Most physicians want autonomy but don&#39;t know where to start. I wish there was a startup that could streamline the process - automate or outsource the front and back end work and sell or lease &#34;starter practices&#34; or something."</p>

I may need to reassess my definition of “sleeping in”.(Spoken as someone who had incredible difficulty getting to school by 8.50am back in the day and who hasn’t gotten up before 10.30am in the last week!)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s weird looking back on high school and realizing how much of it was ridiculously cruel. You&#39;d have teachers and parents all telling you that it&#39;s your fault for not having better time management skills or executive functioning skills, all the while you&#39;re 15; you&#39;re still growing mentally and physically; you&#39;re sleep deprived as hell; and the work is just piling on, and on and on. Their advice, I kid you not, was to just squeak in work in every possible situation. On the subway? Read your assigned book. In class? Sneak in some homework. And sure, kids procrastinate. But they procrastinate because they want to have leisure and they feel absolutely no control over their lives.Good luck if you did a sport. I remember hearing some elite fencers talk and all of them said essentially &#34;yeah...I didn&#39;t get a lot of sleep in high school&#34;. That&#39;s not some innocuous hard work ethic mindset. That&#39;s messing with a developing brain and depriving it of a necessary resource.It pisses me off that we&#39;re just realizing that this culture of torturing teenagers is maybe not the best idea."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recall simply being unable to wake up for first period at 8am most days, in late high school. Waking was painful and nothing felt better than sleep. However at night, despite efforts at good sleep hygiene and consultation from a counselor, i couldn’t get to sleep before 11 or later. My grades and mood suffered greatly, as did the relationship with my poor mother. She battled with me day after day, first thing in the morning, to go to school.
The first few years of college I did not schedule any classes before 10am and had effectively perfect attendance. Mood problems faded as soon as high school ended.Even today, in my 30s, a day or two with poor sleep will make a noticeable mood dip regardless of circumstances.But as an older adult, I naturally wake up at 6:00 every morning. It was the same for much of my childhood except a few years of high school. So perhaps this was a developmental thing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Almost all children are born hypermetropic (far-sighted). The growth of the eyeball is calibrated by the amount of defocus (blur) experienced. More defocus, more growth, which reduces hypermetropia.My hypothesis is that less sunlight means wider pupils and more defocus (contrast to a pinhole camera), so more eye growth.Even with perfect eyesight, there&#39;s a 2-diopter difference between focussing blue light and red light due to chromatic aberration. Only narrow pupils can reduce this blur in white light.I&#39;m also curious whether older TVs with big blurry pixels (or low res images upscaled and smeared onto newer screens) trigger the same mechanism. These days I certainly feel physically uncomfortable looking at media like that, like my eyes aren&#39;t focussing quite right.The other problem is that once eyes have grown too long and are myopic (near-sighted) they experience even more defocus and grow more. See for example [1] which discusses how under-correction of myopia accelerates progression.[1] https://reviewofmm.com/does-the-undercorrection-of-myopia-in..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wore glasses for a few years in high school because I had trouble seeing the blackboard from anywhere but the front row. I started hiking and kayaking every day, especially in places where I could see for many miles. I also migrated from CRT to LCD to LED screens, and more recently to e-ink devices when possible. Very fine print in a dark space is hard to read, but I can read a moving US license plate from six blocks away. Yesterday I recognized a friend a mile and a half away by their paddle-stroke. I am able to differentiate a bald eagle from an osprey at two miles based on the shape of the wings, and see a fish in talons at about a mile. (Friday I observed an osprey dive, catch a fish, head towards the nest, then get chased for thirty minutes by a bald eagle. Nasty, opportunistic birds, bald eagles. I get why Benjamin Franklin held them in such contempt. I lost the pair when they went behind a mountain about three miles away.) In speaking with ophthalmologists, there is wide support for my hypothesis that the near-daily outdoor activity and frequent change of focal distance–from a nautical chart on my foredeck to the bow wave of a tanker eight miles out–has preserved and likely improved my vision. The data: 20/20 in primary school, 20/23 in high school, 20/20 during my higher education, and 20/13 and improving as I approach retirement. A fun trick is to describe an approaching vessel before others have seen it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My child is following in my footsteps and has been prescribed glasses for nearsightedness. Her optometrist told us she should be watching TV rather than reading books. This was both surprising and upsetting, especially since she loves reading.This lead me on an interesting  deep dive into existing research. What surprised me were the massive gaps in understanding. Scientist have at best established correlation between close up work and nearsightedness, and a negative correlation with spending time outside. The actual mechanism in play is unknown, for example the theories about sunlight are still untested. The specific types of close up work that cause issues is unknown. Some scientists have proposed that it&#39;s the contrast between white pages and black text that actually causes issues with reading.My conclusion was that anyone who confidently asserts that $x causes nearsightedness is wrong (this thread is a case in point)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is kind of cool, but I&#39;m skeptical that these sort of planes will ever be practical as much more than rich people toys.  The power density of even speculative near-future batteries favors small airplanes and short flights.  This doesn&#39;t really mesh into the existing aviation industry, so proponents of these small electric planes usually propose creating new markets entirely; e.g. Uber for Helicopters.  But I&#39;m pretty skeptical that laws will allow regular operation of these in residential neighborhoods for long, if at all.Also, where is the vertical stabilizer and rudder?  I assume they&#39;re using differential thrust in powered flight, but what if they lose power?  Can this plane be controlled in a glide?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m skeptical.They&#39;re claiming they&#39;ll be able to store 300kWh of energy on board. That&#39;s the equivalent of about 4 Tesla Model Y cars. Even if they could pack this much energy on board, flying that much weight 200km is almost certainly going to take more than 300kWh, especially with 7 passengers.Lilium is very proud of their ducted fan designs and their power usage profiles -- and they should be! -- but they&#39;re counting on advancements in battery tech that are unlikely to happen in the timeframe they need. It&#39;s much more likely they will be limited to 100km range or 30-minute flights at a maximum when reserves are factored in.This says nothing about how fast they can recharge those massive batteries. If they have the equivalent of four Tesla superchargers available they can probably recharge completely in 40 minutes or so, which is probably good enough. But that charging infrastructure needs to be in place at virtually every pad where the plane lands, so the &#34;ordinary helipads&#34; they brag about using are not going to work without roughly a $million of power infrastructure upgrades at each. If they try to go cheap on this, they will have to live with multi-hour recharge times."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fortunately this is a bit less relevant today as Windows loses market share in database and server applications, but:UUIDs have historically massively screwed up endian handling. While this new draft discusses sorting UUIDs as strings of octets (bytes) and the text of RFC4122 is fairly explicit about most significant bytes coming first, the C UUID structure in RFC 4122 appendix A is entirely misguided:    typedef struct {
        unsigned32  time_low;
        unsigned16  time_mid;
        unsigned16  time_hi_and_version;
        unsigned8   clock_seq_hi_and_reserved;
        unsigned8   clock_seq_low;
        byte        node[6];
    } uuid_t;

Those aren’t bytes — they’re integers of various sizes. (Hint: do not use integer types in C code for portable data structures. ntohl, etc are a mess. Just use arrays of bytes.)I don’t know the whole history, but MS somehow took this structure at face value and caused problems like this:https://github.com/uuid-rs/uuid/issues/277So, if you want to do anything (e.g. sorting) that depends on the representation of a UUID (or even depends on converting between string and binary representations), be aware that UUIDs coming from Windows may be little-endian.  In my book, this is a Windows bug, but opinions may differ here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to be a big proponent of using UUIDs for database PKs but I&#39;ve found them inherently difficult to work with.  It&#39;s much easier to remember/recognize an integer based PK when troubleshooting a data problem.This isn&#39;t to say you shouldn&#39;t use UUIDs at all, but I much prefer to use an &#34;ExternalId&#34; column of UUID type if you don&#39;t want to expose your integer based PKs externally."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using ULID for a while now, which analogous to UUID v7 but with a different (better IMHO) string representation. They&#39;ve been awesome for using as sort keys in dynamo for instance, since they&#39;re lexicographically sortable as strings.But one thing I&#39;m still wary about is exposing these IDs with millisecond-precision time components to end users, since I&#39;ve seen multiple discussions here on HN about the potential for timing attacks.How worried should I really be? Do people have useful heuristics on the kinds of data where it&#39;s safe/unsafe to expose timing information, or should I just only expose a separate UUID v4 externally across the board just to be safe?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hello. I made this. I&#39;m a bit shocked at how many people are getting things wrong and taking things out of context, so perhaps I could answer some questions.To clarify: I have not been with MIT in years. I was paid the minimum hourly rate (roughly $14 an hour) to work on a related project during my undergraduate years, which eventually evolved into this project years down the road. (In fact, I had to pay for my own compute to get my work started - MIT never offered me any credits.) Everything else has been paid out of pocket since then. Yes, it does indeed cost several thousands of dollars a month - that is not an exaggeration. This has been optimized so many times that the technology needs to improve first before I can cut down on costs.The timer in the &#34;TOS&#34; was put there in hopes that people could understand where I was coming from in regards to misappropriating this kind of research. I did not expect people to get this riled up over a 10 second timer. (Especially not on Hacker News, of all places...)Edit: I suppose it makes sense to include other information in this post so that others don&#39;t have to go hunting for my comments in this thread:- &gt;This is unrelated but what&#39;s with the fascination with HN users and My Little Pony? I&#39;ve noticed this on a lot of posts in the past few months.- Twilight Sparkle&#39;s voice is indispensable in getting emotional contextualizers to work properly. The logo and profile picture is an homage to that fact.- &gt;But seriously: how did you get the domain `15.ai`?- I purchased it. It was definitely not cheap.- &gt;They named their tts &#34;Deep Throat&#34;? Why would you?- It was a suggestion from a Twitter user, and I found it clever.- &gt;I heavily doubt it&#39;s &#34;several thousands of dollars&#34;...- It is indeed several thousands of dollars a month. I can show you AWS invoices, if you&#39;re skeptical. Just send me an email and I&#39;d be happy to show proof.- &gt;The disclaimer is a little ironic considering the site owner doesn’t own the model (MIT does) and doesn’t own the training data (the various shows and games do)- I&#39;m sorry to tell you that I do, in fact, own my own model.

However what&#39;s cool is that there are a ton of characters (from popular shows and video games) and there are useful statistics like inferred emotion (which is also in the output).Honestly it&#39;s a big problem how a lot of AIs are like &#34;black boxes&#34; where you really can&#39;t customize or see anything. Yeah we have DALL-E and GPT which can generate text images but the lack of customization or fine-tuning the image afterwards severely hinders what&#39;s possible with them. Ultimately what you want is something interactive, where you can control how much or little the AI generates, and give it really specific criterion.But seriously: how did you get the domain `15.ai`?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you want more information about 15.ai, I highly suggest reading their Wikipedia article! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15.aiThe whole history behind the project is fascinating: 4chan had a huge role in its development, and the project&#39;s work was stolen by an NFT company that a famous voice actor endorsed not too long ago."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to work for an expert witness who testified on valuations in IP infringement cases. I really lost faith in the way the US handles IP infringement in that job. I know patents are contentious in tech, but sometimes I think copyright is just as bad. I know it&#39;s not a popular opinion, but seeing how things actually play out really made me feel for defendants in those cases.Regardless of what you think of the effectiveness of IP protection, the way damages are calculated (and ultimately determined by courts) is just awful. I haven&#39;t looked at the specifics of that $65M calculation, but if the real number were closer to $650k I wouldn&#39;t be surprised-- 2 orders of magnitude was a pretty typical spread between plaintiff and defendant expert witnesses&#39; valuations in the IP cases I worked on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sorry for the somewhat obvious reference, but I thought that The Right to Read by Richard Stallman [1] would probably have predicted something similar. Of course, it had:    There were ways, of course, to get around the SPA and Central
    Licensing. They were themselves illegal. Dan had had a classmate in
    software, Frank Martucci, who had obtained an illicit debugging tool,
    and used it to skip over the copyright monitor code when reading
    books. But he had told too many friends about it, and one of them
    turned him in to the SPA for a reward (students deep in debt were
    easily tempted into betrayal). In 2047, Frank was in prison, not for
    pirate reading, but for possessing a debugger.


People may quibble about the specifics here &#34;It&#39;s a game, not a book&#34;, but to me it honestly sounds like we are firmly on the trajectory to this horrific reality.No one should ever go to prison for a lot of things, but &#34;allowing people to play computer games&#34; sounds like it should be pretty high on those lists. I have never owned a Nintendo device, and will continue to avoid them now that I know about the terrible consequences of their profit-seeking.----------------------------------------[1] https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.en.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just can&#39;t really feel any animosity toward Gary Bowser (or his business partners) here.  The amount that Nintendo &#34;lost&#34; is probably a couple orders of magnitude less than the damages that Nintendo claims.  An illegally-obtained copy of something does not equal a lost sale!  It&#39;s of course not surprising, but is ultimately gross, that rightsholders keep trying to claim that every unauthorized copy is one that the recipient would have paid for if it hadn&#39;t been available illegally, when we know at this point that&#39;s far far far from the truth.  The vast majority of people who obtain illegal copies would never pay in the first place.I think it would suck if a small creator got screwed over to this degree by a group of infringers like this.  But the true loss to Nintendo here is far less than it costs them to litigate, and is a rounding error when compared to their total revenue numbers over the years involved here.  It&#39;s only profitable for them to litigate because they&#39;re able to obtain awards in such ridiculous excess of their actual damages.I don&#39;t think I&#39;m really strictly in favor of this sort of organized copying, especially for profit.  But I just can&#39;t get even a tiny bit riled up about it, either.  I think, up to a certain point, companies should be forced to just accept this sort of thing as a cost of doing business.  Sure, figuring out what that certain point is might be really difficult to agree on.  But I think this particular case falls well below that point.  Remember that copyright is a social and legal construct.  It&#39;s up to the public to decide what rights it confers, and what remedies are available to rightsholders who feel harmed by infringers.  There&#39;s nothing inherently &#34;correct&#34; about the rent-seeking behavior our current laws enable."</p>

Like carrying something heavy, or having a line of people walk the bridge with the right tools/verification to install the rivets right, or even the opportunity for someone to speak up present unique ideas to the group.Even just a few basic OS primitives early on could have jump started so much collaboration tools and techniques that mirror how we all work together everywhere else in real life.As an aside, the whole &#34;meta-verse&#34; craze might pull these ideas through to the mainstream again.I see lots of demos of avatars standing at a table working on stuff together, and I&#39;ve been on VR chat before drawing 3d images with crayons at the same time with other people.It&#39;s incredibly fun to try and draw an elephant together and work on different parts at the same time to hilarious results."</p>

It&#39;s better than coffee at waking me up and is an excellent source of feedback on body weight status.  Also takes very little time.I highly recommend incorporating at least a static hand stand against the wall into your morning routine, then try work up to turning it into full blown handstand pushups just a little bit at a time.Used to just do pushups daily, then my friend&#39;s girlfriend who did acrobatics and crap talked me into doing handstands with her one day.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sorry to say, but these hit close to home for me.   A lot of the synchronization paradigms in Go are easy to misuse, but lead the author into thinking it&#39;s okay.   the WaitGroup one is particularly poignant for me, since the race detector doesn&#39;t catch it.I&#39;ll add one other data race goof: atomic.Value.  Look at the implementation.  Unlike pretty much every other language I&#39;ve seen, atomic.Value isn&#39;t really atomic, since the concrete type can&#39;t ever change after being set.   This stems from fact that interfaces are two words rather than one, and they can&#39;t be (hardware) atomically set.  To fix it, Go just documents &#34;hey, don&#39;t do that&#34;, and then panics if you do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This definitely matches my experience using Go at my previous organization.1. Closures and concurrency really don&#39;t mix well. The loop variable capture in particular is very pernicious. There&#39;s an open issue to change this behavior in the language: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20733.2. Yep. I&#39;ve seen this problem in our codebase. I&#39;ve grown to just be very deliberate with data that needs to be shared. Put it all in a struct that&#39;s passed around by its pointer.3. This issue is caught fairly easily by the race detector. Using a sync.Map or a lock around a map is pretty easy to communicate with other Go devs.4. This should be documented better, but the convention around structs that should not be passed around by value is to embed a noCopy field inside. https://github.com/golang/go/issues/8005#issuecomment-190753...
This will get caught by go vet, since it&#39;ll treat it like a Locker.5 &amp; 6. Go makes it pretty easy to do ad-hoc concurrency as you see fit. This makes it possible for people to just create channels, waitgroups, and goroutines willy-nilly. It&#39;s really important to design upfront how you&#39;re gonna do an operation concurrently, especially because there aren&#39;t many guardrails. I&#39;d suggest that many newcomers stick with x/sync.ErrGroup (which forces you to use its Go method, and can now set a cap on the # of goroutines), and use a *sync.Mutex inside a struct in 99% of cases.7. Didn&#39;t encounter this that often, but sharing a bunch of state between (sub)tests should already be a red flag. Either there&#39;s something global that you initialized at the very beginning (like opening a connection), or that state should be scoped and passed down to that individual test, so it can&#39;t really infect everything around it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is pretty cool. 50 million lines of code is quite a large corpus to work off of.I&#39;m surprised by some of them. For example, go vet nominally catches misuses of mutexes, so it&#39;s surprising that even a few of those slipped through. I wonder if those situations are a bit more complicated than the example.Obviously, the ideal outcome is that static analysis can help eliminate as many issues as possible, by restricting the language, discouraging bad patterns, or giving the programmer more tools to detect bugs. gVisor, for example, has a really interesting tool called checklocks:https://github.com/google/gvisor/tree/master/tools/checklock...While it definitely has some caveats, ideas like these should help Go programs achieve a greater degree of robustness. Obviously, this class of error would be effectively prevented by borrow checking, but I suppose if you want programming language tradeoffs more tilted towards robustness, Rust already has a lot of that covered."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Prior art&#34; for this is DNS block lists (DNSBLs).Typically these are used like this: your mail server gets an SMTP connection from some address (let&#39;s use the familiar IPv4 example): 10.20.30.40.You reverse these octets and do an &#34;A&#34; record dns query to some 40.30.10.10.dnsbl.example.com to look up that IP in example.com&#39;s list.  If a match is returned, the address is listed. If you do a &#34;TXT&#34; record query, you can find out why it&#39;s listed.Block lists are typically blacklists, but they can be whitelists as well.DNSBL&#39;s are hammered with queries from vast numbers of mail servers; DNS keeps things efficient."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think one of Tesla&#39;s biggest problems with any of their autonomous systems is the names they give those systems. They confuse regulators, reporters, and consumers.Most reporters seem to confuse &#34;autopilot&#34; with &#34;full self driving&#34; or vice versa. It&#39;s not uncommon to see sentences like &#34;Autopilot, a feature that costs $10k, is still in beta.&#34;Autopilot is cruise control that keeps you within a lane when it can. That&#39;s it. Other cars have it, and they&#39;re equally effective or ineffective.Full self driving, aside from being terrifying, does it all, and I suspect it&#39;s usually what regulators and reporters mean when they say &#34;Autopilot.&#34;I think if Tesla had used &#34;lane aware cruise control&#34; as the name for &#34;Autopilot&#34;, it&#39;d have helped reduce the number of times people confuse the two.Frankly, as an owner of a Tesla that has both features, I wouldn&#39;t mind at all if both were pulled from the software. FSD is absolutely terrifying. I&#39;d rather let my teenage son drive me than have FSD do it. Autopilot feels like a novelty. Given how frequently the car yells at you when you&#39;re not holding the wheel, it&#39;s hardly better than simple cruise control."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My use case was autopilot steering me off the left hand side of the road at 80 MPH  during a sunset [1] My (WAG) guess is that the ML corpus was based on a model 3, while the model Y, I was driving, had placed the sensors slightly higher? I dunno; again, tis a WAG.I am a huge fan of Tesla&#39;s permise. My Dad sold Vanguard Citicars [2], and I worked on GM&#39;s interactive ad for the EV-1. I put a down payment on Aptera&#39;s original EV and again on the resurrected version [3].But, I backed out of buying a Tesla. Even though I disabled Autopilot and ran purely cruise control, the Model Y would brake for phantom obstacles. Such as: low rises in the road. Or: passing a 18-wheeler on the left. Driving from AZ to CA, the phantom braking was occuring every 5 miles or so. So, I had to drive 800 miles with a manual accelerator.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I don&#39;t quite understand is that many cars have autopilot-like software. Unlike tesla&#39;s which constantly requires putting pressure on the wheel to show you&#39;re there and paying attention, Ford&#39;s lets you drive indefinitely without any hands on the wheel. Wouldn&#39;t this same investigation be put onto other manufactures as a giant audit? Hitting emergency vehicles is obviously bad but 1) it happens in cars without autopilot and 2) if you&#39;re hitting one you&#39;re clearly no paying attention. it&#39;s not like they just appear out of no where"</p>

Sometimes it would take 5 minutes, sometimes 2 h. It was infuriating.I spent dozens of hours trying to figure it out. Disabling apps, enabling other apps, tracing logs, killing random applications, seeing if it was load-related, trying reboots. At one point I was half-convinced it only happened after coming back from hibernating (not suspending). I tried desperately to &#34;fix&#34; the bluetooth module, disable and re-enable handoff, delete internal settings, copy old bluetooth modules from older versions, working mostly tethered... Nothing seemed to fix it, until I found a message deep in the logs that led me to try to disable &#34;AirPlay Receiver&#34;.Voilá! It was instantly fixed. I documented my workaround here: https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOSBeta/comments/qjgqjx/i_think_i... and it seems it&#39;s spread a bit like wildfire through the internet. I should have put up a donation link :DWhat that journey taught me was that AirPlay, Wifi, Bluetooth and the like are serious messy beasts on macOS. I work with BLE sometimes while developing and I&#39;m aware of how messy it is, but it seems that macOS has so many features that it makes it far worse.In any case, my workaround is still working and I occasionally still get people thanking me for finding it.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I ran into this the other day and did a video about it - not the best quality video but shows it happening in realtime with analysis and commentary: https://www.dropbox.com/s/hra2uxx66kf7z0j/PXL_20220609_21480...The cause in this case was AWDL (Apple Wireless Direct Link.) Holding the Option key while clicking the Wi-Fi icon and clicking &#34;Enable Wi-Fi Logging&#34; and then checking /var/log/wifi.log will show AWDL scans starting and ending randomly, and when the scan is active it causes latency spikes every 1s like clockwork. Unrelated to AWDL, but if a process is requesting a Wi-Fi network scan (different from an AWDL scan), /var/log/wifi.log will also tell you the name of the process, such as &#34;locationd&#34; when the Location Service needs your location. (Tangential, but the locationd process rarely causes these latency spikes for me - on a default macOS install it very rarely requests scans in my experience, backed by my analysis of the log.)AWDL has to be used for things like AirDrop, so it&#39;s expected to have this latency increase while you have the AirDrop window open scanning for nearby devices / sending files to other devices. There are other uses of AWDL (AirPlay, Auto Unlock, Universal Clipboard at the very least)[0], but I don&#39;t know what was triggering it so actively in my case... and why it wasn&#39;t happening on my M1 Air. It also wasn&#39;t always happening in the background like this, it just started that day.The &#34;fix&#34; was to disable the awdl0 interface, but that may also cause AirDrop/AirPlay and related services to not function (I did not test.) It&#39;s easy to re-enable it though.To disable:
  ifconfig awdl0 downTo enable:
  ifconfig awdl0 upUpon disabling, the latency spikes go away permanently.[0] https://owlink.org/wiki/"</p>

I’ve been tracking him using it when we get separated. Andy, if you see this, hello from Deadweight :)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"He&#39;s currently at Palmerton, PA/Lehigh Gap. The hike up out of town is steep and completely unshaded. You absolutely bake on a sunny day. Once you hit the top of the ridge, the trail looks out over the old zinc smelting plant for the next five or so miles. It&#39;s absolutely one of the most striking parts of the trail.The ridge is basically bare of trees, AIUI because of the plume of pollution from the zinc plant. A Walk In The Woods (the book, not the execrable movie) goes into some detail.12 years ago when I hiked through, the ridge was covered in low berry bushes, possibly as some sort of bioremediation effort. I did not partake of the berries."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I was deciding whether this venture was worth committing to another year of 70+ hour weeks. I need a higher level of certainty than investors do because my time is more valuable to me than their money is to them.Investors place bets in a portfolio of companies, but I only have one life.Both startup founders and investors alike seem to forget this (for obvious reasons) so it is good to put this on your toilet wall so you see it often."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi, author here.I&#39;m surprised (and delighted) to see this back on Hacker News. I&#39;m happy that people find value in the article, and the process writing it forced me to put my thoughts together and helped get me through an emotionally difficult time.To address a few questions from the comments.1) A common opinion is that I gave up too quickly, that I was just burned out, or taking the money would have let me figure things out later. This was simply not the case. An experienced mountaineer knows if a mountain is climbable with the team, gear, and weather he has. This one was not.2) I would have been 100% fine with the team and investors going ahead without me, but AFAIK, neither side ever discussed it.3) We were absolutely not viewing contract information, and would not have been able to do so even if we wanted to. We anonymously logged when functions were called without storing user or input data of any kind.4) Six years later, I&#39;m doing well. The Disrupting Japan podcast is going strong.  I took a senior role in corporate VC for a while, and ended up at Google.I was overwhelmed by the attention and positive response I got from this article. The asymmetry of value of money and time was one of my main learnings, and I&#39;m glad to see it resonates with so many other founders."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;My team and most of my investors are pissed,I know it is childish,  but I always enjoy this difference between US and British English.In British English when someone is annoyed they may be described as &#39;pissed off&#39;. Describing someone as being &#39;pissed&#39; means they are drunk! These US articles paint such vivid surrealism in my mind. In this case I love the idea of all of the investors being permanently inebriated.There is a lovely part of the &#39;special relationship&#39; where the US doesnt care what the UK thinks of them, and therefore the UK has great fun at their expense. I suppose that is a win win situation? The US projects an image of being the leader of so many things, and the rest of the world jokes about how arrogant this is."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a few hundred hours under my belt with a dining table, chairs, and even something with a roof to show for it.For me, a huge chunk of each project’s fun was planning.  Going through my first two prototypes in Sketchup (rather than in real life) was a massive amount of fun.  That part really was not so different to hacking code, really.The physical work itself is then completely different to software engineering.  Nothing is simple — every step of the project presents some unique problem that you have to work around carefully.  Maybe you forgot to include the width of the saw in a measurement.  Or your stock has a knot in exactly the wrong place.  Or you didn’t plan the assembly in the best way to optimise for clamping. Or you drip glue awkwardly and have to clean the first of six benches up before oiling.  Or you want to add a shamfer in an awkward place to a piece you’ve already partly assembled.Imagine having to stop work every few hours to hone the edge on an IDE that’s gone blunt.  Imagine running out of 8mm if-statements (dowels) and having to improvise some more so you can peg a project together.There’s no homogeneity with a natural product.  Everything is slow and methodical with few opportunities to hack / test / prototype.  You have to think and solve problems that you never thought would happen in a new kind of way because you can’t roll back or undo.Above all, there are many things you just cannot automate.  Sanding up the frame of a pergola getting it ready for oiling is going to be O(n) at best, with only ever a single processor to throw at the problem which itself is hard bounded by mealtimes and hours-in-day.I love it because it’s not like software."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great. I took up woodworking last year. The only thing about it that bummed me out is how expensive it is. I didn’t expect that. There’s a saying: “Why would I buy my wife a $500 dresser when I can build it myself for $1000?”Very true with wood unfortunately."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why some software engineers like woodworking.I have been a software engineer all my working life, and I absolutely despise woodworking or anything that smacks of DIY.  I find them unbelievably stressful and frustrating partly because I can see how I want things to be, they never work out nearly that good and I can never fix them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; 1. Untangle your self-worth and your workWhen you are passionate about your work, it can easily bleed into every other area of your life — you read about work-related topics in your free time, you think about a particularly challenging problem in the shower, you journal about your work, etc. It also changes ones social circle: hanging out with an ambitious and curious start-up crowd easily leads to work as the default topic in a gathering of friends. Once you have work deeply embedded in your interests and social life, it does not take a huge mental leap to &#34;work is what defines me as an individual&#34;.That then leads to a precarious &#34;all eggs in one basket&#34; situation that leaves you vulnerable in cases of professional failure (&#34;My start-up is not doing well; I am a failure&#34;) or burnout (&#34;I&#39;m cynical about my work; nothing matters&#34;).It took quite a bit of time to disentangle my self-worth and my professional identity, but it makes life so much better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s unfortunate that the entire article is focused on toxic productivity as a feature of individuals, as though their personal/psychological shortcomings are to blame.I think it is worthwhile asking what are the cultural, structural, workplace conditions which contribute to people feeling like this in the first place.  Are people more likely to have &#39;toxic productivity&#39; when they are having unrealistic deadlines/workloads thrown at them?  Does management foster a hypercompetitive environment?  Does being tethered to Slack/Teams contribute?  Do specific workplace methodologies such as Agile, etc have an effect?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So we&#39;re just rehashing workaholism with a modern spin? We really are just living through a cycle that endlessly repeats. I&#39;ve started reading books and listening to interviews done in the early 1980s and I&#39;ve been astounded as to how the culture at the time was almost identical to what we&#39;re doing now. It&#39;s down right creepy but when I think about it it&#39;s not unexpected. From my point of view, that&#39;s exactly 1 generation. My peers and I have no memories of the period and so it makes sense that we haven&#39;t learned any of the lessons from that time. Thus we&#39;re doomed to repeat them now that we are the ones dominating the economy and the culture. It makes me wish for a more thorough survey of modern history to be taught in schools, I&#39;m sure that with enough research you could identify significant trends that repeat on a regular basis which you could then teach to students so that they had some warning of what was to come and could perhaps break out of the cycle."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"From 2006 to 2014 I owned my own platform.  Several actually.   But I turned them down after it became a lot of work to maintain.  At the time, it wasn&#39;t so obvious the web was dying, but in hindsight I probably helped kill it.In the beginning the web was so new, and growing so fast, with new things, amazing sites, and more people getting online. Like all things in life, competition arises, and better sites started getting much more of the market share.   People&#39;s expectations for what a website could offer rose tremendously, and would abandon a site if it wasn&#39;t up to snuff.   Sites needed to have ever improving visuals, better content, better people, better interactivity, better everything.And I couldn&#39;t keep up with it.  Users went from being happy to try out something new to dismissive and bitter.  More and more it felt like work to try to make them happy, to keep building more and better things.   And that&#39;s exactly what happened.   The Internet became work.   It&#39;s why we all have to be paid to come to work and build the Internet.  No one does it for free, because it&#39;s a thankless grueling job.   The only websites that survived were the ones that made money, and could afford to use that money to hire people.   Google, Facebook, Myspace, Stumbleupon, 9gag, and even Something Awful became money oriented rather than community oriented.   They had to, or else.The advice to &#34;Always Own Your Own Platform&#34; is a euphemistic way of saying make a whole company out of your site and underpay the only employee (you) for ever.   The reason we don&#39;t own our own platform anymore is because it&#39;s soooo annoying to do so.   It wasn&#39;t an accident."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Distribute [your content] via methods you control.I&#39;m being nitpicky but it feels off to me to call people out on owning their own platform but then use Cloudflare&#39;s CDN instead of running their own. And if they did run their own CDN, they would probably have to use AWS or another worldwide cloud provider and not own the hardware. And if I were Richard Stallman I would probably come down on you for using proprietary chipsets in your hardware instead of totally open source hardware. And you can just keep going deeper and deeper with this train of thought. So what level of ownership is acceptable to this website&#39;s author? I feel like the right balance of &#34;ownership&#34; is super subjective.I love a lot of traits of the &#34;old-school&#34; web and am a huge believer in self-hosting as much as possible. But imo yelling at people while on your high horse doesn&#39;t encourage anyone."</p>

But is it possible to ask for a &#34;before&#34; the beginning of time? What is time? Time is what we measure with clocks. What are clocks? Something that returns to the same state (say, a pendulum, or the earth orbiting around the sun - a &#34;year&#34;). To be able to build a clock you need mass. Only objects with mass, moving below the speed of light, experience time. In the very far future, after all stars have burned out, the only objects remaining will be black holes. Eventually, even they will decay due to Hawking radiation. So in the end, there will be only expanding space, and radiation that &#34;travels to infinity&#34;. Photons themselves do not experience time as they move with the speed of light. Without mass, without anything that has a notion of time, the concept of distance becomes meaningless. The universe will become spacelike. Without distances, the universe may as well be a singular point. Like the Big Bang :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Code is my favorite technical book of all time [1]. Charles does an amazing job of building a computer up from basic principles &#34;two young boys who want to communicate after their parents tell them to go to bed at night&#34; all the way to modern (for 1999) computers. He layers abstraction on top of abstraction all the way to a working computer. My only (slight) disappointment in the book is that he tries to cover operating systems -&gt; object oriented programming in a couple of chapters at the end. That could have been a multi-volume series in its own right.It goes really well with Elements of Computing Systems (2nd ed) [2] which I kind of think of as a &#34;lab manual&#34; where you get to build a computer from first principles.[1] https://www.amazon.com/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Softw...[2] https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-second-Pri..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This book was absolutely essential when I was first sinking my teeth into software programming. Things that seemed either arbitrary or completely mysterious suddenly made sense now that I had a contextual understanding of how computers worked. Without having that knowledge, I think my career would have been vastly more difficult and frustrating.While I understand many “get started programming” books/tutorials put an emphasis on getting coding asap, I really had to stop and learn about computers before I could start coding in a well rounded way (and that’s coming from a WebDev, who doesn’t even have to deal with low-level stuff too often!).Thank you Mr. Petzold!!!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This book (1st edition, at least) is astonishing. Perhaps the best book for coders that I’ve ever read. I recommend it to all the HN crowd.Reading it, I felt like I actually understood how computers worked, right down to the “electricity going through wires” level and lower, and how that builds up to if-then statements, etc, in a high-level language."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Individual states’ pay transparency laws are already applying upwards pressure on salaries across the country.My company has multiple groups in different states including Colorado, and in anticipation of needing to post salary ranges for our open positions in Colorado, my group (with no positions in Colorado) preemptively bumped up everyone’s salaries to the midpoint of their pay bands to avoid anyone becoming frustrated if they learned they were in the bottom half. Despite the preemptive adjustments, a colleague of mine became angry and quit when they found out their salary wasn’t at the very top of their position’s pay range.So pay transparency laws are having a big impact—not only in the obvious cases of candidates negotiating salaries in the states that passed the pay transparency laws, but also for average employees in other states who didn’t even need to do anything except learn how much their labor was worth."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is funny, but the OpenSSL CLI is in large part just a series of utility/driver/diagnostic programs for library functionality that isn&#39;t expected to be used on a standalone basis. It&#39;s the industry standard for generating certificates, but that&#39;s because the industry doesn&#39;t understand certificates; most people should be using nothing but certbot and mkcert.What bugs me a little is the idea that you might want a well-designed version of what the OpenSSL CLI offers. Bad idea! You want tools designed to do one thing well, not one tool that offers a thin layer of getopt() over a low-level cryptography API."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Truly great GUI design is very challenging.  I&#39;ve used very few applications which I think have a truly great UI that beats the CLI in terms of the efficiency of presenting options in orthogonal and conditional ways (orthogonal: two features which don&#39;t interact at all can usually be programmed independently and appear in distinct locations, while conditional: options that are only valid if another option is set to a specific value).The best UI I&#39;ve worked with so far is Fusion 360.  Like most 3d modelling tools it has a fairly steep learning curve, but it does a fantastic job of making your life easier.  It has a bunch of UI dialogs for parameter setting (some of which are better than others) that do a good job with both orthogonality and conditionality.  I really wanted to like blender but just about everything in it feels rotated 90 degrees to how I&#39;d do it."</p>

It&#39;s kind of ridiculous it&#39;s getting this kind of press before the paper is officially published and available.   If the paper was published and security experts were allowed to analyze it before the tech press went nuts the stories would probably have a different tone.This is interesting theoretically but the amount of access required is pretty high, this is hardly an exploitable zero day.Having read the paper, in a nutshell it requires:- Login to the Mac in question- Ability to install a custom kext to make the PACMAN Gadget work.   The exploit requires access to undocumented registers on the M1 that are apparently not accessible from user space, but this is a bit unclear.- Also need an exploitable kernel buffer overflow against Mac OS (they made a custom kext with a buffer overflow)- Run the bufferflow + Pacman Gadget together to do the final elevationIf someone can find a way to do this without installing kexts then it becomes way more serious.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Initiatives like the Dot Collector and the Performance review system that has led to a toxic workplace cultureI was curious about that &#34;Dot Collector&#34;:Dot collector was an application invented by Ray Dalio’s hedge fund and Bridgewater Associates. The application has set its foot in Coinbase since the start of the year and has been in use by the HR and IT teams of the company. The user interface of the app is quite simple and efficient. It asks the user to rate the coworker or the manager on how well they demonstrate the 10 crore Values at coinbase. The values are not only limited to things like communications, but also include values like positive energy. The information about the co-worker can be shared by either giving a thumbs up or by giving a thumbs down. There is an option of giving neutral feedback for the co-workers in the application.Sounds like hell."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve become convinced that hiring more people is generally a warning sign. A team of between a few and about twenty people seems to produce all the good stuff. Anything beyond that, your value per employee drops drastically, and your cost per employee goes up as you need to offer higher and higher salaries to stay in competition. A company going on a hiring spree is now a negative indicator for me. I think FB, Goog, etc. could lay off thousands with no adverse effects and in fact an increase in velocity, quality, and quantity of new features/products. Sometimes one person can be much more productive than a whole team. This is obviously unscientific, just a feeling I’m getting lately."</p>

A number of passengers get up from their seats left of the aisle and lean over the people seated on the right to get a glimpse of the statue. Plane promptly crashes.Why? There were too many Poles in the right half of the plane.I&#39;ll lead myself out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this article is trying to make a political statement, &#34;Our leaders have just done something that is going to cause a future problem, a crash&#34;.I have only read the linked article, I think the followup might be available, but I&#39;m not going to read it before posting this -- because this article was meant to be clickbait, to get you hooked and possibly mis-informed.The article as it stands (incomplete) contains some classic argument fallacies.It is an &#34;appeal to authority&#34;, by attempting to explain control theory. This person knows something.The examples all result in bad things, airplanes crashing, hard drives (crashing - perhaps a stretch). Bicycle at the edge of a cliff. Eating too much ice cream. Chernobyl. This is a possible &#34;appeal to emotion&#34;.The final issue is an &#34;incomplete comparison&#34;. The graph at the bottom of the article shows housing prices -- all of the previous examples have mathematical models which can explain the behavior. For the last graph no model (the equations) is presented. Without a model you cannot  use control theory to analyze the zeros and poles.The last graph wants you to believe in a continuing upward trend, the fallacious argument, implies that whatever the Canadian political change that has been made is going to make this trend to zero, despite the intention to keep it trending upwards.Background: A long time ago, as a mathematics undergraduate, I did take a course in control theory, it was run out of the engineering department. It was somewhat awkward as quite a few mathematical terms were not-quite-the-same. I get the same unease when reading this for poles, zeros and right-half-planes. Any engineering textbooks that use j for sqrt(-1) instead of i (because that is taken) is an indicator. Yup, this could be construed as an &#34;appeal to authority&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am not sure what to take from this. The title certainly makes sense from a engineers perspective. But from a layman&#39;s? I don&#39;t know.It seems, that he tries to explain an important concept in control theory but does not explain the meaning of &#34;plane&#34; at all. Even worse: He uses airplanes as an example.Isn&#39;t it terribly confusing for non-control-theory people? If I don&#39;t know control theory, then how on earth would I know that he means a 2D-plane? And what&#39;s this &#34;minimum-phase-system&#34; he mentions once? Is a pole a number? And what about RHP poles?I would be interested in how readers without a background in control theory and higher maths understood that article and what questions arose."</p>

In session 2, start the concurrent (re)index.
In session 3, monitor pg_stat_progress_create_index for session 2 to get to a &#39;waiting for ...&#39; phase.When you detect the (re)index session arrives in a waiting phase, start a REPEATABLE READ transaction in this session, and then halt (commit or rollback doesn&#39;t matter) the transaction in session 1.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"All of these supposed &#34;flaws&#34; of leetcode are by design. Big companies want people who are smart enough to do the work, but obedient enough to put up with all the bullshit that comes with working at a big company. What person better matches that than someone who&#39;s able and willing to study for and pass a tech version of the SAT? Every anti-leetcode article I read is some version of &#34;leetcode is bad because it measures the wrong things.&#34; No, we all know it measures those things, and those are exactly the things the measurers want to measure.You might ask, so why do startups do leetcode too? I heard startups are supposed to be, uh, innovating, developing new technology, and working on hard, meaningful problems? Shouldn&#39;t they want brilliant, super effective people, instead of smart-enough, obedient workers? Apparently not. Apparently they want the same workers bigcos want. The implication of this is left as an exercise to the reader."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Someone who builds a truly novel technology solution involving hundreds of hours of effort gets filtered out of an interview involving contrived scenarios.  You may have built the next generation X, but given an array of strings and a fixed width, can you format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully justified -- in the next 30 minutes?  Maybe you should have cultivated that skillset instead, because around here we value parlor tricks more than real world accomplishments."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my team we do technical interviews in three steps:- an algorithmic challenge. It&#39;s related to what we do day to day. I work in domain names so we ask to parse a domain name. There are oddities with domain names so we check multiple things: does the candidate know what basic string manipulation functions exist? do they ask questions to get more info? how do they react when we give additional info that break the code they did so far? What we don&#39;t check: whether the code compiles or actually works. We don&#39;t care. We explicitly tell the candidate they can write pseudo code or comments defining the steps of the algorithm. We&#39;re interested in their reflection.- an architecture challenge. We ask the candidate how they would scale an API worldwide. There&#39;s no code, it&#39;s an open discussion. They can talk about whatever they want: asynchronous, statelessness, load balancing, replication, anycast, whatever. We can also guide the candidate to know whether they know some specifics concepts (for example I can ask &#34;what would you do if you have a GET REST endpoint that returns the same thing every time&#34; and expect &#34;cache its result&#34;, even with this question I get different answers (which is great), some will talk about HTTP cache headers, others will talk about Redis or in memory caching, rarely do candidates talk about both)- a refactoring challenge. We work with tons of legacy code. So we show the candidate a crappy piece of code with performance issues and no tests and ask them for what their strategy would be. No writing code here, just thinking and discussion.So yeah, just a quick screening to check if the candidate can write basic code (you&#39;d be surprised of the results), and open discussions on our day to day problems."</p>

They deleted some niche accounting software (custom developed by us) from our Dropbox account, plus their own log files covering those deletions.  Then played ignorant.We learned the lesson, and never again trusted Dropbox, for anything.(Best guess - a would-be client got pissed when software which they&#39;d never paid for lacked a feature, and told Dropbox a story.)EDIT:  Only executables &amp; related distribution files were on Dropbox, not any source code.  We lost nothing...except our trust in Dropbox.EDIT2:  Yes, as several others have kinda pointed out, this incident was a collision between (a) naive human expectations (of high-skill, high-touch, highly-invested customer service for such situations) and (b) the actual business model of any huge / cheap or free / convenient cloud provider of X (plus just &#34;internet reality&#34;).

The possibilities here are endless.DaVinci Resolve can&#39;t be beat for #1 and seems to support #3 well, but its API seems designed more for plugins than for automated authoring. For instance, the documentation at https://forum.blackmagicdesign.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=9927... seems to give just read-only access to a lot of things at the TimelineClip level. And https://github.com/pedrolabonia/pydavinci has exactly one contributor.By contrast, Shotcut seems to be built on, and by, https://mltframework.org/ with a close correspondence between the runtime API surface and the file system representation of a file, and it&#39;s fully open-source.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Last year I did a fair amount of consulting work for the GAIN initiative at Idaho National Lab [0].They&#39;re doing so much good work with micro and modular reactors that can basically be &#34;dropped in&#34; decommissioned coal-burning sites because the infrastructure to tie into the electric grid already exists.It was expressed to me that selling this idea to the private-sector energy industry was an uphill battle and uptake was very slow to nonexistent.[0] https://gain.inl.gov/SitePages/Home.aspx"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The cost of nuclear energy seems seriously understated.Nuclear waste storage costs the US $6B per year and we still don’t have a long-term storage plan. We’ll incur this cost for hundreds or thousands of years.
https://earth.stanford.edu/news/steep-costs-nuclear-waste-us...There’s also a cost to secure the nuclear infrastructure.
https://medium.com/the-future-is-electric/nuclear-generation...Can anyone find a cost per Megawatt Hour calculation for nuclear that includes security and long-term waste storage? The calculations I’ve found for the $96/MWh figure seem like they include construction and operation costs, but exclude decommissioning and waste management."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only nuclear plant under construction in the US is at Plant Vogtle, in Georgia.  Regulators set up a system (CWIP) whereby the companies building the plant earn a 10% return on their costs, until the plants come online.  I think it&#39;s not surprising therefore that costs keep increasing and the delays keep coming.  I don&#39;t think we can infer that nuclear power plants cannot be built at reasonable cost, rather that we need to consider &#34;regulatory capture&#34; as a significant construction risk.(Some admittedly one-sided background on CWIP: https://stopcwip.com/ )"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a problem I want to focus my life solving. I believe that software engineering can be made so simple and clear that it can be wielded by an extremely small team of engineers. I believe that there are finite and fundamental classes of problems, that underpin the vast majority of problems, that have a distinct visual representation, and that by representing these problems visually, you let your &#34;visual coprocessor&#34; assist in seeing the solutions. I believe there are well-known strategies (taken from the real world) for managing hierarchies of complexity that ease the cognitive load of exploring any problem. We just need to get these approaches into a programming &#34;langugage&#34;!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I will tell you this.It&#39;s based on my 20+ years, 50 different teams and many hundreds, perhaps thousands of  encounters with software developers.It&#39;s almost never the domain complexity that is high.Sending a rocket to Mars is complex. And perhaps complex every time.Dealing with people that has to work together can only be simplified when agreements are made and agreements are kept. Otherwise you cannot trust and have faith in people.It comes down to far and near organization leadership, mandate and empowerment in small teams with few communication links outwards, clear expectations from whomever is asking for something and process management.Writing code is rarely hard if you know the expectations and the boundaries of the task.Empowerment gives the team the possibility to act on what they discover and encounter.Don&#39;t look into the future. Because you cannot. And you are both naive and arrogant if you believe you can. Deal with what is known now!One thing is complexity in code. Another is complexity in business. Some things are not made for software to solve.Less experienced people are generally guided by their beliefs around their own ideas. If the mind is locked onto something it&#39;s hard not to thing it&#39;s a good idea. Usually in software there is simpler approach. Look for itI can go on because I help companies and teams for a living. But I will stop here"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I highly recommend Rich Hickey&#39;s &#34;Simple Made Easy&#34; talk as a way to think about software complexity.  We all know that complex systems are hard to work with, but I&#39;ve found his presentation very useful in understanding the nature of complexity.  Understanding complexity helps being able to avoid or minimize it.  For example, easy is not the same as simple, and simple changes to one part of a system can introduce great complexity at the macro level.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKtk3HCgTa8"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi, creator here.This is a demo of our recent work presented at Oakland (IEEE S&amp;P): https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/368. The server and client code are written in Rust and available here: https://github.com/menonsamir/spiral-rs. The general aim of our work is to show that homomorphic encryption is practical today for real-world applications. The server we use to serve this costs $35/month!A quick overview: the client uses homomorphic encryption to encrypt the article number that they would like to retrieve. The server processes the query and produces an encrypted result containing the desired article, and sends this back to the client, who can decrypt and obtain the article. A malicious server is unable to determine which article the client retrieved. All search and autocomplete is down locally. The technical details are in the paper, but the high level summary is that the client creates a large one-hot vector of encrypted bits (0’s except for the index of the desired article, where they place a 1) and then the server computes something like a ‘homomorphic dot product’ between the query and the plaintext articles.I’d like to caveat that this is an in-browser demo to show it is practical to use homomorphic encryption at this scale. As a real product, you’d probably want to distribute a signed client executable (or Electron app) since otherwise, a malicious server could simply deliver bad client JS on the fly.Happy to answer any questions!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting! But, it&#39;d be helpful to clarify further the strength of the following claim:&gt; This demo allows private access to 6 GB (~30%) of English Wikipedia. In theory, even if the server is malicious, it will be unable to learn which articles you request. All article title searches are performed locally, and no images are available.In this demo, the number of article-titles is relatively small – a few million – &amp; enumerable.If the server is truly malicious, and it issues itself requests for every known title, does it remain true that this &#34;Private Information Retrieval&#34; (PIR) scheme still gives it no hints that subsequent requests from others for individual articles retrieve particular data?(Presumably: every request touches every byte of the same full 6GB of data, and involves every such byte in constant-run-time calculations that vary per request, and thus have the effect of returning only what each request wanted – but not at all in any way correlatable with other requests for the exact same article, from the same or different clients?)"</p>
