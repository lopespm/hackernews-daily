								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think Firefox news is what I comment most on here. I don&#39;t know why. Well I guess I do. Web browsers, javascript etc is front and center here - which somewhat means the digital world. All my friends use Chrome, and think I&#39;m weird. I think _they_ are. They care about human rights, at least I think they do. But, having Google, an ad company, dictate how our window to the digital world looks like, is now _way worse_ than what Microsoft with IE6 ever did. They had their share, but nothing compared to this. At least Microsoft was just a software company.If a class of people on a forum such as this with so many brilliant minds cannot even be bothered with the values of open source and how this pertains to democracy and human values I really don&#39;t see how any other part of our species could. &#34;Chromium scrolls 5% better on my machine so who cares about Firefox&#34;. I see these comments all the time here. Even in this thread.Firefox. Linux. Postgresql. Wikipedia. Xmms! The WORLD WIDE WEB! Imaging if Google invented hypertext and not CERN (funny how Google made their initial fortunes). AMP would be the least of your worries. Imagine if Amazon &#34;invented&#34; Wikipedia. All of these open source projects are just mindblowingly awesome. They help people. Me. You.But who cares right? Certainly not the lot with money in the 80/90s that didn&#39;t understand how or why this would be important. Which is why all these amazing things happened. Now they do of course. So none of this anymore.Which is why I think humanity is doomed to succumb to our newfound overlords. The Big Four. Five? Six? Seven? Who cares really. A handful.I wish people, especially like what this place definitely represents, would stand up more (including me!). Teach people, politicians, your parents, your siblings, your kids. We understand tech and it&#39;s implications. We understand how big tech is now stifling everything. Good luck training a neural network that competes with 50 billion uploaded photos. Facebook, Amazon. Google. Microsoft.But noone will - &#34;it doesn&#39;t matter&#34;. But make no mistake. It does matter. And humanity is just sitting here. It&#39;s like we&#39;re heading for this High Class Great Filter.Good thing I&#39;ll be dead before all this comes to full fruition.(Sorry for the rant - hope it was still relevant and on point, and I really encourage discussion here!)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I noticed in the comments below how somebody mentioning Firefox&#39;s limited market share was heavily downvoted.I&#39;m a Firefox user since forever, and will keep using it. I also want Mozilla to win, and strongly empathize with their engineers whom are trying to make the best of it.That said, I think the reality check should not be avoided. There is no good in do-good software without reach.Based on statcounter, Firefox&#39;s market share went from a 2009 peak (32%) to a mere 3.29% as we speak. Just in the last year alone, it bleeds market share from 4.25% to 3.29%.So it keeps bleeding market share, 12 years in a row. The reason it&#39;s still losing market share likely is due to the mobile market still growing in size, whilst Firefox has no presence there: 0.48%.I have access to a handful of web properties, one of which very large and global (billions of page views). In our dashboards, Firefox does not even exist. It&#39;s not in the top 10. Above it are Chromium clones most have never heard of.So to the &#34;ordinary&#34; world, those without a particular stake in open source, it&#39;s a dead browser. It&#39;s even smaller than weird regional browsers that most businesses wouldn&#39;t explicitly support.(note that &#34;support&#34; is overstated as most web tech works just fine out of the box in Firefox)Besides the ordinary world, the grip on the developer community is also lost. Increasingly, I&#39;m seeing developers coding up demos and experiments that break in Firefox, it&#39;s not even considered at all, where just a few years ago it was a developer-default browser.It&#39;s an extremely harsh reality check. Effectively Apple, an enemy of the open web, is our only savior against a full Chromium monopoly. Apple actively sabotaging and blocking the progress of the web, is our &#34;hope&#34;. How bad can it get?Anyway, I&#39;m sorry to bring this up, in particular in a release announcement. I bring it up because I believe impact is central to the discussion and trumps any feature and any engineering. If the crash is not reversed somehow, it is inevitable that very hard questions have to be answered.It&#39;s not what I would want. I hope an independent implementation will keep existing forever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Background updates! Hooray! That may sound like a basic table stakes feature but honestly it&#39;s a huge improvement. And a lot of other apps do a terrible job of it, particularly on Windows. It&#39;s remarkable how many apps require 8, 10 mouse clicks and a restart to install a minor update. Firefox didn&#39;t require any clicks but the nag / need to restart was a nuisance.Actually now that I type that I wonder what has changed. I guess the upgrade appears to happen faster because it was done before the restart? I assume Firefox itself still has to be restarted for the update to be effective.(No problem on a Windows system; the OS reboots itself so often Firefox is guaranteed to before too long :-P)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was responsible for Stripe&#39;s API abstractions, including webhooks and /events, for a number of years. Some interesting tidbits:Many large customers eventually had some issue with webhooks that required intervention. Stripe retries webhooks that fail for up to 3 days: I remember $large_customer coming back from a 3 day weekend and discovering that they had pushed bad code and failed to process some webhooks. We&#39;d often get requests to retry all failed webhooks in a time period. The best customers would have infrastructure to do this themselves off of /v1/events, though this was unfortunately rare.The biggest challenges with webhooks:- Delivery: some customer timing out connections for 30s causing the queues to get backed up (Stripe was much smaller back then).- Versioning: synchronous API requests can use a version specified in the request, but webhooks, by virtue of rendering the object and showing its changed values (there was a `previous_attributes` hash), need to be rendered to a specific version. This made upgrading API versions hard for customers.There was constant discussion about building some non-webhook pathway for events, but they all have challenges and webhooks + /v1/events were both simple enough for smaller customers and workable for larger customers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a hill I find myself frequently fighting (and losing on): webhooks are terrible to maintain, because they start from the premise &#34;this never breaks&#34; and thats about where development in an organization stops.The only event API I ever want is notifications there&#39;s new data, and then an interface by which I can query all new data which has arrived by some sort of index marker - because this is fundamentally reliable. It means whatever happens to my system, I can reliably recover missed events, skipped events, or rebuild from previous events.And this is in fact exactly how something like Kafka actually works! Complete with first-class support for compacting queues to produce valid &#34;summarized&#34; starting points.Any streaming system essentially should never start as a streaming system - it should start as a slow-path pull-based system, and have a fast-path push system added on top of it if needed - because then you&#39;ve built your recovery path already, rather then what happens way too often which is just &#34;oh yeah, we&#39;ll develop that when it breaks&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Zulip&#39;s API is built on roughly this design pattern:* https://zulip.com/api/real-time-events* https://zulip.com/api/register-queue* https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/events-sys...We use this same long-polling based /events API interface for all official clients (web, mobile, terminal), our interactive bots ecosystem (https://zulip.com/api/running-bots), and many integrations (E.g. bridges with IRC/Matrix/etc.).We also offer webhooks, because some platforms like Heroku or AWS Lambda make it much easier to accept incoming HTTP requests than do longpolling, but the events system has always felt like a nicer programming model.(Zulip&#39;s events system was inspired by separate ~2012 conversations I had with the Meteor and Quora founders about the best way to do live updates in a web application)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was 2nd employee at a unicorn startup and have been on a work-hiatus for almost a year.  Now, I live amongst Amish people in the country.My biggest insight has been a mindset change.  Previously my underlying approach to life looked like: &#34;I will do X which will enable me to do Y so that I can finally do Z.&#34; I now approach my days with &#34;What will make me happy?&#34;  This is an experiment I&#39;m performing.  A structured life feels safe and orderly - but what if living life and letting things unfold more &#39;organically&#39; is better?It is a weird/uncomfortable shift because I can&#39;t predict what is coming.  As an example, turns out I really enjoy building dams.  A couple months ago I would not have been able to tell you that I&#39;d be building a dam.I have no idea what it is that drives my own interests or affinities, but now instead of attempting to manipulate them for whatever X, Y, or Z goal... I just roll with wherever they take me.  And they always seem ready to take me somewhere.My point is: In a life without work (in my experience) stuff will come up.  Follow what arises, see where it goes.  It certainly feels better."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is one of the biggest missing pieces in internet FIRE discussions. So much of the FIRE discourse is about not working that many don’t realize that they’re going to be extremely bored with 16 hours to fill every day. Worse, their friends are all busy with their lives.It’s actually a common failure point of FIRE post-mittens that didn’t work out. Especially with couples, where it’s more likely that at least one person will realize that maybe jobs, and the sense of purpose and social life that comes with them, aren’t so bad.The other big issue is that people underestimate their spending in a post-work FIRE lifestyle. It’s tempting to subtract out costs like commuting and work clothes and assume your costs will go down. In practice, if you plan on traveling and spending more time on hobbies your costs are likely to go up."</p>

Some have become desertified, perhaps some of which is our fault (eg. Mediterranean deforestation).

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This sounds cool from a tech-nerd perspective, but of course it all is pretty futile if we don&#39;t get emissions under control. The video says 10 gigatons/yr by 2050. Our 2019 emissions were ~36 gigatons. I.e. even if capture is successful, it needs to be accompanied by aggressive emissions reductions for us to even get to neutral, let alone reversing damage.I&#39;m guessing Musk had some thought process around the expected marginal impact of funding this vs more on energy storage vs energy production. And perhaps capture/sequestration is under-explored.But I wonder what could be achieved with $100M of funds directed at research to intentionally changing and shifting culture towards consuming stuff with smaller footprints? Tesla made some people want an electric car really badly. For some, very small houses are becoming attractive. But so far this stuff mostly arises from ad-hoc marketing efforts around particular brands, products, influencers. What if we need systematic memetic engineering, to make lower energy consumption actually feel desirable?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I switched my primary dev environment to NixOS in a graphical VM on macOS towards the end of 2020 and I love it: https://twitter.com/mitchellh/status/1346136404682625024?s=2...Previously, I used Nix on Mac (as this blog post suggests) but I had enough “gotchas” with Nix on Mac that I decided to go full NixOS.For those who ask why a VM or why I keep Mac around at all: I like macOS for everything else besides dev work. I use iMessages heavily, I like the Mac App ecosystem such as calendars, mail clients, etc. This gives me the best of both worlds.I usually run this on an iMac Pro but also have a MacBook Pro. It runs great on either. It’s also really nice with Nix to update one machine and the other is just one command away from being equivalent.I recognize this is a “weird” setup but wanted to point it out since it seems relevant to this post."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To others who might be interested in trying Nix instead of Homebrew:There is a `brew install` equivalent in vanilla Nix -- `nix-env` provides an imperative interface pretty similiar to `brew`.`nix-darwin` is a third-party thing that tries to give you a NixOS-like experience on macOS. It&#39;s not necessary if you&#39;re only interested in replacing Homebrew. You can have `shell.nix` files and ad-hoc environments without replacing your entire system configuration.Vanilla Nix is very well isolated, and you can try it side by side with Homebrew to see how you like it -- one of the nice side effects of Nix-installed software being independent from the rest of your system is that, well, you can install whatever you want without breaking the Homebrew equivalents. For example instead of putting binaries in `/usr/local/bin`, Nix creates a directory of symlinks to files in `/nix/store`, and you can add that directory to your `PATH` if you wish.I switched to Nix a few months ago and have found it... fun. It&#39;s not something I would recommend if you want things to just work, but if you&#39;re curious about Nix, you can learn quite a lot about it from the comfort of your MacBook.I wrote a little about this experience here, including how to map common `brew` commands into their `nix-env` equivalents: https://ianthehenry.com/posts/how-to-learn-nix/switching-fro...(Warning: it&#39;s more of a rambling diary entry than a blog post.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you read https://haystack-books.s3.amazonaws.com/Study+to+understand+..., you’ll seeQ1. To what extent, if any, do the following statements apply to you?I feel burnt out from work.On a four-point scale, that scores 21%, 35%, 28%, 17%.So, they took everyone except those who said they didn’t feel burnt out at all, and got 83%.I think asking for feelings of burnout exaggerates the issue of being burnt out by a huge factor.For me, burnout means not only being tired of your job, but also inability to ‘burn’ outside work. I don’t even see how you can be that moderately, but over a quarter of respondents reported that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder if software presents a unique situation as we generally make a pretty decent salary and to transition to a new career involves a pretty significant pay cut. So some developers become trapped in jobs they hate with golden handcuffs. I really don&#39;t enjoy software development at all, but at this stage, to even think about doing something else would result in a massive pay cut. I did it once when I was younger, quit software and started a new career with a 55% pay cut. Liked the new work and did it for 5 years. Then I had kids and needed more money so I returned to software, since then I just exist in a constant state of burnout."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How much of the workload is just the dev shortage/insufficient staffing?I am currently the only dev on my team because of departures (there should be 4). Now, it is not really all that in production yet so it hasn&#39;t required late nights or waking up at odd hours, but it does linger in my mind that this could be a big issue if it grew a lot and my team didn&#39;t. I would hate to support it alone.A friend of mine is missing two people on his team at another company. It means that they had to shove the interns into the support rotation to have full coverage of their app. They are hiring too, but as things stand, interns are staying up in the night deal with production errors and they are waking each other up as well, they are interns and don&#39;t know what they are doing.Software seems like something that needs a sufficiently sized team after a certain point and nearly every team I know of anywhere is short people at the moment, even at FAANGs."</p>

If you scroll down, he writes:&gt; The Chair [of the Columbia Film program] reached out and said he was confident that we could work out an arrangement to get my degree. But he insisted that I fly out to NYC immediately for an in-person meeting. So I spent a fortune on a last-minute flight in order to hear his proposal.&gt; But instead of telling me what I need to do to satisfy the requirements to get my degree, the Chair began pitching me his idea for a TV pilot. In excruciating scene-by-scene detail. I nodded along, waiting to get back to the terms of me getting my degree.&gt; But to my horror... I slowly begin to realize this IS the deal. He made it pretty clear if I wanted my degree, I needed to help him sell his tv pilot. Yep, the Chair of Columbia’s prestigious graduate film program tried to shake me down in order to jump-start his own stalled out career."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Columbia has a pretty questionable record with other masters programs in creative fields. The school is exploiting the Ivy brand, the NYC location and talent, and legions of students desperate to stand out in highly competitive creative fields. For instance, a 10-month MS in Journalism is $116k (including living expenses) while a 12-month M.S. in data journalism is $160k (https://journalism.columbia.edu/cost-attendance).Yes, studying under true experts in NYC is a wonderful experience for people in film, theater, journalism, writing, the arts, etc. But there should be no expectation that a very expensive degree will lead to high-paying jobs in those fields. The fact that every year Columbia is setting up all of these new grads with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and little hope of repaying it in those professions is downright predatory.The WSJ article that prompted the original Twitter thread is worth reading. A few graduates have managed to find low-paying, entry-level jobs in the film industry that pay under $50k per year, and probably did not require a master&#39;s degree. One of the grads they talked with is working at the local TJ Maxx ... the same job he had as a teenager.Via one of the WSJ reporters who worked on the report:At least 43% of the people who recently took out loans for master’s degrees at elite private universities hadn’t paid down any of their original debt or were behind on payments roughly two years after graduation.It’s not just arts degrees. Other high debt, low-earning master’s programs: NYU publishing (debt: $116k, earnings: $42k), Northwestern speech-language pathology (debt: $148k, earnings: $60k), USC marriage and family counseling (debt: $124k, earnings: $50k).All this is made possible by Grad Plus, the no-limit federal student loan program. Created in 2005, it’s now the fastest growing program. Based on partial data from the 2021 school year, grad students were on track to borrow as much as undergrads for the first time.https://twitter.com/anfuller/status/1413160574205284352"</p>

Physicists tend to enjoy knowledge sharing.You can generally exit at any time and immediately transition into lucrative careers in, for example, tech and finance.It has it&#39;s downsides, but for how whimsical it is, it&#39;s a pretty soft landing if you decide you want out."</p>

And it doesn’t seem unreasonable that they won’t accept a hack fix (however safe it may be) - that car is going to be sold to someone once the lease expires, they just can’t take the riskI would read this as a cautionary tale against renting your cars. If you can’t buy it, don’t! This holds true for any depreciating asset."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pretty sure, you loose the right to repair when you are leasing something, as all lease agreements for vehicles I&#39;ve seen have direct stipulations on the requirements, and penalties of performing and not performing maintenance and repair to their vehicle.I fully support right to repair YOUR PROPERTY, but I also support as part of that, that if the car is owned by Tesla, they have the right to dictate maintenance requirements, and have a say so in who, and what they feel is a valid fix.I don&#39;t see how right to repair would, or should force a change here?"</p>

Lab project, and part of my ongoing curiosity exploring computer-mediated interaction. But because they had the project taken offline, and my computer confiscated, Apple managed to give it more attention than I could have ever attracted. The reporters using headlines with &#34;artist&#34; in scare quotes got the media artists mad. The censorship and search warrant got the freedom of speech people mad. The feeling of privacy invasion, or just the awareness of surveillance, took care of everyone else. Apple created an amazing discussion I never could have planned.Sounds about right"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of a random, but chilling, scene in &#34;Minority Report&#34;. The protagonist confronts a man he thinks is responsible for killing his child.The man decides to reassure the protagonist by explaining how kind he was to the child, and made sure the child didn&#39;t suffer when he killed him. He&#39;s presenting it as though this is a legitimate defense for such an obvious violation. The part that sticks with me is the man&#39;s seeming sincerity in believing he&#39;s making a case for himself, &#34;yeah I did this horrible thing, but I did it in the nicest way possible so it&#39;s really kinda big of me if you think about it&#34;This post fills me with the same chills. The author&#39;s utter lack of culpability for such a viscerally gross violation and strange attempts to spin it as though he&#39;s kind of a good person for doing it in a slightly less terrible way than he could have otherwise done it...To be clear, he didn&#39;t go out and do a security research project with ethical standards in place. He made it clear how laughable he considers the concept of &#39;consent&#39; (an ethical way to do this might&#39;ve been to take people&#39;s pictures, then ask them if they were OK with sharing it right after. He doesn&#39;t consider such a process at all)Instead, he thought of an amoral and illegal way for him to use people without their consent, for his own pleasure, curiosity, and amusement and decided to call it &#39;art&#39;. There are more horrible ways he could have done the above, sure. But that argument to me sounds as hollow as the &#34;but he didn&#39;t suffer&#34; argument from the movie.Him expressing his own sense of magnanimousness and ironic sense of victimhood at the end of it... it really is a scary glimpse into the mind of such people.It&#39;s sad because it&#39;s very easy to misconstrue this as a &#34;security researcher gets feds sent on him by apple&#34; story, and I think lots of people are basically trying to frame it that way, but it&#39;s not that at all. To me, it&#39;s clearly &#34;jackass doesn&#39;t understand consent, apple calls the feds, still a jackass, still doesn&#39;t understand&#34;.[Note: yes I know the character in the movie is revealed as a bluff shortly after, the scene sticks with me because of the character&#39;s apparent sincerity at the moment][Additional Note: yes I know many of these companies also don&#39;t respect consent. Them not respecting it is not an excuse for everyone to behave the same way.]"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi HN! After months of private beta, Obsidian is now finally available for Android and iOS!Obsidian is a personal knowledge management app that works on top of a local folder of Markdown files [0]. Because &#34;local&#34; often means your computer, for the longest time, it has been a pain to access these notes on the go.Our original plan was to build fully native mobile apps. Instead, we decided to build hybrid web apps. Hybrid web apps gets a lot of hate, and for good reason. There&#39;s heavy performance penalty for running JavaScript. Animations are often janky. A lot of native capabilities are restricted.We know everyone&#39;s favorite argument for using the web stack. &#34;We&#39;re a small team, and it&#39;s just not possible to....&#34;. Sure, we&#39;re also just two developers, but that excuse gets old.We see it in a different way. We leverage hybrid web apps not as a shortcut, rather, we use it to put power in the hands of our users. This has always been a key principle driving Obsidian&#39;s development.Obsidian is one of the few apps out there that lets users customize every aspect of the app. Themes and CSS snippets let users completely change the interface. Plugins [1] let users augment the GUI [2], run macros [3], build databases [4], synchronize with other apps [5], and much more.It&#39;s unprecedented for users to have access to this kind of power on their mobile devices.Now, it&#39;s reality, thanks to the web stack.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Obsidian is the closest thing I&#39;ve found to the Pensive from Harry Potter. It&#39;s a data recording format good enough for me to extract thoughts from my mind, represent them with enough fidelity to reconstruct later, connect them to the concepts that they are related to in my head, and then forget the thought completely so I can move on and process it later.I was only willing to try it out because I had heard it mentioned [0] on CGP Grey&#39;s cohosted podcast, Cortex, in the episode they did on productivity software subcultures. Specifically I think CGP Grey was saying he didn&#39;t &#34;get&#34; Obsidian but had observed a fanatic fanbase around it of people who thought it was god&#39;s gift to note-taking because it represented the links between knowledge in a unique way. Apparently I&#39;m one of those people because I went from installing it for the first time to writing all my new thoughts down in it in the space of 3 days.I suspect the real reason I liked Obsidian right away is that long ago I used Microsoft Onenote as a freeform notetaking app to just spew unrelated thoughts into that I could organize later. Onenote&#39;s interface was good, but there was no way to port those notes in an exportable format to a new computer when the one with a Onenote license died.[0]https://www.reddit.com/r/CGPGrey/comments/ihkqjp/cortex_105_..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a note-taking power nerd who has used all the buzzy apps on Macs. Obsidian is by far the best — it&#39;s become my personal journal, my knowledge base, a quick and dirty blog, a place to keep loose notes.The development velocity of the (TWO PERSON!) team behind this app is ridiculous. They&#39;re constantly pushing updates, and seem to handle all facets of app development with aplomb.No affiliation, just a happy user!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Last year I bought I used TI for my daughter who needed it for school. I got her the oldest version, the one which takes AAA batteries and communicates with the outside world through a serial link. A project like this brings to mind the possibility of stuffing a Raspberry Pi Zero in the battery compartment, hooking it up to the school WiFi, using a terminal app on the calculator to communicate with the Pi and in that way voiding the whole reason of using these ancient beasts in the first place. I won&#39;t do this of course - she&#39;s there to learn other things besides refining the art of cheating [1] - but it would be a tempting hack. An even more elaborate hack would be to replace the guts of the thing with a Zero running a TI emulator as well as some more useful stuff like ssh. The possibilities are endless... so endless in fact that I&#39;m fairly certain this has been done already, somewhere.[1] which in my days at school consisted of writing the translated works of Homer on a 10x10cm piece of paper, a good way to a) learn to write incredibly small and b) get those words to stick inside your head long enough so you don&#39;t actually need to consult the cheat &#34;sheet&#34; during the test."</p>

After 15+ minutes and being transferred to two people, they can&#39;t answer a basic question about a rule they fined me for breaking that they can&#39;t even explain. They never emailed or called me back, which has been the behavior I have come to expect over the past nine years.I am serious, if you work for the city and have any way of applying my 13 month old payment to this license renewal, you have the gratitude of myself &amp; 14 of my employees who will get to continue paying their rents, mortgages, &amp; food bill for their kids.In spite of what people think, I am not a millionaire. If I&#39;m forced to close - I can&#39;t afford to pay these people. I do not want that to happen.I am not meming, I never get responses to DCA emails - not 3 months ago, not for NINE YEARS, and I don&#39;t expect to be able to now.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve met Louis in person, he&#39;s truly a standup guy with a heart of gold.  That said, he needs to pony up and get a lawyer.  Making petty arguments on YouTube isn&#39;t going to help you with bureaucracy it&#39;s only going to make things worse.  If government employees (state or otherwise) hate one thing, it&#39;s being called out point blank for how they either a) don&#39;t do their job or b) are effectively worthless.To be frank, I don&#39;t see why Louis hasn&#39;t left new york / the east coast yet.  I was unfortunate enough to move to NYC just in time for covid.  I still enjoyed my time in New York but I really understand a lot of what Louis has been saying about the city itself.  Subsequently I left.  He clearly hates the business climate, makes weekly videos about how much NYC sucks.  Maybe for his own health it&#39;s time to move to another state?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tell anyone who will listen: stay as far away from NYC and NYS as you can when you&#39;re operating a business. The bureaucracy is insanely complex and both governments harbor a very strong anti-business sentiment.NYS charged my previous, 2-person, zero employee agency a $14K fee for not having a Workers Comp policy, even though having one isn&#39;t necessary for member-managed businesses. We sent in paperwork demonstrating our case and they didn&#39;t care. They kept asking for more proof that we didn&#39;t have employees—even though they had no evidence that we did have them. A bit hard to prove a negative!After several years of back and forth, we finally just said forget it, closed that entity, and started ignoring the monthly shakedown notices. Now I&#39;m wary of even having clients in NYS.[Edit: I&#39;ve heard CA is similar, but don&#39;t have personal experience there.]"</p>

East of the continental divide, it gets about 10&#34; of rain per year, which is about a quarter of the US average.And with climate change, it is more precarious.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think the biggest problem copilot will have in practice gaining traction is that verifying correctness isn’t any faster than writing the code yourself in many cases. The Easter(y) function is a classic example - it would be way faster to write that than to try and verify that there’s no subtle bugs.Copilot is by design trying to give you something that _looks_ correct without caring whether it actually is - so it optimises for real-looking but subtly buggy code, which is the worst kind of broken code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m surprised that so much of the discussion around Copilot has centered around licensing rather than this.You&#39;re basically asking a robot that stayed up all night reading a billion lines of questionable source code to go on a massive LSD trip and then use the resulting fever dream to fill in your for loops.Coming from a hardware background where you often spend 2-8x of your time and money on verification vs. on the actual design, it seems obvious to me that Copilot as implemented today will either not provide any value (best case), will be a net negative (middling case), or will be a net negative, but you won&#39;t realize that you&#39;ve surrounded yourself with a minefield for a few years (worst case).Having an &#34;autocomplete&#34; that can suggest more lines of code isn&#39;t better, it&#39;s worse. You still have to read the result, figure out what it&#39;s doing, and figure out why it will or will not work. Figuring out that it won&#39;t work could be relatively straightforward, as it is today with normal &#34;here&#39;s a list of methods&#34; autocomplete. Or it could be spectacularly difficult, as it would be when Copilot decides to regurgitate &#34;fast inverse square root&#34; but with different constants. Do you really think you&#39;re going to be able to decipher and debug code like that repeatedly when you&#39;re tired? When it&#39;s a subtly broken block of code rather than a famous example?That Easter example looks horrific, but I can absolutely see a tired developer saying &#34;fuck it&#34; and committing it at the end of the day, fully intending to check it later, and then either forgetting or hoping that it won&#39;t be a problem rather than ruining the next morning by attempting to look at it again.I can&#39;t imagine ever using it, but I worry about new grads and junior developers thinking that they need to use crap like this because some thought leader praises it as the newest best practice. We already have too much modern development methodology bullshit that takes endless effort to stomp out, but this has the potential to be exceptionally disastrous.I can&#39;t help but think that the product itself must be a PSYOP-like attempt to gaslight the entire industry. It seems so obvious to me that people are going to commit more broken code via Copilot than ever before."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would hire copilot to write tests for me, that’s about it. Writing tests can be a drag. It’s really a low-risk proposition to have generated code attempt it. If it’s a usable test, maybe it will catch a bug. If not, then kill it and let it generate a few more.The expectation is entirely different than producing code. Code needs to be correct, secure, performant, and readable. Failure on any of those fronts can be expensive to disastrous. Nobody can reasonably expect a test suite to catch every bug, even if created by the smartest humans. If a copilot-created test does prevent a bug from shipping it provides immediate value. I could see it coming up with some whacky-but-useful test cases that a sane person might not consider. From a training perspective I would think that assertion descriptions contain more consistent lexical value than the average function signature.It seems like the ambitious data scientists, product marketers, and managers fell in love with a revolutionary idea about AI writing code, and neglected to consult the engineers they are trying to ‘augment’."</p>

I guess I don&#39;t have a good understanding on how these DRM checks are implemented in games in general."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There was an IMF video clip with BIS director Carstens commenting on CBDCs last year, https://meetings.imf.org/en/2020/Annual/Schedule/2020/10/19/...&gt; With cash, we don&#39;t know who is using the 100 dollar bill today ... a key difference with CBDC is that the central bank will have absolute control on the rules and regulations that determine the expression of that central bank liability .. also we will have the technology to enforce that ... if an advanced economy issues a CBDC, and someone in a 3rd country wants to use it, it will require the consent of the central bank of the residence of that person, therefore the degree of control will be far bigger.Video on the IMF site is not working, here&#39;s a YT copy (thanks @toomuchtodo): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVmKN4DSu3g&amp;t=1451sIn a March 2021 speech, Carstens made a similar point, https://www.bis.org/speeches/sp210331.pdf&gt; It is crucial to trace transactions, particularly large ones, to an individual or entity. For account-based CBDCs, issuing central banks would retain control over cross-border usage. Restricting non-residents’ access reduces the risk of volatile flows, and of currency substitution in recipient economies.Well-intentioned initiatives like Linux Foundation https://www.goodhealthpass.org/ or EU digital health certificate or Apple iOS 15 digital driver&#39;s license (https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/06/07/apples-ios-15-walle...) can all be drafted into the service of CBDC initiatives which require digital identity for digital currency wallets."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There’s another name for a central bank digital currency. It’s called “a bank account at the central bank”. Hardly Orwellian, but hardly innovative either.Traditional paper money is actually a zero interest bearer bond. Essentially a simple receipt for liabilities at the  central bank that can be passed around like an endorsed cheque.Since regulators have steadily been eliminating the abilities of cheques to act as promissory notes rather than bills of exchange for decades, it’s hardly surprising to see their next assault on the “bearer transfer process” of traditional paper money.The whole point is to change it from a promissory note to a bill of exchange at the very least."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Meanwhile, with regards to feedback on a digital Euro:&gt; In the light of the views expressed by the citizens during the public consultation, the EDPB stresses that a very high standard of privacy and data protection is crucial to reinforce the trust of end users and shall be considered as a distinctive element in the offering of digital euro, representing a key factor of success of the project.Footnote 9:&gt; A thresholded approach could be based on the monetary value of the transaction. For example, low value transaction of less than €1000 could enjoy full privacy as they are unlikely to entail AML high risks. Another possible limitation could cover use outside the Euro area.* https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2021-07/edpb_letter_out_...* https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27791789"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As someone who grew up in Eastern Europe in the early 2000s, with a a taste for Western media, especially movies, and the Internet becoming a widespread thing, it was infuriating waiting for movies to come to theaters months behind the rest of the world. Not to mention the horrible country specific posters and advertising, limited availability and titles. Piracy was the only option.It felt like the Internet would solve all these problems, like you&#39;d be able to experience culture from any part of the world however you liked and at the same time as the rest of the world. Sadly that never happened. It&#39;s much better now but it still feels like the media is crippled by old local distributor deals. The fact that e.g. Netflix offers different movies for every country is something that honestly does not make any sense yet everyone accepts it.When I got my first Kindle 12 years ago my Amazon account was registered with my local European address so the books available in store were all complete trash romance pulp novels. Once I simply changed my home address to some random location in New York I suddenly had access to hundreds of thousands more titles. The Internet never delivered on its promise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was born and raised in an African country. My father had a salary of 500$ a month. I could never afford a 50$ book about resiliency engineering or about Java Concurrency when I was 17 years old, neither could my father.The reason I love computer science and tech and excel at some parts of it, is simply because I could access any book, pirated. I have a huge will to learn, and piracy was quite literally the only means to learn. Once I worked and got on my feet, I started buying a lot of the books that marked my learning (because nostalgia and also great resources), and if and when I can, I always buys the books.Let&#39;s not talk about movies. My town STILL has no cinema. Nearest one is 100Km away, and costs about 15$ for a ticket. So if it wasn&#39;t for piracy, I would&#39;ve probably never watched Iron Man, and never dreamed of having my own Jarvis, and hence never taking up speech recognition and deep learning. Again, now that I can, I had periods where I watched 3 to 5 movies a week in the cinema, because I have the means to.I believe people are more likely to buy books/movies when they can. But for those who can&#39;t, I believe it&#39;s almost always a net positive to society to give them access to those resources."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I grew up poor in Eastern Europe. Very poor, in fact. Without piracy I probably wouldn’t ever have been able to learn English, find my passion and make it in life. And not just for monetary reasons but due to access as well. Ironically enough the Internet never mattered too much because we were able to get what we wanted hand to hand. The 56k modem was completely useless when your friend had a zip drive with the games you drooled over. But it taught me to appreciate things. Even today I love physical copies of things, it is like a little trophy to the thing I love.My biggest problem nowadays is not that I can’t afford the things I love but that there is hardly anything I actually want. But when I do I often get multiple copies, whether it is on different platforms or to share the joy with friends.That being said the effects of piracy are both severe and negligible due to the quality. While it probably doesn’t affect big corporations at all, the small indie people sometimes suffer catastrophically from it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have been in the aquarium hobby in the past, so when I started looking into hydroponics, for me the natural outcome was to also look into aquaponics[1].What I like the most about aquaponics (and recirculating hydroponics) is the sustainability aspects, it is an almost completely closed-loop system, with relatively small external inputs compared to other farming methods, and extremely small water requirements (due to the fact that water is continuously recycled).Two bits of info about aquaponics that not many people know:1. it is possible to have aquaponics systems in a vegetarian context: in many cases the fish is not for human consumption as food (in large commercial systems this is usually koi that is sold as ornamental fish[2a], in smaller systems goldfish kept as pets[2b]).2. there are aquaponics systems that don&#39;t require access to electricity, in particular the iAVS system (a.k.a &#34;sandponics&#34;) was developed with subsistence farmers that had no electricity access in mind, it doesn&#39;t require water to be pumped continuously, rather you are only required to manually recirculate the water a few times a day which can be achieved with a bucket or other low tech solutions[3].[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaponics[2a] https://www.pvrkoicentre.com/pages/aquaponics[2b] https://farmingaquaponics.com/caring-for-goldfish-in-aquapon...[3] https://garydonaldson.net/home/iavs/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is obviously nothing less than astounding. I can’t start to describe how incredibly knowledgeable and skilled this person is.Because the topic of hydro and growing food and all that is on HN here, I wanted to leave the following comment on a higher level.Ten years ago I was super dedicated to problems surrounding water, which of course include food and all the issues we have with our food systems. At the pinnacle, I was working with a half acre aquaponics greenhouse in Watsonville, CA. We had 8000 striped bass and produced and incredible amount of fresh produce. It was pesticide free because of you put chemicals on the plants it would get into the water and hurt the fish.It was more “natural” than hydroponics. You weren’t using fertilizer imported from all over, everything in the system could be produced on-site. The more biologically diverse the system was, the more resilient and productive.Both hydro and aqua phonics - the latter of which has been practiced for thousands of years, definitely save a ton of water. But I think aquaponics has a massive chance of being mainstream, especially as automation and all the advanced tech and robots get better.It’s about ecological engineering on a local scale - you are maxing out the ecology to human and nature’s benefit, and there are so many relationships to learn and exploit.It’s strange how impactful this could be on a grand scale - see some Dan barber Ted talks [1]Just really need to get some investment on this on a big scale, like the hydro houses in Canada. No one has, from all that I know, really built aquaponic systems on a grand scale that are economically viable. But I see it coming and after I wrap up my current company, I’m jumping right back in to working on this.We are just going to be doing what nature did best before we murdered all of it…but maybe Mac it out super hard and super quick compared to what it could do.Lastly, with all the climate stuff: Don’t forget, you can’t put a price on the systems that produce the food, water and clean air we breath, cuz you know, we’d be dead. Well maybe we can, but we sure aren’t trying.[1] https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_barber_how_i_fell_in_love_with..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hydro doesn’t taste as good as organic, and it needs to be flushed or you ingest a lot of nitrates, which is likely carcinogenic. Flushing requires careful planning and a system designed for it. You can’t just treat it like a fridge full of food. With soil you can just leave stuff in the ground until you want to eat it.I’ve poured a lot of time and money into the hobby, and have settled on organic soil with some simple drip for indoor growing.The water use is about the same. As long as you’re indoor the water has nowhere to runoff/evaporate to.IMO the benefits of hydro/Aquaponics are nonexistent. Also, the whole system is a pile of plastics. The tote and drain pipe in the linked article are not food grade plastic, which would scare me away from this system.The automation is way way way overkill. Hydro is very easy to tweak. The nutrient profile is a tiny percentage of the labor, and a $3 battery operated temp/humidity display is plenty for keeping things nice for the plants. They show the high and low since last reset, which is all you need.If I had any outdoor space with good sun I would set up a greenhouse, but since I don’t have that I run leds directly off of solar panels on my roof (dc-dc step ups and downs as needed).Kind of cool to see them rise and set with the sun."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently bought a set of 360 watt panels from LG and not more than a couple months later they came about with 400 watt panels in the same form factor (40” x 66”).  Even though that can be frustrating, I am glad the tech is improving at a good clip.While we wait for sorely needed battery cost reductions, it’s good to look at areas where we can ‘make hay while the sun is shining’.  For example, train ML models during sunny days.  Other industries might be aluminum, desalination, ice making (i.e. cooling), and other production (ideas welcome)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hope these get cheap enough that every house in the tropics gets them on their rooves. AC is going to become essential as temperatures rise, the grid can&#39;t support the load, and we can&#39;t afford to power all those ACs with fossil fuel. Solar powered AC seems like the most reliable way to survive a severe heatwave like the one described in the opening chapter of The Ministry of the Future: https://www.orbitbooks.net/orbit-excerpts/the-ministry-for-t...You can&#39;t rely on the underprovisioned grid in a scenario like that, especially since the heatwave will likely drive the power plants themselves out of their operating range. Solar seems like the only way. Its intermittency is a problem on general, but clouds that would disrupt the power would also stop the heat."</p>

I think the product is great, but batteries are consumable products. In fact, I would hope that one day it would be mandatory to offer battery replacements for all products you sell.

I&#39;d love clear or forest green or deep purple.Watching a few air pod tear down videos, I find it weird the battery itself isn&#39;t part of the case. Like just use white instead of black. Have the barrel twist lock into place. Makes the battery replaceable. And that extra millimeter of diameter would probably be 50% more mAh.I know replaceable batteries is un-Apple.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A company which only hires junior developers is not a company that values quality development practices and it cannot expect to get stuff done on time, let alone with high quality and industry&#39;s best practices... not that junior developers cannot be good (with proper guidance they can be awesome), but without experienced people around to guide them, and without them having experience of their own, they are bound to make every possible mistake in the book no matter how smart.The people running the company were playing with fire and they must either be too junior themselves to understand that, or they were just knowingly doing so and hoping to get whatever product MVP they had planned as quickly as possible with the minimum amount of expenses possible.Don&#39;t feel bad for being fired from such a company. It might have been the best thing to happen to you because now you get the opportunity of getting a proper job where you might actually have experienced people to mentor you and  help you become a great developer and professional.With that said: next time a CTO asks you to create something in a month for a demo, just go ahead and implement a mock (no DB, no error handling, just happy path code) that&#39;s just about enough for the demo, nothing else. Make it clear to the person who is going to run the demo that this is not the real deal, and arrange for only the happy path to be followed in the demo (add a few safeguards just in case so if the person does something unexpected you just ignore it, never crash!). You could have probably pulled that off in a couple of days :D but yeah, you probably thought you needed to have the real final product ready otherwise it wouldn&#39;t be demo-able... Trust me, that&#39;s almost certainly not the case."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a similar story but since it wasn&#39;t an internship and I had about 5 years experience in far better companies, I reacted with relief that I got out. I only stayed in the company for 2 weeks in which the CEO and his wife, who was the COO, yelled at me multiple times. I was yelled at for not understanding the code base and delivering a feature within 3 days of joining, trying to relax in my chair when they were talking, using their stash of tissue paper cause they didn&#39;t bother keeping some in the bathroom for wiping your hands etc. In retrospect I wonder how I even got through those 2 weeks without quitting on the second day. I just stopped showing up and the CEO came to my house, banged on my door to try and get me to delete their crappy code written by a mountain of interns from my personal laptop. I pretended I wasn&#39;t home and we later had a call where I deleted it all. I also wasn&#39;t paid for the time I worked there. Everyone who wasn&#39;t me was pretty much an intern writing awful code because they really didn&#39;t know any betterUnlike here I have no qualms about naming and shaming praktice.ai"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It doesn&#39;t sound like the writer was fired for doing her job. It sounds like she did a really good job, given the circumstances, and that her bosses used two pretty quintessential management techniques - deadlines and negging - to motivate her and her colleagues to outperform.But this demo - her bosses ran out of money, and even if the text field did work, but they didn&#39;t get the money from this investor, they were going to be fired.That aside, as other commenters have noted, junior developers need instruction. That&#39;s easy to say if you&#39;re Facebook, and every 22 year old you hire is &#34;junior&#34; but also went to Harvard. They&#39;re not really the same kind of &#34;junior&#34; as the 50th percentile 22 year old college graduate. In my experience Facebook hires these &#34;junior&#34; developers because they thrive despite receiving little to no meaningful instruction - as if &#34;code reviews&#34; or a month of onboarding on Mercurial really teach anyone anything. The small startup is gambling that maybe they can find these 22 year olds that Facebook has missed, which is a reasonable gamble, there are a lot that were missed. But it was never about finding someone who needed instruction.Also, it&#39;s never been my experience that paying bad developers more money made them better. Paying good developers more money does. It&#39;s tough."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have been programming since 1977/78, and sometimes for work, but most of the time for fun. As someone who does technical work at heights with rope access, and many years of technical diving on hydraulics, pneumatic, and electrical equipment, I can say it all depends on your ability to shut out interruptions and get to a good stopping point. I get frustrated when I am programming and I am interrupted, but my most frustrating experience was troubleshooting a technical issue at heights, underwater, or on the deck during a show with almost 2000 patrons getting impatient, while a COO/CFO wants an estimate on when you will solve the as-yet-unidentified issue. They call the show off if you can&#39;t get an estimate to repair or resume after 15 min. and they expect you to hold to your time-to-repair or resume estimate. Oh, and half a million to one million USD are at stake! You might be standing in front of a controls cabinet with hundreds of wires and devices and some indications of where to look, or 10m underwater trying to find a source of the fault. I think interruptions suck for any person who is focused on doing a good job - bus drivers, pilots (yes, I know - autopilot!), soldiers in combat, air traffic controllers, chefs, almost any job. This is why I never took a job coding full time. It is always secondary to my actual job even if it is important. And, I like J and APL for the very reason that you are looking at a few lines of code vs. a few pages of for loops ;)I code in C and other languages as well, so no offense to those who work mainly with scalars ;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The example I like to use is sudoku. Often, after a day of programming, it takes me a while to &#34;come out of it&#34; and I explain that to my SO as if she&#39;d been doing hours of sudoku and then had to jump into a social situation.Similarly, if you are interrupted in the middle of a &#34;solve&#34; it may be difficult to jump back in - especially if the puzzle hasn&#39;t been created correctly and you are trying to &#34;debug&#34; which numbers conflict. Some puzzles are harder than others. At times you don&#39;t have a pen and paper so you have to keep a mental model of the whole puzzle in your head which makes an interruption that much more jarring.Not a perfect analogy, but close enough to get me a 15 minute buffer at the end of the day and fewer knocks on the office door :D"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interruptions are very challenging with any deep work that takes hours. This is true.What I am facing however, is a related issue. Perhaps because I have not been doing much programming lately, I find it increasingly difficult to actually get and be in the zone. When I go in, I go all in, and enter a kind of fugue state where the hours slip away. While for some this may sound advantageous, in the past, it has been associated with some bad physical and psychological health outcomes. Now, I actually have anxiety about going into such a state, and try to piece meal my problems, and focus on the non-programming work and thinking.Situations change, and I am about to be in one where I do really need to perform a lot of coding myself. I suppose I am answering my own question, but I need to split up my work and take notes to reduce the numbers of abstracted layers upon which I am working. Take more breaks with confidence I can return.I suspect this technique can help ease the burdens of interruptions as well, but it does come at a cost in time. For me, the severe crunch time requirements and gained insane last minute skills should still be less necessary for some time. This is likely called being in a startup and getting older and, well, recognizing long-term limitations."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We really need an alternative to YouTube. But&gt; When you publish with Streambus, you create a website, on your own domain name. Reach your audience over RSS on the podcast apps they already have on their phone.This is the problem with most other current alternatives: no discoverability. YouTube has no serious competitors because it has significantly more viewers and creators. If I use Streambus, how will I get others to see my content? If I want to find new stuff on Streambus, where do I see others&#39; streams?IMO any serious contender for YouTube would need:- People using it
- Decent recommendation algorithm - for all the hate YouTube gets, I&#39;ve seen worse
- Decent moderation. YouTube is too severe, yes, but you really don&#39;t want hate speech and shady stuff on your site, and especially recommended. It will scare everyone away. And copyrighted stuff will get you into legal trouble"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not sure how well known it is, but YouTube itself has an RSS feed for each channel (well, Atom feed, most feed readers treat them interchangeably).https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=XXWhere XX is the channel ID (the last component in the URL when you go to a channel).It&#39;s actually how I consume YouTube these days.  It&#39;s a slightly orthogonal problem to the solution posted here, since it doesn&#39;t follow the RSS &#34;enclosure&#34; spec.  Though my feedreader knows enough to call youtube-dl on these URLs, which is fragile at best, but works for me."</p>

The root cause of this appears to be because some glyphs are bigger than the 5px by 11px bounding box, causing most terminals to think a much bigger box is necessary for the general ASCII glyphs.&gt; In order to fix this issue, I manually hand painted all the glyphs from the &#39;creep&#39; font in fontforge.Awesome!

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I read on many different sites that AMD’s current CPUs beat Intel’s CPUs in terms of performance per watt. We can better achieve goals 2 and 3 (low noise and low power usage) by using fewer watts, so we’ll pick an AMD CPU and mainboard for this build.Unfortunately many reviews are very misleading here. Zen 2/3 CPUs have good performance per Watt, that&#39;s true. But for a machine like this, which will be mostly idle, this is not the interesting metric and Zen 2/3 systems show that you can combine good perf/W with poor idle power consumption (which is not true for their monolithic APU brethren, which are used in laptops).One of the biggest idle power hogs for these is the IO die, so make sure that XMP is disabled and the memory uses one of the slow JEDEC timings. This should be fine for a router. Check that the SoC/NB voltage is set to 1 V or less. Some boards set this higher. In the AMD CBS section of the board firmware there should be an item &#34;SoC OC Mode&#34; somewhere. Disable it. Some boards allow you to set a new PPT (package power target), but it&#39;s worth pointing out that values which are too low will make the CPU very slow because it essentially forces all cores to very low power states in order to meet the PPT since the CPU can&#39;t influence the baseline power (due to fabric and I/O die). The upside of using a reasonable PPT of e.g. 50-60 W is that you reduce power consumption if some errant task hogs the CPU.These settings make a big difference, but only if the CPU is really idle. Even fairly light loads (e.g. on a desktop, moving the mouse on the background) has everything rev up. In deep idle (nothing running at all, no user interaction on a desktop) you might get a Zen 2/3 CPU down to around 20 Watts, but as soon as anything is happening at all we&#39;re straight back to the 40-70 W region.Using an Intel system for this would have likely saved 10-20 W."</p>

X470 supports CPUs which have PCIe 3.0 and a board with x8/x8 mode like the ROG Strix X470-F https://www.asus.com/microsite/motherboard/AMD-X470/ should work just fine (and has no fan)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think the problem of this essay is that it&#39;s overly technical: only those versed well enough in SQL will really care to read the whole thing, and if they are already at that level, either they accepted that &#34;SQL will get the job done in the end&#34;, or they learned to live along it and now even kinda embrace it, and are happy to write about how the examples are very poor and dismiss the critique based on that, when the essay kinda explains it main point pretty well:&gt;&gt; The core message [...] is that there is potentially a huge amount of value to be unlocked by replacing SQLTo me, a lot of people defends SQL saying that &#34;perfect is the enemy of good&#34; and that SQL simply works. Not the favourite of anyone, but everyone kinda accepts it.And yeah, it&#39;s true. People use SQL because it&#39;s good enough, and trying to reinvent the wheel would take more work (individually speaking) than just dealing with SQL as it is right now. For large organizations where the effort could be justified, all your engineers already know SQL anyway, so it&#39;s not so great either.But for something so relevant as relational databases, perfect is not the enemy of good. We do deserve better. We generally agree that SQL has many pitfalls, it&#39;s not great for any kind of user (for non-technical users, a visual programming language would work well here, more like what Airtable does, closing the bridge between spreadsheet and hardcore database, and for technical users, it does feel unwieldy and quirky). We should be more open to at least consider critiques and proposals for better. We might find out that people, from time to time, are making some good points."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder how much of the limitation are necessary in order for the query optimizer to have any chance at finding a good execution plan. As you add more and more abstractions and more and more general computations in the middle of your queries, it will probably become harder and harder for the query optimizer to understand what you are actually trying to do and figure out how to do it efficiently. Are you not running the risk that the database will have to blindly scan through entire tables calling your user defined functions as black boxes on each row?I would also guess that we could have a better SQL but I do not think it could and should look anything like a general purpose programming language because otherwise you might get in the way of efficient query execution. Maybe some kind of declarative data flow description with sufficient facilities to name and reuse bits and pieces.And maybe you actually want two languages which SQL with its procedural parts already kind of has. One limited but well optimizable language to actually access the data, one more general language to perform additional processing without having to leave the server. Maybe the real problem of SQL lies mostly in its procedural part and how it interfaces and interacts with the query part."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like most frustrations with SQL boil down to fighting against a shitty schema.When you are sitting in a properly normalized database, it is a lot easier to write joins and views such that you can compose higher order queries on top.If you are doing any sort of self-joins or other recursive/case madness, the SQL itself is typically not the problem. Whoever sat down with the business experts on day 1 in that conference room probably got the relational model wrong and they are ultimately to blame for your suffering.If you have an opportunity to start over on a schema, don&#39;t try to do it in the database the first few times. Build it in excel and kick it around with the stakeholders for a few weeks. Once 100% of the participants are comfortable and understand why things are structured (related) the way they are, you can then proceed with the prototype implementation.Achieving 3NF or better is usually a fundamental requirement for ensuring any meaningfully-complex schema doesn&#39;t go off the rails over time.Only after you get it correct (facts/types/relations) should you even think about what performance issues might arise from what you just modeled. Premature optimization is how you end up screwing yourself really badly 99% of the time. Model it correctly, then consider an optimization pass if performance cannot be reconciled with basic indexing or application-level batching/caching."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Maybe it&#39;s just me, but I dislike the whole concept of advertising in places that aren&#39;t related to shopping. I go to Instagram to look at my friends&#39; pictures, not to be sold something I don&#39;t actually need. If I were to shop, I&#39;d go to a mall, thank you very much.Anyway, at some point Instagram ads (especially the autoplaying video kind, with sound) drove me crazy enough that out came jadx and apktool and I found a beautiful way to inject my own code into Instagram&#39;s networking. The code I injected rewrites the API responses before the rest of the app sees them. I can now scroll through my feed without annoying salesmen begging for my attention. I&#39;ve also enabled a &#34;secret&#34; debugging menu while at it, where there are manual overrides for server-side settings, and there are at least several hundred of them — it&#39;s a bit creepy what they&#39;re A/B testing, like slightly different wording or different button colors.The only problem that still remains is that the feed is still algorithmic, and there&#39;s nothing that could be done with that with client patches."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t use Instagram much, but I am on Facebook too often. The limitations of the advertising algorithms are very interesting to me. For example: I participate in ex-evangelical groups because of my childhood experiences. Also follow pages which discuss American Christianity from a secular or journalistic perspective, and in Christian groups which interpret their beliefs from a left-ish ideology. &#34;Liking&#34; any post from those groups will trigger an onslaught of ads almost exclusively for conservative churches and conservative organizations.The algorithms can&#39;t differentiate between &#34;pro&#34;, &#34;anti&#34;, and &#34;observer&#34; on a particular topic. Nor does it seem to have any awareness of ideology. It&#39;s very rare when I see progressive churches advertise.I understand that the algorithms are going to have difficulty with subtleties. But I&#39;d think they&#39;d still have some rough awareness about &#34;anti&#34; vs. &#34;pro&#34;. And thus not flood people who dislike a thing with ads promoting the thing.At any rate, I suppose it&#39;s oddly reassuring Facebook is so inaccurate. Judging by the high number of critical comments on the religious ads, there are many uninterested people being targeted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I get great ads on Instagram. Generally, they’re niche products related to my interests from small companies I’ve never heard of before.Yes, there’s a few misses, but it’s way better than the absolute scum-sucking garbage I see elsewhere on the internet from other ad networks. “Doctor shares one weird trick for emptying your bowels every morning”, “Alan Greenspan tells you what to buy instead of Litecoin”, and similar.However, I don’t really use Instagram to connect with people I know. I follow a bunch of accounts related to my hobbies and interests. That probably primes the ad-targeting pump a lot better than if I was just following my friends and family on there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wait there are sooo many more edge cases of percentages! When this article finished I think it should be half way through or even one third of 100% weirdness.Examples: with flexbox and/or tables, 100% behaves differently. What about 100% vs 100vh/vw? This would be very nice to show here as well. As others note, background-position or background-size. Collapsing margins might be interesting, but probably not the best fit for this example. How other types of `display` interact with the 100% (e.g. `inline` just ignores it). As it&#39;s just very briefly touched, but how box-sizing affects the height/width. SVGs viewBox, canvas, hiding navbars on mobile, body&#39;s default width/height, the trick of `width: 100%; max-width: 1200px; margin: 0 auto;`, etc. there&#39;s such a vast amount of topics relating/breaking the concept of 100% in CSS that it&#39;s mind-numbing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked on this problem for just over a decade before moving onto other things. It’s a tough problem to solve.The biggest problem I ran into is that the largest segment of user growth were too fickle. They wanted all kinds of magic in new optional features for their personal preferences that took incredible effort. I lacked the analytics to see who used which exotic features. Most of these people just wanted a beautifier more that a diff tool and would drop you in a heartbeat for more popular tools that wouldn’t do what they wanted but were popular.The tool I wrote did have a strong following mostly around markup language parsing that was not at all exotic but solved problems other tools refused to approach.My guidance is don’t become a code beautifier. In the languages I was supporting during the time frame I was supporting this code beautifiers were all the rage. Nobody seemed to want a diff tool with extra capabilities. Stick to being a diff tool. The people that are intentionally looking for intelligent diff tools tend to be more engineering focused and make for a loyal audience. People looking for code vanity are just the same as window shoppers walking down a street."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Surely far from being as elaborate as the linked tool, but I use the following git command a few dozen times daily:  git diff --word-diff=color --word-diff-regex=&#39;\w+&#39;

I added two aliases to my .gitconfig, one for diff and one for show:  [alias]
    word-show = show --word-diff=color --word-diff-regex=&#39;\\w+&#39;
    word-diff = diff --word-diff=color --word-diff-regex=&#39;\\w+&#39;

Those small things improved development and reviewing a lot for me!If stuff moved around or got it&#39;s indentation changed I either add `--color-moved` and/or `-w` (ignore whitespace changes) flags to filter out extra noise.Sometimes I need to use another regex though, e.g. a simple dot `.` for match all with no greedy +"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Been hoping for more of this for years. We stare at diffs all day yet we have to accommodate the computer by understanding that the parenthesis it claims was changed wasn’t actually changed, there was just another set of parentheses added. There’s of course limits to how much a diff tool can extract meaning from two pieces of content, but structure and perhaps even heuristics like “new function was added here, maybe the curly brace belongs with that and not the old function” would certainly help."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reminds me of something.I used to work with a senior guy who went freelance and then bunched together with several other freelancers, also seniors, to form... &#34;an operation&#34;. The MO was that one of them would go and interview for a permanent job, impress the heck out of everyone and then say &#34;there&#39;s more like me, be happy to help you out, but on a contract basis and as a group.&#34; They were basically bait-n-switching them to outsource parts of their development and in some cases it worked, because their fees were very reasonable. And the fees were reasonable because they did very little of the actual work themselves and instead re-outsourced it to some Ukranain dudes.Looked fishy as fuck and I&#39;m not sure how it ended because I felt out of touch with the guy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds me of this threat model:Long term moles at a company, able to climb high and perform well due to remote work which enables:- never really meeting the mole- the “mole” is a superstar because they have a team of corporate raider-employed 10x’ers evaluating and executing everything that this mole does at work. The mole’s code is written by 3x MIT grads hot swapping on the keyboard. The mole’s biz ideas come from a few HBS grads. And so on.Productivity, business intuition, and engineering talent is off the charts for this mole. It rises far enough in the hierarchy such that it maneuvers the company towards favorable action for that corporate raider. Every idea the mole suggests, the corporate raider works in the background to enable via favorable market conditions.  Whoever is the public face of the mole’a reputation might be in flames if found out, but what’s that vs netting 3% of a corporate buyout valuation."</p>

Every developer secretly works for them on the side.But no one anywhere ever talks about it until one day a former consultant notices an expired NDA."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just to throw it out there, I graduated during the pandemic, and it was so frustrating not only the amount of cheating that occurred, which meant that if you didn&#39;t cheat you fell behind; but also how professors responded. I had a few professors who made exams ridiculously hard with strict time limits, just because they expected people to cheat. So the exams were designed in a way they cheating was the only way to get through it, which just encouraged more people to cheat. Not to say every person cheated, or every professor designed tests to be harder, but both groups were larger than you&#39;d expect.The good news is I think that with classes being in person again things will go relatively back to normal. Honestly I don&#39;t think I can fault students who cheated during the pandemic, it was just so abnormal that most people did whatever they had to to cope."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We employed the method of mixing the order of questions, not giving question titles, and having a pool of subtly different questions (a negation or a different constant slipped in) in order to vastly increase the amount of necessary communication to collaborate.We had the students turn on their webcams just to discourage them sitting in the same room, which basically would negate our former efforts. Neither did we flag any behavior nor did we record anything or used some automatic software.I believe that worked quite nicely. A few cheaters were easily spotted when they had the wrong constants in their answer.I understand that not every course and exam style is suitable for that. But for our databases course, it was applicable.I think that this was not much more invasive than a traditional exam. Anything more, like watching the screen, or having audio, would make me feel uncomfortable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Imagine a business that sells deliverable medical testing kits. This business is the best at what they do; they sell more kits than any other organization, they cost less, they&#39;re delivered faster, and are superior in any way, shape, KPI, or form imaginable to traditional alternatives. The only issue being that each kit is in fact a bloodletting kit, and their intended use is to inform you which of your four humours is out of balance.I&#39;m of the opinion that e-proctoring, whatever its privacy concerns, is fundamentally an exercise in &#34;doing the wrong thing faster&#34;. Our exams are a poor reflection of student ability. Our exams have no bearing on actual proficiency in the subject matter. Our exams are ineffectual at catching cheaters. Leaving aside any discussion of privacy, e-proctoring (and traditional proctoring) fails to accomplish its fundamental goals.To automate these exams, to make them ever-more scalable and easier to distribute, is not a victory. We&#39;ve merely perpetuated a flawed system.If we want a meaningful assessment of student ability then we need to use better methods. Dethrone exams from our curriculum. Leverage project-based assessments. Use oral exams where feasible. Replace the infinitely looping lecture halls with recorded videos and open-source textbooks. Use the recovered instructor time for something meaningful. This is not a Gordian knot. It can be solved with a little courage and a little pragmatism."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27770302"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Of course he would. He was a regular hacker. If you&#39;ve read Steve Jobs&#39; biographies they all describe Woz wanting to keep things open and hackable and Jobs pushing through for the vertical integration they have now. Woz made the altruistic decision most of us would&#39;ve &#34;preferred&#34; but Jobs made the decision to create the most valuable company in the world instead. Hard to say who was right, really."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Woz also got into hacking about computers at an ideal time. Not long before then it would have been impossible to build a sophisticated computer in your garage. Years later, miniaturization has continued to progress and many things that were once relatively simple to replace have become much harder.When most parts on a computer were through-hole components and relatively large integrated circuits that could easily be hand soldered, the skill required to participate in the repair process was much lower. Today, even relatively open hardware like a desktop PC has a ton of added complexity that would make people far less likely to ever want to attempt a repair on their own. While I&#39;ve reflowed solder on a faulty GPU in the oven before, that&#39;s not exactly a good idea. A person is usually going to replace the things that have been component-ized like the RAM, GPU, SSD, motherboard, etc. rather than try to actually repair them.Granted, when a component like that breaks on a PC you can just pop it open and replace it, rather than having to find a specialist to repair a laptop or phone where all the parts are glued in or soldered. While I can sympathize with people that do want that (there are projects out there trying to bring products in this category to market), I&#39;m personally okay with that being the niche that it is. Most people didn&#39;t hack their computers back then and to this day most people don&#39;t hack on their computers.There probably should be components available for experts like Louis Rossman who can replace these parts. There probably should be schematics available so they can more easily make these repairs and they can have businesses like his who can specialize in doing these sorts of repairs (they already do exist, clearly). Companies like Apple absolutely should not be using any sort of DRM to prevent use of third party hardware components in repairs. Going out of your way to make your devices difficult to repair is unethical. But I think we&#39;re well past the point that someone without specialized skills should be able to expect to repair any device that they purchase."</p>

And I find the photo quite cool.I think she is just overly susceptible, and maybe a little bit paranoid (which is understandable for a person with enemies as powerful as hers).This reminds me of the time when a russian entomologist named a new wasp species he discovered after her in her honor, and she took offense because the wasp was a parasite species, and blocked sci-hub in Russia for a few days in retaliation !edit: sci-hub was blocked only a few days, not months, my memory failed me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having worked as a researcher all my life in academia and the industry, I can only support Sci-Hub. Publishing as it works currently is an incredibly time consuming and expensive process funneling tremendous amounts of tax money into the pocḱets of publishers.To some extent the whole situation reminds me of the video and music content piracy era in the early 2000s. I hope there will be an equivalent of Apple Music/Spotify/Netflix for scientific papers in the near future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So no new articles have been uploaded this year.While I have relatively good access options through my university, roughly half of the publications appearing in my Google Scholar alerts are unaccessible. As they are also in fields were use of preprint services isn&#39;t common, it really interferes with me being up to date with ongoing research.As the use of sci-hub is so common, I wonder about the wider implications of the newest articles being inaccessible. Could bibliometric methods be used to quantify this? Missed citations? Less citations for articles published in more obscure journals?Interesting that no new solutions have come out yet. I&#39;m seeing people getting back to use #ICanHazPDF - not the best way to conduct research when an article is often just a gateway to more finding more relevant articles to read."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think its too easy to get a patent, and that leads to a great proliferation of patents that serve little purpose but to slow innovation.I worked at a patent law firm about 15 years ago in my wild youth. I’ll never forget hearing an attorney explain that getting a patent is basically bullying the examiner, and if that doesn’t work, appealing repeatedly until it’s eventually accepted.Are there statistics of the number of patent applications rejected? Even better, I would love to see the number of patent applications filed by the Apple computer corporation, and how many were accepted, and how many were rejected.Edit: Autocorrect error."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sixteen years ago, I had the idea for headlights aimed by GPS and started to make some prototypes. Then I read a patent that was basically &#34;a plurality of inputs + processor -&gt; headlight aiming&#34; that covered everything imaginable. I knew the patent wouldn&#39;t hold up in court, but I wouldn&#39;t have the money to fight it.More recently, I&#39;ve been working on a self-driving wheelchair. It&#39;s a fairly obvious straight line from self-driving car to self-driving wheelchair, but someone&#39;s gone out and patented it.  I still don&#39;t have the money to fight it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the OP:&gt;&gt; The study particularly wants to find examples of where a patent has been denied in the US but accepted in other jurisdictions, which will be a key area for European electronics companies.The question at hand does not seem to be what the title of the OP indicates, but rather about patent applications denied in the US but approved elsewhere.  Looking briefly at [1] too is hinting that the interest may rather be to relax the patent eligibility criteria so that more of patent applications in the US are approved.  Note:  IANAL.---[1] https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/07/09/2021-14...Excerpts:  &#34;Last year, after a split panel decision concluding that a method for manufacturing drive shafts was patent ineligible, ... The questions presented in the petition are: (1) What is the appropriate standard for determining whether a claim is directed to a patent-ineligible concept under step one of the Alice two-step framework?; and (2) Is patent eligibility a question of law for the court or a question of fact for the jury? ... The Senators indicated a particular interest in learning how the current jurisprudence has adversely impacted investment and innovation in critical technologies like quantum computing, artificial intelligence,[6] precision medicine, diagnostic methods, and pharmaceutical treatments.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The big question here is how Senior Google executive Urs Hölzle managed to get a &#34;remote work visa&#34; from the government of New Zealand. It reminds me of the &#34;special treatment&#34; that Peter Thiel got, where he got New Zealand citizenship after spending only 12 days in New Zealand [1].It is almost non-existent in the western world to be able to get a remote-work visa (minus Croatia and Czech Republic--both countries are part of the European Union and therefore become &#34;westernized&#34; quickly after accession).Yes, you can technically get _self-employment_, non-remote work visas in many European Union countries. But, the point and intent of such visas is that you contribute to their economy, assimilate, learn the local language, and eventually become a functioning contributing citizen in their society.The hypocrisy of the situation around remote work makes me angry, as I am disabled and I require remote work as an accommodation. I have 2 rare immune-mediated neurological diseases affecting my peripheral nervous system, plus type 1 diabetes (autoimmune and insulin-dependent).I should also point out something else unfair. I am a dual US|EU (Croatian) citizen who works part-time remotely as a contractor for a US-based company in Croatia, while studying for her masters degree in electrical engineering full time. Because I am an EU citizen, I can work in 30+ countries remotely, outside of the United States, while essentially getting paid more (compared to the locals and most other European Union citizens) for just having US citizenship and related credentials. I basically live like a queen in Croatia.[1] https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/29/new-zealand-ga..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I never understood the secretive nature of these Amazon &#34;devplan&#34; / &#34;FOCUS&#34; lists. If an employee has a performance issue, they should know. Period. If they are on a formal list, they should know that too.The only &#34;positive&#34; here is that it can affect the individual&#39;s moral to know you are not meeting expectations - but that has to be communicated regardless. If it&#39;s understood it has to be communicated and there is a list specifically including the individual, it&#39;s up to the company to manage that communication in a supportive manner.And the consequences of this secretive list are a culture of fear and uncertainty and doubt. Especially with the harsh consequences such as - if you leave while on this secretive list (which you cannot even know you are on) - you are ineligible for rehire.The solution is not to maintain a secretive list of employees who have performance issues - it is to be fully transparent about those performance issues and destigmatize being included in this nebulous secretive list in the first place - through a culture of support and shared success.Honestly it boggles my mind how Amazon managers accept this status quo at the scale that Amazon operates. It is so on it&#39;s face a recipe for having a toxic culture which breeds stress, doubt, and only serves to reinforce poor performance outcomes.Out of all the things I&#39;ve heard about Amazon culture for its software organization - this single thing (secretive lists of employees with performance issues with &#34;never rehire&#34; consequences that employees can&#39;t even understand they are on) symbolizes for me all the reasons I would avoid them as an employer. There is no way to have this process without creating a toxic culture."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “Should I tell an employee that I entered them into Focus?” the question reads. The response: “Do not discuss Focus with employees. Instead, tell the employee that their performance is not meeting expectations, the specific areas where they need to improve, and offer feedback and support to help them improve.”The headline is editorialized. IMO whether you’re told you’re in Focus or not is irrelevant. If your manager is telling you you’re not meeting expectations, that’s plenty of signal of what’s going on.The discussion in this thread is written more as if Amazon is pushing out capable talent.There’s a more fundamental question - are we saying once you get hired, your job should be permanent, regardless of your performance?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Donald Knuth&#39;s The Art of Computer Programming has, in its first volume, a lengthy section on simulating an elevator. It is a single regular elevator (nothing &#34;special&#34; going on as in the post here), but even so, as he tries to make things precise, you realize how much detail is involved, and get some appreciation for the task of programming.It occupies about 15 pages (plus several pages of exercises and solutions). Knuth started working on TAOCP when he was a PhD student at Caltech:&gt; The program developed below simulates the elevator system in the Mathematics building of the California Institute of Technology. The results of such a simulation will perhaps be of use only to people who make reasonably frequent visits to Caltech; and even for them, it may be simpler just to try using the elevator several times instead of writing a computer program. […]&gt; The algorithm we will now study may not reflect the elevator’s true principles of operation, but it is believed to be the simplest set of rules that explain all the phenomena observed during several hours of experimentation by the author during the writing of this section. […]&gt; The elevator system described above is quite complicated by comparison with other algorithms we have seen in this book, but the choice of a real-life system is more typical of a simulation problem than any cooked-up “textbook example” would ever be.It ends with:&gt; It is hoped that some reader will learn as much about simulation from the example above as the author learned about elevators while the example was being prepared.And one of the exercises adds:&gt; It is perhaps significant to note that although the author had used the elevator system for years and thought he knew it well, it wasn’t until he attempted to write this section that he realized there were quite a few facts about the elevator’s system of choosing directions that he did not know. He went back to experiment with the elevator six separate times, each time believing he had finally achieved a complete understanding of its modus operandi. (Now he is reluctant to ride it for fear that some new facet of its operation will appear, contradicting the algorithms given.) We often fail to realize how little we know about a thing until we attempt to simulate it on a computer."</p>

I have used this magic power just once, when an obnoxious man got on and insisted on having a loud conversation on his phone. Since he wasn&#39;t paying attention, I double-tapped his floor number and made him skip. I happened to get off at the floor before his, so the elevator went down to the first floor after dropping me off. Small pleasures...."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To me, the particular use case and whether it is fair use or not, is of minor interest. A far more pressing matter is at hand: AI centralization and monopolization.Take Google as an example, running Google Photos for free for several years. And now that this has sucked in a trillion photos, the AI job is done, and they likely have the best image recognition AI in existence.Which is of course still peanuts compared to training a super AI on the entire web.My point here is that only companies the size of Google and Microsoft have the resources to do this type of planetary scale AI. They can afford the super expensive AI engineers, have the computing power and own the data or will forcefully get access to it. We will even freely give it to them.Any &#34;lesser&#34; AI produced from smaller companies trying to compete are obsolete, and the better one accelerates away. There is no second-best in AI, only winners.If we predict that ultimately AI will change virtually every aspect of society, these companies will become omnipresent, &#34;everything companies&#34;. God companies.As per usual, it will be packaged as an extra convenience for you. And you will embrace it and actively help realize this scenario."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If the training set contains verbatim (A)GPL code does this mean that Copilot also should be distributed by Microsoft under GPL? Because without it Copilot (as it is distributed by Microsoft) couldn&#39;t be built, wouldn&#39;t it make it a derivative work of GPL&#39;d code (and obviously every other license)?I see a lot of people comparing human learning to machine learning in the comments, but there is a huge difference - we don&#39;t distribute copies of humans"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am really confused by HN&#39;s response to copilot. It seems like before the twitter thread on it went viral, the only people who cared about programmers copying (verbatim!) short snippets of code like this would be lawyers and executives. Suddenly everyone is coming out of the woodworks as copyright maximalists?I know HN loves a good &#34;well actually&#34; and Microsoft is always suspect, but let&#39;s leave the idea of code laundering to the Oracle lawyers. Let hackers continue to play and solve interesting problems.Copilot should be inspiring people to figure out how to do better than it, not making hackers get up in arms trying to slap it down."</p>

Awhile after the switch his primary care physician listened to his lungs and said they sounded a lot better. She said she because the science isn&#39;t in &#34;I can&#39;t tell you to vape but I can tell you to keep doing what you&#39;re doing&#34;.Should non-smokers pick up vaping? Probably not. But in this one instance it was a good move for a smoker.I&#39;d like to see more studies in this area and some more regulations on the &#34;juice&#34; for vapes. The quality, and I assume health effects, vary widely between different juices. For example: I bought him a non-refillable vape by another company and he started coughing and complaining of soreness in his throat.I also think the arguments against the flavored juices are hysterical/hypocritical given the variety of flavors of liquor one can find.Disclaimer: I think all drugs should be legal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Let me take these PhD level regex down to elementary school awesome.I have a process table and I want to grep it for the phrase &#34;banana&#34;:ps auxww | grep bananaroot  87  Jun21   0:26.78 /System/Library/CoreServices/FruitProcessor --core=bananamikec 456 450PM   0:00.00 grep bananaArgh! It also greps for the grep for banana! Annoying!Well, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s pgrep or some clever thing, but my coworker showed me this and it took me a few minutes to realize how it works:ps auxww | grep [b]ananaroot  87  Jun21   0:26.78 /System/Library/CoreServices/FruitProcessor --core=bananaDoc Brown spoke to me: &#34;You&#39;re just not thinking fourth dimensionally!&#34; Like Marty, I have a real problem with that. But don&#39;t you see: [b]anana matches banana but it doesn&#39;t match &#39;grep [b]anana&#39; as a raw string. And so I get only the process I wanted!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The more general tip is that a single regex isn&#39;t the only tool you have.  You don&#39;t have to get your final product one one step.  Almost every &#34;disaster&#34; regex comes from someone trying to do too much at once.One other solution would have been to run the regex twice, once to pick up all instances of Tarzan, and a second on the results of the first to filter out all instances of &#34;Tarzan&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This trick may be thought of as a simplification of the systematic approach to parsing stuff, that is the lexer-parser division of responsibilities.The lexer uses regexes but only for splitting the input stream of characters into tokens. Identifiers, integers, operators, strings, keywords, opening brackets and whatnot - each type of token is defined by a regex. This part is hopefully deterministic and simple, although the lexer matches regexes for all kinds of tokens at once, which is why lexer generators are often used to generate lexers.The heavy lifting is done by the actual parser which tries to combine the tokens into something that makes sense from the point of the grammar.So in this trick the sub-regexes between |&#39;s define the tokens (the lexer part) while the group mechanism selects the single token that we want to keep (a very very simple parser)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Former film pro here. I don&#39;t see anything &#39;impossible&#39; here, most of this is stuff I could do on my desk 10 years ago with a modest setup - but only with a lot of patience and manual labor.If these demos fairly represent the user experience then it&#39;s slick as hell and further blurs the line between editor, compositor, DI specialist etc. Much will depend on whether the ML marketplace can be competitive with many mature commercial offerings from software studios that have no intention of letting their lunch be eaten. Video production involves a lot of bleeding edge technology but the client base is also suspicious of new providers or do-it-all solutions at first, and very loyal to products and tech support offerings that have got them through difficult projects in the past, so there will be a big hill to climb between people acknowledging it&#39;s cool as hell and their willingness to sell it to a producer who is making a 5, 6, or 7 figure bet on what some editor/VFX geek is telling them.The web browser/cloud storage is an issue. It could be a plus in many circumstances, but it&#39;s also a big barrier to any production that&#39;s working in a remote location without reliable internet, especially given the massive data volumes involved. That limits a lot of the use cases to post production, and many producers and directors are going to be wary of starting on one platform and finishing on something else; nobody likes workflow changes unless they can be shown something seamless, like having your Avid/Final Cut/Premiere/* project leave your machine and show up frame-perfect in Runway, along with a definite answer about export time like being able to take in 12 hours of video and have it online within 24h. There will also have to be a lot of questions about security, downtime, and being able to get your project back out of Runway if money runs out, the editor gets fired, creative differences rear their head etc.Looks like an instant win for short-form projects like personal shorts, music videos, commercials, corporate, demo reels, spec pieces. Potentially very good for reality TV indie and low-mid budget films once the above questions are answered. Toughest nut to crack is large budget or episodic TV where there&#39;s very stiff competition and contractual or professional commitments already in place, but doable within 5 years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve just given this a go, with very little work I was able to produce a near seamless mask which was able to adapt to dynamic and changing pose - interesting stuff.The main drawback I observed was computation speed, most edits required &gt;20 seconds of loading/buffering (with a 1Gbps internet connection). I presume the computation occurs on their own servers, so with beefier hardware the performance could be increased, however my intuition is that the app would perform faster if running natively (rather than a shared resource quota on a remote server).In this regard, the lack of performance could be a major productivity killer, my hypothesis is that it is the video processing/manipulation which is taking a long time (and not the model classification). Many companies have tackled this problem space with completely video transcoding chips (such as YouTube), however this generally still incurs long periods of waiting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m so glad to see this on the front page -- this website, in conjunction with a video from Two Minute Papers, is what convinced me to teach myself machine learning.

It&#39;s big, bulky, has to be set up correctly, lit correctly, and is expensive and just generally a pain to work with.I&#39;m currently working on a fully-automatic version of this based off some excellent research from the University of Washington. It&#39;s still in its infancy, but if you&#39;d like to follow my progress, I post occasional updates over on https://nomoregreenscreen.comThis is just the beginning of what&#39;s possible in the intersection between DL and creative filmmaking, and I&#39;m really excited to get to be in this field at a time when compute is cheaper than ever and all the information I could want is available for free on the internet!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was wonderfully written and if your gonna start a data team, this is how you do it. But I can see that I’m the only one who thought it was crazy to start a data team in the first place.This company makes 10M and spends 3M on the team and infrastructure to make data a core competency?A vast majority of wins discussed were lowly differentiated web / mobile / supply chain analytics which they could have gotten and setup with 3rd party software for an order of magnitude cheaper.I can only imagine what this hypothetical startup could have learned if they spent that money actually talking to customers, and running more experiments.I’ve heard people talk about data as the new oil but for most companies it’s a lot closer uranium. Hard to find people who can to handle / process it correctly, nontrivial security/liabilities if PII is involved, expensive to store and a generally underwhelming return on effort relative to the anticipated utility.My take away was that startups benefit tremendously from a data advisor role to get the data competency, as well as the educational and cultural benefits, but realistically the data infrastructure and analytics at that scale should have been bought not built. Obviously there are a couple of exceptions such regulatory reasons like hippa compliance for which building in-house can be the right choice if no vendor fits your use case."</p>

The only way this doesn&#39;t turn into a complete nightmare of a cluster is if the exec team &#34;gets it&#34;.  If so, you just might stand a chance at building a data team that gels with the rest of the org.But if the exec team simply hired you for window-dressing, expect to be treated like a scapegoat and a punching bag. Any mistakes will be your fault. Any wins will be to the credit of the business.  The Director of Product will ask to &#34;embed&#34; dedicated DS headcount and you won&#39;t have any real power to shape the roadmap. If the exec team doesn&#39;t give you equal footingf with Product (or Marketing, Finance, and Eng for that matter) then this will rapidly become a soul-sucking job.  However, if E-team does give you the authority to call Product&#39;s bullshit, and tell Finance to stuff it, and not take direction from Eng leads, then you actually might be able to accomplish something really cool."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly, this hit me.I&#39;m not a react developer, I was experimenting with it for a new project. I finished the tic-tac-toe tutorial, then tried to throw bootstrap on top to build from there. It told me there was 97 vulnerabilities (85 moderate, 12 high)...I just deleted the directory and went back to vanilla JS.

What will happen in the latest attempt from an affected user? Tune in and be ready for an exciting ride!https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/2372Spoiler: bugs are not sentient beings that solve themselves just by closing the issue (or the whole issue tracker, for that matter).EDIT to clarify: Sorry for the snarkyness. I just find it funny in a sarcastic way that up until I reported the issue in 2020, the issue had been reported repeatedly but &#34;lost&#34; in the way because the project closed or ignored the issue every time it changed issue tracker. Which happened twice since 2017! so go figure the amount of reports that had gone to waste. On the flip side, this time they haven&#39;t changed platforms (yet), although the issue has been closed prematurely anyway."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh wow, that&#39;s from 8 years ago. And then it got leaked outside of Google 3 years ago it seems -- this article [1] provides a ton more context.Just for context, and before people start accusing Google of hypocrisy or anything -- these slides never represented an official (or unofficial) Google position or anything. They&#39;re not PR. They&#39;re just a single employee&#39;s opinion in slideshow form, an opinion he was trying to build support for internally.Whether you think it made any kind of impact is a fun thought question though.[1] https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/10/17333574/google-android-p..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the 8 years that have elapsed since this pitch was made at Google, one conclusion is absolutely crystal clear:  the industry has as little self-regulatory control over its use of such dark patterns as the public has over avoiding them.Regulation, taxation, and where necessary, criminalisation, are obvious and necessary.I&#39;ll note that for once, the patterns are not entirely synonymous with massive tech monopolies, though it is the monopolists who have the greatest resources and capability to tune their attention-diverting practices to the absolute maximum degree.The naivete Tristan reveals here is rather charming, however."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The distraction of notifications, or &#34;sign up for our email news letter&#34; distractions I&#39;m certainly against. But, the fact of having my time wasted (getting a notification I don&#39;t care about) has highlighted other things that waste my time such asMovies that start with 1-3 minutes of company logos. An animation of &#34;A Scott Free Production&#34;, followed by an animated logo of &#34;Bad Robot&#34;, followed by yet another animated logo of &#34;20th Century Fox&#34; and all that is then followed by card that says &#34;Scott Free Production of a Bad Robot movie published by 20th Century Fox&#34;. I want to reach and and shake the people silly &#34;QUIT WASTING MY TIME!&#34;The same with both movie trailers and game trailers. I go to see the game trailer and there&#39;s 30 seconds to 2 minutes of logos. For games, I want to click the video and see gameplay IMMEDIATELY. I don&#39;t want some 5 minute CG movie nor do I want to see the publisher or developer&#39;s names. Those are solely 
there to stroke their own ego. The user/player/viewer as absolutely no need for it. They aren&#39;t respecting my time.Of course those things have been around forever but the fact that my devices and apps waste my time in so many ways as highlighted other ways my time is also wasted."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh dear. After reading the notes in the study itself about the scale this was done at, scaling up might be an issue:&gt; A typical H₂O₂ synthesis reaction was carried out using 120 mg of 1% AuPd/TiO₂ [...] The reactor system was then pressurized, typically to 10 bar. The reactor was then cooled by a water bath to 2 °C. When the reactor had reached the required pressure and the flow through the system had stabilized, the solvent (H²O, HPLC grade), typically at a flow of 0.2 ml min¯¹, was introduced into the system.Oh hey, 0.2 mL/min of water. In Virginia, the lowest flow cutoff for waterworks is 0.5 MGD (or 5000 people), the border between Class 3 and Class 4. That flow rate is 6.5 million times that done in the tests here. The large water treatment plant I worked at is another 400 times that, and there are plants that would be another 5 or 6 times that. So the necessary scaling factor is going to be measured in the billions.So what about those reagants? This uses about 0.6 mg of gold to process 0.2 mL/min of water (if I&#39;m reading the notation of 1% AuPd/TiO₂ correctly). Scale that to our small plant, and that&#39;s about $225,000 of gold and $350,000 of palladium. Go to the scale I worked at, and that&#39;s $190 million of catalyst in terms of raw metal worth alone. That&#39;s comparable to the cost of a regular treatment plant of that scale--just on the catalyst. This assumes that there&#39;s a neat linear scaling, which I doubt is going to be the case (square-cube law!)."</p>

The sane part -- whatever was left of it -- recognized it and found an immediate way to stop it. So what actually happened is that I locked myself up in an empty room and cried (I couldn&#39;t harm myself there, because I didn&#39;t know how to get out until I sobered up a bit).After one hour of crying I started noticing the magical effects of &#34;we&#39;re all connected&#34; etc. So after the bad part of my trip, the amazing things came. I don&#39;t mind that I cried, but I do mind that I was acting on a suicidal tendency that I never experienced sober.I think I overdosed on it, being quite an inexperienced user. Because the first time I took half a dose, that was an amazing experience and it allowed me to reconnect to true child-like wonder (measured in units of whatever the smart shops in Amsterdam sell).N = 1, I know.All I&#39;m saying is: be careful, have a trip sitter and a good set and setting.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"On a related note, I highly, highly recommend watching this well-made documentary on JWST, released around 3 and a half years ago -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLD9LKq0u9EThis documentary was produced by Northrop Grumman Corporation -- the builders of JWST under a NASA contract."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s my personal belief that these massive R&amp;D space telescope programs are nearing their end. Computational approaches among multiple sensors, combined with good &#39;ol factory mass manufacturing powered by low-cost reusable launch technology allows for the money spent on one-shot programs like this to be spent and allocated in radical different ways.Instead of building one huge short life-span spacecraft, why not launch hundreds or thousands of lower cost, less capable birds incrementally? You can start with a small &#34;first light&#34; capable instrument with a dozen or so spacecraft, then over time and more launches put up more and more capability and decommission failed or low capability pieces.Use some computational methods to combine the sensor collection from dozens, hundreds, or thousands of these kinds of  spacecraft and you could end up with planet sized instruments pretty efficiently.By eliminating lots of the hard engineering for the massive instruments (like serviceability, difficult to make massive mirrors, etc) you can build even better instruments that are generational and relatively inexpensive.You get a more flexible funding story as well, e.g. fund at maintenance levels during difficult economic times and fund at larger amounts during boom times with matching launch schedules.Tasking the fleet could be more dynamic as well, with different researchers able to reserve different percentages of a huge fleet for their specific experiments and needs -- e.g. reserve a hundred spacecraft for a long dwell &#34;deep field&#34; type observation, or reserve thousands for planetary imaging in a nearby solar system.I know there are naysayers about this who think it&#39;s improbable. I urge those to think about the Starlink fleet, which went from zero birds in the air in 2015 to over 1500 spacecraft today. Now instead of radio antenna, what if they had imaging sensors and were turned to face out? SpaceX certainly didn&#39;t spend anywhere near what JWST ran as a program to reach this point and the development time has been a fraction so far."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If the JWST survives launch but has a subsequent mechanical problem that prevents it deploying properly (and it’s the kind of problem that would have been fixable on Hubble, using a shuttle mission) would it be feasible to mount a robotic rescue mission to chase it down and remote-hands it back to life? For less than the cost of just launching another JWST?"</p>

Galilean invariance says that the laws of physics should be invariant under translation and rotation. Checking this against Lu = f, you can verify that one requires that L commute with translations and rotations. That is L(u_h) = (Lu)_h, where u_h(x) = u(x+h), and similarly for rotations. What you can show (pretty easily on the Fourier side) is that every linear differential operator with these properties is a polynomial in the Laplacian."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sure. But I have a question: why? Why should we opt out of the telemetry? To me, this idea seems to not just be admitting defeat, it&#39;s ensuring defeat right from the start.Telemetry should always be opt-in. Yes, that means vendors will get much less data. It&#39;s on them to deal with it.On a related note, I wonder how long it takes until one of the vendors of popular CLI tools or desktop apps get fined for GDPR violation. I wonder how much of existing telemetry already crosses the &#34;informed consent&#34; requirement threshold. I&#39;ll definitely be filing a complaint if I find a tool that doesn&#39;t ask for it when, by law, it should."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;PRs and Status&#34; is a very optimistic headline for a list of rejected pull requests.I like the idea, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. I can understand why some Homebrew devs think it&#39;s just an attempt from someone to pad their resume. It&#39;s essentially a single person setting up a website, then submitting a bunch of untested pull requests to a bunch of projects.I imagine this would work much better if a large distro like Debian would adopt this first. They have the credibility and weight necessary for such a project, they can make it much more useful by asking for the desired setting during OS setup, and they can make sure it&#39;s universally respected via patches in the packaging process. From there it would have a chance at wide adoption."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I do not support this idea. The differences between the things they all group together under one umbrella is wild - ads, usage reporting, automatic updates, and crash reporting are all very different things and it&#39;s actively harmful to control all of them with a single switch.At the very least, there should be two different switches - &#34;ads&#34; and &#34;everything else&#34;.If you don&#39;t want telemetry or crash reporting, that&#39;s fine - you may not care about helping the developers of an open-source project improve their software and that&#39;s your personal choice. Similarly, you may want to manually install security patches, while I want them to be automatically installed so I have one less thing to worry about.There may even be some crazy person that wants ads. I don&#39;t, but I&#39;m not going to try to take away their freedom to choose them, which is what this proposal would do - an all-or-nothing switch for non-essential network access.Give me granularity. There&#39;s no (user-facing) reason not to."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s interesting to me that there is not as much push back against Rust from the kernel. Linus (I guess everyone addresses him with his first name), has been very critical, even dismissive of systems programming languages other than C. But with Rust he has a more, I guess we could say passive approach. This might be a good indicator that Rust is doing something very respectable.On the other hand I&#39;m slightly suspicious of this movement. Rustaceans are very, very eager to promote the language. It would be interesting to know how much this movement comes from within the Linux kernel community or if it is driven more by the Rust community.In any case the language seems to have potential of becoming a new mainstream systems programming language in a few years."</p>

I recommend instead of scrolling through the Amazon catalogue like he described, he might want to see if there is a local film festival that screens world cinema. Cinema from other parts of the world for me often leads to great new perspectives and insights. Outside of Hollywood there is plenty of auteurs and refreshing cinema happening.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Roger Ebert wrote an essay [0] in 1992 reflecting on his career as a critic. He writes&gt;In the past 25 years I have probably seen 10,000 movies and reviewed 6,000 of them. I have forgotten most of those films, I hope, but I remember those worth remembering, and they are all on the same shelf in my mind.Overall, he seems never to have lost the joy of watching movies. A relevant quote:&gt;When you go to the movies every day, it sometimes seems as if the movies are more mediocre than ever, more craven and cowardly, more skillfully manufactured to pander to the lowest tastes, instead of educating them. Then you see something absolutely miraculous. Something like &#34;Wings of Desire,&#34; or &#34;Do the Right Thing,&#34; or &#34;Drugstore Cowboy,&#34; or &#34;Gates of Heaven,&#34; or &#34;Beauty and the Beast,&#34; or &#34;Life Is Sweet,&#34; and on your way home through the White Hen Pantry you look distracted, as if you had just experienced some kind of a vision.[0]: https://www.rogerebert.com/roger-ebert/reflections-after-25-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The root cause of this is basically Hollywood (i.e. who makes what gets shown in your local multiplex) has given up on making movies exclusively for American audiences.  You need a global audience, and you need the potential to get a billion dollars + in revenue.  E.G. as he points out comedies have died, that&#39;s because comedy is highly localized versus the kids movies + adventure plots which are more universal.  End result is everything gets boiled down to its rawest, most accessible elements and everything feels samey."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a xoogler who interviewed way back in 2004, let me say that this post sums up my feelings exactly. The people I worked with at Google back then weren’t necessarily there for high six figure salaries. We were there to work with other people like us. We were there to be part of something larger than ourselves. In some sense I felt alone most of the time, and when I interviewed I felt as if I had found my tribe. These are people who made me feel dumb, but also astutely aware that I could improve. I learned so much during my tenure there, and I regret none of it. Perhaps I do regret taking so long to realize the sense of purpose and mission died when Emerald Sea started and good projects (reader, google talk, code search) were being canabalized to prop up a pipe dream that was never going to work. That’s the nexus event in Google’s time line… where things went askew and never came back to normal. Now people only care about perf, OKRs, and levels. Being a poor new grad with no savings and intentionally picking projects that would not get you promoted (but were fun) was frequent back then. The courage to do new things is rewarded in ways different than titles and symbols. Perhaps no “one” is more cognizant of that than the anthropomorphic Google of today."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked on the infra team for a TypeScript-based product downstream of the author. His and his team&#39;s approach and writings influenced at a lot of my thinking about core development, and I&#39;ll always be grateful for having had the opportunity to learn from them by osmosis.The success or failure with which any companies hires and retains folks like these is a mystery to me. As the evidence shows, Google (and I suspect almost any &gt;100-person company) is far too much an amorphous glob/slime mold to even have a single coherent approach to this problem. But what are the successful strategies here? How important is it even to retain this kind of talent? How do we know how a company is even doing in this regard?In my meager-in-comparison 6.5 years at Google, while I certainly saw many amazing SWEs come and many go, I&#39;m far from knowing what the real trajectory was. But I can imagine that for many folks, the perceived trajectory would be a major motivating or demotivating factor to stay or to leave themselves."</p>

The people /will/ change. Give a company serious power you cannot expect the staff to keep it reigned in. It&#39;s completely unrealistic and also unfair to the staff for them to have that moral responsibility forced on them. Ultimately 99.9% of the time the only thing they can do is resign, which reduces the impediments to bad things happening."</p>

Worse, there’s a body of opinion, especially in education, that considers it an ineffective way to practice. That’s a shame, because it’s the most effective way to build your skills.This resonated with me as I watch my kids go through school.Math used to be taught with more drill style. Now with common core every single problem is an epic quest of 10 frames and double pluses. It seems so ridiculous. I&#39;d rather them crush a worksheet of 20 problems that practices a single skill then 2 problems that try to include everything from reading to drawing just for a simple subtraction problem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I paint realism in oils, mostly still life.I showed my grandma (98) a photo on an iPad. Her immediate reaction: “there’s no reason to paint realism anymore”. The method described in this article might work for realism in oils, but please don’t accept it as the exclusive way to create art.Art is about understanding the tools you’re using to create (for example how paint mixes, moves, dries, interacts with a surface), then choosing which tools to use and how to use those tools to convey an experience to an audience. Art is about experimentation, exploration, communication. Art is about studying &amp; talking with other artists to learn how they work, the processes they use, how they solve problems; sometimes copying them and then extending beyond.My point of view on this developed as I studied art in high school, through AP art, and then minored in fine art in college alongside my engineering degree. Plus many hours painting with my grandma and my mom."</p>

Then work on issues for however long you wanted, billed hourly at a generous rate. Several times I disappeared for weeks to travel and climb and was always welcomed back.That company was minting money and wasn’t worried about deadlines. I wish more work was structured this way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve slowly come to realise that:1. There’s a large latent pool of talent that can only do part time/flexible jobs but aren’t even looking because so few are available.2. The total economic loss from such jobs being rarely offered is massive.Consider women who stop working for a year or two due to having a child or children. Many are only able to return part time at first. There’s so few part time jobs in software that many choose not to return to the industry. By the time they can return full time they feel so out of touch, from just a few years away, that they never return at all.Same happens with people who are injured, temporarily disabled etc. The demand of full time only (and often more hours on top again) means that the industry misses out on retaining a lot of skilled talent.And yes chronic conditions and disabilities are also very disadvantaged by the requirement of full-time only work.But as cool as the name sidequest is - I don’t think it’s quite right. Because for most people of the scenarios listed above this would not be a sidequest but a main quest.Awesome work though. And good luck!"</p>

I&#39;ve been looking for the last 12 months and I tried a lot of things, but the thing that worked best is this:Post a job ad.That&#39;s it. My ad sounded like a normal job in every way, with a title like &#34;Director of X&#34;. A couple of specific notes: 1) the first line said &#34;cofounder&#34; in it somewhere, and 2) it specified &#34;part-time to full-time, heavy on equity compensation&#34; somewhere else.The result: Lots of inappropriate candidates applied. But also, my 2 job posts resulted in three extremely excellent team members: a equity-only cofounder, a mostly-equity cofounder/early hire, and an amazing advisor. I have been working with these folks for months and they are very solid.I also recommend my vetting process: just like a job. That is, I did a phone screen, a multi-hour interview, a little take-home, and I winnowed down the candidates at each stage. With the chosen few, I kicked off a &#34;let&#39;s do this&#34; conversation. My pitch was, &#34;I know it&#39;s ridiculous, but let&#39;s get business married, we&#39;ll set up an offsite and start working together full-time... and, if we really need to, we&#39;ll get an annulment&#34;.

Most people don&#39;t understand how much work goes into actually making a startup happen and flame out pretty quickly...alas..."</p>

But plans have been made to tape out a new prototype based on Nanhu (南湖) by the end of the year, using SMIC’s 14nm process allowing up to 2 GHz frequency, and further iterations of the architecture will aim at rivaling Arm’s Cortex-A76 processor.RISC-V is an exciting development in the SoC world. We&#39;re starting to see some of HiFive&#39;s boards trickle out into the wild. The performance is good, but it&#39;s not quite as groundbreaking as many of the headlines make it out to be. The most exciting part of all of this is that ARM has more competition and we get to see some open-source contributions like this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"MicroMagic is pretty interesting to me in the RISC-V space: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/new-risc-v-cpu-claim...They are getting perf-per-watt numbers that are ahead of everyone...albeit with a single core and no real 3rd party verification.Some of the group had worked on Sparc at Sun, and they had previously sold themselves to Juniper for $260M, then regrouped some time afterwards."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know whether it is possible with chip development or not. But I really hope that this project will enable numerous amount of derivative chips just as Linux kernel allows multiple distro. That means IoT/GPU/CPU/etc chips need not to start from scratch. In addition, having similar foundations might help fabs manufacture those chips swiftly."</p>

It had a working stream to file for all changes, and a compaction thread in the background.What I learned...  creating the main/basic features of non-relational database (log based), is easy... but it is the edge cases that hit you hard and dealing with them creates about 90% of the code.It was a fun exercise from which I learned a lot."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a good tutorial.The problem of out-of-order data becomes more challenging as ingest throughput requirements increase if your storage representation must guarantee a strict total order. In high-throughput designs this is often handled by relaxing the strict total ordering requirement for how the data is represented in storage. As long as the time-series has an approximate total order at ingest time, there are many techniques for inexpensively reconstructing a strict total order at query time."</p>

This seemed to be very much the prevailing wisdom of the time. I pursued it anyway as it was my passion.I was one of five students in my program that had been a huge multi-campus program only a couple years earlier. We were the last cohort before the college discontinued the program entirely, and I was the only one to graduate. What I found  however for maybe five years after graduation was a insanely high demand for developers.There was genuinely a generation that was so strongly discouraged from becoming developers that there were very few. Seems to me like the folklorists have largely missed this."</p>

It&#39;s plainly wrong, and it sucks in people who drink the koolaid and think there&#39;s an easy route to work.Very little is learned in college that is necessary for general employment. By general I mean just about everything that isn&#39;t licensed, like being a doctor.What college does is it throws a bunch of hard but irrelevant subjects at you that you slog through, so that you learn how to learn stuff. The best demonstration of this is in subjects that are scientific mathematical, because there&#39;s very deep trees of knowledge there that you have to trace, and there&#39;s relatively few ways to use common sense and cultural experience to answer questions.This is why there are so many devs with no &#34;relevant&#34; degree. If you can sort through the mess of learning a stack, you can do the job. If you need to know some particular CS thing, you will find it and learn it yourself. There&#39;s no magic dust in any class, it&#39;s all publicly known information that&#39;s been digested by many many people before us, and these days you can find umpteen explanations for just about anything online for free.The thing that sorts people is the ability to persevere through technical issues.

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27736650">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I disagree with this article. GitHub Copilot is indeed infringing copyright and not only in a grey zone, but in a very clear black and white fashion that our corporate taskmasters (Microsoft included) have defended as infringement.The legal debate around copyright infringement has always centered around the rights granted by the owner vs the rights appropriated by the user, with the owner&#39;s wants superseding user needs/wants. Any open-source code available on Github is controlled by the copyright notice of the owner granting specific rights to users. Copilot is a commercial product, therefore, Github can only use code that the owners make available for commercial use. Every other instance of code used is a case of copyright infringement, a clear case by Microsoft&#39;s own definition of copyright infringement [1][2].Github (and by extension Microsoft) is gambling on the fact that their license agreement granting them a license to the code in exchange for access to the platform supersedes the individual copyright notices attached to each repo. This is a fine line to walk and will likely not survive in a court of law. They are betting on deep lawyer pockets to see them through this, but are more likely than not to lose this battle. I suspect we will see how this plays out in the coming months.[1] https://www.microsoft.com/info/Cloud.html[2] https://github.com/contact/dmca"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Julia Reda&#39;s analysis depends on the factual claim in this key passage:&gt; In a few cases, Copilot also reproduces short snippets from the training datasets, according to GitHub’s FAQ.&gt; This line of reasoning is dangerous in two respects: On the one hand, it suggests that even reproducing the smallest excerpts of protected works constitutes copyright infringement. This is not the case. Such use is only relevant under copyright law if the excerpt used is in turn original and unique enough to reach the threshold of originality.That analysis may have been reasonable when the post was first written, but subsequent examples seem to show Copilot reproducing far more than the &#34;smallest excerpts&#34; of existing code.  For example, the excerpt from the Quake source code[0] appears to easily meet the standard of originality.[0]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27710287"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; On the other hand, the argument that the outputs of GitHub Copilot are derivative works of the training data is based on the assumption that a machine can produce works. This assumption is wrong and counterproductive. Copyright law has only ever applied to intellectual creations – where there is no creator, there is no work. This means that machine-generated code like that of GitHub Copilot is not a work under copyright law at all, so it is not a derivative work either. The output of a machine simply does not qualify for copyright protection – it is in the public domain. That is good news for the open movement and not something that needs fixing.This is very good news. This line of thought implies that we can legally feed all proprietary code into GitHub Copilot in order to teach it all the patented and secret tricks of the companies we can see (since data mining is not copyright infrigement) in order to have it print those secrets back when we ask it to (so they become public domain)./s"</p>

The telemetry I&#39;m reading about is literally:1. error reporting - the user has to click a button to share crash logs. It&#39;s basically a macro to help the user create a support ticket.2. version checking - no PII information being kept, literally just helping the developer get an idea of what versions they need to be supporting--you do want them to support the version you&#39;re running, right? Well, if not, you can turn it off.What&#39;s the big deal?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish we could add telemetry to the rr debugger without risking this sort of blowback. We have no idea how many people are using rr, and how much, so when we talk to hardware vendors and other groups we depend on, we have no leverage. This is a real problem.It would be a big boost to free software if some org like Freedesktop had a standard telemetry library, data collection policy, data collection and publication service, and a distro-wide master switch to opt into data collection, and it was socially acceptable to use that framework."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here is the problem I see:1. Users enjoy product for free.2. Users pretty much never tell maintainers what is going wrong for them: no messages (much less proper bug reports), no contributions in any way!3. Something invariably goes wrong for users that do the above.4. Users immediately hit social media and try to tar the entire project, developer/company reputation, whatever.  “Zero stars”, doesn’t work in their use case.  You have surely seen these “reviews” before, and mindless tweets.THIS is why I am torn on telemetry to some degree.  IF you demand no auto-feedback in the name of privacy, THEN you should help out voluntarily OR not use free software!  Yet software maintainers can’t count on this at all.  They risk being hanged in the public square for every bug."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those unfamiliar with Strong Towns, here’s a best-effort summary of what they do:Strong Towns is a non-partisan non-profit that advocates for governments to build financially solvent towns. Many cities are perpetually broke because they owe more money in maintenance burden (fixing roads, pipes, etc) than they bring in through tax revenue.This happens because towns in North America tend to build out large neighborhoods all at once (think: suburbia). At the start, the developers pay for all the infrastructure, and then “give” it to the city to maintain.At first, everything seems fine. The city gets plenty of new tax revenue! But come 20 or 30 years later, it turns out that the tax revenue of the new development is not enough to replace the roads, fix the pipes, and so on.And so to pay for the repairs, the city then builds yet another neighborhood in the same strategy to collect the initial tax revenue and use it to pay for the repairs of the previous neighborhood. It’s effectively a Ponzi scheme (as referenced in the article).The gist is that many low-density spread-out suburban neighborhoods with expensive infrastructure are a huge cost center for a city. And since most North American cities build this way, we have a lot of cities that are “functionally bankrupt” or will be soon.If you&#39;re a systems thinker who lives in a town that can&#39;t seem to fix it&#39;s potholes, you may want to check out the book they&#39;ve published with the same name: &#34;Strong Towns&#34;.(Adapted from a previous Strong Towns post)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Not Just Bikes [1,2,3] YouTube channel also has an excellent series of videos based on work from Strong Towns.  I link to these videos whenever a friend asks why I chose to leave the United States. :)[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfQUOHlAocY

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This ‘Ponzi scheme’ (bond issuance) is the most efficient funding mechanism by far, and is proven to work sustainably within limits.That limit is the marginal point where the expenditure equals the net asset value gain resultant from it, such as real estate prices. How can you know this limit? You can’t, but the bond market can guess at it.Let’s say that you have a nice picket fence suburb with no police department and lots of robberies. You float a bond for your first police officer (not that this will help, but, run with it…). People buy it for nearly the risk-free rate. Why? Because they know that they will get paid back by the next bond, which will also get funded. Now the cop floats a bond for a Lamborghini. The demand is much lower, and the interest is unsustainable, so it doesn’t get funded.Now here’s where it goes wrong. The mayor sees that nobody wants to pay for the Lambo, and solves the problem by packaging it up with everything else. This works for the first Lambo, but they want 10 Lambos, so the bond interest rate is unsustainable.So what now? Taxes. They put a bunch of taxes on the residents, and then tell the investors that the Lambo bond will now get paid by tax revenues, which they have ultimate authority over. Now the calculus is different. The value of the expenditures is almost irrelevant. The only thing that matters is the marginal point where an additional dollar in tax reduces the net asset value by the inverse of the tax rate (e.g. $1 in tax revenue at 1% =&gt; $100 value destroyed). Notice we’re no longer talking about increasing values by large multiples, but destroying value by large multiples.Now the Lambo bond goes out supported by tax revenues. The casual observer might note that the people of the town are now paying the bond holders for their right to exist on the land that they ‘own’. The major innovation from feudalism is that now the peasants actually pay for the land up-front too, and they pay for any improvements on it, and then higher rent for the improved property.But that’s only an illusion of sustainability created by forceful extraction of resources. It’s like a strip-mining operation on middle class wealth. Profits are great until the resource runs out. So what is the solution there? Growth. Bring in more people to extract resources from. This is a requirement of the extractive funding model.Market forces create sustainable economies. Any use of force distorts away from sustainability, toward finite extraction, and extractive models require expansion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"So.. I can see that this ML model is generating some code exactly same as the original dataset, which definiately a problem. A defect model, sure. 
Beside that, I cannot understand why the overall idea, using open-source project to train a ML model that generates code would ever be a problem. We human beings are learning as the model, we read others code, books, articles, design patterns... and it becomes part of us. Even the private code, I mean like you join a company, you read their codebase, methodology and it becomes something yours. Copyrights generally not allow you to &#34;copy&#34; the original, but you can still synthesize your own code -- cutting, combination, creating based on whatever you have learnt. 
The method of how a ML model works is differ from human brain for sure, but I cannot see why this would be a problem, or why an organic would become something superior that what they do is a creation and a ML mode is scraping your code. What is the difference here????And also recently we saw GPT that generates articles, waifulabs that generates ... waifus... to be honest I cannot perceive the difference since all of them are &#34;learning&#34; (in a mechanical way of human created knowledge."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a genuine question about this whole thing with Copilot:A similar product, TabNine, has been around for years. It does essentially the exact same thing as Copilot, it’s trained on essentially the same dataset, and it gets mentioned in just about every thread on here that talks about AI code generation. (It’s a really cool product btw and I’ve been using and loving it for years).  According to their website they have over 1M active users.Why is this suddenly a huge big deal and why is everyone suddenly freaking out about Copilot?  Is it because it’s GitHub and Microsoft and OpenAI behind Copilot vs some small startup you’ve never heard of?  Is it just that the people freaking out weren’t paying attention and didn’t realize this service already existed?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey everyone, I just wanted to chime in and say that GPT-J is incredibly legit. Every aspect of GPT-J is production grade — no difference in process, quality, or results, compared to any other big name research lab.I also want to apologize to Eleuther for giving them a hard time in the past. My earlier concerns were unjustified. To be completely honest, I was jealous they achieved everything I tried to achieve with my own open source research lab attempt. It took a long time to even recognize that jealousy in myself, let alone set it aside. Sorry.The credit for this work goes almost entirely to kindiana, aka Ben Wang. Remember that name; you’ll be seeing a lot of it in the coming decade. It’s clear to me that whichever lab he ends up at (he’s an undergrad! Google let him slip away because he didn’t have a degree!), he’s gonna be changing the world. Don’t know what, don’t know how, know he will.Every aspect of that codebase is immaculate. Most research code is not pretty; this looks carved out of marble and placed in a museum.Without Eleuther’s TPU resources, this work wouldn’t have happened. Tensorfork (my lab) didn’t get access to the TPU VM alpha. And TPU VMs were an absolute necessity here. (TPU VMs are a new thing; they’ve been in alpha since December, but only recently launched. If curious see https://github.com/shawwn/website/blob/master/jaxtpu.md and https://github.com/shawwn/website/blob/master/mlmind.md for why it’s the future of ML.)Eleuther also helped test the model thoroughly. Leo Gao (go follow him: https://twitter.com/nabla_theta?s=21) ran GPT-J through the gauntlet. He was the primary person behind The Pile, the training data that makes any of this possible. I can say with absolute certainty and no hesitation that there are no “gotchas” here.Eleuther’s https://6b.eleuther.ai page looks wonderful too. It’s like a free OpenAI API playground that everyone can try. Keeping it running for months is no small achievement. (Set top_p to 1.0 and temp to 0.8; the defaults are pretty bad.)Congratulations, and thank you everyone for all your hard work. The world is so much better for having access to this level of quality."</p>

Contraversial figures are sometimes elected as Rector, at least in the UK, because students are the electorate. However for the same reason this isn&#39;t considered especially prestigious by people who know this.* Fund and create an academic post specifically for her (Ptolomy II Professor of the ethics of copyright strikes me a  a suitably biting title [1])* Nominate her to some well known prize[1] Ptolomy II decreed that any book found in a ship in the port of Alexandria should be copied by the scribes of his library - with or without the permission of the owner.  The UK actually has a similar law in that publishers are required to send copies of any book published in the UK to the British Library"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really wonder how this is going to play out. For those who don&#39;t follow the current situation with Sci-Hub, Alexandra (the creator and likely the sole operator) of Sci-Hub shut down the part of the website (&#34;the magical proxy&#34;) that is responsible for fetching the papers that were not previously retrieved. This was done to comply with the request of the Indian court, as described in the article.As a result, any papers published in 2021 (and some of the rarer, older ones, that nobody tried to access in the past) are not retrievable by Sci-Hub. The user only gets to see a white screen.This is meant to be a temporary measure, but it&#39;s been going on since December of last year (due to various court hearing delays), and the desperation in online communities like the r/scihub subreddit has been palpable [1,2].[1] https://old.reddit.com/r/scihub/comments/o2xb57/how_do_i_eve...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The push for crypto without ecc ram is a nonstop horror show. Software under normal circumstances is remarkably resilient to having its memory corrupted. However crypto algorithms are designed so that a single bit flip effectively changes all the bits in a block. If you chain blocks then a single bit flip in one block destroys all the blocks. I&#39;ve seen companies like msps go out of business because they were doing crypto with consumer hardware. No one thinks it&#39;ll happen to them and once it happens they&#39;re usually too dim to even know what happened. Bit flips aren&#39;t an act of god you simply need a better computer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cosmic-ray bit flipping is real and it has real security concerns. This also makes Intel&#39;s efforts at market segmentation by not having ECC support in any consumer CPUs [1] even more unforgivable and dangerous.Example: bitsquatting on domains [2].[1]: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/01/linus-torvalds-blame...[2]: https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/08/10/bh-2011-bit-squa..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"OP here.  Unless you work for a certificate authority or a web browser, this event will have zero impact on you.  While this particular CT log has failed, there are many other CT logs, and certificates are required to be logged to 2-3 different logs (depending on certificate lifetime) so that if a log fails web browsers can rely on one of the other logs to ensure the certificate is publicly logged.This is the 8th log to fail (although the first caused by a bit flip), and log failure has never caused a user-facing certificate error.  The overall CT ecosystem has proven very resilient, even if a bit flip can take out an individual log.(P.S. No one knows if it was really a cosmic ray or not.  But it&#39;s almost certainly a random hardware error rather than a software bug, and cosmic ray is just the informal term people like to use for unexplained hardware bit flips.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s wild we have any images of the surface of Venus at all given how hostile Venus is. Given how hostile it is, it seems unlikely we&#39;ll go back anytime soon. These images were really a product of the Cold War where the US focused on Mars.It&#39;s worth noting that Venus is still probably a better terraforming target than Mars [1]. This romantic notion of Mars has rooted itself deeply at this point (eg with Elon Musk) but Mars is basically a more distant and inconvenient Moon. Almost no atmosphere (in fact, just enough because dust storms will occasionally just coat all your equipment), the Sun is weaker and gravity is still very low.Venus&#39;s atmosphere is about 3% nitrogen and 97% CO2. It has about 100x the atmosphere of Earth, which means there&#39;s actually more atmospheric nitrogen than on Earth. And abundant CO2 means oxygen is abundant.[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI-old7YI4I"</p>

It helps to see what are the things missing or suboptimal for &#34;expert&#34; users of the system.Blender and OBS Studio are very good examples of FOSS software that are the best at what they do and can easily offer competition to even the commercial alternatives.Most of all their design and UI language is consistent - something very rarely seen in FOSS software.And they have incredible depth of features 90% of which are overkill for the casual user but the experts sure do appreciate them.And the best part is the well-thought of extensibility and API story. Both of them have a very good community of plugins and extensions which add very useful features without feeling out of place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Blender has gone from being a tool professionals scoffed at to one that professionals are stressing over themselves to learn by binging tutorials. It is quite the sight, I remember in 2008 wanting to get into game development and being poopooed on forums from picking up blender and instead pirating maya instead. I obviously dropped the idea completely because of it.Idk, I think there might be a larger lesson somewhere in there but regardless it&#39;s amazing to see the shift that has occurred."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a bit funny to see an IETF draft for this!Adding idempotency support to Stripe&#39;s API was one of the things I built while an intern in 2015. We&#39;ve since rewritten it almost entirely, but many the technical decisions made in 2015 still stand.One of the things that IETF doesn&#39;t specify (&#34;an appropriate response&#34;) is that Stripe&#39;s Idempotency API has a response body has the latest rendering of the resource. Here&#39;s what I mean:  # Set tax exempt status

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s more appropriate IMO to name it something like &#34;Request-Identifier&#34;. All the client should indicate is that if you get 2 or more POSTs with that same Id, you are free to no-op on any after the 1st successfully handled one.Idempotency is an emergent property of a system so it doesn&#39;t make sense that a client would dictate the key that&#39;s used to provide that behavior. So if the Idempotency-Key is quite likely not to be the actual &#34;Idempotency-Key&#34; in any sufficiently complex system, then don&#39;t name it that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ll repeat my comment from nearly seven months ago [1] since it left a really bad taste about how users are dealt with. Nearly a year ago when the initial waves of the pandemic were raging on, Migadu removed its free tier. That&#39;s not a problem by itself because businesses have to make money to sustain and grow. But Migadu gave one month’s notice (contrary to the claims in the replies, that&#39;s what I saw) for users to switch. The replies to the comment also said that the new lowest paid tier was &#34;affordable in every corner of the planet&#34;, which sounded quite ignorant even for a non-pandemic time.Another point, which may matter to some people, is that while Migadu may be a Swiss company, the data centers where the mails are hosted were in France (this was the case at least a year ago). So the situation is somewhat comparable (not entirely though) to Fastmail being an Australian company with data centers in the U.S. being used.For those who want multi-domain email services for a lower (flat) price, look at mxroute. It&#39;s based out of the U.S. though, which may not be an option for people who want certain services outside Five Eyes jurisdictions.[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25382626"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ive had a bad enough experience with migadu that I am compelled to actively warn people not to use them (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25054091).Migadu has taught me bargain basement email is too expensive in the long run."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Their $19 (Micro) Plan lists &#34;200 in/day and 20 out/day&#34;. My email usage, personally, seems to be in bursts. It stays below 1 or 2 outbound mails on most days, however on some days (rarely) there&#39;ll be threaded conversations with &gt;50 outbound mails. So, I feel like it would be fantastic if the plan had monthly limits instead of daily limit. Or some other sort of limit, say EC2 like, which would allow the user to consume the resources in bursts."</p>

The city&#39;s vulnerability was known beforehand [0] but the inevitable disaster was greeted with shock, confusion, and a search for peripheral explanations.  In the case of the pandemic, our vulnerability to zoonotic viruses and other diseases was also well-known; e.g. [1] was published in 1995.  But again the reporting, as it seems to me anyway, focuses on the particular circumstances of the disaster rather than our fundamental vulnerability.  There is a plentiful supply of unknown microorganisms to fuel the next global health crisis, and we need to expect and prepare for it so that next time we can prevail without great struggle.[0] https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/predicting-katrina/[1] https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46722.The_Coming_Plague"</p>
