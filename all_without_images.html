								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Even if you are a person who will never in your life end up as any kind of person of interest for the government, handing over data in this way could still be quite dangerous.Phones will often contain data that can facilitate theft and fraud if ending up in the wrong hands. If they&#39;re able to copy everything, including private data from all apps that could be quite bad. For example many countries now use apps to login to online banking, with private keys for the login stored in the app. Will that be copied? Will it ever be found out if one of the 3000 government officials with access to this data sold it on darknet markets?Maybe some months after your travel you suddenly wake up one day to find all your money transferred from your bank account to some account in Nigeria."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Terrifying for only 2 reasons:1. Any malicious person savvy enough to pull off a crime of interest to the Feds is smart enough to provide a wiped or burner phone to DHS/ICE, and they have to know this. So, what is the point in doing this if not to target law abiding citizens.2. USGOV has a spotty track record of keeping this information secure. A foreign actor is likely to access this info eventually. As one former government official once joked many years ago - concerning Chinese hacking - &#34;Well, its probably more secure in the CCP&#39;s data center, so I wouldn&#39;t worry.&#34;This is the problem when a non-technical generation makes the rules and regs. Luddites ought not be permitted to ascend the GS ranks."</p>

It also bypasses things like ALSA in order to be able to bit-bang audio in supported formats directly to an external receiver. These are basic functions of normal video playback devices like blu-ray players or cable boxes.A Plasma skin can&#39;t do any of this. So while it&#39;s probably very suitable for things like games and photo frames on a big screen, I fear that it is disadvantaged from the start for video and audio."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Having watched most of the GamersNexus video, my takeaways were:- Will maintain some stock for RMAs- Made pre-production boards for 4xxx, will not manufacture- 3080 and above are not profitable for EVGA- NVIDIA is not transparent about pricing with board manufacturers, they find out MRSP same time we do- NVIDIA limits MSRP heavily on cards so they can&#39;t do things to sell more profitable higher end cards- It sounds like (this is my takeaway from GN&#39;s description, not their words) EVGA&#39;s CEO is tired of dealing with NVIDIA, wants to refocus on family, and there isn&#39;t a clear person to replace him and hesitant to sell to people who would mistreat employees/cut corners/damage brand.- Will continue selling power supplies- No plan to work with AMD or Intel making boards, CEO sounded dismissive toward it"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"EVGA is doing what every iOS developer secretly dreams of doing whenever they have to deal with some new stupid bullshit from Apple. Respect.Also, I&#39;ve always liked EVGA. I&#39;ve bought a few of their cards over the years, and many power supplies, and I&#39;ve never had a bad experience. It seems like they really care about making quality products, which is pretty rare to see nowadays.If they start expanding into new products with the same focus on quality, that&#39;ll be a net gain for the world. Maybe they&#39;ll try making laptops again?Or maybe this is all just an elaborate power move to put pressure on Nvidia and renegotiate their relationship."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s crazy to see them go, they&#39;ve been a big name in the GPU space since as long as I can remember. If they truly don&#39;t expand into AMD GPUs or something else as they&#39;ve said, I don&#39;t see them sticking around in the long term. A bit sad, they have been a good company to their customers.I don&#39;t blame them though, it sounds like Nvidia is a PITA to deal with, and the recent pains with GPU shortages and mining have likely exacerbated it as well.My best wishes to their employees, hope they all find good work elsewhere."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think it&#39;s worth repeating: at this point, MFA that is not based on Webauthn (https://webauthn.guide/#about-webauthn) should be considered dangerously insecure. Uber almost certainly enforces MFA for remote access; I strongly suspect we&#39;ll end up hearing that it was successfully provided during the authentication step (update: screenshots on Twitter appear to confirm this). As we saw in the case of the 0ktapus campaign, a sufficiently-skilled attacker will simply proxy the MFA calls to the real identity provider in real-time, the user none the wiser.Webauthn, however, binds the authenticator to the domain and port, and requires https as the scheme. If a user gets phished, they cannot be compromised: the phisher&#39;s domain will not match and any Webauthn authentication challenge would fail.So if your workplace is letting you authenticate with SMS codes, push notifications to an app, or 6-digit codes generated by an authenticator app/hardware device, you need to start banging on pots and pans up your reporting chain to get your security team the support they need to make Webauthn + FIDO2 hardware tokens or Webauthn + Mac Touch ID happen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why are people talking about MFA on this thread. Look, as someone whose day job is responding to such incidents, someone targeting Uber and is persistent will get in, MFA or not. Infostealers for Mac are a thing (Uber is a mac heavy shop I hear) and that&#39;s all it takes to steal cookies and tokens post-mfa, or why even bother with that, if you&#39;re running code just make it a reverse shell.The big screw up here is powershell script on a network share. A cheap pentest would have uncovered something like that.Modern security is not perimeter focused where you try to keep the bad guys out. Yes, you should do MFA,firewalls,vpns the whole schtick but(!!) your presumption should always be that threat actors already have a foot-hold in your network. This is very important because it helps you  focus on basic things like scripts and gpos with creds in them but also you treat internal devices the same as internet exposed devices. It&#39;s sort of what the whole &#34;zero trust&#34; thing is about as well. In other words, host/user compromise is a given but lateral movement should be at least as difficult as breaching the perimeter.But my prediction is, just like top commenters here, they will slap MFA on it and of course cleanup scripts with creds and call it fixed until the next compromise. Oh and FYI, MFA on VPNs is a PITA, that&#39;s rarely done for good reason, instead you use device certificates in addition to passwords which is what the recommendation should be not yubikeys or webauthn (vpn!=web??) because VPNs need to reconnect and you can&#39;t have people insert a yubi each time their connection drops. Ideal setup would have 7 day valid (or however long is reasonable for users to disconnect their PC and remain out of office) mutual-auth certs+ocsp getting conditionally reissued new certs to remain connected (compliance stuff like patching, unapporoved software,security alerts for the device). If you think about it, you typically issue users two yubikeys not just one so if the backup gets stolen you have a problem depending on how easy it is to social engineer users or reset their password with a good yubikey but a stolen laptop means certs+password revoked immediately."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unconfirmed method of breach: https://twitter.com/hacker_/status/1570582547415068672- Socially engineer an employee to get on their VPN (could have been prevented with webauthn / hardware 2fa)- Once on VPN, scan their intranet and find a network share- Network share has powershell scripts with admin credentials for their PAM vendor, Thycotic- From there can get full access to all systems"</p>

And there&#39;s now effort underway to be able to import Figma files.edit: okay, I&#39;ve gotten signed up with penpot, made rudimentary sketches, it seems solid and promising. I&#39;m now a fan and I think this seals the deal for me, I&#39;m glad that it was an easy decision. And I will give them the benefit of the doubt when it&#39;s not exactly up to par because 1) they seem to be new and characterize themselves as still being in beta and 2) it&#39;s self-hostable OSS and the inherent security of this offering is something I value deeply."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since 2012, through the eras of Photoshop, Sketch, InVision, XD, Figma, and whatever else, I&#39;ve been using Antetype: https://www.antetype.comFor me, it&#39;s been a 10x tool since it was always the only piece of software that was designed from the ground up as a UI design tool, rather than being some other kind of app that was pressed into service for UI design. Auto-layout, responsiveness, and flexible components that can be edited per instance without breaking their link to the master component are all features that were present from day one rather than being awkwardly bolted on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really wish OmniGroup had the vision and resources to bring OmniGraffle into some kind of shared collaborative editing world, whether by developing a web app, or incorporating some kind of collaborative, versioned backend for &#34;corporate&#34; users.It has one of the best overall general diagramming/graph layout engines and UI of anything I&#39;ve used on the desktop and web. My experience in the diagramming, layout and technical-ish drawing realm includes Figma, as well as Illustrator, Photoshop, Pagemaker, Freehand, Deneba Canvas, Mac Draw Pro.I still love Omnigraffle for flow charts, presentations, UML diagrams, and UI wireframes. It&#39;s not a 1:1 replacement for Figma, but it suits many of the same problems.But its existence as a solo, mac-only, desktop-only app relegates it to my personal projects and I can never use it fully at work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"* I far, far, far prefer Craigslist interface to anything else in that space. It&#39;s clear and focusedIts search engine too - I get things I search for in the area I search for.For me, Kijiji and Facebook marketplace are awful UI, awful distractions, and give me 10,000 &#34;suggested&#34; or &#34;fuzzy searched&#34; things in random order, suppressing things I&#39;m actually looking for. And I&#39;ve completely given up on eBay over last decade.However.* Nothing is on Craigslist anymore in my area (Greater Toronto Area). Until about... 5-6 years ago, I could find comparable number of photography, computer, music &amp; kids stuff on Craigslist and Kijiji. Today, Craigslist is a desert, a void, an oasis of empty search results.So network effect wins, as always :-/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My problem with Craigslist isn&#39;t that it looks old, the problem is that they seemingly refuse to modernize anything else about the site. Craigslist is chock full of spam and people abusing the search feature. I&#39;m no anti-spam guru, but surely there is a way to cut down on people submitting the same thumbnail dozens of times using as many keywords as they can so their cellphone screen repair service shows up when looking for just about anything.Craig is no saint, and actively goes after any competition to his site. That, coupled with the complacency or refusal to go after spammers leaves me with a very sour opinion of the platform and Craig himself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate FB Marketplace.It&#39;s actively hostile to buyers.Like, try to find a &#34;kinda nice&#34; bicycle. You can&#39;t find the bicycle category  (though it does exist as a sub-group of Sporting Goods), you can&#39;t just say &#34;show me bikes&#34; unless you hack the URL, you can search for the word &#34;bicycle&#34; but for some reason people selling a &#34;Specialized Rockhopper&#34; think you know it&#39;s a bicycle so don&#39;t use that word.Oh, and when selling, they just suggest random categories instead of letting you choose from their heirarchy. So you get bicycles in Hobbies. You get them in Sporting Goods. You get them in Bicycles. But... You can&#39;t search for them by type.That&#39;s not even complaining about the lack of attributes, like &#34;type=BMX&#34; or &#34;type=Mountain&#34; or &#34;Size=Large&#34; or &#34;Frame Material=Carbon Fiber&#34;... all of which are in Craigslist and eBay.And! when searching, they actively work to inject ebay-like selling (non-local) into the mix by resetting my distance preferences every time I change the search. &#34;Find bicycles&#34; -&gt; &#34;Find bicycles in 30 miles&#34; -&gt; &#34;Find &#39;Specialized Rockhopper&#39;&#34; -&gt; Why am I getting &#34;Ships To You&#34; results?! Why am I getting non-bicycle results?! Oh. They reset my distance again.^-- BTW they do this because they actually make money when the sale happens through FB. If you just buy it in-person with cash they don&#39;t get a cut. Misaligned incentives, as they say.And! even if I do find the bicycle category, if narrow the category by searching with a word in there, like &#34;Rockhopper&#34; it takes me out of the bicycle category to do the search!G.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I read these articles sometimes about crypto games, but they all never seem to describe the actual game, it’s like crypto is the primary concern, and game is secondary, and i’m getting the distinct impression none of these games are any fun and everyone in the space has to avoid mentioning it.I think that the people writing these things only have a very slim grasp of gaming, but they know it would be a good market to capture"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; What Went Wrong?It&#39;s in the title of the article. It&#39;s a &#34;Blockchain Game&#34;. That&#39;s what went wrong. It was a flawed concept from its inception. Blockchains are pretty cool from a math/cryptography standpoint, but they really do not provide added value in most areas people try to apply them to.CryptoKitties is a digital trading card game. You get cards, you can &#34;breed&#34; cards together to make new cards, you trade/buy/sell cards. That&#39;s it. Nowhere at any point in this &#34;game&#34; is a blockchain necessary. Nowhere at any point does a blockchain add any value whatsoever. In fact, due to transaction fees, I&#39;d argue the blockchain actively detracts from the game.The idea of an artist signing their work in a cryptographically unique way is not new or revolutionary, and it certainly doesn&#39;t need a blockchain. There&#39;s a reason the general sentiment the art community has towards NFTs is overwhelmingly negative: it&#39;s because they literally actively harm us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I don&#39;t see addressed in this article is that as far as I know, it&#39;s basically impossible to trust the reported price or volume of NFT transactions, because there&#39;s no way to distinguish fake wash trades from real ones.So it&#39;s hard to draw any conclusions about whether the data reflects an actual peak in user activity, or just a peak in scams."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a great writeup overall. I was happy to see Tyler&#39;s initial outreach before conducting his tests [0]. However, please note that these tests are also being revised shortly after some brief feedback [1]:- The sendfile tests at the end actually didn&#39;t use sendfile, so expect much greater performance there.- All the Caddy tests had metrics enabled, which are known[2] to be quite slow currently. Nginx does not emit metrics in its configuration, so in that sense the tests are a bit uneven. From my own tests, when I remove metrics code, Caddy is 10-20% faster. (We&#39;re working on addressing that [3].)- The tests in this article did not tune reverse proxy buffers, which are 4KB by default. I was able to see moderate performance improvements (depending on the size of payload) by reducing the buffer size to 1KB and 2KB.I want to thank Tyler for his considerate and careful approach, and for all the effort put into this![0]: https://caddy.community/t/seeking-performance-suggestions-fo...[1]: https://twitter.com/mholt6/status/1570442275339239424 (thread)[2]: https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/4644[3]: https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/5042"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like we never see HAProxy in these reverse proxy comparisons. Lots of nginx, Apache, Caddy, Traefik, Envoy, etc.The HAProxy configuration is just as simple as Caddy for a reverse proxy setup. It&#39;s also written in C which is a comparison the author makes between nginx and Caddy. And it seems to be available on every *nix OS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wrote up a few notes on my Caddy setup here https://muxup.com/2022q3/muxup-implementation-notes#serving-... which may be a useful reference if you have a static site and wanted to tick off a few items likely on your list (brotli, http3, cache-control, more fine-grained control on redirects).I don&#39;t think performance is ever going to matter for my use case, but one thing I think is worth highlighting is the quality of the community and maintainership. In a thread I started asking for feedback on my Caddyfile (https://caddy.community/t/suggestions-for-simplifying-my-cad...), mholt determined I&#39;d found a bug and rapidly fixed it. I followed up with a PR (https://github.com/caddyserver/website/pull/264) for the docs to clarify something related to this bug which was reviewed and merged within 30 minutes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"from the article,&gt;&gt;As much as we love exciting new features, we also want to see people create games on the full spectrum of devices for everyone to enjoy.This is one of the main attitudes of the Godot team I really appreciate a lot. It might be easy for people in more developed nations to upgrade their hardware every few years, but there&#39;s people still playing games running on computers from 2002 and before. I used to know of a player who used to play (an old MMORPG) games on a computer he aimed a table fan at to keep it cool. The whole casing was open, it was kinna funny to look at it and it had hardware he got as a birthday gift more than 10 years ago. He played that old MMORPG because newer games wouldn&#39;t even start on that old thing. But most people who played that MMO were in the same boat, it was one of the very few ones they could run.The requirements for some of the games coming out these days is sometimes so insane a lot of people from around the world are unable to play them. I always found it funny how we had so much developer time wasted on supporting ie6 because a small percentage of people were unable to upgrade their browsers, but when it comes to gaming, all bets were off and you are now expected to spend a few grand a year on upgrading your computer to play newer games. And don&#39;t get me started on the bandwidth costs to play some of the new games."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I played with Godot back in the early 3.x timeframe (3.1? 3.2?) and then fell away and spent some time with Unity. But between some of Unity&#39;s missteps and Godot getting dotnet 6 support it is time to give it another go, plus a bunch of nice changes to gdscript that might make it something I&#39;m okay with using (functions are first class citizens now unlike before where you just passed the name of the function as a string which always felt incredibly gross).Though based on the discord conversation there are still a lot of bumps even in the beta so I would not expect smooth sailing yet, but lets see if it is any good.For anyone interested, the main documentation on their site is still pointing at 3.x.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a current software engineer at Adobe, I was really disappointed when I got the internal email announcing this this morning. It&#39;s reminiscent of Microsoft&#39;s anticompetitive behavior in the early 00s. Figma is the better product and Adobe knows it - but instead of using that to light a fire under them and work harder to create a better product, Adobe just used its deep pockets to make the problem go away. I was already planning on leaving the company for other reasons but this is the nail in the coffin for me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Used to work for a “high risk” payment processor, we inherited tons of accounts that were terminated by Stripe, Square, and PayPal. Here’s one small bit of inside info that may help the newer businesses out there:Most real payment processors (e.g. banks, merchant services companies) “underwrite” a company BEFORE allowing them to process. Underwriting means they look over the business model, financials, etc and make sure the business is an acceptable risk, not doing anything illegal or against their terms, etc. So you’re more likely to be declined initially, but if you’re lit up, you should be good for the future because the underwriters actually saw the deal and approved it.While I haven’t worked for these other companies, a lot of experience seems to show that Stripe, Square and PayPal operate differently: they light up ANYONE, and then only underwrite when the account hits a critical threshold of revenue. So it’s easy to get an account there, but if you scale up, that’s when you’ll be scrutinized and potentially terminated. It’s a very unethical practice because it ends up hitting businesses at the worst possible time, when the termination or suspension causes a huge financial hit.So basically, always have a backup processor and use these web based services at small scale to prove out your model, but NEVER rely on them as your sole payment solution."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a very similar experience, except it was on our launch day.We hadn&#39;t charged a single live customer yet, but we had done plenty of tests using the Stripe testing environment. So we go live with a huge launch event, and we have customers signing up in droves. When they get to the last step -- payment -- they get an error.Logging in to the dashboard I didn&#39;t see any indication that there was anything wrong with our account. No alerts or notices. We had already gone through the approval process you go through when signing up, and been told we were approved.The thing that surprised me the most was that there was just no indication anywhere that our account would not be able to charge cards. Wouldn&#39;t it make sense for there to be an indicator somewhere that just says &#34;Not ready yet&#34;?Apparently, they had never even begun reviewing/vetting us since the time we signed up for the account months earlier. We reached out to customer support and it took them about two weeks to get us activated. And, similar to OP, they never gave us a shred of information about what was going on. I still don&#39;t know to this day what the issue was.Next time I build something with Stripe I&#39;m going to test it in production before launching, with my own real credit card!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The worst part about these type of cases is not being able to get a straight answer. There is a whole subset of big tech that has taken the &#34;you must be a fraudster therefore we can&#39;t unfuck the situation&#34; approach to customer support.It&#39;s an arms race with fraudsters that eventually sucks in legitimate businesses."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Prior to the merge ethereum’s trust was controlled by the organizations with the most money who bought/built massive data centers to mine it.With the merge &amp; staking that abstraction layer has disappeared and it’s still the organizations with the most money who control it.Sure it’s great that non-productive math problems no longer need to be solved &amp; consume so much energy and hardware to make it all work. And it may be an incremental improvement over traditional global finance because there is a much greater ability to publicly scrutinize what goes on.But no one should consider this a fundamental paradigm shift &amp; democratization compare to traditional financial systems controlled by a a very small number of big players. Their influence still can override the mining process that’s supposed to be the final word on transactions.Although I’ll clarify a bit: I’m actually a proponent of having a layer of human judgement that can fix a problem when things go off the rails. The issue is that in crypto this layer is even less accessible to smaller players than in traditional finance. The DAO was able to throw its weight around and get a hard fork, but how many other groups with much less influence have suffered from similar problems and exploits without that same benefit?Yes, even in traditional finance there are some types of irreversible fraud. But for every day transactions, for using money as a daily part of transactions necessary to live your life and not just as a speculative investment, crypto falls far short.If a criminal spies on my credit card # as I make a purchase and uses that to go on a spending spree I can fix it with the credit card company with little cost but a few hours of time and frustration. If my wallet is pick pocketed or I simply lose it by accident I have a similar recourse to mitigate the fallout. Crypto? No. It may, eventually, have some other benefits though that’s yet to be seen. But as a major change &amp; liberation of people from massively powerful banks and governments there seems to be nothing more that shouted rhetoric and wishful thinking."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It&#39;s like Finland has suddenly shut off its power gridSo, have we observed global energy usage go down by about one Finland?Shouldn&#39;t that be observable somehow? Shouldn&#39;t there be some power stations reducing their output as a reaction to reduced demand?Anyone know how this would be visible, and on what kind of time frame we expect it to become visible?I&#39;m not claiming it hasn&#39;t happened. I just feel surprised to not see more coverage of that in this article, nor here in the comments. Energy efficiency is largely the point of this major change. Shouldn&#39;t there be graphs of the power grids everywhere showing a big drop? Maybe my expectations are just off on that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The Merge is one of the largest technological events in the industry to date.I feel kinda ashamed. I work in the IT industry and I claim to have knowledge about (&#34;good&#34;) software engineering practices, distributed systems,  compilers, algorithms, etc. Nevertheless, I didn&#39;t understand a word of what the article is saying. Could you recommend serious references (preferably books and not random blogs) I could read to catch up with what&#39;s going on with crypto these days? I&#39;m not planning to &#34;buy&#34; crypto; I would like to understand the technicalities."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32851262">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sounds like they have a interesting history behind the creation of Penpot:&gt; Penpot was (effectively) born in a Kaleidos personal innovation week (PIWEEK, aka recurring hackathon) in 2018. Back then we had been recently forced to break one of our sacred rules at the company “only open source tools and platforms are allowed to build technology” due to F1gm4’s overwhelmingly productivity boost for designers at the company. “We are second-class citizens in open source, it’s frustrating and it’s painful!” they cried, and they were right.https://kaleidos.net/ seems like an interesting place to work as well.Gonna be exciting to see where Penpot moves from here. I&#39;m a 100% Figma user who just signed up for Penpot and gonna see if it&#39;s possible to adopt for my own workflows.Particularly interesting for me as a Clojure/Script developer is that Penpot is written in Clojure and ClojureScript, but the average user won&#39;t care about that. But will also be interesting to see if they&#39;ll be able to keep iterating at the same speed as they currently are, and how the language will affect it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is the beauty of FOSS. It might be rough at the edges but you can always have access to it and not have to worry about losing your daily driver (talking to you Figma). Every organization  needs to start thinking about this and invest in good FOSS tools for any recent technology to avoid business continuity  risk."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m excited to see alternatives to Figma, because using it is like an emotional rollercoaster for me. There are times when I&#39;ll open a massive project file with hundreds of frames, each with thousands of graphical nodes. And even then, I can zoom in and out with no friction at all, it&#39;s just buttery smooth. I&#39;ve been a developer for over a decade, and I have no idea at all how they&#39;re able to pull that off. It&#39;s a technical marvel.On the other hand, it&#39;s far from what I would want for a modern design tool. Managing tokens, or anything from the &#34;design system&#34; world, is an absolute headache. Compared to the efficiency of the dev tools I use, it feels like Figma (and every other design tool) is just light years behind.Even when I use a tool that&#39;s built specifically for that purpose, like Supernova, I still feel pretty underwhelmed. I&#39;m not sure exactly what I&#39;m looking for, but I know that the current landscape doesn&#39;t cut it for me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Notable highlights for me:&gt; Lockdown Mode is available in iOS 16 and coming soon in iPadOS 16 and macOS Ventura.&gt; Web browsing - Certain complex web technologies are blocked, which might cause some websites to load more slowly or not operate correctly. In addition, web fonts might not be displayed, and images might be replaced with a missing image icon.The first sentence I believe is referring to disabling JIT (just in time compilation of Javascript), which is dangerous as it allocates W+X pages which are often used by the final stage of an exploit. Apple did an amazing job already of hardening iOS by severely restricting which applications can use JIT (and this is their justification for why non-Safari browser engines are not allowed on iOS) and even enabling per-thread memory page permissions. Many more details are in this fantastic post from Google&#39;s project Zero: https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/09/jitsploitatio...Overall it&#39;s very interesting to see Apple invest so significantly in something that will benefit relatively few users -- not that I&#39;m complaining!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For kids over 1 year, some sanity saving notes (I have more than 4 kids, was about to go crazy when I got my second and then learned the things below):- everyone wakes halfway up multiple times each night to see if everything is OK. Make sure they don&#39;t fall asleep with anything that can&#39;t stay with them during the night: music, tv, light, food, drink or another person (you or others).- to teach kids to sleep, make them feel safe about it. What I did was walking in at a fixed schedule, starting at exact 3 minutes between the first night (I used a digital kitchen timer back then, a smartphone later) and increasing by two minutes every night. Surprisingly fast, my kids learn that I didn&#39;t disappear, and he&#39;ll be around even if they don&#39;t cry. Once they realized this they started playing with the toy the were allowed to keep in the bed. But, keep in mind: don&#39;t stop coming back if they are silent. A major part of the idea is that they realize that they don&#39;t have to do anything to make sure we don&#39;t forget them. Oh: and keep a very close ear with them in the beginning so they don&#39;t wake up and think they are alone.I never really could get myself to accept the idea that &#34;they need to cry themselves to sleep&#34; and every thing I tried before this didn&#39;t work on my oldest.This worked on my oldest kid, she started sleeping through the night within a week and also became calmer and I got my sleep back. With the rest of them it took 2-3 days only since I started earlier (shortly after they was a year old).Maybe other methods work too, but this was easy for us and we didn&#39;t have to let the kids cry to sleep or anything else I have seen recommended online that I didn&#39;t like."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My partner is a doctor mainly working in early childhood prevention. When she did some recent training on evidence based early childhood care (which is surprisingly rare, most early childhood care is not really evidence based), she learned a couple of things that she said she really would like to have known when we had our children were born.One is that you get told a lot about averages. So commonly parents get told that babies (should) sleep around 12h a day. What nobody talks about is the variance. There are babies who sleep only 8h a day and others who sleep close to 20h. So you end up with parents who thing they need to get their child to sleep, even though the child is absolutely not tired.Also a lot of people talk about not giving children too much impressions/stimulation. Which is also generally false, giving them stimulation will actually make them tired and sleep better, they also learn stuff. Obviously you don&#39;t do that just before or when going to bed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One day, I believe car design regulations will be amended to allow fully electric braking (ie. no hydraulics, drums, rotors, or pads).   At that point, the motor can be moved into the wheel (unsprung mass = bad, but weight savings from not needing an axle or gearbox will outweigh this).  Suspension and steering design is then far easier, because there is no axle to need to keep straight.Braking redundancy will be achieved by having motors/brakes on all four wheels, and within each motor 3 independant phase coils with independant controllers, such that there are effectively 12 brakes on a car.   Normally the controllers work together for smooth braking, traction control, software differential, etc.  But even after 3+ failures braking performance should still be satisfactory for an emergency stop.Obviously braking energy needs to go somewhere.  In the happy case, it&#39;s regen&#39;ed into a battery.  If the battery can&#39;t accept it, it gets dumped into dump resistors.  If the dump resistors fail, it gets dumped into motor coils (of which there are 12 remember).  Obviously the motor coils will heat up very fast, so this is probably a one-use-only failsafe, like airbags.So the whole system (except the pedal itself) is 12 way redundant."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; When crashes do occur an engineer needs to spend time to diagnose how it happened and what caused it. Since Pingora&#39;s inception we’ve served a few hundred trillion requests and have yet to crash due to our service code.&gt; In fact, Pingora crashes are so rare we usually find unrelated issues when we do encounter one. Recently we discovered a kernel bug soon after our service started crashing. We&#39;ve also discovered hardware issues on a few machines, in the past ruling out rare memory bugs caused by our software even after significant debugging was nearly impossible.That&#39;s quite the endorsement of Rust. A lot of people focus on the fact that Rust can&#39;t absolutely guarantee freedom from crashes and memory safety issues. Which I think misses the point that this kind of experience of running high traffic Rust services in production for months almost without a single issue is common in practice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked for a company big enough to be in the HN headlines (sorry, have to stay somewhat anonymous) where development virtually stalled for a couple years after a mass exodus event. The CEO went on a rampage and fired some people on the spot for something they weren’t even responsible for, which destroyed the already fragile morale and created a steady exodus of good talent over a couple of years.It didn’t kill the company for several reasons, but primarily because:1) The company had enough momentum, revenue, and cash in the bank that they could go on hiring sprees to replace everyone. The new hires had a lot of churn when they realized what was going on, so they just kept hiring until enough replacements stuck around.2) Many of the employees who didn’t quit saw this as their opportunity to rise through the ranks and fill the voids. They weren’t wrong and it paid off for many of them in the form of rapid promotions and advancement. The CEO became more hands-off as he realized his micromanagement wasn’t helping, so they basically inherited a slightly better situation.After this experience, I don’t really see a developer exodus killing any big company with good momentum and decent cash reserves. As long as a company has cash flow they can spend their way into hiring replacements as long as it takes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Being a senior engineer is weird when looking retrospectively. I remember being a junior and experiencing what the author is talking about with respect to puzzlingly staring at my seniors when they could answer obscure questions.Now I do it and do the same things they did with me: facilitate my thought and troubleshooting process rather than give me answers. I think the people that are successful in Senior+ engineering are that way because of certain technical and character traits they&#39;ve developed.One is a willingness to be right in the long run. When I was a young engineer I would make my cases hard with data. As a senior engineer I sit back and let the machine mull for a while because I know that&#39;s what the engineering machine will do regardless of how technically right I may be. Another is knowing that right isn&#39;t always right. Sometimes the right answer is technically wrong, or the learnings of wrong need to be made before we collectively can be right. Another is a lot of patience; patience for myself, patience for others. I recently admitted I was behind on work because my power was out for three straight days. Young me would&#39;ve found a coffee shop and worked those days with a single monitor down to the bone. Senior me took my dog to the park.Not everyone makes it to senior, had I not forked my path in certain places I don&#39;t think I would have. My advice, relish your time as non-senior and ask lots of non-technical questions. The technical stuff comes over time and by necessity."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yes it’s a negative feedback loop created by the very bad product decisions they made to optimize for local maxima of getting more ads revenue. You inject more and more ads followed by more and more suggested content, thereby reducing the in network content. The in network content doesn’t get as much of traction, therefore people stop posting. This in turn forces the feed to have more and more suggestions and a few stale in network posts from days ago. This drives engagement down from people who want to see in network content and they leave. So what is left is people who do engage with suggested content, pushing the product to make decisions to push even more suggested content. All of this continues till eventually fatigue sets in and a sudden rapid drop in engagement kicks in because your global maxima of a quality product was lost long time ago and your product dies."</p>

And they already have all of that functionality built, so they could run significantly leaner, and hence not have to drive their remaining users away with excessive ads.This seems like a good idea to me.

Playing with a controller is slightly slower, and will take some getting used to (just as it does when playing with keyboard and mouse for the first time). After becoming familiar with it, I find it very comfortable. I recommend everyone to play through the first levels of our tutorial campaign, as it&#39;s a great way to get acquainted with playing Factorio with a controller."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Full post from Jack Conte&#39;s Instagram post:&#34;Hi everyone - I have some sad news to share: today, Patreon is doing a layoff of about 80 employees, about 17% of our team. This was ultimately my decision, so I wanted you all to hear directly from me about the reasoning.Before I do, I want to say two things: first, today will be painful for many people, and I am deeply sorry to the incredible teammates who will be leaving Patreon - they are good, kind, creator-first, exceptionally talented, and smart people.And second, I remember how nerve-racking it was when I was a full time creator - before starting Patreon - to watch companies that I depended on go through moments like this. So for those of you who rely on Patreon for your business and communities: I want to assure you that the company is making this move precisely for that reason - so we can continue to be a rock for your business.As the world has recovered from COVID lockdowns and entered a broader economic slowdown, it has become clear that the original plan we built doe he year, to support outsized growth through the pandemic, is no longer the right plan for the company.I take full responsibility for choosing that original path forward, and for the resulting changes today, which will be so difficult for our team.It&#39;s important to me that we continue to deliver for our creators and patrons with new features and products like native video, new content creation and organization tools, a wold-class mobile experience, and new ways for creators to grow their membership and strengthen their communities. To ensure that we make progress on that roadmap, we are increasing our investment in product, engineering, and design, which means decreasing our spend on other ares of the company.Ad difficult as this is fo our team, I know this is the right thing to do for Patreon, because it ensures that the company maintains a position of strength, even through an economic downturn, while continuing to deliver for our creators.If you want to read more about this decision, I just published the internal note I sent to our team this morning, and it&#39;s linked in my bio. I&#39;m going to stop posting here for a while to be 100% present internally for our teammates at the company. But I promise to come back in a bit - I will see you all soon.- Jack&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hard to overstate Godard&#39;s importance to the film world, both as a critic and a filmmaker. As a critic with Cahiers du Cinema he and others championed many forgotten Hollywood films and established one of the first recognizable &#39;canons&#39; of film -- one of the beginning points of film history as a subject. And unlike his predecessor and colleague Bazin, Godard went beyond theory to actually create films that embodied the radical new ideas about film that the Cahiers crowd promoted. I&#39;ve seen people in the thread mentioning Italian Neorealism, and some of the great Hollywood films of  the 50s, all fantastic examples of forward-thinking film art. But Godard and his contemporaries&#39; contributions were about synthesizing earlier developments with a pop-art bent in a way that destroyed established boundaries of the medium and paved the way for explosions of film creativity on the continent and beyond. His genius was finding a middle ground between directors like Hawks and Rosselini, or Ford and Renoir, and using that space to create indelible masterpieces. RIP JLG"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Le Mépris (Contempt) is by far my favourite movie, peak cinema. Absolutely stunning Mediterranean cinematography, beautiful coastal and indoor shots, a decent plot with Odysseus in the background, and certainly not hurt by Brigitte Bardot&#39;s onscreen presence. Overall unbeatable aesthetics.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0Ju0ONwGUWatching it is like taking a short vacation. Phenomenal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is hard to overstate how much Godard changed cinema, even in America. If you don’t believe me check for yourself. Open the best picture nominees between 55’-65’ and watch their trailers. Films like Marty/On the waterfront/12 angry men/To kill a mockingbird/The Caine Mutiny/Sweet smell of success is what movies were like in the late 50s.The acting/writing was pompous, actors talked like reciting Shakespear. The movies were about heros of impeccable character doing heroic things and there always was a happy ending. Movie shots followed strict guidelines and the creative head of the movie was the producer while the director was akin to a contractor, someone hired to film the scenes.Starting in the mid 60s there was a radical shift, topping the nominations we have films like Five Easy Pieces, The French Connection, The Godfather, One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, The Deer Hunter, Dog Day Afternoon, Taxi Driver etc. Actors would act and behave like normal everyday people facing everyday problems. The new Archetype is the Anti-Hero, someone with flaws/vices in their character, someone that viewers can relate to. We see the rise of the director as the auteur, the creative master of a film. Every known filmaking rule is being tested to it’s limits and broken by young experimenting directors.The catalyst for this change was the French New Wave, a group of young filmmakers tired of the old style of cinema wanting to do films about their own life and experiences. The poster boy for the New Wave was Jean-Luc Godard starting this revolution with his 1960 film Breathless."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I made an API for a bank...   I was a third party and made the API by screen scraping their webUI.   I sent their devs a link and initially there were positive messages going back and forth.The API allowed you to see balance, transaction history, and make payments.Before long, the API got quite popular, and lots of people were using it to make lots of payments automatically.You know what makes money laundering super easy...   a banking API so you can split the million dollars you want to launder into 1 million 1 dollar payments.   And an API client which lets you treat each login cookie and account as an object in python.Before long, the API and all users who had ever used it were perma-banned from the bank, because it was determined they posed too high a fraud/money-laundering risk.I&#39;m still salty because, after spending a week of my life building and refining that API, they banned me and 6 years later still claim they can&#39;t return the $350 that was in the account because they are still &#39;investigating&#39;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Anything that you can achieve with PDFs, presence, and persistence in a bank branch you can do with our API.Not sure how to take this. With a small tweak like &#34;you can eventually do&#34; I would let it pass without criticism.I work with bank cores, imaging, BSA and related middleware on a daily basis. The scope and complexity of these systems is incomprehensible to most. Many of our clients don&#39;t even try to think about how fucked up their business is. They prefer to hire Deloitte and other vendors like us to be stressed about it for them.To give you an idea of how comprehensive a &#34;full&#34; banking API is, our combined WSDL and XSD references total ~9 megabytes. This is before codegen. The final reference sources as generated into the .NET codebase total nearly 20 megabytes. This is just the types &amp; method signatures. The actual implementations live in an IBM system manufactured some time during the previous millennium.But, none of that really matters. Whatever API method you call against a specific bank will have behavior that ultimately depends on a million things specific to them _and the region within which they operate_. So, its not enough to simply integrate with this massive API. You also have to understand a multi-dimensional matrix of regulations, end-customer behaviors, technological constraints, active geopolitical affairs, et. al."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"W4 Games&#39;s CEO Juan Linietsky is the creator and lead dev of Godot. Their primary mission, from my understanding, is providing the non-open-source tooling and support that&#39;s needed to make it feasible to use Godot as an environment for developing console games. The SDK&#39;s and their APIs cannot be included in the FOSS Godot code directly.Juan shared a blog post about the state of console support in Godot shortly before the launch of W4 that gives some more insight: https://godotengine.org/article/godot-consoles-all-you-need-...Often time folks say that what Godot is missing is a &#34;killer app&#34; that shows that the platform is viable. I think that this could potentially go a long way towards that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve started using Godot (4.0-alpha) for some hobby game dev recently. In the past I&#39;ve done a fair amount with Unity and touched Unreal once or twice. Thoughts so far:Godot is far from perfect. It&#39;s definitely more sparse than the others in terms of features. I&#39;ve encountered some bugs (nothing show-stopping, and it&#39;s tough to say how much of that is just from using the alpha version, but it has impacted my flow). There are unfortunate quirks; for example, saving scripts always saves the whole scene, and saving large scenes can pause the editor for multiple seconds, which is a particularly annoying combination. The programming model is heavily OOP. The custom scripting language, GDScript, is a blessing and a curse; its tight integration with the engine comes at the cost of subpar tooling (and of course, just learning a new language with new quirks).But.Godot has the distinct feeling of being cohesive. It feels like it was designed by one person, who knows what it takes to make games, and set out with a holistic vision. Everything you might need to do has an answer, or at least a story. You don&#39;t get confusing mixed signals from different parts of the interface or from the docs; there&#39;s one, intentionally-designed way to do each thing. GDScript has its quirks, but it also has very elegant built-ins for doing engine-specific stuff that would be super clunky in a general-purpose language. Using Godot almost has the feeling of using (good) Apple software; somebody anticipated your needs, and made sure they&#39;d be met. Maybe not in the exact way you would have picked, but in a way that will work, and will fit in with everything else.That, combined with it being fully open-source, makes it feel like it has good bones. Especially in contrast with Unity - which felt like a growing pile of corpses being tossed on top of each other with each release - it&#39;s been so refreshing that it&#39;s singlehandedly gotten me back into hobby game dev. I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m wasting my time learning one half-baked API that&#39;s going to be replaced with another half-baked API six months from now. For every annoyance or missing feature in Godot, I have faith that things will continue to improve - because they&#39;re built on a solid foundation - or that I could at least build it myself if I really needed to.I believe in the vision and the future of this piece of software. And that makes it feel worthwhile to invest the time learning all its quirks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice! I don&#39;t think W4 has created any games though. To get some REAL traction, Godot needs some full well-known games published. Basically, we need a game to do to Godot, what Undertale and Nuclear Throne did to GameMaker.We have Wrought Flesh by Miziziziz, but other than that I can&#39;t think of a single game actually produced by Godot. I know it is capable of it, but we need a &#34;killer app&#34; to make it really blow up."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve read GEB over many years rather in the way someone would read the Bible.  I pick it up from time to time and enjoy chewing on one or two chapters of material.But I&#39;ve yet to figure out if the book actually has a specific thesis.  I know it&#39;s all about the power of interpretation and the way in which interpreting a formal system as self-referencing has the effect of completely blowing up the intended design of that system.  But can someone sum up how this connects to consciousness beyond the obvious way in which consciousness plays the role of the interpreter?  Or is that itself the thesis of the book?  Or maybe that consciousness is the originator of self-reference?Bottom line is that I think the thesis can be summed up in a few sentences, but apparently it takes a whole 800 page book to get to the point.  Would love other people&#39;s thoughts on what that point is ultimately.  By the way, as salty as I sound about it, I love GEB.  So don&#39;t get me wrong :)."</p>

This is by design. You can apply them to almost anything. Almost everything &#34;is a graph&#34;, or &#34;recursion&#34; if you formulate them to be so."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The cost of building a consumer audio product is generally no more than 30% of retail. 30% COGS (cost of goods sold) is virtually a maximum for items sold at mainstream retailers.There’s nothing wrong with this. These are standard ratios, not some dirty secret.The cost of goods sold is only a fraction of the costs that go into getting products all the way into the customers’ hands and supporting them (customer support, warranty replacements, lost shipments, fraudulent orders, etc.). That’s not even counting the R&amp;D investment costs that go into making the product, as the post says.Salaries, warehousing, shipping, insurance, and all of the others costs of doing business add up.It’s not actually realistic to expect an entire company to be selling you a $300 product that costs them something like $250 to build. Every business in existence must build in enough margin to pay the people who do all of the work to make it happen and support it.If this seems shocking, consider that the COGS of software as a service products are much lower by comparison. Doesn’t matter, though, because you have to pay all of those expensive salaries to make it happen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems to apply across the entire Small Plastic-covered Electronics sector.  I worked for an instrumentation/sporting goods manufacturer among others and this reads like I wrote it myself.The CEO, even of a small operation, likely has no idea what the performance characteristics of their devices are.  They exist to raise capital and deal with paperwork.We operated at about a 25% bom cost which was muuuuch higher than it needed to be but we were the aforementioned $50 components assembled by baboons case.  The products were very high end meters and sensors with the electrical sophistication of a McDonalds toy, just using whatever the highest end parts Arrow et al would sell us.Like they aluded to, ultimately it&#39;s all the little stuff that gets you.  Packaging, whatever voodoo the S&amp;M team is up to, random IT bullshit, heath insurance, random FCC compliance stuff, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Years ago I visited a friend in emmm..., &#34;Europe&#34;. He was not home and the neighbour let us in. He asked us to entertain ourselves until he gets back. It took little time to notice the pair of speakers: 50cm cubes, almost. I managed to turn them on and connect them to the TV. There I heard the most lifelike sound I ever heard from any speakers. I wondered: these should be some crazy European brand... no brand names anywhere on the boxes.Later that night I asked about the speakers and he went: &#34;What? They sound good?&#34;It turns out his friend works at &#34;Insert big European brand, not only audio here&#34; and they decided to make a great pair of speakers. Then he brings home a measurement device north of 6 figure €s, and they tune it so that you would not be able to distinguish a person talking behind you, from the recording of them being played with these speakers... Or as close you can get to that.Then they take their product to the company only to be laughed at: &#34;for anything below 5000€, we don&#39;t use any part above 50€. You have parts north of 500, this is not feasible for the market.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a degree in Studio Arts in addition to being a software developer (and recently I&#39;ve started making a lot of creative work with AI). Back when I was in school, there was already plenty of debate about &#39;what is &#34;Art&#34;&#39;? It&#39;s always been hotly contested. Most of my teachers felt that &#39;technique&#39; was not Art. Others were more purists – life painters, etc – and felt that, no, technique is art.Duchamp poked the art establishment in the eye with his &#39;readymades&#39; (urinals on the gallery wall, etc.) Warhol with his &#39;factory&#39; making silkscreens.The &#39;reverse Monet&#39; (too lazy to link) that caused such an uproar when it was shared last week was ironic – apparently people aren&#39;t aware that the impressionists themselves were considered &#39;not artists&#39; by a lot of people at the time.The camera and photography made many painters sit up and say, &#39;hey, it can&#39;t just be about &#34;image&#34; anymore&#39; – enter abstract expressionism, fauvism, cubism, etc. Work that shifted the focus from the image represented in the painting (&#39;a window into a world&#39;) onto the surface of the canvas itself: Rothko, Albers, etc.The thing is, people have wild misconceptions about what this technology does. Many clearly think it&#39;s a photocopier. As if StableDiffusion is hiding copies of all these works inside. When in fact what&#39;s been done is to take all of this online knowledge and create an incredible new tool with it. Like a music synthesizer times a million.It&#39;s understandable why this technology makes people uncomfortable. There are legit fears about displacement, economic uncertainty, etc. But we are fundamentally tool makers – it&#39;s arguably intrinsically part of what makes us human (borrowing from Carl Sagan&#39;s &#34;Dragons of Eden&#34;).If I were back in the art department last century, I&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;d be really excitedly discussing how these new tools will enable entirely new forms of expression. And sure, there&#39;d be the old guard saying it was awful, and &#39;not Art&#39;.This is a really interesting debate – I just wish it scratched deeper than the surface more often than it does, with a bit more historical context."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Aside from the debates about &#34;artistic merit&#34; and the ethics of using AI trained on existing artists&#39; work, one of the key things is that this new technology allows anyone to flood a place with images.There are some scifi-themed subreddits that I visit that allow posting art, and at this point it feels like 50% of all submissions are Midjourney/Dall-E generated art. Fine, it looks ok, but there&#39;s such a low barrier to creating and posting these, it&#39;s beginning to drown out other valuable content. The article even speaks about this:&gt; In July, one AI furry porn generator was uploading one image every 40 seconds"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s important to keep in mind that these art communities represent one very narrow kind of art, one that is more focused on illustration and graphical style, and most often not the kind of art that major art institutions work with. In the past 5 years, AI-generated art has been accepted and incorporated in the contemporary art world, with major works produced by luminaries such as Pierre Huyghe (of Ideal), Trevor Paglen (Bloom), and Hito Steyerl (Power Plants). For these artists, the graphical potency of the generated images is usually only one factor of the work, which also centers on how the artists use the technology, its origins, history, and broader uses, and what it might imply.For this kind of artwork, the kind made by artists who feel threatened by AI, I’ve been thinking for a while that a computer could likely do it better. Intricate detail, repetition, sampling and recombination of popular styles, optimization for aesthetic popularity and mass appeal — these practices are all squarely in the domain of automation, data science, and marketing. We might call it the Netflix-ification of illustration art, but it’s quite different, because the tools for making are available to many. As an arts educator and artist, I welcome these new tools, as they allow easy experimentation for newcomers, but also as they reveal that art based primarily in deployment of technical skill and eye-popping graphics is missing something vital."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The UK media (not just the BBC) continue to profess &#34;amazement&#34; at the speed and efficiency of the transitioning from a dead monarch to a living one. There&#39;s been much speaking in awed tones at the pace of the various proclamations, committee meetings, document signings, etc, as if this pace tells us why we should be impressed.Personally I&#39;ve found it borderline sickening.If there was a curtain that could have slipped, we all knew what would be behind it: a bunch of cherry-nosed coffin-dodgers with old-school-tie chums ensconced in the machinery of state, parliament, the military, whatever.Sure. Fine. Yadda yadda, blah blah. The &#34;deep state&#34; dancing hand-in-hand with the old school elites. Yuck. Disgusting but hardly a clear and present danger.But to see this machinery spring rustily, creakily into action has been truly eye-opening. Hitherto unknown people wearing ritualistic outfits have marched into public spaces in several cities, and declared that a member of the elite has been replaced, the continuum is unbroken. And this has been broadcast 24/7 by pretty much all media in the UK and in other countries. Elected representatives from all political parties have fallen into line.It is not okay to ritualistically march a bunch of military-state personnel into multiple public spaces across the country, under the protection of the police and with the consent of multiple international media outlets, and expect public passivity and capitulation.And yet, that&#39;s what has happened. And it keeps happening.It&#39;s bizarre in the extreme, and we really should not be okay with this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They aren’t being arrested for being anti-monarchy though.They are being arrested for being rude about it.Was the fella on radio 4 who stated to the entire nation that ‘King Charles and his family should be put in a council house and that the Monarchy should be abolished’ arrested? No.If you are going to attend a funeral, any funeral, be it the Queen’s or anyone else’s and hurl abuse or hold up signs with obscenities, you will be arrested.There were arrests in which the arrestee has been unarrested, when the police made a mistake. Like the fella who stated that ‘we didn’t vote for him’ when King Charles was pronounced King.You can, quite legally, protest the Monarchy. Being a dick about it and trying to upset people mourning will however be considered a breach of the peace or some other public order offence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The new law allows police to act in cases which they deem to be &#34;unjustifiably noisy protests that may have a significant impact on others&#34; or seriously disrupt an organization&#39;s activities.Doesn&#39;t take a political science degree to see what&#39;s wrong with this law. When cops get to decide what is a justifiably loud protest and what isn&#39;t you no longer have the right to protest. Protests are meant to disrupt, if you can&#39;t be loud about it then it no longer has its intended effect."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Riding a bike doesn&#39;t need to be the only or primary way that people get around in every city, all the time, for it to drastically improve quality of life for people living in cities the world over. Most people are capable of riding a bike - especially an e-bike - to get to where they&#39;re going. It&#39;s cheaper than a car, it can be faster than driving a car, and it is obviously better for both the global climate and the local environment.More than half of all daily trips in the US are less than 3 miles[1]. If cities give people the option to ride a bike for those shorter trips without feeling unsafe, a lot of people will ride bikes to complete those trips. That&#39;s shown over and over again. Change is hard, but a future with less cars and more trips by bike and public transportation is better, and possible.[1] https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1230-marc..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just bought a bike in Bangkok.To be honest it sat in my living room for a week because of the fear of riding it on these most dangerous streets. (Bangkok has bad reputation for accidents worldwide).But today I took it out.I rode to work and it was amazing. People here respect two wheels a lot and drivers slow down for you.Normally I’d walk to work for the exercise 3km. Which is about 45 minutes for me each way.But today the riding took about 10-15 minutes with a great cardio workout.I’ll take the bike out most of the week now instead of taking a cab.Here motorcycles are the mainstay. But I’ll stick with my bike for shorter distances and cabs for longer ones."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t understand take that this is not possible due to disabled people, winter, hills. Climate and city planning is an incremental problem. Just 2 new bike lanes significantly change the way I am able to commute, even far into the winter, and when it’s raining or snowing I switch to car or public transport. I live in a reasonably bike friendly city for us standards, and it’s clear that some overhauls have made the road much more efficient for cars themselves, pedestrians don’t stray out nearly as much into the road, as did the consolidation of parking spots into parking lots. Just go see some European cities for how not only public transport, biking and a more modern street layout make life better for almost everyone.For disabled people, having dedicated parking spots as well as a pedestrian friendly street layout makes life easier than having to navigate a busy street.Make the city better for bike doesn’t mean making it hell for cars."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m glad this research is being done. I don’t use cannabis, but I also don’t frown upon it. However some of the conversations on the use of cannabis recently have changed from “it’s a drug, but it isn’t that bad” to “it is completely harmless”. Which in my opinion is very dangerous and could harm entire populations before we have enough research. In my opinion, it should be considered similar category as alcohol, cigarettes, fat and sugar, a national health issue and research needs to happen asap on various short term and long term effects."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is this really surprising?Any time I had used cannabis I felt like my IQ dropped 20-30 points and I would lose hours of my day where it was difficult for me to learn. It made doing household chores not terrible, but brought out a lot of panic inducing moments and erratic behavior. I was thinking about a 100k other things while doing one thing. Later on I realized I wasn&#39;t even doing that one thing so well. Anything that drops cognitive abilities for a moment is going to be awful long term and especially for babies.I know a lot of people think cannabis isn&#39;t bad, but it is intellectually dishonest to disregard the broader effects of effects on cognition. I say that as someone who used to smoke a ton of cannabis.Not having to rely on drugs to find calmness has made a profound change in my life, and I can&#39;t believe that I used to turn to weed, alcohol, etc. when all I needed to be permanently (key word) happy was already present within me. Prior, when the effects went away I spent just as much time craving and suffering heavily.That being said I don&#39;t think it should be criminalized or anything like that. It is up to adults to do whatever, but it is useful to be honest as well. Not everyone uses it for epilepsy, none of the dispensaries here sell CBD products. Its all high THC products meant to &#34;fuck you up&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The amount of research over last decade has been huge, even outside of this. It used to be the only way companies could research cannabis was by getting really crappy samples from a government grow house, but with legalization the supply of research samples and the quality of researchers willing to work on it has grown considerably.This is a direct safety issue. I used to moderator one of the bigger cannabis subreddits and one of the bigger questions that always came up was whether it was safe to smoke while pregnant. The answer I always gave was that we just don&#39;t know, and so it should be avoided. The lack of research though meant that people couldn&#39;t make informed decisions, and the stereotype around cannabis being safe meant that people did not always err on the side of caution. Now there is something concrete we can point to."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"With a few tweaks (monospaced variant), it could make a great coding font.Coding fonts have essentially the same goal: make similar looking characters different: 1liI|, 0O, etc... Code naturally strains our visual acuity: we want to see as much as possible, it means that we may use a smaller font size than we would find comfortable reading text with. Single letter, punctuation, etc... can be really important, in regular text, you can understand even if you can&#39;t read all the characters. So a hyperlegible font can help coders, even those with good vision, and many coding fonts already have &#34;hyperlegible&#34; features."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I also find the website confusing, the font is available here however  
https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Atkinson+Hyperlegible"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminder that fonts are subjective.This one is good for specific people, not everyone. I can&#39;t use it because I find it overly rounded with tics.An example of a font that is also meant to be legible, but is on the squarish side, is Tiresias Screenfont.Increased legibility does NOT mean &#34;flow&#34;. Just because each character is more &#34;distinct&#34; does not mean that the whole word is able to be processed with ease. Important to evaluate them in body text.Also, one&#39;s cultural background absolutely affects which fonts are preferred. If you grew up with German blackletter writing, you&#39;re not necessarily going to like or appreciate a sans-serif font. In Germany&#39;s case, the change from blackletter to latin shapes happened fairly recently (WW2). It&#39;s happening now again, Kazakhstan has decided to stop using cyrillic and change to latin characters."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To be honest, what I love about legos is the free play aspect.When I play with my kids, (now 8 and 10), I find that the key thing is not what pieces we have (admittedly, we have a lot of pieces), or instructions, but developing some theme or challenge.The theme could be ‘space’ or ‘under water’ or ‘I’m going to build the taller possible leg structure’ or ‘I’m going to build a vehicle that can be blown across the floor with a fan.’  Once they have a theme, they will do amazing stuff.Also, I believe it’s important to have a big slush pile of pieces.  It’s amazing how much builds change when your are scrounging for piece X, and you see piece Y and think, actually…I see that this app is technologically interesting for the developer, but it doesn’t address my core problem: inspiring kids to get started on free creativity.  For that, I’d more like a Lego theme of the day app, maybe slightly inspired or guided by the kids ages or genders.  If I did that, I’d have the kids submit pictures of their results, and use those over time to assess and improve the quality of my suggested themes at different ages and Lego piles sizes (there is your AI, if you must).The pitch would be ‘inspire your kids to new creativity.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just tested it on my kids lego clone bricks; there are like 800 of them but they are almost exclusively basic shapes (1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 2x3, 2x4 and 1x4) in red/black/blue/green/yellow/gray. This is a picture of the box: https://static-v3.e-jumbo.gr/uploads/resources/137879/201611... ; you&#39;ll see they are exactly like legos.The app identified 400 pieces (of the 800) and unfortunately the resulting ideas were not possible to be constructed because it required pieces we don&#39;t have. Of the 50 ideas I was only able to construct 1 or 2 that had very few pieces.I tried it a couple of times with diferent layout in pieces or lights, nothing really changed.Sorry but it doesn&#39;t work, at least with my kind of bricks."</p>

It&#39;s quite a polished UI, but there are a lot of features missing. The first ones that come to mind are:- No way to specify a seed. This is an important part of SD workflows, letting you redo an image with a slightly tweaked a prompt.- No way to specify a custom model. Alternative models (such as Waifu Diffusion) are fun to play with too.- No way to generate batches of images.- No way to specify which sampler to use.- No way to adjust the weight of specific sub-phrases, or use negative weights.There&#39;s also no img2img yet, but it sounds like that&#39;s a planned feature.Other GUIs such as https://github.com/sd-webui/stable-diffusion-webui, https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui have many more features - but not all will be trivial to port to M1.P.S.: For the people asking - yes, it can do NSFW images. I checked."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can confirm that this works great on the M1 Max. It has been taking less than a minute to run the model and generate the images.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Some have A records pointing to the root servers. I’m not sure why this is - I think it might be because no DNS has been configured in the TLD zone for these TLDs.I was also curious about this. It turns out that it&#39;s because dig interprets some TLDs as DNS record types (MD, MG, MR, MX) or DNS classes (IN and CH) of the same name! Not sure why, but when given only a type or class (without a domain name), dig actually queries for a list of the root servers, which explains the strange results. Looks like using the -q option to specify the domain name works around this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was responsible for the Turbo C (later Borland C/C++) run-time library in the late 80s and early 90s.Tanj Bennett created our original 8087 floating point emulator. It was real mode, 16-bit code, that kept an 80-bit float in five 16-bit CPU registers as a working value during its internal math calculations. If you ever coded for the PC you will appreciate just how precious register space was on the 8086/8088.It&#39;s been a few decades and my memory is fuzzy but I don&#39;t recall any critical places where the registers had to be saved and restored. He choose math algorithms and code paths specifically to keep all five live at all times. Tanj&#39;s code flowed with an economy of motion that brought to mind the artistic performance of a professional dance troupe. I did not have the math skill and could not have ever created it as he had. It brought me genuine pleasure just to read his code.Eventually, it came time to port it to 32-bits (real and protected modes.) I wrote new exception handlers and replaced the instruction-decode logic with a nice table-driven scheme but did not touch the core math library. It still ran in 16-bits under the hood exactly as Tanj designed it.Tanj, if you happen to see this, I have fond memories of your emulator. It was beautiful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nobody has mentioned Knuth’s corpus of work in Pascal-Web for the TeX ecosystem. This is code written for an era where there wasn’t an ecosystem of libraries for common tasks and even things like being able to access a file in random access order couldn’t be counted on. Even 7-bit ASCII couldn’t be counted on as a given (EBCDIC-based IBM mainframes were a significant element of the computing landscape still).Against all that, Knuth wrote code that could be ported to other systems (I first used TeX on an IBM mainframe running VM/CMS, then later on a VAX minicomputer running VMS, then on a PC with DOS, PC with OS/2, PC with Windows and now a Mac with OS X/MacOS. His presentation of code and internal documentation intermingled is something which I could see still being useful now, although sadly, literate programming seems all but dead now. I still go back to Knuth’s code to understand how to solve some problems on occasion even though it’s about 30 years since I last wrote a line of Pascal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Using three separate identification strategies we show that, controlling for own-vehicle weight, being hit by a vehicle that is 1000 pounds heavier generates a 40–50% increase in fatality risk. [...] We consider two policies for internalizing this external cost, a weight-varying mileage tax and a gas tax, and find that they are similar for most vehicles. The findings suggest that European gas taxes may be much closer to optimal levels than the US gas tax.In an environment of wealth inequality, this seems like another way that the wealthy can benefit: easily afford to drive heavier vehicles that increase their personal safety while increasing the lethal threats against the poor.How about instead: if larger vehicles are more dangerous for the population overall, then they should be banned for everyone, not only effectively off-limits to the poor."</p>

This is in the Caddy 2.6 beta already: https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/releases/tag/v2.6.0-bet... - please try it out!Thanks to Marten Seemann for maintaining the quic-go library we use. (I still haven&#39;t heard whether Go will add HTTP/3 to the standard library.)Caddy 2.6 should be the first stable release of a general-purpose server to support and enable standardized HTTP/3 by default. HTTP versions can be toggled on or off. (Meaning you can serve only HTTP/3 exclusively if you&#39;re hard-core.)PS. Caddy 2.6 will be our biggest release since 2.0. My draft release notes are about 23 KB. We&#39;re looking at huge performance improvements and powerful new features like events, virtual file systems, HTTP 103 Early Hints, and a lot of other enhancements I&#39;m excited to show off on behalf of our collaborators!"</p>

I recently added IPv6 which also &#34;just works.&#34;greenpau/caddy-security is fantastic and &#34;just works&#34; for OIDC sso.mholt, thanks for recently adding the ability to bind to multiple specific IP addresses by default, this help me conserve precious public IPv4 addresses."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very neat. They write:&gt; In this course, we’ll be looking for the following trifecta: (i) ideas that are non-obvious, even to the well-trained computer scientist, so that we’re not wasting your time; (ii) conceptually simple — realistically, these are the only ideas that you might remember a year or more from now, when you’re a start-up founder, senior software engineer, PhD student, etc. (iii) fundamental, meaning that there is some chance that the idea will prove useful to you in the future.In the first lesson, they discuss consistent hashing, and they seem to have achieved their goals.ETA: Must include this anecdote on the history of the algorithm:1. 1997: The implementation of consistent hashing given in this lecture first appeared in a research paper in STOC (“Symposium on the Theory of Computing”) [...] Ironically, the paper had previously been rejected from a theoretical computer science conference because at least one reviewer felt that “it had no hope of being practical.”2. 1998: Akamai is founded.3. March 31, 1999: A trailer for “Star Wars: The Phantom Menace” is released online, with Apple the exclusive official distributor. apple.com goes down almost immediately due to the overwhelming number of download requests. For a good part of the day, the only place to watch (an unauthorized copy?) of the trailer is via Akamai’s Web caches. This put Akamai on the map.4. April 1, 1999: Steve Jobs, having noticed Akamai’s performance the day before, calls Akamai’s President Paul Sagan to talk. Sagan hangs up on Jobs, thinking it’s an April Fool’s prank by one of the co-founders, Danny Lewin or Tom Leighton."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"VMLS by Stephen Boyd (also of Stanford) would be great background reading for the vector/matrix stuff (i.e. most of this course): https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18678314I love this book. As opposed to the way that linear algebra is typically introduced, this book focuses on concrete applications (like text analysis, image/signal processing, finance, ML, etc.) and eschews more arcane concepts (like eigen). To me, building practical intuition is the best way to learn* the subject.A more advanced but still accessible manuscript by Boyd et al: Generalized Low Rank Models (establishes connections between PCA/SVD and many other matrix factorization methods, and shows you how to roll your own): https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/glrm.pdf"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a really elegant point.&gt; Doing upfront authorization of powers is relatively efficient, and is also pleasingly self regulating. If an agency overloads or confuses its ex ante regulator, they simply won’t get permission to do things. This provides a strong incentive for clear and concise requests to the regulator.It is very easy for regulators, even well-meaning, to focus on what they require of an individual transaction.  But we live in a world where automation and dynamic workforces make it possible to break every expectation about how a system will be used."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That last line made me laugh, but it&#39;s funny because it&#39;s true. It&#39;s down to the &#34;sit where you&#39;re sitting&#34; effect.Noam Chomsky famously told Andrew Marr during an interview that he was sure Marr was sincere and believed everything he was saying, but if he&#39;d believed anything else, he wouldn&#39;t sit where he was sitting.It follows from that true observation that the only time such appointed watchdogs (whether oversight board members or news personalities) are actually doing something, is when they quit, or at least threaten to quit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find it interesting that the Dutch push to change the intelligence law coincides with a similar one currently taking place in my home country of Romania.I wonder if these are actually part of a more coordinated attempt to tacitly make the (broadly speaking) West more authoritarian and tightly controlled."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To be clear, this is an extremely tiny subset of JS. It looks like they only implemented the features needed to run a very specific function. For example, the only symbol allowed after &#34;new&#34; is &#34;Date&#34;, everything else throws an exception.It&#39;s still fun that it&#39;s there, but it&#39;s not as big a deal as it sounds from the tweet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anyone who has ever pulled a website from a script knows the pain that is Javascript. Normally you want to just get some text and work out the API actions but a lot of sites use horribly obfuscated Javascript -- either because that&#39;s what modern web development is (lolz) -- or because its part of their &#39;security.&#39; That means if you want to write browser-based bots properly -- you ought to use a browser. There are special browsers that run &#39;headlessly&#39; or are designed mostly for bot use. Like https://www.selenium.dev/ which plugs into a few different &#39;browser engines.&#39;But now you have another problem. Your simple script goes from being small, simple, self-contained, and elegant gem, to requiring a full browser, specialized drivers, and/or daemons running just to work. If you&#39;re using something like Python you just frankly don&#39;t have very good packaging. So it&#39;s hard to string together all that into a solution and have it magically work for everyone. What YouTube-dl have done is good engineering. Even though it&#39;s not a full JS interpreter: they&#39;ve kept their software lean, self-contained, and easier to use."</p>

His follow-up gig became WebOS[0]Back then it was called DHTML or Dynamic HTML and then evolved into the HTML5 standard later on. The syntax of React &amp; Vue is just too weird for me. Frankly I&#39;ve reached a framework fatigue after learning jQuery inside out which was a hard-won battle, and then having to learn React/Vue/Svelte just to stay &#39;in the game&#39; is too much for me.

As the web became more popular, websites started to add more functionality similar to traditional software programs.Eventually, the original guideline of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity started to not really make sense anymore for many websites, because as pages became more interactive, the lines became blurred. If you look at a site like GMail, where does the page structure end and interactivity begin?With large parts of a page being interactive, it becomes difficult to manage all the state involved, especially if it’s a “live” page that updates in real time and may have several people viewing it.Frameworks were introduced as a way to manage state and allow websites to re-render efficiently without hard page refreshes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember when I was a young assembly programmer and I looked down on those obtuse C programmers who needed such a slow high-level language. After high-school, having read all those fantastic W. Richard Stevens books I simply could not understand why anybody on earth wanted to use C++ when C was easily capable of modeling complex object structures. When they forced us to use Java, I was deeply in shock: was this really a programming language or more a toy for little kids and why would they want to slow down computers to a crawl?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The &#34;letters to the editor&#34; are really fun to read -- it&#39;s like reading the HN comments of the time, with the same combination of insight and cynicism.&gt; In response to Gregg Williams&#39; editorial (&#34;The New Generation of Human- Engineered Software,&#34; April, p. 6), the mouse of Lisa, Visi On, and their predecessor, the Xerox Star, is a truly fascinating hardware device, and on those few occasions that I have seen these devices in use, I have been impressed. But the mouse is not revolutionary, and, as its name suggests, it is really nothing more than a rodent. Its functional predecessor was the light pen. Some years ago, light pens were fashionable devices for selecting a particular function, and they are still in use. But displays attaching light pens had to have an appropriate phosphor, and they were not as easy to program as function keys. About the same time, touch- sensitive screens were introduced, and they are still used in applications such as online catalogs in libraries; here, too, however, programming appears to be the chief stumbling block.&gt; If the name of the game is &#34;ease of use,&#34; the industry would be far wiser to develop touch-sensitive displays than mice. Because a display has no moving parts, it is likely to prove more durable than a mouse. And a finger placed on a display screen does not require additional desk space, as a mouse does. If an executive were having an office conference, don&#39;t you think he might rather touch his screen a couple of times than roll a mouse around his desk pressing buttons on it?&gt; There are, obviously, many considerations at work in the development of new products. My bet, simply stated, is that the mouse is not a viable product. At best, it will limp along like bubble memory. - John P. Rash, President, Acorn Data Ltd.There&#39;s also:- Several refutations to a previous letter which claimed CRT monitors are a radiation hazard- An engineer from Intel responding to criticisms of their FORTRAN compiler with &#34;those issues have been fixed in the latest version&#34;- Debate over structured programming and strong typing- Debate on what &#34;computer literacy&#34; means and whether the general population needs it (including a claim that WYSYWIG editors and desktop file managers do not make computers easier to use because &#34;a desktop manager is only a sophisticated analog for being able to copy one file into another&#34;)- Conversations on software prices and piracy- And, of course, someone pointing out a typo in an article."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The things that made C successful are rarely recognized even by its fans, but much moreso by its critics and competitors. Things it is most criticized for are among them. They have made C hard to unseat. Too-easy conversion between arrays and pointers is one such criticism, but such conversion was essential to its success.C++ succeeded not just because it can call C libraries -- most languages can -- but because it retained every advantage C has, even those that few recognize. C++&#39;s STL is a success because it built on what made C a success, deliberately. Alex Stepanov, anyway, understood. Most STL components are really just examples.Today we are locked in battle against C&#39;s weaknesses, particularly in how easy it is to exploit C programs. We lose that battle when new languages leave behind what made C successful. Too-easy accidental conversions bad; deliberate conversions possible, good.C got various other things subtly right, too: manifestly enough to make up for its blatant failings. If you would displace C, it is much more important to retain its strengths than to fix its flaws. You can do that without understanding by copying. Retaining strengths while leaving behind flaws requires understanding, which has proven too hard for most."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The profit motive is being blamed here for optimizing for engagement.But how do you assess progress when you remove all desire to monetize?I run r/WallStreetBets and &#34;quality&#34; is an extremely nebulous term.I look for things like &#34;novelty&#34;, &#34;thought-provoking / well reasoned commentary&#34;, &#34;original content&#34;, &#34;authenticity&#34;, &#34;self-awareness&#34; or &#34;primary research&#34;. But these are human assessed metrics.Some more easily measurable metrics might include, &#34;length of submissions&#34;, or &#34;number of outbound links excluding blacklisted domains&#34;. Or even &#34;number of tickers or quality-correlated keywords mentioned&#34;.All these metrics have very clear downsides, and if generally well-known, become useless. Interestingly, a score too high can also result in something being unlikely to be authentic.Another challenge is your relationship with users. Surprisingly, moderators are not innately adversarial to users, they can also promote content through other channels (discord, twitter) or sticky threads for a viewership boost.So, even without a profit motive, what do you do?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good article, though I think it missed explicitly making the point that the reason &#34;engagement&#34; is the metric is because that&#39;s what platforms monetize. Engagement is a euphemism for attention, and social platforms exist to sell your to advertisers.Since the article is written for &#34;community builders,&#34; understanding that engagement is a metric to quantify the advertising potential of a platform should make it obvious that people who aren&#39;t in the business of selling attention to advertisers don&#39;t need to copy social media and optimize for engagement; instead they should target better measurements of value creation for their community. Of course Goodhart&#39;s law[1] still applies.1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law(edited for readability)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I enjoyed the Monsters Inc reference and the turning of it on its head central to this piece.  But we&#39;ve said/argued this for years and at the end of the day engagement = ad reach = profits and until the economics there change any for-profit social media will gravitate towards engagement.  Hell ANY media gravitates toward engagement and outrage bait.  An actual community built around Mastodon seems possible, and there&#39;s community discussions around private group chats but they will always remain niche and not profitable.I don&#39;t get what https://savannahhq.com is and what the value add is there but that seems to be what he&#39;s interested in, niche + small communities."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked in public accounting with some major corporations as clients. Every single company I interacted with used SAP. It is the de facto software in its field and is deeply entrenched. Its UX is the most horribly wicked thing I’ve ever come across. We would conduct walkthroughs with process control owners that showed us what they would do in SAP to perform their job functions, and it would take multiple, intelligent people to capture all of the processes. The knowledge that the users at the client had built up was extensive and highly specialized. If something happened to that person, I don’t think you could quickly plug in a new person and have them take over. The initial learning curve felt far too high. I’m sure it gave those people a sense of job security.I feel there is a lot of room to develop better tools that are not so horrid, however, the process for replacing SAP will be long and close to impossible. SAP feels like one of those businesses that’s too big to fail because it’s so entrenched in the corporate world. Somewhat jokingly, I think it would be easier to switch the US over to the metric system. Any challenger will have to be massive, accept losses for over a decade to gain market share, and have incredible support for their clients if they ever want to takeover in the Fortune 500 world. Challenges too great for a mere startup to accomplish.It’s easier to just hire people to learn the SAP workflow and then hire external auditors to make sure the accounting policies are properly being followed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My mother works for a fairly large textile lab. For decades, they used an internally developed system for lab reports (they had a few programmers and admins they called the &#34;nerds&#34; that did nothing else than extend and maintain the system). The company switched to a SAP solution a few years ago. Chaos ensued. The SAP solution missed so many edge cases that a huge number of lab reports were either inaccurate or completely wrong because information was lost in SAP translation between different labs. Sometimes clients (huge international players) noticed the mistakes, which then led to costly product delays. It became so bad that communication between labs eventually had to be done on two levels - within SAP, and &#34;informally&#34; by mail, telephone, or by simply walking to the other lab, adding a huge time overhead to every report.SAP removed virtually every automation advantage of the old system, and added the additional complexity of navigating the SAP GUI. Because of this additional workload and the reluctance of the company to hire more people to counter it (after all, SAP was implemented to streamline everything!), employee turnover suddenly skyrocketed. Everytime I talk with my mother, she complains about the system and tells me that another colleague has quit. She only stays because she only has 2 years until retirement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am an SAP developer since kind of forever, my first job after university (since 2009). First I hated it, but the deeper I am entrenched, the more I see why you choose SAP: Because there really is no alternative. The data model is so complex because it is growing iteratively since the 80s. Hacker News is valuing businesses that adjust to the customer instead of going for some kind of purity. Another complexity especially now is the different paradigm changes in between. ABAP, the programming language of SAP, is quite nice nowadays. CDSViews are a great invention, and so on. There&#39;s really a lot of innovation buried in the bad documentation, it&#39;s getting better. In summary as bad as it is, I don&#39;t see an alternative for all of the backoffice work. SAP is really flexible and supports a lot of different processes. A thing that makes it so costly is a lot of time culture, no small releases, MVP, and so on. But you can be agile with SAP, especially if you move to the cloud."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well this part is very familiar:&gt;  its work was given prominence in the engineering operation by former Chief Technology Officer Michael Schroepfer, who announced last year that he was stepping down.At the end of 2016, I joined Twitter to lead one of the anti-abuse engineering teams. My boss, who led the effort, was great: loved Twitter, hated abuse, very smart. 6 months later the CTO, who had been behind the creation of the anti-abuse engineering effort, left. My boss, previously gung ho, left in a way that made me think he was getting signals from his boss. And shortly after that, said boss&#39;s boss said that our team had succeeded so well that there was no need for us. He scattered the engineers, laid of the managers, me included, and declared victory. We all laughed bitterly.What these have in common for me is a high-level executive launching a special team with great fanfare in a way that addresses a PR problem. But because PR problems are generally fleeting, as soon as do-goodery loses its executive sponsor, everybody goes right back to the short-term incentives, meaning things like &#34;responsibility&#34; go right out the door. At least beyond the level that will trigger another PR disaster.And if you&#39;re wondering why you don&#39;t hear more about things like this, you&#39;re not supposed to. At least for the managers laid off, it was a surprise meeting and then getting walked out the door. In the surprise meeting, they offered a fair chunk of money (for me, $40k) to sign an additional NDA plus non-disparagement agreement. I happen to have a low burn rate and good savings, so I didn&#39;t sign. But I know plenty of people who have looked at the mortgage and kid expenses versus the sudden lack of income and eventually signed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi, orsond from the fifth column here.The Fifth Column is a Minecraft hacking and griefing group. We created Project Copenhiemer which is a Minecraft server scanning tool. Copenhiemer scans the internet every 20 minutes for minecraft servers, logs players, server versions, mods and more.Originally we had created it to find players and grief their server worlds, highlighting how much information about players is leaked from Mojangs default server configuration. They have put some features into the game to stop this information from being leaked but have made it an opt in system which no one uses or is even aware of.We have become increasingly worried about the direction of Mojang&#39;s safety policies and we believe they are just playing lip service to the actual problems at hand.Online gaming and gaming coms has a seriously unaddressed problem with child safety.
Mojang&#39;s reasoning for chat reporting is to protect children. Chat reporting does absolutely nothing to solve this problem. You can report people for swearing, drug/alcohol references, etc. You cannot report a player for child exploitation unless they use the chat system to do so.As an example, I know one server admin that disabled chat entirely on his large server only to have pedophiles use in game signs to message and groom children over Skype and Discord.If Mojang were serious about protecting children, they would stop developing their paternalistic chat surveillance system and split multiplayer children and 18+ play from each other.For example, children should only be able to join under 18&#39;s Mojang hosted servers (realms) where conduct can be heavily monitored and 18+ players join multiplayer servers where children cannot play.It is clear they have thought about this problem for a total of 5 minutes and have shut down healthy &amp; reasonable debate about their solution to avoid embarrassment and scrutiny."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Patreon’s comment on this so far is on their creator Discord, so I can’t link to it, I’m afraid, but this is what one of their team members posted about an hour ago (7:29 PM EST):- - -“As a global platform, Patron will always prioritize the security of our creators&#39; and customers&#39; data. As
part of a strategic shift of a portion of our security program, we have parted ways with five employees. We also partner with a number of external organizations to continuously develop our security capabilities and conduct regular security assessments to ensure we meet or exceed the highest industry standards. The changes made this week will have no impact on our ability to continue providing a secure and safe platform for our creators and patrons, including the upcoming adult ID verification requirement.”- - -I have no idea how big their security team is (five may in fact be the entire group they called “the security team”), but I am not convinced that this is necessarily the end of the world for those who use Patreon. I don’t know how much financial data they even store directly (I would assume best practices entail letting their payment processors store actual credit card and bank account numbers, for instance, although I’m aware that may be easier said than done depending on their infrastructure).While I do think Patreon is going to have Issues (tm) due to having accepted so much VC money, it’s not clear to me that these layoffs were forced by their funders—they haven’t accepted any money recently, and I haven’t heard anything that suggests their revenues have been dropping to a point where there’d need to do serious belt-tightening.(Also, to people who seem to think any creator could just slap up “a basic microblog” and get all of Patreon’s functionality, that kind of falls into the “not even wrong” category. Replicating what they do would be a lot of work even for the technically-minded, many creators who use them are not technical, and even if you pull it off, there are things that just literally can’t be duplicated as a solo endeavor: all of your patrons may be supporting multiple creators, not just you; patrons may discover other creators based on who their friends support and who those they support are supporting; creators who support other creators just have those charges automatically deducted from their earnings; etc.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sounds rather scary but I would like to hear both sides of the story. I don&#39;t like guessing and passing judgment with basically a single sentence describing something that could have more to it than meets the eye."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There seems to be some speculation that this is credit card details being hacked. Firing your _entire_ security team sounds like the sort of action taken if basic security practices are not being done. Until we know more, hold out on hiring these people.Xe has commented on this and is suggesting to simply enable 2FA to deal with security concerns [1], as apparently a more measured response to security issues at Patreon. This seems to be more self-serving advice rather than good advice [2], the better suggestion would be to simply move to one of the many alternatives.The assumption is that the login system is somehow insecure, instead of the bank details themselves being stored insecurely. (Hypothetically) If you suffered a large leak of payment details, when payment processing is your _main_ income revenue, and you find out your security team of X people at probably $100k+ a year for N years have done nothing to secure payment details, you too may fire them on the spot.Until Patreon explain why they fired their _entire_ security team, the best advice is to remove your card details immediately. You can always add it back at a later date, or use an alternative payment processor.[1] https://xeiaso.net/blog/patreon-happening[2] https://www.patreon.com/cadey(Edit: As pointed out, Xe didn&#39;t mention credit card details.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m curious how much other major brands pay to stay in their placesCoke arguably pays megabucks to have giant displays in prime locations. Those locations have limited space so Coke taking up one isSimilarly, IIUC, companies pay to have their products put in conspicuous places in stores like Walmart, Target, etc. Only rich companies can afford to always get the spots that stick out the most.I don&#39;t know if those are compariable. Google pays Apple to be the default search engine seems no different than Coke paying to be the first soda on the aisle or to be featured on the edge of the aisle. People are still free to pick a different search engine or go into the soda aisle.Of course in retail another tactic is to make a bunch of products that appear to be different but are all basically the same. I think Crest or Colgate and 15 kinds of mouthwash all of which have the same &#34;active ingredient&#34; at the same concentration. The goal is to fill up the shelves with your products so there is no room left for the competition&#39;s products since shelf space is limited."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I produce Music Tech-based educational content on YT.  It started as a hobby and sideline to my main work (which at the time was classroom teaching of the same content).  While I&#39;m no longer working in classrooms (pandemic plus other reasons led to this), I&#39;m still producing content, which I think is of good quality and worthwhile.The issue I have with it is that I refuse to produce attention-grabbing clickbaity titles or thumbnails.  I don&#39;t like the whole algorithmically-driven race to the bottom of the brain stem, and have zero interest in producing the same.  I&#39;ve had plenty of comments from viewers who say the videos are great and informative, but if I&#39;d just jazz things up a bit then I&#39;d get more views.I&#39;m just wondering how this will change (if at all) with this new program.  It takes a LOT of time to produce decent content, and even more if you&#39;re going to provide a course and backup materials etc.. Writing curricula is HARD work, and writing tests, etc., that are actually valid is reasonably challenging and time consuming.I currently get about £100 a month from YT, which definitely doesn&#39;t reflect the time I put into it (but I know it has other benefits as I sell a fair number of books partly as a result of the viewership).

Had no idea what javascript was, just wanted to learn how to program and trying to pick the most popular language.$40 later, I got home and started reading! Very confusing, the first half of the book covered the language runtime (I think?) and the second half covered the browser sandbox, and it took me 200 pages to realize that I can&#39;t easily read or write to files on my machine with this language. Not what I was hoping for!Back to Barnes and Noble, another $40 and I came home with the O&#39;Reilly camel book, Beginning Perl I think? Cover to cover read, probably the last time I did that with a programming manual.Decades have passed, I&#39;m in the same camp as those that prefer Ruby now, but man what a breath of fresh air Perl was back in 2000."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It just occurred to me, Zig could be a great learning-language for CSWhen I was in college we mostly used C++, which exposed (and thereby taught) a lot of core concepts around how computers and low-level languages work. But it was also a bit of a nightmare for... unrelated, obvious reasons.Rust is great for building software, but as a learning language I think it introduces too many additional concepts, has too many additional constraints, and has too many magical abstractions. Eg, doing manual deallocation helps you later appreciate what the borrow-checker does and why it existsZig is supposed to be C++ without all the pain and misery (esp around tooling). That could make it perfect for teaching people about pointers and heap allocations and working with bytes, with minimal extra pain and friction"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried Zig recently but I found the unsilenceable lints to be a huge productivity killer. I actually posted a link to the GitHub issue this morning. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32751317This makes a normal workflow with `watchexec zig test` basically impossible, since before I can even run the tests I have to spend time hunting down which variables are used/unused at the moment and (un)commenting them. And it seems like they&#39;re planning to double down on this by making you adjust even more trivial things like public/private and var/const before it will even compile your code. https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/335 https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/224Maybe I&#39;m a bad developer, but my code is never perfect the first time around. I always spend time experimenting and refining my designs. I want to find a design that works, and only then spend time polishing and prettifying before I git push.I do understand the reasoning (they don&#39;t want people committing poor quality code), but this implementation just seems completely backwards to me. It breaks the natural order. It&#39;s like saying we won&#39;t let you ctrl+s until your tests pass to make sure you don&#39;t commit broken code. Stop nannying me and let me get my work done!"</p>

Stuff like a way to share volumes isn&#39;t supported, etc. Personally I find Dockers architecture a bit distasteful and Podmans tooling isn&#39;t quite there yet (but very close).Honestly I don&#39;t really care about containers vs VMs except the VM alleges better security which is nice, and I guess I like poking at things but they&#39;re were a little too rough for weekend poking.Is anyone doing &#34;small scale&#34; lightweight vm deployments - maybe just in your homelab or toy projects?

For me, one of the best parts of Docker is building a docker-image (and sharing how it was done via git).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Co-founder here, thanks for posting!Let me add some context:Many people add &#34;Reddit&#34; to their search queries to find authentic product reviews. We fine-tuned a BERT model to extract product mentions from over 4 million Reddit comments and posts with Named Entity Recognition (NER). The result is a list of the most popular products across many subreddits.No platform (including Reddit) is resistant to fake reviews and spam, but we think it&#39;s happening less frequently here for various reasons:- Redditors and other forum members are more interested in boosting their ego by showing their depth of knowledge on the topic (and correcting others on the topic), whereas corporate websites are more interested in raking profit by displaying (potentially) dishonest information.- Enthusiasts in subreddits are pretty good at spotting dishonest or fake content, which results in immediate downvotes. The whole karma system helps with trustworthiness.- Most subs are moderated well and spam gets removed quite quicklyThat being said, good fake reviews are technically almost impossible to detect, even with sophisticated network analysis of the reviewer&#39;s profile.Looria is still in Beta and we&#39;re working on improving our classification, summarization, and sentiment analysis.

Perfect size for me and i can sit in in for 12+ hours just fine.&gt; I personally haven&#39;t found the thinks to be more comfortable than other chairs, I&#39;d rather go with a staples Hyken. Also, I see these go for much less. This looks like a V1. I sold one like that for $200 in Virginia.&gt; Hello all, I went on a deep plung into chairs over the weekend to find a good new chair (instead my junky racer/gaming chair that hurt my back and neck. I ended up finding the Staples Hyken and Staples Dexley. I went to store and tried them both out.

But by 1926, he “claimed that he had counted 946 different sandwich varieties stuffed with fillings such as watermelon and pimento, peanut butter, fried oyster, Bermuda onion and parsley, fruit salad, aspic of foie gras, spaghetti, red snapper roe, salmi of duck, bacon and fried egg, lettuce and tomato, spiced beef, chow-chow, pickled herring, asparagus tips, deep sea scallops, and so on ad infinitum.”I ordered it off Amazon right away only to immediately realize, to my horror, that the hardcover version I had chosen would not arrive until Saturday, a full fortnite after my aspic of foie gras, salmi of duck, and the $5 esp32-wroom dev kits that were part of the same order.What is this, the 1930s?

They&#39;re not interested in the process at all, only in the outcome; financial success and social approval from authority figures.Many people are spending most of their lives doing stuff that they don&#39;t want to do, so of course they tend to look for shortcuts instead of trying to do things the right way.

Each of us is here for a brief sojourn; for what purpose he knows not, though he sometimes thinks he senses it. But without deeper reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people -- first of all for those upon whose smiles and well-being our own happiness is wholly dependent, and then for the many, unknown to us, to whose destinies we are bound by the ties of sympathy. A hundred times every day I remind myself that my inner and outer life are based on the labors of other men, living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same measure as I have received and am still receiving...I have never looked upon ease and happiness as ends in themselves -- this critical basis I call the ideal of a pigsty. The ideals that have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been Kindness, Beauty, and Truth. Without the sense of kinship with men of like mind, without the occupation with the objective world, the eternally unattainable in the field of art and scientific endeavors, life would have seemed empty to me.

It won&#39;t.  Those who care about this are already on Firefox, and frankly - Firefox isn&#39;t going to be the answer here (to be clear, this is opinion).I&#39;m also not thrilled at manifest v3, although for very different reasons than the adblocking limitations - I do lots of extension development, and I think the service worker approach taken is a bad mistake, forcing a distributed consensus model onto extensions without understanding the limitations that model imposes given how often extensions span multiple js contexts (across tabs/frames/content_scripts/windows/etc).Frankly - the environment is also still riddled with bugs... everything from docs that are wrong, to serious issues like a service worker not activating on simple, basic, required events (like chrome.action.onClicked, which is literally about as basic as it gets for extensions).Overall - my first impression of the manifest v3 upgrade was fairly neutral (it&#39;s not really solving any of my pain points, and it requires a lot of changes to support - but it seemed functional).  My opinion after porting several large extension projects to the space is... bad.  It&#39;s a bad set of changes as implemented in chromium right now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just so I understand correctly: This version removes *all* of the features that read or modify a user&#39;s data, so as to abide by the &#34;&#34;stated intent&#34;&#34; of MV3, rather than taking full advantage of all of the actual MV3 APIs? For example, this commit removes the &#34;scriplet injection&#34; and cosmetic filtering features, which AFAIK work perfectly fine on MV3?    if broad &#34;read/modify data&#34; permission is to be used, than there is not much point for an MV3 version over MV2, just use the MV2 version if you want to benefit all the features which can&#39;t be implemented without broad &#34;read/modify data&#34; permission.

Huh? But ... the &#34;read/modify data&#34; permission isn&#39;t getting removed by MV3? I don&#39;t understand how this follows. This is like saying &#34;Google implemented all of the same things we could do in MV2 in MV3, so we went ahead and removed all of the features anyway&#34;. I don&#39;t see any way to interpret this as anything except cutting off your own nose to spite the face of Google. It certainly doesn&#39;t seem to be a good faith attempt to reproduce the features of uBlock within the new technical framework of MV3."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I rely on Otter pretty heavily these days. 100% agree that recording and sending the transcript to meeting attendees without their knowledge is a really bad move from several angles.I work sales calls set up with Calendly and Otter joins them all. These are very technical so normally it&#39;s fantastic - EXCEPT if we start talking early or the prospect doesn&#39;t follow the invite and never joins the call, then they would get a transcript of my team&#39;s chatter. I learned to not allow Otter to join the call until everyone is in attendanceWhats more frustrating is that you can&#39;t disable this auto-email &#34;feature&#34; unless you are on a business plan of some sort. But I have a paid plan through the iPhone app and apparently can&#39;t convert it to a business plan associated with my company. So no good way to disable itI get the network effect of referral business but sharing private conversations without consent is not the way to achieve it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"THANK YOU for posting this. My partner uses Otter, and HIS Otter bot will join my work meetings that he is not even invited to.

We&#39;ve emailed Otter multiple times since July 2021 without any satisfactory response or investigation. You&#39;d think they would take this privacy issue more seriously.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a newbie in nuclear fusion, this explanation is the most interesting part:&gt; Lee Margetts at the University of Manchester, UK, says that the physics of fusion reactors is becoming well understood, but that there are technical hurdles to overcome before a working power plant can be built. Part of that will be developing methods to withdraw heat from the reactor and use it to generate electrical current.&gt; “It’s not physics, it’s engineering,” he says. “If you just think about this from the point of view of a gas-fired or a coal-fired power station, if you didn’t have anything to take the heat away, then the people operating it would say ‘we have to switch it off because it gets too hot and it will melt the power station’, and that’s exactly the situation here.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was at school in Abingdon, Oxfordshire (UK) around 1988 my physics class (A level aged 17) was somewhat enlivened by a visit by a bunch of clever chaps from JET at the Culham labs from up the road.This was the first time I heard the &#34;nuclear fusion is 25 years away&#34; joke and it was told as such.  We were also shown a graph of how many orders of magnitude away from ignition (for want of the correct word) by date.  It had an initial steep decline but then turned right quite sharply and had annoying looking tendency to avoid the magic value.Now, once you have ignition, you have to sustain it and extract power from it.  That&#39;s quite tricky too!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting to see that South Korea has such strong nuclear research facilities. Taiwan lost a lot of nuclear researchers in the past decades. Some of it due to US lobby work and some of it due to stupid governmental policies in the recent past. Japan which is also quite strong in nuclear seems to be trying to sell part of their nuclear industry, a move which turned out disastrously for the french."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Two things...First, looking through their design guide (https://www.wikihouse.cc/guides/design), the only thing they mention is that space (32mm in walls, I guess, and 70mm under ceilings) is provided.Given that the plumbing, electrical, ventilation, appliances, etc. are the majority of the cost of a home, I find this a bit odd.  A typical American full bathroom costs something like $5k to $20k (and up... way up) depending on the quality.  A kitchen can cost multiple times more.  Sure, you can build them cheaper, but that&#39;s the rub... most people who are in the market to purchase a home don&#39;t want low-end bathrooms and kitchens.  Or windows.  Or lighting.  Or wall fixtures.  Or anything really.Second, IMO, the problem with affordable housing is not a construction cost problem.  We can build small, livable (for various definitions) homes for $50k (or less) today, ignoring land costs.  But the regulatory costs, the land costs, the market demands all make building such homes a non-profitable endeavor.   Why build 20 $50k homes on the land and make $200k profit when you can build 10 $500k homes and make $1mil in profit?The affordable housing crisis in the America do not have a technical solution, only a socio-political one.  And since nearly all the power related to zoning, building costs, etc are managed at the local and state level, that means engaging with local politics."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really like the concept of this, it&#39;s basically a step further on from SIPs (structural insulated panels) by having standard composable blocks. The things I think are particularly good:- Standardising on screw pile foundations. Standard concrete foundations are often be about 30% of the build cost, with the quantity of earth removed and cement used it&#39;s a massive part of the carbon footprint of a home. For a &#34;light weight&#34; timber construction, screw piles are the future.- Having services recesses and notches built into the panels, and there is no need to batten the internal walls for boarding. this will increase the speed of construction significantly.- Being an &#34;Open&#34; standard allows any timber frame or prefab construction company to adopt it.My one concern (I wouldn&#39;t go as far as criticism) is that the panels have a somewhat complex manufacturing process by having to be CNC machined. Realisticly they almost always will be, but I would have liked to see the panels designed to be constructed a little more simply - you will always have to make changes on site.I wander why they went with ply over OSB, they have similar structural properties but OSB can be cheeper."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is overly complicating the process. If you want an open source DIY method of building a home, just learn basic framing and construction. It&#39;s not hard, lots of people have built their own homes, you just need some common sense and a willingness to learn.If you want to go all in on modular, wood based, zero carbon housing then learn how to build a timber frame house. If you really want zero carbon you can use only hand tools and harvest your own trees.Wikihouse seems more for people who want to buy something off the shelf, pretty much a kit house. That&#39;s not a bad thing since it takes a lot of effort to build something as big as a house and lots of people don&#39;t want to do that. But I don&#39;t think this should be sold as a solution for DIYers since the existing methods already satisfy the listed requirements."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The carbon monoxide is possibly more valuable than the oxygen.It&#39;s a good feedstock for making hydrocarbons and petrochemicals and also as good a reducing agent as hydrogen for making metals.  In fact you could use the CO to make,  say,  iron,  producing CO2 which gets cycled back into the above reactor."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Of course, the other plausible explanation is that (at least at the time) Weird Al didn&#39;t know the difference between RAM and hard drive space (especially likely, because he&#39;s talking about defragging a hard drive).  In fact, I&#39;d be surprised if that wasn&#39;t what he meant.  I will, however, leave room for him knowing the difference, but intentionally being absurd (it is Weird Al, after all).That problem (referring to things that are not conventional fast, volatile random access memory as RAM) seems to have only gotten worse in the last twenty years - exacerbated, I believe by the increased use of flash technology (SSDs, etc - which have, admittedly blurred the lines some).It also doesn&#39;t help that smart phone and tablet manufacturers/advertisers have long insisted on referring to the device&#39;s long-term storage (also flash tech) as &#34;memory&#34;.  I doubt that will ever stop bugging me, but I&#39;ve learned to live with it, albeit curmudgeonly.Whippersnappers! :-D"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting point that RAM has basically not moved up in consumer computers in 10+ years... wonder why.The article answers its own question by pointing out SSDs allow better swapping, bus is wider and RAM is more and more integrated into processor, etc.But I think this misses the point. Did these solutions make it uneconomic to increase RAM density, or did scaling challenges in RAM density lead to a bunch of other nearby things getting better to compensate?I&#39;d guess the problem is in scaling RAM density itself because performance is just not very good on 8gb macbooks, compared to 16gb. If &#34;unified memory&#34; was really that great, I&#39;d expect there to be largely no difference in perceived quality.Does anyone have expertise in RAM manufacturing challenge?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think a big piece that is ignored is how much normal compute/memory usage has been shifted to the Cloud.I no longer need to have local resources to do amazing things. I don&#39;t need an 10GB+ GPU in my phone to be able to hit some website and use AI to generate images. I have fast web/email search capabilities that don&#39;t require me to have a local index of all of it. I can spin up a remote compute cluster with as much RAM as I need if I want some heavy lifting done, and then throw it all away when I&#39;m finished.&#34;Back in the day&#34; we would try to build for all that we could perceive we would do in the next 5 years, and maybe upgrade memory half way through that cycle if things changed. We ran a lot of things locally, and would close apps if we needed to open something needy. I think also systems have gotten a lot better at sharing and doing memory swapping (see comments about SSD helping here). Back in the old days, if you ran out of memory, the app would just not open at all, or crash."</p>
