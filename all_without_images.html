								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another way of looking at this scoreboard is as an approximate inverse ranking of webmail client security and leak vectors, with Gmail stripping far more dangerous elements than most webmail clients.This is actually a great tool to find vulnerabilities in various webmail clients such as ProtonMail and Hey, just compare the HTML or CSS features they do not yet filter compared to Gmail, then do a search for &#34;[feature] + exploit&#34; to see how a feature could be abused, and then submit a bounty report.For example, there are alot of good reasons that you may not want your webmail rendering SVG images (mXSS, appcache poisoning) or allowing CSS variables or imports.And I&#39;m pretty sure the list supported by Gmail could also be narrowed down further. There are some fantastic bounties lurking in here, just waiting to be discovered."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; we settled on $11,000 per month as a baseline salary for working full-time on open source.&gt; For now, Nicolò, Henry, and Jùnliàng will all be paid a temporary rate of $6,000 per month. This doesn&#39;t solve the problem,I used to donate to Babel, before they made it apparent they are just interested in funneling the money to one developer. 11K per month?! That is absolutely bananas and same reaction I had the last time this came up, but this time I cannot do anything as a reaction as I&#39;ve already pulled my funding.But my guess is that a lot of people feel the same way, as the donations seems to be going down. 11K per month could pay for many developers if you hire people outside of Sillicon Valley, which since you&#39;re doing open source, you should really really consider.Open source is not &#34;VC fueled develoment&#34; and I don&#39;t think we should go that way either. Make your operation nimble and survive on little, otherwise you&#39;ll soon disappear. Optimize for sustainability, not for paying the one of the highest salary in the world (minus SV bubble of course).It&#39;s not wonder Babel is going the way it&#39;s going, as the economy you&#39;ve setup for yourself is nowhere near sustainable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This whole thread is basically a testament as to why the OSS model, unfortunately, is broken. Very competent people are expected to write widely used software for a salary that basically merely guarantees subsistence. It never ceases to amaze me how great software engineers allow themselves to be exploited in such a way. If you consider the societal impact that some of these projects have and the skill set that some of their maintainers have, which pretty much dwarfs the skill sets of people in other well paid professions such as lawyers or doctors, it&#39;s frankly ridiculous that they are expected to work for significantly less money. Not to mention that the abstractions some of these people wrote basically allow a significant number of people to enter the industry in the first place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Savage of Sebastian to call out Henry like that on twitter. Are you on drugs or something?
https://twitter.com/sebmck/status/1392019586833387522Publicly accusing Henry of not actually working on the project seems short sighted. Only looking at a one year slice of contribution rather than the lifetime of the project masks the full picture of Henry&#39;s contributions. Also in Henry&#39;s defense, the past year has been a terribly difficult one for most all of us to get through this pandemic.Not a good look for you Sebastian. Feels like you are looking for a place to point blame and unfortunately decided to direct that blame in Henry&#39;s direction. Henry Zhu is a great developer and contributor. Really deserves better than this."</p>

These &#34;industrial&#34; panels are normally twice the price of consumer grade ones but are designed to operate 24/7 with a MTBF of 100k hours (approx. 11 years) and are usually twice the brightness of normal ones (a very noticeable difference).

If the Amazon project succeeds, I would expect in a few months most home devices manufacturers, to partner to implement it so they have a way to circumvent users choices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a blatant attempt at using their market power to gain a dominant position in IoT connectivity by creating a parallel Network where Net Neutrality does not apply. If this succeeds, only Amazon approved devices will be allowed on this global Network connecting only to aws provided services thereby establishing a monopoly on non-cellular IoT connectivity.
After Apples recent move in the same direction with their „find my“ mesh network of apple devices being used to introduce a whole new mode of operation to support their Air Tags the Question of Net Neutrality has to be extended from just ISPs to Dominant Platforms that have the ability to create derivative Mesh-Networks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Future Wi-Fi devices will be able to see through your home and business walls, for activity monitoring and biometric identification, https://www.theregister.com/2021/03/31/wifi_devices_monitori...&gt; In three years or so, the Wi-Fi specification is scheduled to get an upgrade that will turn wireless devices into sensors capable of gathering data about the people and objects bathed in their signals... When 802.11bf will be finalized and introduced as an IEEE standard in September 2024, Wi-Fi will cease to be a communication-only standard and will legitimately become a full-fledged sensing paradigm... tracking can be done surreptitiously because Wi-Fi signals can penetrate walls, don&#39;t require light, and don&#39;t offer any visible indicator of their presence.IEEE 802.11bf paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14918Papers on device-free wireless sensing (DFWS): https://dhalperi.github.io/linux-80211n-csitool/Remote sensing with low-cost ESP32 and 802.11n: https://academic.oup.com/jcde/article/7/5/644/5837600"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the industry response[1]:&gt;  &#34;It’s important to note that there is presently no evidence of the vulnerabilities being used against Wi-Fi users maliciously and these issues are mitigated through routine device updates once updated firmware becomes available.&gt; &#34;Like many previous vulnerabilities, FragAttacks has been academically well-researched and responsibly reported in a manner allowing the industry to proactively prepare and begin to roll out updates that fully eliminate the vulnerabilities. This set of vulnerabilities requires a potential attacker to be physically within range of the Wi-Fi network (or user device) in order to exploit it. This significantly reduces the likelihood of actual exploitation or attack.&#34;[1] https://www.commscope.com/blog/2021/wi-fi-alliance-discloses..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; By default devices don&#39;t send fragmented frames. This means that the mixed key attack and the fragment cache attack, on their own, will be hard to exploit in practice, unless Wi-Fi 6 is used. When using Wi-Fi 6, which is based on the 802.11ax standard, a device may dynamically fragment frames to fill up available airtime.Why does this feel like Spectre? We&#39;re trying to speed things up in a way that eventually blows back into our face."</p>

You get the alert if the tag is planted on your person/vehicle and following you around, not if it happens to be sitting still in a location that you frequent.The alternative is being constantly bombarded with alerts because other residents of an apartment building also own AirTags, which is not going to be useful to anyone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Dr. Martin Loetzsch did a great video, ETL Patterns with Postgres. He covers some really good topics:- Instead of updating tables build their replacements under a different name then rename them. This makes updating heavy-to-compute table instant. Works even for schemas: rebuild a schema  as schemaname_next rename the current to schemaname_old then rename schemaname_next to schemaname.- Keep all the source data raw and disable WAL, you don&#39;t need it for ETL.- Set memory limitis high.And lots of other good tips for doing ETL/DW in postgres. It&#39;s here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwNi21jAm4I really appreciate having data in postgres. It&#39;s often easy to think that a specialised DW tool will solve all your problems, but that often fails to consider things like:- Developer experience. Postgres runs very easily on a local machine, more specialized solutions often don&#39;t or are tricky to setup.- Learning another tool costs time. A developer can learn postgres really well in the time it takes them to figure out how to use several more specialised tools. And many devs already know postgres because it&#39;s pretty much the default  DB nowadays.- Analytics queries often don&#39;t need to run at warp speed. Bigquery might give you the answer in a second but if postgres does it in a minute and it&#39;s a weekly report, who cares?- Postgres is boring and has been around for many years now, it will probably still be here in 10 years so time spent learning it is time well spent. More niche systems will probably be superseded by fancier, faster replacements.I would go so far as to say don&#39;t necessarily need to split out your DW from your prod DB in every case. As soon as you start splitting out a DW to a separate server you need some way to keep it in sync, so you&#39;ll probably end up duplicating some business logic for a report, maintaining some ingestion app, shuffling data around S3 or whatever. Keeping your analytics in your prod DB (or just a snapshot of yesterdays DB) is often good enough and means you will be more likely to avoid gnarly business-rules going out of sync between your app and your DW."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A new Postgres-based darling is TimescaleDB.  It’s a drop-in for Postgres.It is a hybrid row column store with excellent compression and performance.It would be interesting to see how it compares if narrator would try it out.  Benchmarks would be cool.One very neat feature I am enamored  by is “continuous aggregates”.  These are materialized views that auto-update as you change the fact table.Continuous aggregates are a great idea.  InfluxDB had “continuous queries” (but the implementation of influx generally is not so neat), and firebolt has “aggregate indexes” which are much the same thing.I think all olap dbs will eventually have them as staple, and that they will trickle down into oltp too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Avoid Common Table Expressions (or upgrade to 12)Upgrading to 12 (or 13) seems like the better option here, whenever you&#39;re able to do so. The improvements are very much worth it."</p>

The only reason they were going for $179 previously is because thermoworks was buying the thermometers from sellers and reporting them as counterfeit. Thus making it difficult for sellers to sell them which keeps supply low.They have fraudulently filed copyright removals and counterfeit accusations on amazon multiple times for Thermapen listings that don&#39;t use the &#34;thermoworks&#34; name.You can see that thermoworks does not own the Thermapen trademark.https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4803:hv...Edit: apparently, you can&#39;t link to a trademark search directly, so you would need to go to the basic search and enter&#34;Thermapen&#34;.https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=login&amp;p_lang=engli..."</p>

The more the business model relies on this, the more likely companies are to get hit with a ruling like this — and it&#39;s not just the ruling that&#39;s interesting, but also what Facebook&#39;s reaction will be.  If they stop offering or reduce WhatsApp services in Germany (or India), that&#39;s a great indicator that the service isn&#39;t profitable without the sale (or other commercial exploitation, Facebook is an ad company after all) of large amounts of user data."</p>

We want to secure national security via chip manufacturing and you want billions of dollars? Give us some upside.I don&#39;t want to hear it creates jobs, it generates blah blah blah, a real equity stake and possibly repayment of the capital. Creating jobs should be a happy by-product of subsidizing an industry that is probably more well capitalized than any other in existence.According to (https://startupanz.com/5-tech-giants-hold-588b-cash-reserves...) Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft had 526 billion dollars between the four of them in cash reserves. They have over half a TRILLION dollars in cash. If this were life or death, they could afford anything.But the calculus is offload risk onto the tax payer (despite being a shareholder directly in all those companies or indirectly via mutual funds/etfs), I don&#39;t want to be left holding the bag with no upside beyond the general sentiment of &#39;national security was secured&#39; while private companies reap all the benefits."</p>

And no, fiction books don&#39;t sell for $20 typically, but I&#39;m using this number to make the math easy.)Now, if you sell 5000 copies of an ebook for $20 and earn 80% royalties, you earn $16 per copy, and earn $80,000. This is the royalty rate on Leanpub (disclosure: cofounder), but with Gumroad or blog + Stripe approaches you&#39;d earn an even better percentage (if you want to run your own store).For fiction, however, the dream combination is probably publishing in-progress with subscriptions. Currently it seems that Substack is the best for that. If you can get a few thousand people to subscribe for a few bucks a month, you could do well. The people at the top are doing really, really well: https://stratechery.com/2021/sovereign-writers-and-substack/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It would be interesting to have a timeseries plot of this sort of information. Did it used to be easier to make a living as an author? Presumably there was some point at which the ease of making a living as an author peaked. This article suggests that time is in the past, but how far in the past? Has the absolute number of people who can make it as an author decreased, or just the relative fraction of the human population? So many questions.I do also think that the expectation/standard of a $100k/year salary is a bit high. That&#39;s almost double the US median household income, for a job that can be done (some would argue is best done) from a house in the woods. I also know that some authors are turning to Patreon. N.K. Jemisen famously started a Patreon that allowed her to quit her job and begin writing full-time. I personally have donated &gt;$100 directly to favorite midlist authors who have made a big impact on my reading life.FWIW, I used to read more, but I still buy at least three or four full-priced books a year."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From what I read in the proposal the core idea of it is solid. DNS is a vital piece of infrastructure, and we should take steps to ensure it keeps working. Putting together task forces to make sure it is secure therefore sounds like a very good idea.Root servers might be out of scope to some degree for this however. Interestingly enough the root servers also aren&#39;t mentioned in the proposal itself, nor in the annex listing essential services. They&#39;re only mentioned in the lead up, which is the argument for why it&#39;s needed. It somewhat feels like they left it in accidentally, especially with the parliament immediately amending to scrap it from the lead up as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;In addition, by downloading this file, every Internet service provider can run their own root server.&#34;Any end user can do that as well.The truth is, root servers are not nearly as &#34;essential&#34; as the major TLD servers, like .com, .net and .orgWhat is essential is the ability to download the root.zone file.  At least if one wants to track any changes (seldom seen).I always have a copy of the current root.zone file.  If the public root servers all ceased operation I would not see any noticeable effects.However if the .com servers went down, I would have to use a local copy of the com.zone which is a much larger file to download (via FTP, HN&#39;s favourite protocol to make fun of).An easier alternative is to keep a custom zone file with all the domains that I use regularly.  Does any single end user really need access to the entire www. How much of the www does anyone think they have really seen.For example, I have zone files with every domain that is posted to HN, so I never have to worry about being able to read what gets posted here. I can read fast without making any remote DNS lookups."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I left the game industry for FAANG and I&#39;m getting paid 2-3x more. I&#39;m happy with this situation if I consider the big picture but, at least in my case, my game job was much, MUCH better than FAANG. No matter how many fancy drinks and energy bars FAANG gives me, if the pay in the game industry was higher I&#39;d have stayed without a doubt.What this means is that FAANG is actually paying what it needs to pay to get employees, otherwise many people would simply work elsewhere.There is a myth that working at FAANG is amazing for everybody, but most people I know there are actually kind of miserable and doing fairly dull work for which they are massively overqualified. Nonetheless, these companies have money and they want the &#34;best&#34; (in their eyes) people for everything, so they pay for it... Well, it&#39;s a decent deal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is ultimately a supply and demand issue. Google pays high salaries because they have to in order to hire the talent they want. Game devs apparently do not have to, because they are able to fill their roles for lower salaries. Don&#39;t pretend like all tech companies wouldn&#39;t love to lower dev salaries, they just can&#39;t because they wouldn&#39;t be able to hire.Game companies apparently have a meaningful differentiator, which is that working in a gaming context is something people actually value and are willing to give up potential compensation for. This seems especially true at the junior level, which depresses junior salaries relative to other tech companies.Also, comparing compensation against US FAANG hiring is beyond insane. They pay ridiculous salaries due to the extremely limited and competitive market for hires that meet their caliber. This has driven up salaries, but should NOT be treated as an indicator for what &#34;reasonable&#34; pay looks like across the entire industry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just to have a bit of a counter argument from me, a game developer who loves games and has worked in the US games industry for the majority of my 20 years career:If your argument is &#34;You can make more at a FAANG company&#34; - well yeah, you can. You don&#39;t work in gaming because you want to make the top salary. You work in gaming because you love games and you enjoy having all your coworkers also love games and being able to talk to all of them about games and having your company culture revolve around games and gaming. It&#39;s games all the way down! It&#39;s a completely different work environment. As someone who loves games, the best years of my working career were when I was working on game teams, not at tech companies.Also, developer salaries in games is still plenty good. It&#39;s still great money. I never felt like I was losing out.Also the argument that it&#39;s &#34;grueling 80+ hour weeks day in and day out is&#34; is bullshit! The only time I ever worked 80 hours in a single week was when I was starting out in Quality Assurance and I was getting paid hourly so I was happy to make the extra overtime. As a salaried developer I don&#39;t think I was ever expected to work more than 60 hours a week, and then after the crunch was over we always got 1 or 2 weeks of extra vacation (&#34;comp time&#34;). To be clear, the normal working schedule was 40 hours per week. Crunch time is like 1 or 2 times a year, for maybe 1-2 months each time. And like I said, depending on how much you crunch, you would get extra paid time off afterwards. So for me, that was a pretty good trade. I&#39;d much rather work my ass off for a couple months and then get an extra 2 week vacation at the end of it.Maybe some game companies treat their employees like dirt and work them into the ground, but the ones I&#39;ve worked for, I never felt that way. Don&#39;t work at those terrible companies! There are plenty of &#34;good&#34; game companies out there who pay good salaries and have good working conditions.As someone who is older now with kids, my priorities are definitely different than when I worked in games during my 20s and early 30s. I would no longer be happy working those 60 hour weeks. I want a better work life balance. So I don&#39;t know if I could work on a game team like that anymore. But do I regret working there before I had a family? Absolutely not. #gamedev4life"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I stayed in a small town outside Chablis, France, many years ago. I rented a room above the only restaurant in town. There were a few businesses, mostly food-related and clothing repair. Everything just seemed slowed down. I watched a man in waders unload a dead boar he had just shot to the butcher at 9am. I watched two other men repairing brickwork on a foundation. I watched another woman tending a large garden, then go to work at a bar/restaurant. The stores were open for just a few hours. The shelves were free of random plastic trinkets and gadgets.It just seemed like it was 1/10th the normal speed, somewhat Luddite... and every task seemed oddly fundamental.I&#39;ve also encountered towns like this in Spain, Greece, Austria, Mexico, Guatemala, Chile, Uruguay, Thailand and Cambodia.After reading these comments, I would never have believed that so many small towns exist that seem untouched by 24-hour stores and everything cheap and on-demand. It sounds inevitable that everyone is eventually pushed into hyperinflationary always-working mode. But yet, these places persist. I might even chalk it up to depressed economies and &#34;third-world&#34; nature, but my samples include all sorts of economies.I think we choose what kind of lifestyle we want, but it needs to be done at the community level. Without going all &#34;we should all be farmers hippie dippy portland nature fetishist&#34;, it does seem like decisions have consequences and it is possible to steer away from hyperactivity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The roots of this phenomenon can be traced back to the &#39;Protestant work ethic&#39; in the 16th Century - a worldview held by white Protestants in Europe that made hard work and the quest for profit seem virtuous. Sally Maitlis, professor of organisational behaviour and leadership at the University of Oxford, says that &#34;later, the drive for efficiency that arose out of the Industrial Revolution&#34;, as well as the way we prize productivity, have &#34;further embedded the value of consistent hard work, often at the cost of personal wellbeing&#34;.The roots of the valorization of work may well have been religious, and maybe Christian (though I very much doubt it&#39;s exclusively Christian in its origin), but it&#39;s definitely spread throughout much of the world, even among the non-religious and even atheist population.I can&#39;t count the number of times I&#39;ve heard people praise others as &#34;hard working&#34;... in all sorts of contexts, in many different parts of the world, native or immigrant, hard work is praised to the heavens and one of the best things you can say about a person is that they&#39;re hard working.I almost never hear the value of working hard being questioned, except when the subject turns to burnout.  Then everybody nods sagely and agrees that overwork is bad.. the next day they go back to praising hard workers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Six-day work week was standard like, what, 100 years ago? Now it just seems savage. And so will the five-day work week.I had the luck of getting a four month severance when a company closed, full salary, full benefits. I lined up a new job and just said I will start later.Let me tell you, going back into a tech job, 10 to 6-ish PM every day was no joke, after three months of not giving a fuck. It was torture. I could not understand how I did it until then. And there was that painful realization of &#34;what am I doing here for eight hours a day? I am clearly not using all of it. Give me four hours and I will do the same amount of work and go live my life&#34;.And that&#39;s when I knew that I am not going to be the guy on his deathbed, realizing that he worked too hard and didn&#39;t live, after winning the cosmic lottery of being born on such a rare place as planet Earth."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Roger Cicala knows a lot about lenses and pushed lens manufacturers to have better testing and quality, he created https://www.lensrentals.com/ because he got sick with low quality checks of lenses:When I started Lensrentals I had a lot of conversations with service centers that went like this. Me: &#34;That lens you repaired still sucks&#34;. Person at service center: &#34;No, it’s within specs&#34;. Me: &#34;What are the specs?&#34; Service center: &#34;We can’t tell you&#34;. One day, after I raised hell with a factory service manager, he patted me on the head and said, “testing lenses is complicated; you don’t have the background to understand.”Any of you who has ever seen a physician after someone says something like ‘you wouldn&#39;t understand; it’s complicated’ knows what happened next. I had no option but to spend a couple of years buying testing equipment, offering internships to really smart optical engineering students, and developing a lens testing center and methodology that was as good as anything in the industry.He is also capable of writing about hard topics in a way that most people can understand them.Anyone interested in camera lenses should read also his previous posts https://www.dpreview.com/members/1329131098"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a bunch of full frame lenses.Recently I looked at some very old ones I haven&#39;t used in a long time. I thought they are faulty (soft).After some diagnosing I found that it is not the fault of lenses but rather in the meantime I have started looking at images at 1:1 in Lightroom and gotten used to ridiculously sharp images from new cameras.Have you ever watched an old TV show and despaired how unwatchable it is because of low quality of image? Yes, that&#39;s the same thing -- our tastes change."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are a couple of other big reasons related to differences between film and digital sensors.First film is much less sensitive to the angle at which light strikes it. There are some great, sharp old lens designs from leica, zeiss and others that show heavy light fall off in the corners on digital sensors. This is a big part of why even f1.8 or 2 lenses need to be more complicated.Next film grain itself has sharp edges which effectively sharpens images a bit and also limits the resolution and generally has a pleasing effect when viewed at high magnification. With digital you don&#39;t get that and lens flaws get a lot more obvious."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think a lot of this analysis is tautological -- meaning that when you boil it down, you&#39;re just saying that things are as you have defined them to be.For instance, take a Big Five trait such as agreeableness. How do we know that a person is agreeable? Because we define agreeableness in a certain way and then measure the degree to which someone conforms to the definition. If that measurement includes questions such as, &#34;Do others find you easy to get along with?&#34; then of course there&#39;s going to be a negative correlation with loneliness, because you&#39;ve essentially defined it that way.I am the author of Correlated.org, which commits many different types of statistical errors for humor&#39;s sake, so this leaps out at me. By the way, for a surprisingly vast number of things, agreeableness is quite predictive. Food preferences, public policy positions, and even willingness to answer poll questions :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author is making a subtle mistake; evolution doesn&#39;t mean like-parent-like-child.Evolution is likely selecting for, eg, people who have children at a certain ratio of introverted-extroverted.Introverted, disagreeable, high-contentious types make, for example, great scientists. A population (call it A) that produces a reasonable number of such people is at a huge advantage compared to the alternative that only produces extroverted agreeable types (call them B).Population B will be more competitive at breeding, but population A will win any conflict with B because they&#39;ll have a bunch of weirdos in the back room producing a lot of high quality science (a classic stereotype with some foundation in truth).Note that men are much more likely (something like 4x) to be &#34;completely homosexual&#34; compared to women [0]. I&#39;m betting this is because having a few men who opt out of the race to pass on their genes and focus on other stuff is a massive advantage to the society that hosts them. Look how much of a force gay men have been in culture for example.Locally catastrophic for breeding, globally optimal for society. The equilibrium isn&#39;t for all offspring to maximise their chance of breeding. The optimum is for the community to thrive.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_sexual_orienta..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Of all of the personality traits I have attempted to change over the years, my introversion has remained the most stubborn.  It&#39;s a shame, too.  I can briefly emulate extraversion, at an enormous cost of mental energy and feel like a dog walking on its hind legs.  Nor do I seem to be able to extract the purported benefits of it.  And the list of approaches I have exhausted is, in retrospect, more than a little shocking.  It&#39;s the one area where &#34;fake it until you make it&#34; seems to have failed me utterly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Pair programming generates visceral responses due to it being introduced as if it were fact, which for me always triggers my spidey senses. People who didn&#39;t like it were told &#34;you&#39;re doing it wrong&#34; or &#34;you didn&#39;t give it a proper chance&#34;. Dismissing criticisms out of hand only furthers distrust, regardless of the actual value of the idea.I played along and paired for awhile, but now steadfastly refuse to pair, ever. I work best within my own mind, and the distraction of talking to someone breaks my concentration such that I&#39;m unable to keep the big picture in my head anymore. The irritation of being that close to someone and having to engage with them for even half an hour is draining, and I took more frequent and longer breaks because of this (much to the annoyance of my pair-partner, who couldn&#39;t work while I was away).There may very well be people who work well in pairs, but rest assured that there are those who aren&#39;t built that way. Don&#39;t disparage them, don&#39;t discriminate against them, and don&#39;t play the moral superiority game with them. Accept their diversity and be a better team for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I also worked at a company where pairing was mandatory for 8 hours a day. Plan was concocted by two tech leads who, of course, didn&#39;t pair themselves.The exhaustion was visible, and productivity was very low. Since everyone vocally thought it was a &#34;waste of time&#34;, there was a Fight-club-style &#34;rule&#34; where we couldn&#39;t talk about the downsides in public or even in Scrum meetings. We missed several deadlines for an MVP, code quality was abysmal and the product barely worked.It stopped when the CEO took issue with it. He gathered the team to ask &#34;why is the productivity so low?&#34;. There was an awkward moment where a junior dev was trying to answer but a tech lead was trying to tell him &#34;don&#39;t break the rule&#34;.It was an absolutely surreal experience, but not out of place in that startup.EDIT: I also remember one of the tech leads complaining during a Sprint Retro that some of us weren&#39;t reading Slack fast enough, and we said &#34;well, I was paring, I wasn&#39;t at my computer&#34;, to which he became a bit agitated and visibly angry. It was an awful place to work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve had incredible experiences pairing.There were whiteboards, snacks, rating each other’s themes, and jokes.What worked very well was to pair for conceptional problems, like architecture and defining modules and their interfaces. Commit some types and pseudo-code.We’d then break away and work at our own speed and in our own style using the common foundation.Come together to integrate and discuss.Pairing is also worth it’s weight in gold for debugging. It’s like a rubber duck, but doesn’t feel wrong.It is of course of utmost importance that both parties enjoy it. Else it’s pain and a waste of everybody’s time. I had a colleague who hated it like the plague. In which case short code/review cycles worked best.A good tool, if employed correctly. Like most things, really. And fuck management if they force it down on me."</p>

By that time it was already more useful to me than the Encyclopedia Britannica, and getting better all the time. The trajectory was clear.It seems like, of all the exciting things from the early web, Wikipedia has been one of the only things that actually panned out the way it was intended. It didn&#39;t get commercialized, but it didn&#39;t go broke either. It didn&#39;t become a cesspool, or try to consume all of my attention. It just does the thing it&#39;s supposed to do. If there was a fire on the internet, and I could only save one website, it would be you Wikipedia."</p>

This is different, and more toxic, than all of the in—app purchase stuff — you’re telling indie developers that no matter how hard they try, they won’t be able to match the functionality of Apple’s special friends.Otherwise, well, there goes your narrative of having a level playing field. The problem with this is, the loss of trust results in a slow, unending decay that only becomes obvious in retrospect.It may not seem like it, but billions of dollars of value are at stake with little things like this. If you work at Apple, you should raise the alarm."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another weird example is how Apple&#39;s own &#34;Clips&#34; app has a special private entitlement that bypasses the permission prompt for camera access.Would it hurt them so much to prompt for camera access the first time the app is started after installing it from the app store?I found that extremely worrying as it means I can no longer trust the app store to provide a safe sandboxed environment. Suddenly there&#39;s an app with this special no-cam-permission entitlement and your mugshot is uploaded when you believed the ios camera permission system would have protected you.Oh, but Apple would only ever grant that permission to its own apps? Better hope we&#39;ll never get a repeat of the PsychicPaper exploit!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is what bothers me most about Apple devices and software. They probably have the &#34;best&#34; devices out there in terms of user experience. I use an iPhone and iPad every day because of it. But they keep very tight control over what software can be installed and run on it in order to safeguard their views on UX and security/privacy.This means for me as a developer that it&#39;s hard to write software and tools for my own devices without having to deal with Apple in some way or root the devices. Some things are even clearly impossible because of these private entitlements: There is no way for me to explore the CarPlay API&#39;s to experiment with my own ideas.A small part of me hopes that the Epic lawsuit and recent developments can lead to more abilities for sideloading on iDevices."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Robin Hobb is one of my favorite authors. Her masterwork is a series of series (four trilogies and a quadrology) known as The Realm of the Elderlings.She published the first trilogy, which begins with Assassin&#39;s Apprentice, starting in 1995. I saw the books when they first came out and I assumed from the title and the cover that it would be a cheesy fantasy by the numbers, so I never bought it. But I kept hearing about these books from other people who liked SFF, so I finally picked up the first trilogy.I was completely wrong. It&#39;s not at all by the numbers. While it&#39;s not trope-free (nothing is), there are all sorts of interesting ideas, from the political to ecological. As you read the later series, the world opens up quite a bit, and it gets even more interesting. The final trilogy brings so many elements together, and the ending is shatteringly powerful.While this is epic fantasy, it&#39;s _not_ at all grimdark. Bad things definitely happen, but it&#39;s more hopeful and humane than something like Malazan or Song of Ice and Fire.I can&#39;t recommend these books highly enough. Even if her writing is slowing down, I hope that she&#39;s satisfied with what she&#39;s done. This series alone is an enormous accomplishment. To build a world across so many books, across so many years, and have it come together so well in the end is massively impressive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"70?  My animal is only 33 and is very tired.  Writing this as it lays in bed, 3 in the afternoon, because even a standard chair sounds more exhausting to it.It seems to have no motivation or energy to do much besides lay here.If I force it, it will get stuff done but at a huge cost.  It will yearn the entire time to just lay back down.It&#39;s interest in things seems to be fading quickly.  What desire it used to have to work hard and succeed, has slipped away.  It seems these days it has only enough energy to lay in bed and scroll through the internet.  Not sure what is wrong with my animal, but this is no way for it to live.I was hard on the animal in its early 20s, but no harder than the average animal.  The past 7 years or so have actually been pretty calm, good food, semi regular exercise,  stable job, etc.It&#39;s scary to imagine how the animal would feel at 70 if this is how it feels at 33.  Maybe the pandemic was a straw to its back, and the isolation has worn it down more than anything else possibly could."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Better food, more exercise, more relaxation... but I also wonder if it would have made any difference.Yes. I&#39;m only half OP&#39;s age but working out and eating well (well for me means much more) has made all the little aches I started to have in my 20s go away and made me much calmer, I can also sleep pretty much anywhere and at any time.More interestingly though,Me, and the animal I live inside.there is no animal you live inside, this is not a meat vehicle for something else, your body is you, it&#39;s not some machine you merely inhabit. Its/your gut will affect your mood, its limitations are your limitations, being physically strong will make you feel strong and keep anxieties at bay."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interestingly, there is an embedded video in that article that explains the issue specific to the automotive shortage - it&#39;s because the automotive industry cancelled a lot of chip orders in anticipation of low vehicle demand and that caused chip makers to reduce their production for the kinds of chips that go into cars, and now it takes time to ramp back up:https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/03/02/how-the-global-compute...It&#39;s at the 4m15s part of the videoI think a facepalm is in order."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regarding cars:&#34;Some carmakers are now leaving out high-end features as a result of the chip shortage, according to a Bloomberg report on Thursday.Nissan is reportedly leaving navigation systems out of cars that would normally have them, while Ram Trucks has stopped equipping its 1500 pickups with a standard “intelligent” rearview mirror that monitors for blind spots&#34;I have an unpopular opinion, especially when we start to look at the increase of safety features and increase in pedestrian injuries, that we may be better off going back to smaller trucks designed for good visibility and less reliance on features.
(bias: I drive a 16 year old wagon, and feel panicked around bicycling with what feels like more trucks in the US)---&#34;Hertz said it is “supplementing” its fleet “by purchasing low-mileage, preowned vehicles” from auctions and dealerships.&#34;I find it wild that just a year ago Hertz filed for bankruptcy [0] and was selling vehicles by end of year [1].[0]: https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/22/business/hertz-bankruptcy/ind...[1]: https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/hertz-must-offload..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think a lot of folks underestimate how fabulously complicated it is to fab a chip. Yes, you can diy it in your garage, here&#39;s a wonderful implementation. http://sam.zeloof.xyz/first-ic/But take a look at the specialized tools they used. Heck, think about proper handling of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrofluoric_acid and this is just a simple amp. imagine trying to make something with lots of gates?Making a single chip is _hard_. And that&#39;s just for a one off. doing that at scale requires an amazing amount of process control. And that diy chip is, according to the author &#34;5µm (1975 tech. level)&#34;Anyway, yes, you could make a chip in your garage, but it&#39;d take a lot of time to ramp up, and you&#39;d only have 1."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Classically trained pianist here (since 7 years old), I like the article&#39;s advice.&gt; Use the correct fingering, dynamics, articulation, etc. from the very beginning; you are never going to get around to “fixing” it later.When I was an impatient kid my piano teachers would keep insisting I play sections slow on a first pass, which annoyed me (it was like reading a book out loud slowly), but it was only until many years later when I played pieces like Un Sospiro[0] which are intractable if you do not start practicing at something like 16 times slower than performance tempo.  If you start out correctly, the rest will follow, and IME, sight reading greatly improves as well.&gt; [...] you may reach a point where you can’t play any faster, no matter how hard you try. What is likely happening is that the hand motions you are using—which come naturally at the slower tempo you started with—simply will not work at such high speeds.This is completely true, for instance, in ragtime, the left hand makes big, quick jumps and there is often no time to look at where it will land (which one likely does when playing slowly), so repeating a bar over and over again to incrementally refine your distance estimate is crucial.This applies to things like typing on a keyboard as well, if you focus on correct finger placement (and correct use of the 4th and 5th fingers), your WPM might take a hit for a few days or a week, but in the long term it really helps.[0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po_a1SmZKLs"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Indian classical dancer here.&gt; Do not work on this section for more than twenty minutes.This is not something I&#39;ve heard often in my field but I had to learn this over the years. Performers want to present a piece as if it was never practiced and was all made up on the spot, and yet we do have to practice a piece day after day. Losing vitality and &#34;becoming rehearsed&#34; through over-practice is a real problem.The book &#34;A Soprano on Her Head&#34; by Eloise Ristad, who was a piano teacher, really helped me with my dance &amp; acting practice. I restructured a lot based on that book (added improvisational elements, reduced forceful drill-like elements, more self-observation, less verbal cues), and my technique and enjoyment both improved a lot during covid lockdown. She also wrote a book called &#34;Bold Beginnings&#34; for teaching piano using a new method that she made up, but I&#39;ve not been able to find a copy."</p>

I dont want to have to wade through content to find the exercises that are relevant to me. I think Duolingo has an interesting approach to this, where has you re-visit concepts every day and it tells you what to practice to reduce decision fatigue.I want a dashboard that is keeping track of my goals and progress akd has an opinionated way for me to measure my skill, and to direct my effort."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve wondered what the effect our modern digital economy has had on consumer price inflation.Normally, an increase in money supply would cause consumer goods to increase in price, since more people are able to buy them and there is a limit on how much of any particular physical good is available.This isn&#39;t the case, however, for digital goods. If there are suddenly 100 million new people who want to buy a Netflix subscription, it isn&#39;t like we are going to see the price of a Netflix subscription go up because there isn&#39;t enough Netflix to go around. The marginal cost for a new subscriber is practically zero, so there should be no price increase caused by a shortage.It would be easy to see that inflation would be essentially zero if ALL goods people wanted to buy were digital ones... no amount of demand can eat up the supply, since supply is practically infinite.Of course, in the real world, some goods are digital and some are physical. If you gave everyone $5000, some of that would go to Netflix subscriptions, which wouldn&#39;t effect consumer prices, and some would go to buying TVs to play Netflix on, which WOULD cause inflation.I am curious how much of our current &#34;low inflation even with an increasing money supply&#34; is caused by our increasing spending on non-exclusionary goods."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some personal anecdotes. I grew up during the hyperinflation days in Brazil (80s, early 90s): talking about 60% a month.People would get their salary and run to the supermarket and buy everything they needed for the month, because if they waited a single day the prices would have changed. A lot of people internalized that habit and still do that nowadays (not in the sense of running to the supermarket, but buying a lot for the whole month).This was before barcodes, and every item had a price label on it. Supermarkets had people employed full time just to be remarking the items. I remember running to pick up an item on one end of a shelf while the employee was remarking the items coming from the other end, so you could buy the item at yesterday&#39;s price.I lived through 6 currency changes. Usually when prices started being in the scale of millions, the government would announce that in a very short period (sometimes that being next week), there was a new currency with a new name and 1000 OLD = 1 NEW. Until the government could replace all existing bills, the old bills would be accepted as if they were the new bills (at 1/1000 of the face value, of course). Old bills passing through the banking system would be stamped with the name of the new currency and the new value before being put back into circulation.Contracts like rentals were all indexed: there was a clause saying the price would be corrected every month using the official index that tracked the inflation. Or were pegged to the dollar. This by itself fed into the positive feedback loop that was perpetuating the hyperinflation.The government tried some bizarre measures to tame inflation. Often they would try freezing all prices, but that was never sustainable for long. The craziest one was probably in 1990 when the government simply froze 80% of everybody&#39;s money in the bank for 18 months to reduce the amount of money in the economy. This was a total disaster and even caused many suicides.In 1994 hyperinflation was finally tamed when the current currency, Real, was introduced. It was the culmination of an ingenious plan that actually worked.Feel free to ask me more, if you&#39;re interested."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It always amuses me that large cats are no different than house cats, they seem to act exactly the same including sitting in boxes [1].Only difference is when the large cat gets annoyed for unknown reasons it kills you rather than just scratching your arm up and that’s just due to a difference in size not behavior it seems.1. https://www.pinterest.com/pin/404268504021009708/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m very sad I can&#39;t view the figures, which appear to include at least a couple of shots of cats sitting in things. It looks like the Kanizsa square illusion they&#39;re referring to is this: https://puzzlewocky.com/optical-illusions/kanizsa-square-and..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Obfuscated Javascript didn&#39;t render here (Chromebook), found what looked like the abstract:&#34;A well-known phenomenon to cat owners is the tendency of their cats to sit in enclosed spaces such as boxes, laundry baskets, and even shape outlines taped on the floor. This investigative study asks whether domestic cats (&lt;em&gt;Felis silvestris catus&lt;/em&gt;) are also susceptible to sitting in enclosures that are illusory in nature, utilizing cats’ attraction to box-like spaces to assess their perception of the Kanizsa square visual illusion. Carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study randomly assigned citizen science participants Booklets of six randomized, counterbalanced daily stimuli to print out, prepare, and place on the floor in pairs. Owners observed and videorecorded their cats’ behavior with the stimuli and reported findings from home over the course of the six daily trials. This study ultimately reached over 500 pet cats and cat owners, and of those, 30 completed all of the study’s trials. Of these, nine cat subjects selected at least one stimulus by sitting within the contours (illusory or otherwise) with all limbs for at least three seconds. This study revealed that cats selected the Kanizsa illusion just as often as the square and more often than the control, indicating that domestic cats may treat the subjective Kanizsa contours as they do real contours. Given the drawbacks of citizen science projects such as participant attrition, future research would benefit from replicating this study in controlled settings. To the best of our knowledge, this investigation is the first of its kind in three regards: a citizen science study of cat cognition; a formal examination into cats’ attraction to 2D rather than 3D enclosures; and study into cats’ susceptibility to illusory contours in an ecologically relevant paradigm. This study demonstrates the potential of more ecologically valid study of pet cats, and more broadly provides an interesting new perspective into cat visual perception research.&#34;Thought that might be of interest to other who, like me, couldn&#39;t grok the headline."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something like this is so sorely needed.I&#39;ve been doing some work in ag-tech for the past few years (having previously worked in ISP/telco, general SME web/mobile development, then consumer travel tech).The tools available to farmers/growers for what should be quite basic things - i.e., web-connected weather stations and monitoring systems for soil moisture, frost alarms and irrigation control are terrible.The industry is full of small players who take a look and think &#34;I know how to build stuff with [Arduino/Raspberry Pi/Zigbee etc], I can build an ag-tech monitoring/control product easily&#34;.So everyone builds a hardware product from scratch, then as a quick afterthought, a web app with an SQL database and Highcharts to show data graphs. You have an MVP within a few months, then a few paying customers in your local community, then suddenly your customers start asking for features you&#39;d never thought of, like sensor inputs you didn&#39;t know existed, or combined displays of different kinds of data you&#39;d never considered anyone would want, or needing it to be faster (SQL turns out to be really slow for this kind of data) or more reliable (bugfixing is hard when your devices are hundreds of miles away and connected via weak 3G/4G data links), and you realise your hardware and software architecture doesn&#39;t support any of this, and you&#39;d have to completely start over to actually deliver something that customers really need, but you&#39;re out of money and energy.The result is a lot of farmers/growers dissatisfied/frustrated at never being able to get the monitoring systems they need (some of them having tried 3+ different vendors), and a lot of new companies trying to build new solutions and going bust.I&#39;ve been thinking there needs to be some widely accepted open standards in the industry for hardware and software platforms, so solutions providers can avoid trying to re-invent everything and instead focus on integration of tried-and-true building blocks.If this initiative brings that about, it would be a big win for everyone in the industry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Of interest to me because I have been doing agricultural process monitoring and production control systems for about 30 years. And most of my clients&#39; systems are at least semi-custom and re-invent wheels for no other purpose other than to do it their way; that is, silos (pun not intended). But where NDAs and IP agreements allow, I have attempted to standardize some architectures.But was disappointing to see the way the LF is organizing this - no representation from the ag industry&#39;s heavy hitters and no specific and attainable goals.Should this be done by an Operating Systems organization? Other than centralized control and logistical systems, ag engineering is not the realm of microprocessors and operating systems, and code monkeys. Ag engineering is a world of hardware, micro-controllers, FSMs, and scheduler stacks.But then, if not the LF, whom has the organization to do this?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is a ridiculous feature of modern C that you have to write the super verbose &#34;mask and shift&#34; code, which then gets compiled to a simple `mov` and maybe a `bswap`. Wheras, the direct equivalent in C, an assignment with a (type changing) cast, is illegal. There is a huge mismatch between the assumptions of the C spec and actual machine code.One of the few reasons I ever even reached to C is the ability to slurp in data and reinterpret it as a struct, or the ability to reason in which registers things will show up and mix in some `asm` with my C.I think there should really be a dialect of C(++) where the machine model is exactly the physical machine. That doesn&#39;t mean the compiler can&#39;t do optimizations, but it shouldn&#39;t do things like prove code as UB and fold everything to a no-op. (Like when you defensively compare a pointer to NULL that according to spec must not be NULL, but practically could be...)`-fno-strict-overflow -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks` gets you halfway there, but it would really only be viable if you had a blessed `-std=high-level-assembler` or `-std=friendly-c` flag."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Rust gets this right. These primitives are available for all the numeric types.    u32::from_le_byte(bytes) // u32 from 4 bytes, little endian
    u32::from_be_byte(bytes) // u32 from 4 bytes, big endian
    u32::to_le_bytes(num) // u32 to 4 bytes, little endian
    u32::to_be_bytes(num) // u32 to 4 bytes, big endian

This was very useful to me recently as I had to write the marshaling and un-marshaling for a game networking format with hundreds of messages. With primitives like this, you can see what&#39;s going on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is why, in 2021, the mantra that C is a good language for these low level byte twiddling tasks needs to die. Dealing with alignment and endianness properly requires a language that allows you to build abstractions.The following is perfectly well defined in C++, despite looking like almost the same as the original unsafe C:    #include &lt;boost/endian.hpp&gt;
    #include &lt;cstdio&gt;
    using namespace boost::endian;

    unsigned char b[5] = {0x80,0x01,0x02,0x03,0x04};

    int main() {
        uint32_t x = *((big_uint32_t*)(b+1));
        printf(&#34;%08x\n&#34;, x);
    }

Note that I deliberately misaligned the pointer by adding 1.https://gcc.godbolt.org/z/5416oefjx[Edit] Fun twist: the above code doesn&#39;t work where the intermediate variable x is removed because printf itself is not type safe, so no type conversion (which is when the bswap is deferred to) happens. In pure C++ when using a type safe formatting function (like fmt or iostreams) this wouldn&#39;t happen. printf will let you throw any garbage in to it. tl;dr outside embedded use cases writing C in 2021 is fucking nuts."</p>

Weight is indeed a force, but gravity is more like a field. I understood it like this: Say you have a point mass in an isolated system. There is certainly gravity all around that mass, but there are no forces anywhere in the system. Not until another mass is introduced into the system do you have any forces. It is apparent from the formula for force since then you have that new mass times the acceleration of gravity.Or is this just being pedantic and does it even matter?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Most theorists assume that gravity actually pushes us around through particlesIs this true, and if so, why? The interpretation of gravity as something that warps spacetime very elegantly yields its “gravitational force” via its effect on the action integral, and is easily understood using a path integral style framework. It seems like a particle-based framework would necessarily be a lot more complicated, although maybe it’s necessary for some reason I don’t know."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"And, in my opinion, its only going to get worse if Intel doesnt sober up and address the elephant in the room:  Hyperthreading.Without serious reform to the design of the Intel X86 chip to eliminate and refactor what basically amounts to a performance-before-safety feature, Intel is going to see the lions share of performance hits.  Eventually people will tire of writing backflip code to sidestep pitfalls in the Intel HT design and simply return the responsibility to Intel, where its existed since day one.It could be argued Intels mouthpiece has already lost its ability to convince major datacenter and cloud customers that HT is even remotely safe as a continued investment.  Intel needs a new X86."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For data center operators the choice between AMD and Intel in this space comes down to power efficiency.Ignoring the performance improvements for real workloads, the #1 driving factor is performance per watt. By going with AMD that metric improves ~2x over comparable Intel offerings.There are facilities where physical space to expand is available but the building has effectively run out of additional power that can be provided by the utility company.Scaling up on performance per watt is the last frontier."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s stopping more people from moving cloud workloads to AMD? Unless you&#39;re running a rickety legacy application using Intel features you&#39;ll instantly save money by moving to AMD.Both my work and all my side projects have moved to AMD instances where available, except for some legacy on-prem stuff."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ah, the simple life...My grandfather would take me along and we&#39;d go to the neighbour to fetch eggs. He had a plastic bucket that he put them in with some old newspapers scraps in the bottom. I heard that before the war they didn&#39;t even need money. He&#39;d simply bring a bucket of milk, and he&#39;d get a bucket of eggs in return. But it was of course a lot simpler to bring money. It was far cheaper than in the store too.My grandfather knew what all the birds were singing. Every bit, plus their behaviour. He&#39;d especially heed the magpie, because it&#39;s a smarter bird. If it warbled this way, it meant that the weather would stay warm. If they warbled in another way, it meant that it might become rainy. He said that the birds knew, because their lives depended on it.Another more commonly known sign is dependent on where the magpie makes its nest. If it it&#39;s high in the tree, then it will most likely be a warm and sunny summer. But if it is tucked way down in the tree, the summer will be cold and wet. It makes sense. There&#39;s more protection from the elements further under the leaves, but it&#39;s also colder there. If I were a magpie, I&#39;d want to make a warm and nice nest for the summer, but all that could be ruined if I didn&#39;t heed the weather.One day, the grouse was seen perching atop the family house. When I told this to my grandmother, she went silent at first, and then she told me that it means someone will die in the family. This was of course terrifying news to me. But it also turned out to become true, because my grandfather also died that year. May he rest in peace."</p>

I&#39;ve known farmers like him, bachelors who are mild mannered and love their lives and the extended family that comes with living an entire life in one valley. He maybe goes to Sunday service for socialization and the local pub to watch the game, and as long as his sheep are healthy and the sky does what it promises (because he knows the day before always if it will rain), the peace he feels is the result of being in place, of not creating too much fuss, the satisfaction of seeing the stone walls he built in his 20s holding strong and knowing they&#39;ll be there long after to tell his story. He leaves behind him more of a legacy than many of us."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Small business near me never seem to have online catalogues or stock levels.Hunting for a specific product (for example a washing line) might involve walking into 3 different shops and guessing which shop might sell what you need.  When you arrive in the shop, they always arrange aisles differently so unless you have 20 minutes to hunt you might not find it either.Whereas online it&#39;s a simple search and click &#34;buy now&#34;.  It&#39;s probably cheaper too.Bricks and mortar shops need to do a lot of work on the shopping experience before they&#39;re competitive.   The only time bricks and mortar shops win are when I need something right now or groceries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’d be happy to support local merchants, but they have to get the overall value proposition somewhat competitive. For the most part, they aren’t. Maybe it’s pricing, selection, policies, hours of operation, or some combination, but other than grocers and large chains, I’m not even sure they’re trying.Amazon is winning by serving the customers. Local shops will continue to have a hard time if the primary value prop is “we’re more expensive and not as good, but we’re your neighbor, so you owe us!”I try every so often to use a local shop. Maybe I need a common appliance, lawn mower, or small engine part. If they have it on-hand, I’ll pay 5x the online price to get the job done today. I can only recall one time where that worked. “We can get it for you” only to find out that means a week and 4x the online price. “No thanks; I don’t want to be a bother...” &lt;tap, tap, wait 2-3 days, done&gt;Our dishwasher door broke last Thursday; I fixed it in 30 minutes that Saturday afternoon with a $30 part I ordered on Thursday. Don’t even know how long it would take to setup a $150-200 repair appointment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a really good idea! I love my small businesses but being coddled by the internet is so real, you get used to immediately finding exactly what you want. With local stores, you have to put in some work sometimes, and ghasp talk to real people, potentially a few, at different stores, to get what you need. It sounds like a lot written out like that, but the important bits are that the people you talk to, you learn things from, and that makes you better at finding things.This tool is kind of like that effect, or an easing into it from someone who may have just bought the first-worst thing on Amazon."</p>

I have all three on my phone. Whatsapp usage has dropped a lot lately in my circle of friends. I removed Facebook Messenger ages ago (nobody I know uses that anymore). Just like the Facebook app and instagram. Whatsapp is the last bit of Facebook software on my phone.I&#39;ve been watching this corporate stupidity train wreck play out over the last few months. Every time I open whatsapp I get an obnoxious dialog urging me to pretty please accept their T&amp;Cs. I click it away because I can. The fact that I can amuses me because it signals a certain amount of despair by Facebook. It&#39;s not normal for an app to be usable without accepting the terms and conditions.The dilemma Facebook has is the very real problem that people are opting to uninstall rather than accept. Their users are angry and disgruntled. Which is why they are allowing people to use the app without accepting the terms and conditions. Which is of course highly unusual. From a legal point of view, until I agree, the old T&amp;Cs apply. Basically they are saying those were actually fine and nothing really changed and it&#39;s all cosmetics but bla bla bla could you please accept the new ones anyway. It&#39;s a very weird position to take legally.Either the old T&amp;Cs were fine and there never was a reason to change them or the new ones materially change the old T&amp;Cs and they should just state in plain language why and how. Instead we get this months long weaseling that is no doubt partially inspired by the fact that they are under a lot of scrutiny by authorities in the EU and US for privacy violations, monopolistic tendencies, data leaks, etc. The real issue is that the new T&amp;Cs are of course designed to carve out some legal wiggle room there for Facebook to do user hostile things like ads and tracking. So they are in fact a change and they need users to swallow that."</p>

I&#39;ve tried, yet they always message me through WhatsApp. They&#39;re not people i can really ignore either.Anyway, i guess this is mostly a rant.

Particularly because Apple wasn&#39;t the source of the issue, the issue was people downloading an unofficial XCode tool not made or hosted by Apple. Apple discovered it (just like many researchers did) and made various (non-perfect) efforts to mitigate it. And according to Macrumors, the attack did not really lead to any serious consequences. Not sure if that&#39;s true but I haven&#39;t seen any evidence to the contrary either.&gt; Apple did ultimately inform users that downloaded XcodeGhost apps, and also published a list of the top 25 most popular apps that were compromised. Apple removed all of the infected apps from the  App Store , and provided information to developers to help them validate Xcode going forward.&gt; XcodeGhost was a widespread attack, but it was not effective or dangerous. At the time, Apple said that it had no information to suggest that the malware was ever used for any malicious purpose nor that sensitive personal data was stolen, but it did collect app bundle identifiers, network details, and device names and types."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a huge milestone for the Starship team and SpaceX, so massive congratulations.This was also fun to watch. Fun in part because while SpaceX had it on &#34;tape delay&#34; the enthusiast channels were showing it live. It will be fun to have them do it without the low cloud cover but I&#39;m guessing that without the disassembly at the end they may have some on-board recordings that are recoverable.To whomever does telemetry for these things, the frequency bands you are using are blocked by clouds. It makes it hard to keep a live signal. Ask the FCC for a temporary operating permit for 900Mhz or so. You will be much happier with the results.I was paying close attention to the area of &#39;heat shield&#39; tiles. That is the next really big hurdle. If you recall getting the grid fins on F9 to survive re-entry was a big challenge. Getting tiles that don&#39;t break because the various expansion coefficients don&#39;t match is a big challenge as well. That is critical to having enough fuel left over to stop when you get back down inside the gravity well.It is easy to forget the scale of this thing without visual cues but its like flying skyscrapers around. They are very big. And the booster will be larger still.Also super curious how the lunar lander version will work. That is awfully high up there, could be a long ladder down to the surface. That, and given its mass, means that when it lands on the moon the dust it kicks up will hit escape velocity[1] which will be interesting.All in all though, so much progress in space after so much non-progress. Quite the thrill![1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.12312"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the previous tests Spacex used 2-3 rocket engines for the initial landing burn.For SN15, the rocket used 2 engines throughout the landing procedure. I wonder if this is a sign of their confidence in the improved design.The landing was smooth as butter and nothing went noticeably wrong, although I did noticed that the rocket landed dangerous close to the edge of the concrete pad."</p>

I was shocked when I first saw these living if()s in the server-side C++ code but then realized it was vital for debugging in production.People also used to prefer table based jump over long if-else-if chain for anecdotal performance reasons. That has gradually changed over the evolution of CPUs with various optimizations like the branch prediction. Now some JIT impls like tracing JIT replace virtual function calls with if-elses.By the way, I&#39;m glad that the article is so thoughtfully written that it doesn&#39;t include any ambiguous &#34;best practices&#34; at the end. It could have created yet another myth. The three top tips in the article is more about stating facts. I admire the author taking that stance."</p>

The article mentions that Honeywell sent parts relating to the engine, this could literally just be a valve or bearing component. I doubt this kind of information is usable unless you have a ton of additional documentation describing their function and utility as a sub-assembly.- Honeywell reported this themselves. A bunch of articles on this topic use the phrase &#39;Honeywell admits...&#39; as if this was some kind of smoking gun.The knee-jerk reaction claiming that Honeywell has committed treason or something like it is unreasonable. Methinks incompetence from the sales department is to blame here rather than malice.See Reddit threads discussing same topic:https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/n5vglg/honeywell...https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/n5tcqg/honeywel...https://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/n4gwma/honeywell_...https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/n5n1jc/honeywell_admi...

Then you extract the files where needed [0]I learned this method just last year but it seems it&#39;s pretty universal. At least for Win10 ISOs.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While it is not my experience at all, I understand that some folks have certain negative opinions of Beyond Burgers, and other fake meat/imitation burgers:- The texture is off
- Maybe they cook strangely
- Potentially less tasteBut the most important thing about them, and the reason I urge everyone to at least _try_ Beyond Burgers, is they require no violence against animals.This is not an argument that fairs well on HN in general, but the fact that we can eat something this similar to a burger but without the slaughter of living, feeling, individual being is so unbelievably important and incredible.Maybe you think the burger tastes different, or has a strange texture, but I certainly won&#39;t try to argue that because it doesn&#39;t matter. No one needed to die for you to eat it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m generally surprised no one brings up the negative health benefits of processed foods.  It is not healthier to get rid of meat only to replace it with high salt chemically processed food that tastes like meat.It seems like we are going backwards.You know what uses less greenhouse emissions, less water and less land?  The orginal plant based food that gets processed into a beyond burger.If you really care about the planet why are you buying processed anything?  That get&#39;s shipped nationwide / worldwide that creates factories, chemical waste, greenhouse gases.  Buying locally and growing locally really helps the planet.  Going to burger king and getting an absolute burger instead of a whooper is just pretending."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am an avid meat-lover but it does play on my conscience that I am in fact eating a former sentient being and potentially contributing to environmental devastation.I would appreciate answers to the following two, albeit simplistic questions that always plaque me when I consider stopping eating meat products:1) Is it really unethical to eat animals when the natural trajectory of most animals lives was likely to be eaten by other animals or die some horrendous death in their natural environment? Isn&#39;t it better for an animal to live its best life on a free range farm being grass fed, then get quickly and humanely slaughtered?2)If I made a personal decision to stop eating meat, would there be any significant impact at all on the overall environment realistically? For example, I recently watched the documentary Seaspiracy which showed the negative effects of commercial fishing. However, the reality is that me (not) eating a bowl of sashimi once a week makes no difference in the context of, say, countries like Japan slaughtering millions of fish daily (regardless of any change in behavior on my part or my small circle of influence)?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s nice to see hard evidence of this, but anecdotal evidence is plain to see on Amazon.com reviews. For example, a product gets a lot of 5 star reviews stating that the buyer bought it for their child/relative/friend and they are just sure that they will love it... 5 stars! Or &#34;I just got this delivered yesterday and I haven&#39;t used it yet but it looks really great!&#34;... 5 stars.These are then immediately followed by a 1 star review along the lines of &#34;This is the biggest piece of junk I&#39;ve ever bought online. Will be returning to Amazon. DO NOT BUY!&#34;These aren&#39;t to be confused with the indiscriminate idiots who can&#39;t be bothered to use their brains, who leave mindless reviews such as &#34;This is junk but it was cheap and kinda works... 5 stars!&#34; Right.Most times this trend of 5&#39;s followed by 1&#39;s is seen even in the first page of reviews. It&#39;s a serious problem with the platform. I usually search for reviews written by people who have had the product for a week or two and give the pros/cons along with a less than 5 star rating. That helps me avoid the fakes and the idiots.This makes me wonder why Amazon, in all their analytical genius, isn&#39;t cracking down on this when it&#39;s so blatantly obvious."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s gotten to the point where a product with thousands of reviews and an average 4.5 - 5 star rating immediately raises a red flag with me.And Amazon appears unmotivated to do anything about it. As a personal example, I had purchased a mouth guard that had over six thousand 5-star reviews. It was listed as high quality, FDA approved, etc. When I received it, it was a piece of plastic junk with inkjet quality instructions in English and Chinese. Along with it came a note promising a $10 Amazon gift card if I left a 5 star review and emailed them proof of it.I took a photo of the note and forwarded it to Amazon expecting some action - instead I received a canned response about &#34;we take these issues seriously&#34;. A year later, that seller is still there with dozens of products, all with thousands of 5-star reviews."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Last year, I posted a negative review of an inexpensive (~$10) electronic device on Amazon. A few weeks later, the seller contacted me with an offer of a $20 Amazon gift certificate to take it down. I didn&#39;t respond. A few days later, they offered $30, then $40, then $50."</p>

A part from their conclusion:More than a year after the initial documented cases in Wuhan, the source of SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be identified, and the search for a direct or intermediate host in nature has been so far unsuccessful.The low binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to bat ACE2 studied to date does not support Chiroptera as a direct zoonotic agent. Furthermore, the reliance on pangolin coronavirus receptor binding domain (RBD) similarity to SARS-CoV-2 as evidence for natural zoonotic spillover is flawed, as pangolins are unlikely to play a role in SARS-CoV-2′s origin and recombination is not supported by recent analysis.At the same time, genomic analyses pointed out that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits multiple peculiar characteristics not found in other Sarbecoviruses.A novel multibasic furin cleavage site (FCS) confers numerous pathogenetically advantageous capabilities, the existence of which is difficult to explain though natural evolution...source: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10311-021-01211-0"</p>

How does it take so long for the truth to win?I published a meta-analysis covering much of the same ground in November 2020 and this was only after waiting and expecting for several months that someone with a better platform would do so first.

I don&#39;t think they did this intentionally. I think everyone had the best of intentions and either they found something deep in a bat cave or there was a lab mishap. I&#39;ve gone down the rabbit hole on this issue. Here are some interesting links https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=R01AI110964&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sd... is the papers done by a NIH grant to Eco Health Alliance. This shows they were looking for new variants of Coronavirus at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089274/pdf/114... This shows they were artificially synthesizing Coronaviruses and incubating them in monkey cells. Dr. Peter Daszak seems to be in the center of a lot of this and IMO had a conflict of interest being on the WHO COVID-19 origins report."</p>

S3 can be cost efficient, but only if you don&#39;t touch data :)Their price calculation doesn&#39;t mention cost of S3 requests, which very quickly adds up and is often neglected.It costs $1 for 2.5M GET requests to S3. They have 180 shards, in a general case query seems to fetch all of them. Presumably they don&#39;t download full shard per request, but download an index + some relevant ranges. Lets say that is 10 requests per shard. So that would be 1800 S3 GET requests = ~1400 search queries cost them $1.Assuming their service is reasonably popular and serve 1 req/second on average, that would be $1,440 per 30 days in addition to advertised $1,000 spent on EC2 and S3 storage.Seems comparable to AWS ElasticSearch service costs:- 3 nodes m5.2xlarge.elasticsearch = $1,200- 20TB EBS storage = $1,638"</p>

The reality is that FB&#39;s entire business model has been predicated on the default being that tracking is allowed.If this holds, this will be cataclysmic for FB. You can&#39;t have a huge portion of your wealthy user base just disappear and expect advertisers to keep paying what they were paying previously.BTW, this is also why the covid exposure notification apps failed miserably. They should have always been opt-out."</p>

I don’t think Apple ads won’t be limited to the App Store within a couple years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why would you enable it? What possible benefit is there in doing so?The ads won&#39;t get better regardless of the data they have on you. They aren&#39;t exactly using ML or AI to help you get better ads. Its really just boring data queries in SQL or some graph language. That&#39;s the sum total of most advertising intelligence. Its not 21st century high tech. Its mostly relational databases with some NoSQL to make that table linking faster and cached. In cases where they do actually bring out that NoSQL it is to reimplement all the relational smarts just with extra steps. Then its at least shiny and cool.The whole thing is really just about storing and gathering a profile on you as part of them building an asset they can later resell. Creepy technology for creepy uses. An asset full of subtle errors about you that can likely never be seen or fixed. Much later they will invariably then leave all or some of it on a usb stick or some poorly protected cloud server. After that your details will end up in the hands of some scammer or other miscreant to enable them to send you endless emails full of typos, lies, emojis and if you&#39;re exceptionally average like the rest of us: an interesting tale about long lost nigerian princes just needing a bank account.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great resource. At Splitgraph, we index ~40k open data sets, and we make sure to include structured metadata for each one, so we show up in these results. (example [0])One cool aspect of this metadata is that it allows a dataset to have multiple sources. So if two sites index the same dataset, there is no duplicate content penalty like there might be with textual content. If you search for a dataset, it will include links to all its sources (whether canonical or otherwise).For most of the data we index at Splitgraph, the canonical source is 
an open government data portal powered by Socrata (e.g. data.cdc.gov). We noticed that Socrata powered a lot of portals, so we wrote a Socrata plugin for Splitgraph, along with a scraper to index the metadata. The plugin basically implements a Postgres FDW so that Splitgraph can translate from SQL to the upstream query language. In this case, the plugin translates to Socrata&#39;s bespoke API language. But for private deployments we also have plugins for Snowflake, Postgres, some SaaS services, etc.If you find some data on Google Dataset Search with Splitgraph listed as a source, please take a look! Our &#34;Data Delivery Network&#34; (DDN) is implemented on top of the Postgres wire protocol, so you can connect with any Postgres client (or use our web editor). All the Postgres query syntax is available to you; you can even JOIN across any of the other 40k+ datasets indexed at Splitgraph. That includes &#34;live data&#34; like Socrata portals, but also versioned snapshots of data called &#34;data images.&#34; Here&#39;s an example of a point-in-time query across two snapshots (basically a diff) [1], and another query that joins across tables at data.cityofchicago.org and data.cambridgema.gov [2].[0] https://www.splitgraph.com/cdc-gov/distribution-of-covid19-d... – &#34;View Source&#34; to see the Schema.org metadata[1] https://bit.ly/3epvxcj[2] https://bit.ly/3f1ll8K(Sorry for the bit.ly links.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Can confirm. I’m friends with a group of very smart distributed systems engineers who were excited to launch an actually useful crypto project that gets talked about here from time to time.As much as they’re excited about the technology itself, very few people are actually interested in using it. Instead, their business seems to revolve around the value of the utility tokens for their project.Few people are buying the utility tokens to pay for the service. They’re buying them to horde so they can resell to other speculators when the price goes up. They have a lot of tokens in circulation, but only a small number of them get used to pay for the service. Many of them are sitting in the wallets of exchanges where they get traded back and forth but never come near the blockchain.Investors only care about getting more press releases out so they can pump up the price of their discounted tokens, which have a shortened lockup period relative to something like stocks. It’s almost like a pump-and-dump scheme for investors.Maybe their underlying project will become popular in the future, but the volatility of the token price makes it increasingly unattractive for companies that want to actually use it."</p>

For a space littered with intriguing technology it&#39;s endlessly frustrating that there&#39;s no HN-like forum. Instead, any community that started off that way is now filled with speculators and shillers.Take your pick for where to source your news: 1. crypto influencers on YouTube who are paid to shill, 2. forums likw Reddit filled with speculators and conmen, 3. pump and dump groups on Telegram.The greed and FOMO on display in the crypto gold-rush is deeply depressing, and for the majority who join the craze at the peak of the bull run, it&#39;ll surely end in tears."</p>

There&#39;s similar tech in git, we don&#39;t call it &#34;crypto&#34;, we call it VCS.Calling this &#34;crypto&#34; is just trying to add a mystic aura for stuff people don&#39;t understand, to further muddy the waters.We have a word for this technology. It&#39;s not &#34;crypto&#34;. It&#39;s blockchain.Sure, it&#39;s your shorthand for &#34;cryptocoin&#34; or &#34;cryptovalue&#34;. Which are again newspeak for blockchain, and we could argue that given its limits and usage of the last years they should be called crypto-investment, at best.Which is still like ordering a pizza and forcefully referring to it only as &#34;food&#34;. I want a pepperoni-food please.Sorry for the rant, but it really feels like it&#39;s just a way to further embellish something with dubious values like the post points out"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lots of comments already, but I&#39;ll chime on in.I realized this very late in life, but I have a test for when it&#39;s time to pay attention to a new technology. It&#39;s when technical people look at what seems like a groundbreaking idea, seem unimpressed, and say &#34;couldn&#39;t you just _____&#34;, were the blank is filled with something a nontechnical person doesn&#39;t understand or considers very cumbersome.The web: couldn&#39;t you just transfer a file to an open port and use a rendering tool to view it?Blogs: couldn&#39;t you just update a web page?Wikis: couldn&#39;t you just update a web page?social media: couldn&#39;t you just set up group view preferences and use RSS?youtube: couldn&#39;t you just upload a video and use tags for search?twitter: couldn&#39;t you just not? Isn&#39;t that just a worse version of what we can already do??Honestly, I&#39;ve overlooked almost every one of these things, because I failed to understand how removing small bits of friction can cause a technology to explode.Sure, some ideas are crazy new, but some sound too underwhelming to be revolutionary. but they are, there&#39;s no question about it, all those things I listed above changed the world, in ways both good and pretty damn awful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think &#34;attacking&#34; Crazy New Ideas is how we develop them, iron out the kinks and test our understanding. Criticism is an essential part of the journey from crazy new idea to accepted wisdom.However, the main problem I have with with this article is that it divides people into domain experts and the rest. This kind of black and white thinking is pervasive in PG essays, and always lead to a cute conclusion. You can have two domain experts that disagree. You can have an idea that spans multiple domains, and there are no (or few) experts in all of them. Maybe the Crazy New Idea seems brilliant to experts in one domain, but only because they don&#39;t grasp the others."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"HN comment section pessimism is a new metric for evaluating your odds of success. &#34;It&#39;s too expensive&#34; or &#34;Nobody needs it because we have X&#34; on a project lead by a domain expert is not constructive criticism or conservatism, it&#39;s pure envy.PG isn&#39;t defending Mighty, Dropbox or Coinbase because he has skin in the game, but because he knows what the teams have achieved and what they could potentially achieve.I don&#39;t understand, it seems so obvious to me. Dropbox started as a better FTP, Coinbase is a better Bitcoin wallet, Gmail is a better SMTP, Mighty is a better Chrome. All of these products are meant for the masses because the core technologies/protocols are too complicated or restrictive to directly interact with."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The online ad business generally mystifies me.  While an awful lot of the internet, especially the surveillance advertising part, looks to be the greatest misallocation of engineering (and other) talent in the history of the world, ya gotta ask about the efficacy.The only reasonably accurate targeting I&#39;ve ever run into is the occasional ad for something I just browsed on Amazon.  I&#39;ve never clicked on an internet ad.  Youtube advertising might as well be targeted to an alien race.  What in the hell keeps this whole business afloat at it&#39;s current level?  Am I being programmed to buy that mechanic&#39;s vise because they threw up an after-the-browse ad?No doubt there&#39;s some sort of backend telemetry that proves the value of all this trouble, but I just don&#39;t see it.  Maybe the emperor really is nekkid.edit:  It may well be that the real marketing genius in the advertising industry is not it&#39;s value in increasing sales, whether it&#39;s old school print media/OTA/tradeshows or the newfangled spying-on-you internet variety, but in convincing it&#39;s customers of advertising&#39;s value.  Anything beyond pushing you up a search engine&#39;s ranking strikes me as a sketchy proposition."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author writes that you can either pay with money or you can “pay with your attention”. What’s left unsaid is the cost of that attention. I believe that cost is very high and it isn’t just ads, it’s the design of countless products including social media sites, games and even the site you’re reading this on right now. It’s all designed to extract as much attention as possible, and the cost is people’s ability to concentrate, learn and get shit done. The cost is, in other words, staggeringly high."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As the person who originally asked &#34;why&#34; I feel like I ought to respond, though much of it is covered by other comments. I used to work in more trad advertising, so my question wasn&#39;t so much an objection to working in advertising itself, but specifically Google&#39;s version of advertising, which I see as gross overreach into people&#39;s personal lives.In other comments people have mentioned YouTube subscriptions as being an alternative, it really isn&#39;t - OK, you don&#39;t see any adverts, but they&#39;re still harvesting and selling you. That a privately owned corporation is allowed to read your messages and sell what they find to the highest bidder is vile and honestly makes me wonder how we got here.I quit advertising after only a couple of years because it blackened my soul. If I was helping to harvest people&#39;s personal lives for private profit I can only imagine it would have been worse."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"For about 15 years I&#39;ve been trying to figure out how to articulate a `Tetris is life` essay. &#34;Things are going good, you&#39;re given an S piece that doesnt fit anywhere. You have to decide where you&#39;ll put that blocking piece so that you can hopefully clear it later. This might be an unexpected car repair bill or a death that you aren&#39;t emotionally capable of addressing ... You&#39;re in control, you have a good job, a great partner, and yall are saving to buy a house -- basically waiting for an l piece to complete your `Tetris`...&#34;Anyway, this game of (ha)Tetris is a lot like a lot of people&#39;s lives, just roadblock after roadblock. While the normal version where you start from zero on level one is probably an upper middle class life. And Id say that the majority of people in the world start on level 6 with the board halfway filled with a bunch of gaps and the pieces move at a speed that is barely controllable (im thinking of the classic gameboy version when I imagine these boards)Hatetris is cool. I couldn&#39;t get one line and I consider myself a damn good tetris player. It kept giving me S pieces and threw a Z in there and then an l"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Open-ended homework for those who are interested: solve the same problem, but with actual Tetris rules.I&#39;ve seen a bunch of those &#34;adversarial tetris&#34; variants, and they all operate under the assumption that any of the seven pieces can appear at any time, and with only one preview.Modern Tetris has 3 previews + hold, and pieces are drawn randomly &#34;from a bag&#34;, without replacement (more formally, if P[i] is the sequence of pieces, each aligned subsequence of 7 pieces must be a permutation of the tetrominos).This would be more interesting to make/play. Note that under such rules there exists a strategy that allows infinite play if the well is at least 17 tiles high."</p>

Nice one!&gt;&gt;IBM states that the technology can fit ’50 billion transistors onto a chip the size of a fingernail’. We reached out to IBM to ask for clarification on what the size of a fingernail was, given that internally we were coming up with numbers from 50 square millimeters to 250 square millimeters."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The table in the article suggests to me that instead of this fictional &#34;feature size&#34;, we could use the achievable transistor area as a more meaningful measure of process scale.IBM achieved 50B transistors in 150mm^2, for a per-transistor area of 3000 nm^2.TSMC&#39;s 5nm process (used by Apple&#39;s M1 chip) apparently achieves a transistor area of 5837 nm^2, while Intel&#39;s 10nm is lagging at roughly 10000 nm^2."</p>

I recall many people reporting that fake comments antithetical to their own beliefs had been submitted using their identities.Why was FCC head Ajit Pai able to get away with citing fraudulent evidence? How can we stop such blatant corruption of the FCC&#39;s policy-making process in the future?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The headline news is that they do so with impunity and achieved their goals at no cost. The corporations (&#34;like AT&amp;T, Comcast and Charter&#34;), their association (Broadband for America), the lobbying firm (unnamed - who is it?), and the FCC, to the degree it failed its duties, suffer no consequences - and indeed the corporations get what they wanted; their plan worked.&gt; The report said investigators had not found evidence that Broadband for America or the lobbying firm it used for the campaign were aware of the fraud. But, the attorney general said, several “significant red flags” had “appeared shortly after the campaign started, and continued for months yet still remained unheeded.”&gt; The attorney general’s office said it had reached agreements with three “lead generation” services that were involved — Fluent, Opt-Intelligence and React2Media, companies that gather customers for clients as part of marketing efforts. Under the agreements, the companies said they would more clearly disclose to individuals how their personal information was being used. The companies also agreed to pay over $4 million in penalties."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can&#39;t say what&#39;s driving all the playerbase losses but:They stopped development on Diablo 3 a long time ago. It doesn&#39;t have the staying power of more modern online games where new content is added continuously.They stopped development on HotS, which never achieved the same level of pull as League of Legends.Overwatch faces stiff competition from Valorant and other competitive small team FPSes, and also has overlapping audiences with battle royale FPSes.Starcraft 2 is basically dead. WC3 remastered flopped. The RTS genre writ large is definitely in a waning phase.IMO, when a gaming company doesn&#39;t make new games, it is going to see some losses in the playerbase. To me it&#39;s more remarkable that they&#39;ve only seen this much of a dropoff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Do you guys not have phones?&#34; -Blizzard staff in 2018, in response to booing fans upset that Blizzard wouldn&#39;t make a PC version of a game those same fans obviously wanted to play.This company has been contemptuous of their players for years.   They fell into that classic trap of &#34;If we [do something that will alienate all our customers] we can get 10x as many customers from [untapped market]&#34;    As anybody should have been able to foresee, the old customers were indeed alienated and the new customers never materialized."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Blizzard died the day it was bought by Activision. It has been descending into mediocrity ever since. Many executives left, and many studios/teams inside Blizzard have been shuffled around and between projects, unlike Blizzard&#39;s doctrine of old (tight teams focused on a project until it&#39;s great or must be stopped -- Blizzard&#39;s infamous &#34;Soon(tm)&#34;).World of Warcraft is still being milked till it dries up (and I&#39;m saying that as someone clocking 560+ days in game). Diablo has been abandonned (see the announcement of a mobile Diablo game last year¹, and its reception by the player base). So has StarCraft. Overwatch is stagnant (no new hero for a year) and Overwatch 2 is probably in development hell (pure speculation on my part I&#39;ll admit). Heroes of the Storm is also pretty stagnant (the game went from a hero every month to only two last year, nothing in 2021 so far).In the meantime, there has been a very heavy push for e-sports with Overwatch and Heroes of the Storm (though I have not followed any of those). These efforts seem, to me, extremely centred on American audience, unlike League of Legends which has multiple leagues around the world. I&#39;m sure a ton of money has been poured into this venture, but I&#39;m unsure it has improved the games...Anyway, the last time I launched Battle.net was for Destiny 2... and it has migrated to Steam in the middle of 2019!¹Wow OK, that was in 2018 o_O Time flies, especially with a global pandemic, it seems..."</p>

					<h3><a href="http://mobileatscale.com/">Show HN: I wrote the book Building Mobile Apps at Scale</a></h3>
				</div>
				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27050801">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m excited to share that Building Mobile Apps at Scale: 39 Engineering Challenges is out. It&#39;s my first-ever paperback book and one that is free as a PDF for the rest of the month[1].I had worked for years at Uber, first as a mobile engineer, then an engineering manager. Despite being a mobile-first company, I could not shake the feeling that non-mobile engineers and managers consistently underestimated the complexity of large-scale mobile development. I&#39;ve been in so many meetings where an engineer, a PM, or a director would say, &#34;oh, compared to the backend, the mobile part should be simple enough... it&#39;s just another frontend, right?&#34;.I found myself explaining again and again to PMs, engineers, and stakeholders all the hoops the mobile team needs to jump to ship things in production. How mistakes are very expensive - and thus, we need to ship almost all changes behind feature flags. How the build train means that the changes we make today will take at least 2 weeks to get to prod. How devices being offline is something we need to actively support, and anticipate... and so on. I noticed similar &#34;aha moments&#34; each time. Talking with other mobile engineers in similar environments, they were having similar conversations, and battling similar assumptions on mobile being relatively simple.I had been collecting the numerous challenging areas that I planned to publish as a blog post. After I shared the draft on Twitter[2], I got an unexpected amount of interest in people offering to contribute. The contents became too long for a post, and so this book was born. Several people asked for a paperback version[3], and I decided to create the book in print as well, as I felt the contents warranted it.I hope you find this book useful - both if you&#39;re a mobile engineer or if you work with mobile teams. And I&#39;d love to hear any feedback![1] https://www.mobileatscale.com/#pricing[2] https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1335305213394251780[3] https://twitter.com/elevenetc/status/1335595203411972097"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having read the book cover to cover I can say that it is quite a well made, relatable list of challenges and how they are being resolved in the sector. Foreseeing these types of issues is hard especially if you never went through the process, and quite hairy to resolve as such I believe it is a very good resource to have.On another note each section comes with quite a lengthy follow up material, which I found absolutely amazing to use as a starting point as well.Absolutely love it!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everything Gergely writes (and he writes a lot! Books, blogs, tweets; and also YT channel) is gold, especially if you&#39;re into mobile dev, interested in growing as a senior developer, or if you live in Europe and are interested by big tech. He&#39;s really filling a huge gap.Re:book, I&#39;ve been an Android dev for 3 years (hybrid &amp; native) and the book really covers the whole spectrum of things (as you can see in the table of contents) that need to be done to have a good app, some of them hard to know in advance. At the same time, it can (and should) be read and understood by non-devs (project managers, directors etc.). Congrats on the launch!"</p>

Thankfully, they’re both very cordial with one another and both happily remarried.I have doubts this means anything negative for the foundation, other than maybe a rebrand of the name.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A particularly bad instance of link tracking I&#39;ve found is in TikTok&#39;s link sharing feature.If you share a link from the TikTok app, it gives you a vm.tiktok.com/[xyz] link to send/post elsewhere. It gives you no indication that this isn&#39;t a generic link to the post, nor does it give you an option to expose the generic link to the post.Instead, when you share that link and someone clicks on it and does not have the app, it opens with a header saying &#34;[First Last] is on TikTok.&#34; On the other hand, once you do click on that link (if and only if you don&#39;t have the app installed), you get redirected to the static link to the video and finally obtain it.This is an anti-pattern that enables further tracking and potentially unknowingly exposes user data when links are shared publicly. And there&#39;s no indication to the user that this is happening, since the link is structured as if it does not contain any tracking. Ie a tool like this wouldn&#39;t be able to &#34;strip out&#34; the tracking since it isn&#39;t tacked on in any way, but embedded as the generated link itself."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would love to see an &#39;educational&#39; mode on this - rather than just removing the tracking elements, put some info on-screen that shows what was removed and why, so people can use this as a tool to learn more about what types of tracking exist online and how common it is. Hopefully that would lead to a more knowledgeable end user community online and we can have more nuanced discussions in the future about where tracking is benign, and where it is not."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you want to treat climate change as an existential threat, then you do whatever it takes to keep all existing nuclear running until fossil fuel plants are gone from the entire continent. And you put a little money to subsidize/stimulate new nuclear on the off chance some of the advanced nuclear concepts work out (or as a backup in case renewables improve slower than we think).You don’t have to stop or even slow renewables deployment to do this. They are fairly different industries with different workforce’s, so there are resources to do both simultaneously without significant interference. And you’re not going to get “too much” electricity as cheap abundant electricity will help accelerate decarbonization of other things like building heat and transport and industrial processes.Existing nuclear ESPECIALLY must be protected. And existing hydro. Number 1 and number 2 (tied with wind) clean energy sources.Nuclear power produces as much energy in our country as coal. We can phase out coal twice as fast if we at very least keep nuclear around a few years longer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A broad carbon price that starts small but rises gradually over time would be better than passing a hodge podge of half measures.

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27042151">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have been noticing the impact of excessive multitasking on myself lately, and I am now actively trying to avoid it.
At first i thought that multitasking would increase my overall efficiency by filling in gaps of downtime in certain tasks, but it soon turned me into a person incapable of focusing on anything deeply.
One day, I noticed that I am unable to read a book the same way i did as a child (cover to cover in one sitting for example), and it kind of shocked me.
I now have a rule that i do one thing only, and start other tasks only when the previous task has been finished. This applies to both productive work (learning, programming etc.) and entertainment (YouTube, books etc.).
I think that it is starting to help, but I feel like it will take time to undo the damage of years of bad multitasking."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My primary school age son, and anecdotally, lots of other kids of similar age, relentlessly multitask in ways that hurts my brain just to think about.He literally is playing a game, watching a YouTube video in another screen, and talking to friends at the same time, and in the most extreme case, is even listening to an audiobook or podcast as well.Asking kids about it, they all say that&#39;s just what they do and look at us oldies like we are from the 20th century or something."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yet multitasking is still being branded as something of a higher cognitive functioning. Byung-Chul Han in The Burnout Society claims that it is the opposite:&gt; “The attitude toward time and environment known as “multitasking’ does not represent civilisational progress. Human beings in the late-modern society of work and information are not the only ones capable of multitasking. Rather, such an aptitude amounts to regression. Multitasking is commonplace among wild animals. It is an attentive technique indispensable for survival in the wilderness.&gt; An animal busy with eating must also attend to other tasks. For example, it must hold rivals away from its prey. It must constantly be on the lookout, lest it be eaten while eating. At the same time, it must guard its young and keep an eye on its sexual partner. In the wild, the animal is forced to divide its attention between various activities. That is why animals are incapable of contemplative immersion—either they are eating or they are copulating.”&gt; ...&gt; We owe the cultural achievements of humanity—which include philosophy—to deep, contemplative attention.”"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The world is a scary and violent place. Without Liveleak, you might never feel it. Until you see the actual violence and gore, it doesn&#39;t mean anything, it&#39;s just empty words. I didn&#39;t care at all about wars in the middle east until I saw the reality on Liveleak. Seeing dead children and people with their legs blown off made all the commentary on CNN and Fox seem so understated.A lot is said about desensitization as a result of seeing horrible things on the internet, but in my experience, only the opposite was true. Seeing violence online when I was in my late teens sensitized me and made the stories on the TV real. Frankly, I owe a lot of my political beliefs (especially on foreign policy) to horrible realities I saw on Liveleak."</p>

Your demise means that people who want to see something like a shooting that&#39;s been removed from mainstream platforms will be forced to visit darker corners of the internet.

I can only imagine that he might be similarly self-righteous in workplace situations.I think that, no matter your political views, if a situation gets out of hand that bad over matters that aren&#39;t even really directly related to workplace concerns, something must have gone fundamentally wrong much earlier.

Very easy to get into drama scenarios with this mix. Very easy to mishandle it. But it still seems that this topic is not normal workplace topic. If there is a serious issue in that matter, you go to some authorities. If you did not address it officially and decided to attack the head people - sorry, it&#39;s not the way. That might suggest that there was no real issue as there were no serious actions;- policy change public announcement first then to your team: Yeah that&#39;s a big mistake, something that probably their books wouldn&#39;t even advise.

I think a lot of this is actually racist.”He continued: “Very often, if you express a dissenting view, you get called a Nazi. … I have not felt this is open territory for discussion. If we were to try to get into it as a group discussion it would be very painful and divisive.”Singer concluded his remarks. Fried responded, “Thank you, Ryan.”A handful of other speakers followed. Then a Black employee asked if the company could revisit Singer’s remarks. (I’m withholding the employee’s name and other identifying details out of colleagues’ fears that they could be targeted for harassment for speaking out.)--Interesting that comments objecting to political hyperbole gets the commenter suspended (leading to resignation) with his name all over the place, while those who called for his censure are deemed as needing to be protected from naming due to &#34;harrassment for speaking out&#34;."</p>

Sorry to have caused some confusion: this is part of a research project, and it&#39;s not yet meant to be terribly legible to a public audience.In the near-term, this project is about augmenting written texts so that readers can easily remember the key details. See https://quantum.country for an example or https://numinous.productions/ttft for detailed background and discussion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some context: The author created https://quantum.country which is a text book augmented with spaced-repetition. It seems that Orbit is a toolkit for creating these types of flashcard/spaced-repetition learning webpages for anyone (with the user data being stored at Orbit&#39;s server).I&#39;ll have to say that I&#39;m still not 100% sure how useful this approach is. Most of the times when you&#39;re learning something you&#39;re not merely reading, but you&#39;re also actively using the knowledge in some way. If I&#39;m learning about B-trees then the major part of that learning process is implementing them. If I&#39;m learning some complicated math I will solve a bunch of exercises. Where does flashcards in a text book fit into this?It was also my impression (from the Anki community) that spaced-repetition is far more effective when you create the cards yourself. A common &#34;beginner mistake&#34; is to download a pre-made deck and start memorizing from scratch."</p>

But someone who is buying ads will read this same thing, be impressed by just how tightly Facebook can target, and put $10K into an Ad Account to try it out.As to me, I use Facebook, I am willing to see ads within Facebook using the information I share with Facebook but where I draw the line is Facebook &#34;leaking&#34; into my wider web browsing history (either tracking me, or using my non-Facebook browsing to advertise to me on Facebook). Therefore, I use Mozilla&#39;s Facebook Container extension and blacklist Facebook/Instagram&#39;s &#34;Share&#34; tracking buttons.I also access Facebook from a mobile browser rather than app and use Signal instead of Facebook Messager, to limit Facebook&#39;s ability to track my location and other phone meta-data."</p>

Even if you work for Megacorp with a $$$ budget, keep in mind that your future hires need to start somewhere, need to be able to learn on their own, and need to do so safely.Don&#39;t walk down the same path as IBM&#39;s mainframes, where no student anywhere ever has been able to learn on their own, making it a dead-end for corporations who pay billions for this platform.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Random diamond story! As a freshman in college, I took a geology class and our teacher asked all of the women in our class to raise their hand if they would rather have natural or human-made diamonds. Most of the women (over 80%) raised their hands for natural. The reasons they gave all seemed to tie back to branding and natural diamonds being “real.”Then our teacher gave another analogy. He asked if people would rather have natural ice or human-made ice in their water. He broke down that the human-made ice could be frozen in a freezer to a custom size/shape, be a lot cleaner, consistent in how you make it, and chemically no different than H20 than naturally occurring frozen water. As you looked around the lecture hall, you started to see people’s brains unlock. He went on to explain cost efficiencies, ethics, challenges with conflict diamonds, and how you could make a perfect diamond at a fraction of the coast.After a 30 minute lecture, he asked the question again. Surprisingly, the majority of the women still wanted natural diamonds although the number was less than the original amount that raised their hand. That was the point where I realized the strength of diamonds product branding."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good for them. It&#39;s literally the same material, and we can now use scientific and engineering advances to remove the need for people to toil and die underground to get them.Hopefully the process is more environmentally friendly too.They are real diamonds.I find it hi-goddamned-larious that the moment these became viable, the industry switched from &#34;Diamond purity is the be-all and end-all and you must have the clearest, most pure&#34; to &#34;Oh, well of course it&#39;s all about having the right impurities to increase sparkle and character, lab-grown diamonds don&#39;t have character&#34;Just like with sapphires, if we&#39;re not there already I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t be long before exactly the right type and number of impurities or faults can be introduced to mimic any natural diamond."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you want to read about the insanity of manipulation in the diamond industry, this Atlantic article on de Beers from 1982 is a … gem.Of the many shocking moments, one that stood out to me was the way they went after post-war Japan to convert their &#34;backwards&#34; desires to ones of a more &#34;forward-thinking&#34; diamond friendly impulse:&#34;J. Walter Thompson began its campaign by 
 suggesting that diamonds were a visible 
 sign of modern Western values. It created 
 a series of color advertisements in Japanese 
 magazines showing beautiful women displaying 
 their diamond rings. All the women had 
 Western facial features and wore European 
 clothes. Moreover, the women in most of 
 the advertisements were involved in some 
 activity -- such as bicycling, camping, 
 yachting, ocean swimming, or mountain 
 climbing -- that defied Japanese traditions. 
 In the background, there usually stood a 
 Japanese man, also attired in fashionable 
 European clothes. In addition, almost all 
 of the automobiles, sporting equipment, and 
 other artifacts in the picture were conspicuous 
 foreign imports. The message was clear: 
 diamonds represent a sharp break with the 
 Oriental past and a sign of entry into modern life.&#34;&#34;The campaign was remarkably successful. Until 1959, 
 the importation of diamonds had not even been 
 permitted by the postwar Japanese government. When 
 the campaign began, in 1967, not quite 5 percent 
 of engaged Japanese women received a diamond 
 engagement ring. By 1972, the proportion had risen 
 to 27 percent. By 1978, half of all Japanese women 
 who were married wore a diamond; by 1981, some 60 
 percent of Japanese brides wore diamonds. In a 
 mere fourteen years, the 1,500-year Japanese 
 tradition had been radically revised. Diamonds 
 became a staple of the Japanese marriage. Japan 
 became the second largest market, after the United 
 States, for the sale of diamond engagement rings.&#34;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/02/have-yo..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel a common issue with such &#34;dead bedroom&#34; discussions is the seeming lack of capacity of some parties (including some prominent toplevel comments here) to understand how deep a need for sex many people have.  To think sex can be replaced with &#34;strong friendships&#34; is laughable to anyone who actually feels a strong desire for sex.The dead bedroom situations I&#39;ve seen with my friends (M-&gt;F equally as well as F-&gt;M) are always the result of one party being incapable of understanding the other&#39;s desire for sex.  This leads them when pressed to try approaches such as, substituting &#34;being nicer&#34; for sex, trying therapy to reduce their partner&#39;s sex drive, or just forgetting about the problem because they are unable to sympathize with it.  Ideas such as initiating sex more often or opening up the relationship either don&#39;t occur to them, are vehemently opposed, or forgotten about.No-one is entitled to sex.  But individuals in a sexually-exclusive relationship are entitled to sympathy, action, and compromise from their partner to bridge severe differences in sexuality, just the same as any other sticking point in a relationship."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really like this post because it exudes nuance. So many problems are boiled down to terse summaries that are barely accurate when examining details.People being hateful and violent are a problem. More of a problem are the conditions that push people in this direction. When presenting the underlying cause, people push back and instead focus on scapegoating or minimizing.This problem occurs in engineering all the time too. We accrue &#34;tech debt&#34; and when it bites us we&#39;re quick to blame incompetence or bad luck. Nobody wants to hear that the problem is because we have to &#34;waste time&#34; working on hardly visible components that don&#39;t change anything except &#34;down the road.&#34;The problem is the same now. We blame &#34;bad apples&#34; and &#34;bad days&#34; instead of blaming our own culture and society and undertaking the effort to improve it. We try to make the world fit our own perspectives instead of critically examining our biases. We outright lie to ourselves, and I&#39;m frankly sick of it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My pet theory is that the developed or post-industrialized world is becoming increasingly two-classed. I have had the privilege of having a decent job (being so-called &#34;economically desirable&#34;) and decent education and was able to find someone who I think loves me for who I am, for some definition of &#34;I am&#34;.That being said, the &#34;incel&#34; problem concerns me. I think the existence of this entire class of individuals shows that the ideals of equity in gender relations, just like the ideal of equity in relations across economic classes (i.e., being equal before the law, regardless of how much money you have) is obviously a grand ideal that we cannot live up to.I once tried talking to my girlfriend about it when the topic came up. I brought up the usual statistics that show that men graduate from college at a lesser rate than women, nowawdays. That they are more likely to die in violence or from drugs. That this compounds with the fact that the status of women in the world has generally raised (a _good_ thing!) and that the average woman wants someone who is above them on the social or economic ladder. Her response was that they had so much &#34;male privilege&#34; and that they have no excuse for underperforming. That, thus, they should still be _ahead_ of women, presumably, despite the goal being that they... shouldn&#39;t be. They need to pull themselves up from their bootstraps, and &#34;man up&#34;, but we also must remember that &#34;man up&#34; is a problematic term that is part of &#34;toxic masculinity&#34;.Of course, all of this was foreseen by French novelist Houellebecq. Economic liberalization has lead to social/sexual liberation. After a period of free love things settle down and here we are. Just as most of the new income generated by later periods of economic liberalization go to the top 20%, so it is with the sexual market.I&#39;ve tried to stop moralizing it for my own mental health. Like the author, I just try to look at it with a degree of sympathy. It&#39;s complex, and it&#39;s kinda fucked up. For myself, these hard statistical realities have increasingly robbed me of the romantic impulse. Marriage to me now seems absurd. An empty, pyrrhic victory."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something that I&#39;ve noticed recently is that in my work life, I&#39;m finding there&#39;s more bureaucracy in what I do, mostly in the name of &#34;efficiency&#34;. When you encounter a problem to solve, there&#39;s often a process already defined that is most efficient (or at least thought to be most efficient), when accomplishing tasks, there&#39;s a pre-defined way of laying out the tasks (i.e. tickets), updating them, reviewing them, and organizationally figuring out what&#39;s best to do next.In my opinion, these processes are an attempt at organizational efficiency. However, the flip side is it reduces personal agency for the worker. There&#39;s little room to diverge or think about what you&#39;re doing. If you diverge, such as taking longer to do something than what was prescribed, or using a different pattern to solve a problem, there is a cost to you within the system. You must explain why, which itself &#34;costs&#34; something. In a sense, you&#39;re punished for doing things differently.That loss of personal agency is absolutely soul-sucking. You feel like a machine, again at the cost of organizational efficiency. Slack is definitely important because it lets people acquire some sense of personal agency again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"And this is why you schedule flights in the morning: there&#39;s so damn little slack in the system that if things go wrong at 10:00 AM at O&#39;Hare, flights for the whole rest of the day are screwed up owing to the cascading delays.At least in the morning the airlines have had the overnight to unsnarl the previous day&#39;s mess because of the reduced revenue traffic overnight and the corresponding slack that accrues as a happy side effect.This is also why things like the healthcare system, transportation network, and postal system shouldn&#39;t be run for maximum utilization/efficiency under normal load: if there isn&#39;t any slack in the system it gets real ugly when things get squirrelly. In cases of localized disturbance, we get by on mutual aid: linemen and bucket trucks from far away respond in the aftermath of e.g. a hurricane or tornado. Likewise, fire departments from all over The greater Boston area responded to the gas explosions in the Merrimack Valley[0] and companies from even further away repositioned trucks to cover the departments that responded directly.When it&#39;s national or global scale event, you&#39;re left leaning on whatever slack was in the system. As we&#39;re all painfully aware, there hasn&#39;t been enough. The public health and healthcare systems have been doing heroic work, but if they weren&#39;t stretched so tight in the name of efficiency beforehand, there&#39;d be less need for the heroic efforts.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrimack_Valley_gas_explosion..."</p>

It had the requisite votes but the user had not merged it.

The truth is probably that each company had just a few very important acquisitions (that  should be more closely scrutinized).Our current tax laws make vertical integration or even conglomerates more tax efficient.

https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-vega-liteIt&#39;ll be very interesting to see this develop.  My initial reaction, as a vega-lite user is I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s worth learning the new API immediately.Having said that, I do find the idea of writing transforms in javascript compelling, and I can see there may be some situations in which this is a very elegant solution.I think the idea of a plotting library allowing transforms is initially a little jarring - feels potentially like poor separation of concerns.  But the more I think about it, the more it seems really logical: a lot of transforms (e.g binning) are done only for plotting purposes, in which case keeping them in the visualisation logic makes complete sense.Looking further ahead (not sure this is possible in Plot yet, but giving its integration with Observable I&#39;m sure it will be), the idea of a reactive model where charts can both react to user interactions, but also be the source of inputs (select a range, drag a bar, draw a distribution freehand) is very exciting.Transforms and signals are both possible in vega/vega lite, but I can definitely see the benefit of them being cleaner and being able to accept arbitrary javascript."</p>

I&#39;ve also heard great managers self-deprecatingly say they &#34;don&#39;t do any work&#34;. I&#39;ve seen managers feeling bad they weren&#39;t productive so they resorted to writing code to feel that they were having impact.This post is an example of the incredible impact an engineering manager can have without writing a line of code."</p>

Things students learn during their formative years at university will bear fruit once they enter the work force.How many of those students are now at or about to enter important positions in the industry?Do you think Java could have become this big if it wasn&#39;t teached at so many universities at the entry level?"</p>

It&#39;s under the eyes of everyone, and not enforcing such policy will only make it even worse for Amazon itself that eventually will end up selling only non-branded products. Finally it will be only another e-commerce like &#34;ebay&#34; used to be, and something else will replace it. Just enjoy the ride until you can.PS: speaking out of experience, I had one time a talk to a director from an important online shop (top 3 in the country in that specific field) and &#34;this sort of things&#34; was exactly the reason why they chose to use MS Azure instead of AWS. Imagine how deep it can go. And I totally support that.PPS: I don&#39;t understand the downvote.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thought exercise because I legitimately struggle with this. Is this fundamentally different than Costco using sales data to choose which Kirkland products to launch/sell? If so, how? If not, then why do we not pursue Costco with the same gusto as Amazon? To me this behavior by Amazon seems worse, but I can&#39;t figure out why."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The most interesting part of the HN discussion is not about the definition of what Amazon is doing, but the occasional misunderstanding of how large brick and mortar retail businesses operate at scale (see: buying shelf space/payment dependant on sales/etc).There are lots of folks on here that understand what Amazon is doing, less who understand retail businesses mechanisms.I&#39;m not sure what Amazon is doing is legal (def will vary widely between the eu and us markets), but it is another interesting example of how doing something at scale can be perceived as fundamentally different then when it&#39;s done in a smaller way (especially as it pertains to privacy)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an excellent example of what I call the Copy-Object-Copy effect.  It&#39;s particularly apparent in frameworks with ORMs like Django.  In Pandas case, devs will do &#39;SELECT *&#39; and use pandas as a sort of pseudo ORM.You run a query to get your data as a bunch of objects, but you&#39;re copying the data over the db connection from the postgres wire protocol into Python objects in memory, which are typically then garbage collected at the end of the transaction, then copy the result to a JSON buffer that is also garbage collected, and then send the final result to send to the browser which has been waiting this whole time.I regularly see Django apps require several gigs of RAM per worker and when you look at the queries, it&#39;s just a bunch of poorly rendered SELECTs.  It&#39;s grotesque.Contrast PostgREST:  100 megabytes of RAM per worker.  I&#39;ve seen Django DRF workers require 50 to 1 memory vs PostgREST for the same REST interface and result with PostgREST being much faster. Since the database is generating the json, it can do so immediately upon generating the first result row which is then streamed to the browser.  No double buffering.Unlike Django, it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t like Pandas, it&#39;s that people way overuse it for SQL tasks as this article points out.  I&#39;ve seen pandas scripts that could be a simpler psql script.  If psql can&#39;t do what you want, resist the temptation to &#39;SELECT *&#39; into a data frame and break the problem up into stages where you get the database to do the maximum work before it gets to the data frame."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Pandas is a very popular tool for data analysis. It comes built-in with many useful features, it&#39;s battle tested and widely accepted. However, pandas is not always the best tool for the job.SQL is very useful, but there are some data manipulations which are much easier to perform in pandas/dplyr/data.table than in SQL. For example, the article discusses how to perform a pivot table, which takes data in a &#34;long&#34; format, and makes it &#34;wider&#34;.In the article, the pandas version is:&gt;pd.pivot_table(df, values=&#39;name&#39;, index=&#39;role&#39;, columns=&#39;department&#39;, aggfunc=&#39;count&#39;)Compared to the SQL version:&gt;SELECT
    role,
    SUM(CASE department WHEN &#39;R&amp;D&#39; THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as &#34;R&amp;D&#34;,
    SUM(CASE department WHEN &#39;Sales&#39; THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as &#34;Sales&#34;
FROM
    emp
GROUP BY
    role;Not only does the SQL code require you to know up front how many distinct columns you are creating, it requires you to write a line out for each new column. This is okay in simple cases, but is untenable when you are pivoting on a column with hundreds or more distinct values, such as dates or zip codes.There are some SQL dialects which provide pivot functions like in pandas, but they are not universal.There are other examples in the article where the SQL code is much longer and less flexible, such as binning, where the bins are hardcoded into the query."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The more I learn SQL, the less I write Python.Although the SQL syntax is weird and so dated, its portability across tools trumps everything else. You finished the EDA and decided to port the insights to a dashboard? With SQL it&#39;s trivial. With Python... well, probably you&#39;ll have to port it to SQL unless you have Netflix-like, Jupyter-backed dashboard infrastructure in place. For many of us who only have much-more-prevalent SQL-based dashboard platform, why not starting from SQL? Copy-n-paste is your friend!I still hate the SQL as a programmer, but as a non-expert data analyst I now have accepted it."</p>

MPQS processing nodes could be added and removed dynamically, so if somebody needed a computer that was part of my cluster, they could just quit my program and everything would go back to normal.Also, once the number theory professor learned of what I had implemented, he worked out an agreement with the lab manager to give me legitimate access to the machines. :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In 19 and 82 or 3, I worked at Lockheed Shipyard in Seattle, in a sort of tech writing capacity on a Navy ship building project, based on my recent experience in the Navy. The business closed with completion of the ships.We had to fill out lots of forms that documented what we called &#34;analysis,&#34; and we&#39;d often have to change them based on some factor changing. One change could cascade through the whole form.Paper forms. Green see-through plastic letter guides. Whiteout. Lots of whiteout.We had access to a department mini computer, don&#39;t remember what it was. The language might have been Basic-like, but I didn&#39;t know enough to recognize it as such.I figured out how to write and run programs, someone showed me how to print, and I wrote a program that would accept values for all a form&#39;s fundamental values, and cascade those through calculations for the dependent values, and print out the filled in form. You could save it, update a new value, re-cascade, and print it out again. No more whiteout.Part of the calculation involved sorting. I didn&#39;t know anything about sorting, so I implemented what I later learned was bubble sort. Because that&#39;s obviously how you&#39;d do that.The system administer noticed more load when people ran my program. He found me, and told me not to do that again.I learned that there was a thing called a system administrator. He might have given me a better canned sort, don&#39;t remember.I eventually thought it would be a good idea to quit and go to school, so I did.(I took a number theory class, but had to drop it.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ah yes, good memories. I&#39;m having a really hard time right now remembering the name of that program that blocked access to the Finder; I think it was &#34;Easy&#34;-something. Google fails me on the name too. Breaking it was a hobby.Some school labs had left access to Hypercard available through that program, so you could just pull up Hypercard and make a new stack that would tell the program to quit.The other way to get around it -- or around many other misbehaving programs in the cooperative multitasking system -- was to bring up the programmer&#39;s interrupt like the author describes, and enter &#34;SM 0 A9F4&#34;, followed by &#34;G 0&#34;. This would set memory location 0 to the _exitToShell function in the OS ROM and then resume execution from there, which immediately terminated whatever was in the foreground.The rest of the system would often be a little unstable after that though, so you only had a few moves left before a restart would be needed.To youths with curious mindsets, an anti-authoritarian streak, and seemingly limitless amounts of free time, little restrictions like these only improved our skills. Systems with challenging but imperfect security are a great way to foster new young talent."</p>

Tech isn&#39;t special in this regard.The thing that hasn&#39;t come about yet though is, sales, marketing, accounting can also be outsourced. Dare I say automated. It is at the end of the day, still waged work. Marketing is not an asset class. Accounting isn&#39;t capital ownership. Fabrication is a tool, tech is a tool, social media is a tool.The moment that this sort of stuff gets automated there will be a reckoning on how businesses are built in western society. I don&#39;t mean a saleforce competitor with a slicker UI, I mean completely abstracting away payroll and the like.Imagine for a moment:You could say to anyone, &#34;I like the work you do want to work for me?&#34; either in person, online, even here. They say yes. Now suddenly a pipeline process kicks off, like a CICD for recruitment. You have your budget metrics all in place, the receiver has their negotiation asks, etc. And AI hashes out a negotiation, in browser or on your phones etc. comes up with a negotiation contract, highlights the important bits or deal breakers that need a higher level sign off. &#34;Click &#39;Yes&#39; to work.&#34; Done. Hired. Here&#39;s your onboarding package and account credentials, your paycheck comes in at the end of the month.All the while, the two people at the table or on twitter have just been continuing on with their lives. Nobody talked to HR. Nobody had to manually do filings with the IRS. The business owner never opened a dashboard or logged in to their negotiation.ai account. It is not this easy at the moment. But no rule of physics says it can&#39;t be in the future.Entire classes of work could crumble while people could create in a much more competitive manner."</p>

Their new hardware is really exciting, the first ARM on the desktop, which doesn&#39;t just compete, but in many aspects beat current x86 chips. A lot of the Linux and tech enthusiast crowd would love to jump onto Apple Silicon. And while they might not bring huge profits by themselves, these are the people who do come up with great new technologies. Better give them a home on Apple devices. It doesn&#39;t need a complete and formal documentation of every aspect, just supporting those projects with a little bit of information would go a long way.

Apple has been locking that down with proprietary controllers and signed firmware since their Intel days (i.e. T1 chip).  Are people really going to drag around their shiny new macbooks with an external USB-C dongle hanging off of it because that&#39;s required in order to run Linux?I worry that the endgame here is Linux becoming Just Another MacOS App.  Apple is quite happy for Linux to be a MacOS app running in their VM.

It is also alleged that Google let their own exchange win, even when someone else bid more!Somewhere, in a parallel universe, people are going to jail and paying substantial fines for this behavior.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My $1200 7 year old Miele dishwasher stopped working a few months ago, with the “Intake/drain” light on red when starting a load. Dishwashers during the pandemic were sort of scare due to massive home remodeling demand, and the professional repair people would have cost $300 just to diagnose, so I went to try to fix it myself.It turns out the water intake valve solenoid was jammed or gummed up somehow, as applying 120V to it directly had no effect. I went to find an OE replacement online only to find that they are $580, sold by only 2 places, and sold out. You need to be a certified Miele technician to buy them.Given I knew the specifications from the model number and the printing on the solenoid itself wrt voltage and flow rate, I bought the cheapest replacement I could find on Amazon, spliced the wires into the existing harness and boom, it worked perfectly.One thing I didn’t understand was why there were so many different inlet valves that all did the same thing. There were 120V AC and 12V DC versions but other than that the only difference was the water connector/dongle/bracket. It seemed absurd there would be so many but the reality is that actual solenoid is super generic and should only cost $20 and should be made to fit them all. Of course nobody really repairs things these days but I think this is the reason why. Even when the part could easily be standardized and replaced/repaired like a light bulb, companies want you to buy a whole new one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Actual news about hacking! It is interesting that this is in the UK ... i&#39;m fairly sure most rents come with a full-sized dishwaster when furnished and all properties have the plumbing for one. I&#39;m not sure what the market is. Especially that one of the main value adds was &#34;no mess&#34; when our dishwashers all accept pre-form tablets for detergent.Anyway, I adore these kinds of blog posts. Tinkering, naughtiness and a big dollop of technical knowhow."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Loved the obsessiveness! FWIW the entire beer-brewing industry runs on NaOH for cleaning and sanitising. Disposing of it is not quite as environmentally-friendly as the dishwasher manufacturer seems to want you to believe -- in most places you&#39;d be in serious trouble if you poured any significant quantity down the drain.eta: I&#39;ve just looked up the constituents of the dishwasher tablets we&#39;ve been using, and yes, indeed, they&#39;re mostly NaOH, an inert carrier (Na2SO4) and a variety of water-softeners, packaging films to keep everything in tablet form (but soluble) and a small number of helper enzymes, perfumes and whiteners. Looks like a teaspoon of NaOH might work justabout as well. :D"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A common one is fake consent popups for system notifications.Websites need to ask for consent before sending system notifications via the Notifications API. If a user declines, that website is blocked from asking again (for obvious reasons)But many websites cheat this by showing a fake consent popup designed to mimic what the browser would show. If a user clicks &#34;Decline&#34; on the fake popup, the website won&#39;t show the real one to avoid being blocked. So the next time you visit the site, they&#39;ll be able to show you that popup again as many times as they want.If a user finally clicks &#34;Accept&#34; on the fake popup (out of frustration probably) then they&#39;ll show the real popup. To most people, seeing two popups might seem like a glitch, and will just mindlessly click &#34;Accept&#34; twice.The only way to circumvent this is to click &#34;Accept&#34; on the fake popup, and then click &#34;Decline&#34; on the real one. 99% of people aren&#39;t going to know how to do that....I&#39;d post this myself as a comment, but I don&#39;t like that it&#39;s asking for so much personal information (full name, email, state, city, phone, etc)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The &#34;hold-your-offline-device-hostage-until-you-attempt-to-connect&#34; pattern. It goes something like this:When setting up a new unlinked kindle device, Amazon tries to trick you into connecting to the internet by showing a wifi setup screen that cannot be skipped. The only way to skip it is to supply the device with bad credentials and let it attempt to connect and fail. Only when it fails will it allow its owner to skip that step.Microsoft has also started employing the same strategy in windows 10. Within the first year of setting up windows 10 locally, the user will be presented with a screen they can&#39;t dismiss until they link their local user account with an online microsoft account. Again, the workaround here is to let windows try to connect with bad credentials. Once it has failed to login, it will allow the user, a child who urgently needed to get to her online classes in my case, to skip this step.Words can&#39;t describe the contempt I have for companies who engage in these patterns."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I spent years working on the Ubuntu phone. It was a fully convergent device: by default it would present a phone UI, but plugin an a keyboard and screen and it presents a full desktop UI. The UI was designed by a team of brilliant professional designers and it was a technical success.Why isn&#39;t it around any more?(1) The carriers. Many people get a free or heavily subsidized phone from their carrier, who makes money from the data charges. Carriers were just not interested in phones from smaller manufacturers, and it&#39;s not entirely clear that there is no backflow of cash involved at higher levels. There is also the issue of controlling access to user metadata, always a profitable exercise.(2) The manufacturers: why would they put a third-party OS on their phone when they control the entire stack from the silicon to the end-user&#39;s metadata through their in-house Android fork? They can sell hardware at a negative margin if they can profit from selling access to metadata, or possibly data.(3) The apps. Developers want to target the biggest, most lucrative markets so they target Android and iPhone which already have a critical mass. You could provide a container to run Android apps on Ubuntu, but then you end up with no differentiating factor except your Android apps look like crap in desktop mode. Running in a container can also restrict the kind of data collection many apps rely on for monetization.Another problem with apps is that many web services check to see whether the device is iPhone or Android and respond accordingly. Like the browser checks of yore (&#34;you need at least IE 6 to use this site, try updating to a newer browser!&#34;) this gives a less satisfactory experience to end users."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t understand the desire for a Linux phone as so described in the article as a daily driver.The Android platform represents an enormous amount of work that encompasses a more secure base kernel, an unparalleled selection of applications designed for mobile usage and written in a memory-safe language, fantastic sandboxing and user privacy features leagues ahead of any desktop operating system, and great diversity in the hardware market.While it&#39;s apparent that Android has significant downsides - de facto proprietary drivers, an environment of mostly closed-source applications, some Big G integration, and a general lack of long-term updates occasionally countering the work put into security (thanks, chip manufacturers: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26593274), these are problems that can be solved. It doesn&#39;t make sense to throw the baby out with the bathwater.Closed-source applications are more a moral problem than a security one thanks to Android&#39;s sandboxing, and a vibrant ecosystem of high-quality free-and-open-source Android applications (https://f-droid.org - Amaze, Notally, QKSMS, and Tasks are some of my favorites) makes them all but optional. Google&#39;s presence in the AOSP codebase is rather limited (mostly around notifications) and taken out altogether by custom ROMs like Lineage and GrapheneOS. Proprietary drivers remain as Android&#39;s biggest problem, perhaps alongside the manufacturers that ship locked-down phones with bloatware (looking at you, Samsung).Why go the desktop-Linux-to-mobile route when you could fork Android, write drivers for the Pinephone / Librem 5, punch a hole to the base system for privileged applications, and have the best of both worlds with an order of magnitude less effort?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d be shocked if it took off. The FOSS development paradigm seems to be allergic to good UI design, and this is far more important for people on mobile than desktop."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I consider myself a very politically informed person. I&#39;m not a politically active person however, largely for the reasons mentioned in the article.I considered myself a liberal by the standards of the time I grew up in. My views on some social issues, particularly &#39;free speech&#39;, are considered a conservative now. I am one of the people the article is concerning who will not publicly voice their political opinions in the workplace for fear of potential repercussions. One thing that particularly upsets me, is how willingly other people bring up politically sensitive issues in the workplace. I regularly hear woefully uninformed diatribes on geopolitics and American domestic politics (I do not live in America) in the workplace. Even correcting people who are clearly misinformed on clear matters of fact can cause offense. As a result, I do not enter into such discussions.I feel as though I am more open-minded than many others. I am always ready to be corrected if I am wrong, and I am always willing to discuss my views with people subscribing to other political ideologies. However, I fear the repercussions of offending others who do not have an open mind. I also feel as though many politically active people are not acting in good faith. I feel that the safest option I will not regret is not to engage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Only nine percent of the British adults we surveyed described politics as “very important” to their sense of identity, and only 22 percent had shared any political content on their social channels in the previous year&gt; When it comes to speaking their minds at work, one of these tribes—home of the “Progressive Activist”—is not like the others.  “A powerful and vocal group for whom politics is at the core of their identity,” as More in Common describes them.i see this more and more. the loud few make a lot of noise, the majority just want to do their jobs. companies have to cater to everyone... but at some point there’s too much virtue signaling at work"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#39;For two-thirds of the population, talking politics sincerely, on the job, is uncomfortable. People who hold certain, commonplace views, stay silent believing that expressing those views will carry penalty not reward. &#39;This sounds like a recipe for disaster for any company. When I worked in the UK no part of my job description was about &#39;talking politics sincerely&#39; or sharing my &#39;commonplace views&#39;. I did that in the pub afterwards.&#39;Ethical Systems&#39; appear to be a great way to stir up rancor and division with the usual cocktail of racialisation (the new segregationists) and genderisation of everything. I can&#39;t see how this would help productivity or enhance people&#39;s work lives in any shape or form. It reminds me of the first frame of a Dilbert cartoon."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Notarization has been a nightmare of a solution to a problem that isn&#39;t effective. You can get practically as much security by pushing malware signatures to the client without the massive privacy overreach of having Apple archive each and every bit of code that you generate for distribution.This is just Apple&#39;s overreach extended to the desktop. Excessive control that makes developer&#39;s lives hell while adding barely any security on top."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wrote a little sh script to notarize HandBrake two (or maybe three) years ago, and that&#39;s was it. It&#39;s not rocket science. But like every new thing, it required a bit of time to read the documentation and to understand what&#39;s going on.The plugin issue described in the article is probably related to the hardened runtime, so it&#39;s unrelated to the actual notarisation process."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The initial setup is a bit of a pain (and the documentation is a bit lacking - though much better than most Apple documentation - particularly for edge cases like mine, distributing a screensaver), but to Apple&#39;s credit the process is pretty solid and is now consistently quick. I&#39;ve notarized dozens of builds of Aerial since the requirement was announced and I think only once did I have to wait to release because their service was stuck.Minor tip: Stapling, while optional, should be recommended (and might as well be mandatory) to everyone that notarize (you staple a certificate signed from Apple that avoids the call home when the user tries to open your software).The only thing that slightly irks me is the contract situation, if you have a &#34;paid&#34; developer account, you absolutely need to sign any update to the &#34;paid app&#34; contract from the App Store even when you want to notarize an &#34;out of store&#34;, open source app.Plus it breaks my script every time..."</p>

A student would probably expect that to launch an app, there is a system call that would do exactly that: you pass it the name of the application/executable file, and it launches. Instead, there is a small dance of duplicating itself and then re-writing one of the copies--try not to get tangled up in the legs while doing that!The fork+exec has many unobvious advantages over CreateProcess, but also disadvantages, and one of them is that it&#39;s, in my opinion, a completely unexpected approach: I can&#39;t think of any other system object that can only be created by first copying another already existing object and then overwriting the newly created one if needed. Files of any kind (folder/pipe/socket/etc)? Memory mappings? Signal handling? Process groups/sessions? Users/groups? The processes seem to be unique in this regard. How did people come up with this approach? That would be an interesting discussion, I think.Instead, it&#39;s just described as the completely self-justified, with description of &#34;zombies&#34; thrown in the end for boots: and the zombie processes are pretty much an accidental artifact of early UNIX design; if the fork was returning not only globally visible (and therefore unstable) PID but also an fd associated with the child process, neither wait/waitpid syscalls nor reaping duties of PID 1 would have been necessary."</p>
