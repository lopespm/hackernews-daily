I just burst into tears unexpectedly on hearing this news and I don&#39;t quite understand why I feel so very sad. I guess I have grown up and lived my whole life (as a Brit) seeing and hearing the Queen, singing &#34;God save the Queen&#34; etc, and this news made me suddenly feel very old, very nostalgic, with the sense that all things pass in time, which makes my heart ache deeply."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; From commoners to heads of state, the queen has been known to smooth over embarrassing situations with a gentle quip or two. According to Blaikie, at a Buckingham Palace Garden Party, a woman was chatting with the queen when her cell phone embarrassingly started ringing. “You’d better answer that,” the queen told her. “It might be someone important.”&gt; Then there was the notorious incident that occurred during Charles and Madame de Gaulle’s state visit to Buckingham Palace. “Somebody asked Madame de Gaulle what she was most looking forward to in her retirement, which was imminent,” Blaikie writes. “Not speaking English much at all, she replied, ‘A penis.’ Consternation reigned for some time but it was the queen herself who came to the rescue. ‘Ah, happiness,’ she said.”https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/08/behind-queen-elizab..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I gotta admit that it is a bit weird to see british royalty being so heavily privileged that they even get special moderation treatment here on HN to protect them (?) from any negativity, or rather stop negativity about them.I&#39;m not keen on the idea of using this submission to flame the Queen, I obviously agree with the general rule of avoiding flamebait, what I mean is that other HN submissions on the deaths of people certainly didn&#39;t get this special treatment. It is also not at all enforced in both directions when looking at the obviously and comically over the top positive comments of low quality which contain no real substance.Edit: I used the wording &#34;stop negativity&#34; which might be misleading, since (as far as I am aware) no comments are being deleted. What I&#39;m talking about is moderation giving out a lot of warnings and keeping a closer watch on &#34;flamebait&#34; violations than I&#39;ve ever seen before on any submission."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Co-founder here, thanks for posting!Let me add some context:Many people add &#34;Reddit&#34; to their search queries to find authentic product reviews. We fine-tuned a BERT model to extract product mentions from over 4 million Reddit comments and posts with Named Entity Recognition (NER). The result is a list of the most popular products across many subreddits.No platform (including Reddit) is resistant to fake reviews and spam, but we think it&#39;s happening less frequently here for various reasons:- Redditors and other forum members are more interested in boosting their ego by showing their depth of knowledge on the topic (and correcting others on the topic), whereas corporate websites are more interested in raking profit by displaying (potentially) dishonest information.- Enthusiasts in subreddits are pretty good at spotting dishonest or fake content, which results in immediate downvotes. The whole karma system helps with trustworthiness.- Most subs are moderated well and spam gets removed quite quicklyThat being said, good fake reviews are technically almost impossible to detect, even with sophisticated network analysis of the reviewer&#39;s profile.Looria is still in Beta and we&#39;re working on improving our classification, summarization, and sentiment analysis. Let me know what you think!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great, but the sentiment analysis is way off. Take these &#39;negative&#39; reviews for the Staples Hyken office chair:&gt; For months i was waiting for the Staples Hyken Mesh chair to drop to a good price. I pulled the trigger at 150ish, received it really fast, and set it up right away. I actually really love the chair, totally worth it. Perfect size for me and i can sit in in for 12+ hours just fine.&gt; I personally haven&#39;t found the thinks to be more comfortable than other chairs, I&#39;d rather go with a staples Hyken. Also, I see these go for much less. This looks like a V1. I sold one like that for $200 in Virginia.&gt; Hello all, I went on a deep plung into chairs over the weekend to find a good new chair (instead my junky racer/gaming chair that hurt my back and neck. I ended up finding the Staples Hyken and Staples Dexley. I went to store and tried them both out. I really liked the Hyken way more than the dexley....In the small number of negative reviews I&#39;ve looked at it seems like around half of them are categorised incorrectly."</p>

There wasn&#39;t a single Laptop which was not listed on Amazon. Case closed for me.However, I would really like to build this myself or have an open source alternative.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a great article but the best part is an off hand link to a book review of A Square Meal: A Culinary History of the Great Depression [1] which includes choice quotes like&gt; The writer George Jean Nathan claimed that before the 1920s, there existed only eight basic sandwich types: Swiss cheese, ham, sardine, liverwurst, egg, corned beef, roast beef, and tongue (yes). But by 1926, he “claimed that he had counted 946 different sandwich varieties stuffed with fillings such as watermelon and pimento, peanut butter, fried oyster, Bermuda onion and parsley, fruit salad, aspic of foie gras, spaghetti, red snapper roe, salmi of duck, bacon and fried egg, lettuce and tomato, spiced beef, chow-chow, pickled herring, asparagus tips, deep sea scallops, and so on ad infinitum.”I ordered it off Amazon right away only to immediately realize, to my horror, that the hardcover version I had chosen would not arrive until Saturday, a full fortnite after my aspic of foie gras, salmi of duck, and the $5 esp32-wroom dev kits that were part of the same order.What is this, the 1930s?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems to be a major epidemic nowadays. I suspect that mechanistic, meaningless, purely mimetic pursuit of success has some pretty negative consequences on society. I suspect it might explain why so many people are interested in engaging in politics (or company politics) and zero-sum value extraction schemes instead of just adding value... They&#39;re not interested in the process at all, only in the outcome; financial success and social approval from authority figures.Many people are spending most of their lives doing stuff that they don&#39;t want to do, so of course they tend to look for shortcuts instead of trying to do things the right way. They have no intrinsic pride in the work they do; it&#39;s all about status, money and power. As people have become more free in their personal lives, on the career-side, we&#39;ve never been so constrained."</p>

They (IIRC it was the CIA) got into all sorts of shenanigans, dosing people (including CIA officers) without their consent.

This was back in the 1950s- a time at which American had little or no conception of the concept of a &#34;psychedelic&#34; at all.Also, the Grateful Dead- whose parking lots were famous as large scale drug distribution sites- went from being counterculture to establishment in some ~25-30 years (the &#34;house band&#34; of the Clinton administration).We apparently live don&#39;t live in the strangest timeline, but it&#39;s definitely the trippiest one."</p>

DO NOT post negative reviews with your real name"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Though I didn&#39;t get banned, I had a similar experience with Airbnb recently.Booked a hotel. When we got there, it was abandoned! Host unresponsive. Clearly a scam. Reported it to Airbnb, and after some back and forth we got our money back (pretty quickly tbf). We naturally left a bad review, warning others.But then the host left us a bad review, despite never even meeting us or interacting with us in any way! We complained to Airbnb and of course, they &#34;saw nothing that violates their review policy&#34;... Diabolical.I am sure that that listing is probably still up."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is very similar to an Einstein quote:&#34;How strange is the lot of us mortals! Each of us is here for a brief sojourn; for what purpose he knows not, though he sometimes thinks he senses it. But without deeper reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people -- first of all for those upon whose smiles and well-being our own happiness is wholly dependent, and then for the many, unknown to us, to whose destinies we are bound by the ties of sympathy. A hundred times every day I remind myself that my inner and outer life are based on the labors of other men, living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same measure as I have received and am still receiving...I have never looked upon ease and happiness as ends in themselves -- this critical basis I call the ideal of a pigsty. The ideals that have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been Kindness, Beauty, and Truth. Without the sense of kinship with men of like mind, without the occupation with the objective world, the eternally unattainable in the field of art and scientific endeavors, life would have seemed empty to me. The trite objects of human efforts -- possessions, outward success, luxury -- have always seemed to me contemptible.My passionate sense of social justice and social responsibility has always contrasted oddly with my pronounced lack of need for direct contact with other human beings and human communities. I am truly a &#39;lone traveler&#39; and have never belonged to my country, my home, my friends, or even my immediate family, with my whole heart; in the face of all these ties, I have never lost a sense of distance and a need for solitude.&#34;-- Albert Einstein"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I approve (of both the release and the name).I see plenty of folks in here lamenting this release at all - in the hopes that the lack of it will push folks to Firefox.  It won&#39;t.  Those who care about this are already on Firefox, and frankly - Firefox isn&#39;t going to be the answer here (to be clear, this is opinion).I&#39;m also not thrilled at manifest v3, although for very different reasons than the adblocking limitations - I do lots of extension development, and I think the service worker approach taken is a bad mistake, forcing a distributed consensus model onto extensions without understanding the limitations that model imposes given how often extensions span multiple js contexts (across tabs/frames/content_scripts/windows/etc).Frankly - the environment is also still riddled with bugs... everything from docs that are wrong, to serious issues like a service worker not activating on simple, basic, required events (like chrome.action.onClicked, which is literally about as basic as it gets for extensions).Overall - my first impression of the manifest v3 upgrade was fairly neutral (it&#39;s not really solving any of my pain points, and it requires a lot of changes to support - but it seemed functional).  My opinion after porting several large extension projects to the space is... bad.  It&#39;s a bad set of changes as implemented in chromium right now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just so I understand correctly: This version removes *all* of the features that read or modify a user&#39;s data, so as to abide by the &#34;&#34;stated intent&#34;&#34; of MV3, rather than taking full advantage of all of the actual MV3 APIs? For example, this commit removes the &#34;scriplet injection&#34; and cosmetic filtering features, which AFAIK work perfectly fine on MV3?    if broad &#34;read/modify data&#34; permission is to be used, than there is not much point for an MV3 version over MV2, just use the MV2 version if you want to benefit all the features which can&#39;t be implemented without broad &#34;read/modify data&#34; permission.

Huh? But ... the &#34;read/modify data&#34; permission isn&#39;t getting removed by MV3? I don&#39;t understand how this follows. This is like saying &#34;Google implemented all of the same things we could do in MV2 in MV3, so we went ahead and removed all of the features anyway&#34;. I don&#39;t see any way to interpret this as anything except cutting off your own nose to spite the face of Google. It certainly doesn&#39;t seem to be a good faith attempt to reproduce the features of uBlock within the new technical framework of MV3."</p>

The actual process of porting anything is sometimes incredibly tedious (e.g. &#34;scour the entire source code for unaligned memory accesses, and manually rewrite all of them&#34;), but also gives a chance to do some very clever things (like, &#34;use the piezo speaker to beep out the address of a fault, because nothing else works on the device after a crash&#34;).What made me do it was 1) the satisfaction I got from seeing my work produce something which, at first glance, shouldn&#39;t exist (Quake... on an MP3 player?), all while 2) learning deeply about software close to the bare metal, which is fairly hard to do early in one&#39;s career. There&#39;s of course also the factor of having lots of free time - I did my port when I was still a student with not very many responsibilities, so I could afford to spend entire evenings and weekends poring through mountains of C code.

It worked great for me, as long as you design a good heuristic. I imagine it might have been complicated to design a good heuristic with an expanded move set. I see autochrome had to abandon A* and has an explanation of why, but that explanation shouldn&#39;t apply to difftastic I think."</p>

People who want taxes to be lower don&#39;t want the &#34;pain&#34; of taxes to be hidden. They want people to cringe every time they write a check for tens of thousands of their hard-earned dollars, not just have it magically spirited off to the government.Filling out taxes helps share some of the same pain.

Many people have an &#34;I need to report everything because I don&#39;t know what the IRS knows&#34; mindset.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I rely on Otter pretty heavily these days. 100% agree that recording and sending the transcript to meeting attendees without their knowledge is a really bad move from several angles.I work sales calls set up with Calendly and Otter joins them all. These are very technical so normally it&#39;s fantastic - EXCEPT if we start talking early or the prospect doesn&#39;t follow the invite and never joins the call, then they would get a transcript of my team&#39;s chatter. I learned to not allow Otter to join the call until everyone is in attendanceWhats more frustrating is that you can&#39;t disable this auto-email &#34;feature&#34; unless you are on a business plan of some sort. But I have a paid plan through the iPhone app and apparently can&#39;t convert it to a business plan associated with my company. So no good way to disable itI get the network effect of referral business but sharing private conversations without consent is not the way to achieve it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just deleted my account because of that, also they share conversations with everyone in the meeting by DEFAULT, it wasn&#39;t nice receiving a message from a co-worker telling me that he received an email with the transcription it generated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"THANK YOU for posting this. My partner uses Otter, and HIS Otter bot will join my work meetings that he is not even invited to. He&#39;s sent me some recordings within the app in the past and we share calendars, but it still doesn&#39;t explain why this would happen. We&#39;ve emailed Otter multiple times since July 2021 without any satisfactory response or investigation. You&#39;d think they would take this privacy issue more seriously. Truly absurd."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a newbie in nuclear fusion, this explanation is the most interesting part:&gt; Lee Margetts at the University of Manchester, UK, says that the physics of fusion reactors is becoming well understood, but that there are technical hurdles to overcome before a working power plant can be built. Part of that will be developing methods to withdraw heat from the reactor and use it to generate electrical current.&gt; “It’s not physics, it’s engineering,” he says. “If you just think about this from the point of view of a gas-fired or a coal-fired power station, if you didn’t have anything to take the heat away, then the people operating it would say ‘we have to switch it off because it gets too hot and it will melt the power station’, and that’s exactly the situation here.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was at school in Abingdon, Oxfordshire (UK) around 1988 my physics class (A level aged 17) was somewhat enlivened by a visit by a bunch of clever chaps from JET at the Culham labs from up the road.This was the first time I heard the &#34;nuclear fusion is 25 years away&#34; joke and it was told as such.  We were also shown a graph of how many orders of magnitude away from ignition (for want of the correct word) by date.  It had an initial steep decline but then turned right quite sharply and had annoying looking tendency to avoid the magic value.Now, once you have ignition, you have to sustain it and extract power from it.  That&#39;s quite tricky too!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting to see that South Korea has such strong nuclear research facilities. Taiwan lost a lot of nuclear researchers in the past decades. Some of it due to US lobby work and some of it due to stupid governmental policies in the recent past. Japan which is also quite strong in nuclear seems to be trying to sell part of their nuclear industry, a move which turned out disastrously for the french."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Two things...First, looking through their design guide (https://www.wikihouse.cc/guides/design), the only thing they mention is that space (32mm in walls, I guess, and 70mm under ceilings) is provided.Given that the plumbing, electrical, ventilation, appliances, etc. are the majority of the cost of a home, I find this a bit odd.  A typical American full bathroom costs something like $5k to $20k (and up... way up) depending on the quality.  A kitchen can cost multiple times more.  Sure, you can build them cheaper, but that&#39;s the rub... most people who are in the market to purchase a home don&#39;t want low-end bathrooms and kitchens.  Or windows.  Or lighting.  Or wall fixtures.  Or anything really.Second, IMO, the problem with affordable housing is not a construction cost problem.  We can build small, livable (for various definitions) homes for $50k (or less) today, ignoring land costs.  But the regulatory costs, the land costs, the market demands all make building such homes a non-profitable endeavor.   Why build 20 $50k homes on the land and make $200k profit when you can build 10 $500k homes and make $1mil in profit?The affordable housing crisis in the America do not have a technical solution, only a socio-political one.  And since nearly all the power related to zoning, building costs, etc are managed at the local and state level, that means engaging with local politics."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really like the concept of this, it&#39;s basically a step further on from SIPs (structural insulated panels) by having standard composable blocks. The things I think are particularly good:- Standardising on screw pile foundations. Standard concrete foundations are often be about 30% of the build cost, with the quantity of earth removed and cement used it&#39;s a massive part of the carbon footprint of a home. For a &#34;light weight&#34; timber construction, screw piles are the future.- Having services recesses and notches built into the panels, and there is no need to batten the internal walls for boarding. this will increase the speed of construction significantly.- Being an &#34;Open&#34; standard allows any timber frame or prefab construction company to adopt it.My one concern (I wouldn&#39;t go as far as criticism) is that the panels have a somewhat complex manufacturing process by having to be CNC machined. Realisticly they almost always will be, but I would have liked to see the panels designed to be constructed a little more simply - you will always have to make changes on site.I wander why they went with ply over OSB, they have similar structural properties but OSB can be cheeper."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is overly complicating the process. If you want an open source DIY method of building a home, just learn basic framing and construction. It&#39;s not hard, lots of people have built their own homes, you just need some common sense and a willingness to learn.If you want to go all in on modular, wood based, zero carbon housing then learn how to build a timber frame house. If you really want zero carbon you can use only hand tools and harvest your own trees.Wikihouse seems more for people who want to buy something off the shelf, pretty much a kit house. That&#39;s not a bad thing since it takes a lot of effort to build something as big as a house and lots of people don&#39;t want to do that. But I don&#39;t think this should be sold as a solution for DIYers since the existing methods already satisfy the listed requirements."</p>

It seems like SQLite will only use one index, even in cases where two indexes would better suit the query. Or, in cases where the query is fetching most of the table, it will use an index even though a full scan would actually be much faster.Don&#39;t get me wrong, SQLite is awesome, and it&#39;s quite possible to work around these behaviors.

In my experience, the # of data analysts / BI analysts / etc that write and have mastered SQL vastly exceeds the # of web developers (especially if we focus on developers actually writing SQL instead of using ORMs)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The EXPLAIN keyword is really awesome. It also allows you to quickly validate SQLite command text without actually executing it. We have found this to be useful for real-time validation of user inputs when working on SQL-based config tools.Note that EXPLAIN also seamlessly incorporates any application-defined functions, so you can validate everything is as expected.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Of course, the other plausible explanation is that (at least at the time) Weird Al didn&#39;t know the difference between RAM and hard drive space (especially likely, because he&#39;s talking about defragging a hard drive).  In fact, I&#39;d be surprised if that wasn&#39;t what he meant.  I will, however, leave room for him knowing the difference, but intentionally being absurd (it is Weird Al, after all).That problem (referring to things that are not conventional fast, volatile random access memory as RAM) seems to have only gotten worse in the last twenty years - exacerbated, I believe by the increased use of flash technology (SSDs, etc - which have, admittedly blurred the lines some).It also doesn&#39;t help that smart phone and tablet manufacturers/advertisers have long insisted on referring to the device&#39;s long-term storage (also flash tech) as &#34;memory&#34;.  I doubt that will ever stop bugging me, but I&#39;ve learned to live with it, albeit curmudgeonly.Whippersnappers! :-D"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting point that RAM has basically not moved up in consumer computers in 10+ years... wonder why.The article answers its own question by pointing out SSDs allow better swapping, bus is wider and RAM is more and more integrated into processor, etc.But I think this misses the point. Did these solutions make it uneconomic to increase RAM density, or did scaling challenges in RAM density lead to a bunch of other nearby things getting better to compensate?I&#39;d guess the problem is in scaling RAM density itself because performance is just not very good on 8gb macbooks, compared to 16gb. If &#34;unified memory&#34; was really that great, I&#39;d expect there to be largely no difference in perceived quality.Does anyone have expertise in RAM manufacturing challenge?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think a big piece that is ignored is how much normal compute/memory usage has been shifted to the Cloud.I no longer need to have local resources to do amazing things. I don&#39;t need an 10GB+ GPU in my phone to be able to hit some website and use AI to generate images. I have fast web/email search capabilities that don&#39;t require me to have a local index of all of it. I can spin up a remote compute cluster with as much RAM as I need if I want some heavy lifting done, and then throw it all away when I&#39;m finished.&#34;Back in the day&#34; we would try to build for all that we could perceive we would do in the next 5 years, and maybe upgrade memory half way through that cycle if things changed. We ran a lot of things locally, and would close apps if we needed to open something needy. I think also systems have gotten a lot better at sharing and doing memory swapping (see comments about SSD helping here). Back in the old days, if you ran out of memory, the app would just not open at all, or crash."</p>

If US healthcare spending were a country, it would have the third largest GDP in the world. Accidents of history and the massive federal beauracracy created the crazy monster of ICD/CPT codes that results in the very clumsy way of pricing healthcare services that results in this massive matrix of data.As pointed out elsewhere there is a tremendous amount of cost distribution that goes into the code matrix and this plays a large role in negotiations with health insurers as well. Ground is given in one set of procedures and lost in others.This is a big step in shining light into areas that need it to improve the system overall."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work in data at https://www.carrumhealth.com/, and I&#39;ve been parsing this data for weeks. The transparency prices allow us to meaningfully negotiate with providers, and make tangible, incremental progress toward cheaper health care. Providers and existing insurance carriers leverage information asymmetry to control the market otherwise.For context, we bundle the 100&#39;s of itemized costs into a single, static bill per surgery type. In doing so, we&#39;ve built a custom virtual-network with the most efficient surgeons. These surgeons are able to meet the volume and quality requirements to allow for lower margins. We&#39;re able to get negotiated rates that are 10-40% cheaper than traditional insurance contracts when we have data that we trust.Unfortunately, this data alone isn&#39;t enough to properly determine prices because organizations will spread costs across procedure and billing codes that often occur in aggregate groups. For example, in a joint replacement surgery, some organizations may dump the cost into the billing for the implant itself, while others may put it under the procedure code. You have to gather billing data en masse to see which charges occur together, then combine this pricing data to determine what costs will actually look like for someone experiencing a procedure.It&#39;s a nightmare!"</p>

Running into a hardware bug whilst your CPU is in space is not good.Still good SiFive have convinced NASA otherwise, they must have a pretty strong verification story behind the scenes."</p>

If it is not lab-made, then nature may do this again soon with another virus."</p>

If we know both are possible, that seems like enough knowledge to move forward with exploring possible mitigations for future.I realise there may be hard reasons why no mitigation is possible, but i just never encounter popular discussion of what to do next."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At a previous company I worked at, we had an issue with our software (Windows-based, written in a proprietary language) randomly crashing. After some debugging, we found that this happened whenever the user made some specific actions, but only if, in that session, the user had previously printed something or opened a file picker. The culprit was either a printer driver or a shell extension which, when loaded, changed the floating point control word to trap. That happened whenever the culprit DLL had been compiled by a specific compiler, which had the offending code in the startup routine it linked into every DLL it produced.Our solution was the inverse of the one presented in this article: instead of wrapping our routines to temporarily set the floating point control word to sane values, we wrapped the calls to either printing or the file picker, and reset the floating point control word to its previous (and sane) value after these calls."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Julia package ecosystem has a lot of safeguards against silent incorrect behavior like this. For example, if you try to add a package binary build which would use fast math flags, it will throw an error and tell you to repent:https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/BinaryBuilderBase.jl/blob/...In user codes you can do `@fastmath`, but it&#39;s at the semantic level so it will change `sin` to `sin_fast` but not recurse down into other people&#39;s functions, because at that point you&#39;re just asking for trouble. There&#39;s also calls to rename it `@unsafemath` in Julia, just to make it explicit. In summary, &#34;Fastmath&#34; is overused and many times people actually want other optimizations (automatic FMA), and people really need to stop throwing global changes around willy-nilly, and programming languages need to force people to avoid such global issues both semantically and within its package ecosystems norms."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem here is that enabling FTZ/DAZ flags involves modifying global (technically thread-local) state that is relatively expensive to do. Ideally, you&#39;d want to twiddle these flags only for code that wants to work in this mode, but given the relative expense of this operation, it&#39;s not entirely practicable to auto-add twiddling to every function call, and doing it manually is somewhat challenging because compilers tend to support accessing the floating-point status rather poorly. Also, FTZ/DAZ aren&#39;t IEEE 754, so there&#39;s no portable function for twiddling these bits as there is for other rounding mode or exception controls. I will note that icc&#39;s -fp-model=fast and MSVC&#39;s /fp:fast correctly do not link code with crtfastmath.As a side note, this kind of thing is why I think a good title for a fast-math would be &#34;Fast math, or how I learned to start worrying and hate floating point.&#34;"</p>

After glancing over the API I guess it&#39;s because FPEs are too high-level to implement FUSE properly, but I&#39;d be glad if you can share any details to satisfy my curiosity.[1] https://developer.apple.com/documentation/fileproviderEDIT: Errata, I assumed it was open-source, but it is not.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A4 is so ubiquitous around me (Europe) that, no matter its merits or not, it&#39;s really a major PITA when you get documents that are not A4.  They don&#39;t line up nicely with the A4 stuff.  They don&#39;t go gently in the A4 folders / sleeves / pockets / ring binders (files) / etc.Typical offenders in my case are medical bills printed on dot-matrix printers.I don&#39;t even know if there&#39;s perforated continuous stationery/form paper with tractor holes that, once you strip the holes, is A4 sized?  I guess it&#39;s really uncommon if it exists for I don&#39;t ever recall seeing any actually used.Now don&#39;t get me wrong: hearing the song of a dot-matrix printer makes me happy (brings back lots of memories as my first printer was a dot-matrix one) and it&#39;s nice that that tech is still in use here and there.  I just wish the dot-matrix printers in Europe would use A4 continuous paper (which may or may not even exist).And don&#39;t get me started on oversized continuous paper that is not perforated: this is the kind of stuff that can trigger obsessive-compulsive disorder!I guess all this rant to say that even in Europe, where A4 is ubiquitous, you still have places using other sizes than A3/A4/A5 etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article sadly misses the root of the An sizes. A0 has an area of 1m^2, setting its dimensions and defining the rest of the sizes. Quite genius!The B sizes start at B0 with a length on the short side of 1m, then follow the same pattern. The C sizes, often used for envelopes, are defined as the geometric mean between the equivalent A and B size.As a child of an architect, when I was a kid my dad would bring old A0 drawings home as paper we could draw and paint on the back of.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is great, because Unreal is a C++ project that&#39;s not so easy to just Rewrite In Rust.It&#39;s also nice it uses bevy&#39;s ECS. It&#39;s made to fit Rust&#39;s type system and borrow checking model, and is highly parallel. It&#39;s really awesome how easy it is to distribute work across cores with it, without risk of heisenbugs thanks to Rust&#39;s data-race-safety guarantees.I know game development sees traditional software best practices as not applicable to them, but then games struggle with showstopping bugs and single-core performance bottlenecks. I hope someone will bet that Rust, despite being stricter and seemingly slower to iterate with, can be a net benefit from lower defect rates. Rust users outside of game dev praise the &#34;if it compiles, it&#39;s usually correct&#34;, and that junior devs can be told not to write unsafe code, so they can&#39;t cause UB and memory corruption."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great, because Unreal is a C++ project that&#39;s not so easy to just Rewrite In Rust.True. Although rewriting Nanite in Rust would be useful. Nanite is a very clever data structure for meshes. It&#39;s brittle, and full of internal relative addresses within the data item, so it&#39;s very vulnerable to buffer overflows. If it becomes widely used outside of UE, it might become something that gets supported in GPU hardware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am always skeptical about these type of projects. Out of the box Unreal Engine supports C++ and Blueprint.The problem with C++ is the slow compile times, and if you make mistakes the engine crashes. In general you produce stuff slower by using  C++.Blueprint is a visual scripting tool, it compiles fast. But it stores code as a binary blob in source control. And I&#39;m personally not a fan of visual scripting, I would prefer scripting by just writing code.So generally I prototype in Blueprint and then rewrite in C++ later on. I would love an intermediate language that has fast compile times and saves as a source file instead of a binary blob.The problem is most of the projects that integrate with another language get abandoned after a while. MonoUE was abandoned, USharp was abandoned, now the newest attempt to integrate UE with C# UnrealCLR looks abandoned. SkookumScript doesn&#39;t support UE5. Haxe support for UE was abandoned.Do I really want to risk writing a ton of code in a language that might not support future engine versions? To be honest, I don&#39;t want to take that risk."</p>

With recent developments in AI, there is renewed discussion about cheating as the best AIs have no trouble beating anything from PLO to NLHE.It was only a matter of time before this started to spread offline, and just a few weeks ago, I heard a story from a friend of a friend who caught a player using a device similar to this during a private game he was hosting. It&#39;s only a matter of time before these sorts of devices continue to spread, and I&#39;m not sure how the world will respond.It would be a huge deal to cheat at events like the World Chess Tournament, but the consequences of getting caught will likely stop at complete disgrace.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I did fairly well in the test (I didn&#39;t remember that you couldn&#39;t shift into the sign bit), but it really helps highlight how stupid the C promotion rules are. In C as soon as I have to do arithmetics with anything but unsigned ints all sorts of alarm bells start going off and I end up casting and recasting everything to make sure it does what I think it does, coupled with heavy testing. Now add floats and doubles into the mix and all bets are off.Rust not having a default &#34;int&#34; type and forcing you to explicitly cast everything is such an improvement. Truly a poster child for &#34;less is more&#34;. Yeah it makes the code more verbose, but at least I don&#39;t have to worry about &#34;lmao you have a signed int overflow in there you absolute nincompoop, this is going to break with -O3 when GCC 16 releases 8 years from now, but only on ARM32 when compiled in Thumb mode!&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These examples do look scary. However, in my 16 years of experience of mostly writing In C, I have never found a single chance that I need to actually use the expressions that I got the answers wrong.Never mix unsigned and signed integer comparison unless you know exactly what you are doing.And never do arithmetic on boundaries definitions like INT_MAX, they are boundaries , why you need to compute a derived value on boundaries?If you do not need arithmetic behavior, do not use signed integer, use unsigned. Because computer does not understand sign, so if you do not need a sign, do not use it.You do not need to be a language committee member to write C , you just need to understand the reason behind its design."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Found a disappointing bug in the test:  (unsigned short)1 &gt; -1 

Correct answer is: implementation-defined.The left operand of &gt; has type unsigned short, before promotion. On C implementations for today&#39;s popular, mainstream machines, short is narrower than int; therefore, whether it is signed or unsigned it goes to int.In that common case, we are doing a 1 &gt; -1 comparison in the int type.However, unsigned short may be exactly as wide as int, in which case it cannot promote to int, because its values do not fit into that type. It promotes to unsigned int in that case.  Both sides will go to unsigned int{*}, and so we are comparing 1 &gt; UINT_MAX which is 0.Maybe the author should name this &#34;GCC integer quiz for 32 bit x86&#34;, and drop the harder choices like &#34;implementation-defined&#34;.---{*} It&#39;s more nuanced here. If we have a signed and unsigned integer operand of the same rank, it could go either way. If the unsigned type has a limited range so that all its vallues are representable in the signed type, then the unsigned type goes to signed. My remark represents only the predominant situation whereby signed and unsigned types of the same rank have overlapping ranges that don&#39;t fit into each other: the unsigned version of a type not only lacks negatives, but has extra positives."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m surprised no-one in the comments has mentioned MailInABox [0].On recommendations here, I switched to it 2 or 3 months ago from Gmail, after Google announced they were going to start charging for Gmail on custom domains.  I&#39;d no previous experience at all with running my own mailservers and had always been put off by how complicated it seemed.Even with a non supported configuration setup [running the mailserver for my domain on a separate VPS from the domain itself] MIAB setup was pretty easy. I had it installed and was up and running in no time. I then spent a couple of days setting up the various DMARC MTA-STS policies etc. [most of that time involved looking up what they were and why I needed them!] and [after testing with an unimportant account] migrating the rest of mine and my family&#39;s and friends&#39; emails across from Gmail. I was able to import half a dozen accounts from Gmail with about 8GB of emails between them, using ImapSync [1]So far [fingers crossed] it&#39;s been almost painless. Giving the lie to the commonly held belief that running your own mailservers needs constant hands-on maintenance. My MIAB setup runs quite happily on a $5/month Linode [I checked the IP was not on any blacklists, before I started] and the whole thing has been pretty much &#39;fire and forget&#39;. MIAB sends me weekly reports on what&#39;s been happening. Software updates are a one-liner in the terminal and I&#39;ve had no trouble whatsoever with Google, Microsoft etc. as regards the mail not getting through.If you&#39;ve always hankered after running your own mailserver but [as I did] thought it was too difficult and required too much &#39;hands on&#39; tinkering, I heartily recommend you give MIAB a go.DISCLAIMER: I run a couple of dozen email addresses on 3 or 4 domains on my MIAB. Probably sending and receiving a few hundred emails a week between them. YMMV if you&#39;re a heavier user than this.[0] https://mailinabox.email/[1] https://imapsync.lamiral.info/"</p>

The tactics were different, but the goal is effectively the same.The key differences are Kiwifarms is targeting individuals personally. And that they’re doing it kind of randomly, for the lulz. Whereas their main opponents here are targeting a company/community, and acting in self-defence.I know who I think is more worthy of protection."</p>

After learning about the situation from the last couple threads here and going down the rabbit hole of sources, the future of the internet seems pretty sad... If cloudflare doesn&#39;t reinstate the website after dealing with said immediate danger they claimed was the reason to remove its protection it just shows how hard you can shut someone down by just twitter outrage.If the threat really was so dire, and if there really was something of the sort sure i can see allowing the obvious DDOS in the background go thru and take the website down. But not reinstating it after the time they were claiming to buy by doing it was already bought it means if you scream loud enough on twitter, even while having an obvious army of arsonists behind you, the firefighters will just stop serving said target.Sure, cloudflare is a private company and all that, nobody questions it, but it doesn&#39;t make it any less unsettling."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting to see the comment thread digging into all sorts of criticism of the article (is it 2 kWh / fridge? Or 1.1? Should the author discuss renewable earlier or more seriously?)The main point I got from the article was a helpful reminder that a large part of the world doesn&#39;t have basic things that I take for granted (not just refrigeration, but you might also include air conditioning, transportation, etc). And that if we did want the entire world to live a life that includes things like that, we just don&#39;t have the energy right now.EDIT: I kept thinking about this and it doesn&#39;t stop at just basics. It&#39;s also things like living in a comfortable, well-manufactured home. Being able to buy toys for your kids. Taking airplanes to visit family or to vacation. Enjoying the consumption of meat, or food delicacies. The list goes on as you expand the threshold from basic necessities, to comfort, to luxuries, and you can decide where you want to draw the line."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not really.A lot of poverty is societal poverty (of order, collaboration, help, education, distribution, and so on) and is worse, even all other things (like relative cost of energy to average salary) being equal.You can be a slum-living destitute poor in a country even though you have financial access personally to several times the energy expenditure of someone in another country (or area of same country) with a different lifestyle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is exceptional. It may be reductive or even wrong but at least it&#39;s trying to quantify these issues and it uses actual data. Not only does this allow for analysis, it also makes it, in theory, falsifiable.If the article is right and all it takes is around a doubling of the current global energy, at 1.1% population growth and a global annual increase in energy usage of 2.5%, this gives around 50 years before we start producing enough energy to push poverty levels below 1%."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m on 12 years of self hosting email and counting. Once every so often, I do end up being blocked, usually by Outlook and once by Yahoo. I&#39;m in their &#39;sender program&#39; and they still don&#39;t actually bother to contact postmaster@, but a few emails is usually enough to unblock the block within 24h.Agree with a sibling comment that many major providers fail to operate the SPF/DKIM/DMARC tools they insist you do.Each to their own, but ultimately if we don&#39;t hold on to the freedom to operate our own mailservers, it will be taken away through inaction. This means doing some things right: DMARC, DKIM, SPF of course, server maintenance, good password policies and of course IP reputation. The best way I can recommend for IP reputation is to use a dedicated provider or VPS provider that disallows things like VPN endpoints, where it is less likely they&#39;ll assign an address with a poor reputation. A good provider might also ask you what you intend to host, and you might be able to discuss IP addresses with them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been hosting my mail for 20+ years now, with minor issues. I guess I&#39;ve been lucky.Reading the comments here makes me incredibly sad. Every answer that tells me to use a provider misses the point. The Internet was created so that there could be many independent nodes, not so that everybody has to rely on one of several blessed providers. I should be able to run my own E-mail.The real problem is lack of incentives. The big corps do not care about e-mail. It doesn&#39;t make money and isn&#39;t easily controllable. You can&#39;t turn it into a walled garden and lock users in. So, it gets minimal attention, and only defensive measures are developed.Either we solve the spam problem, or things will get worse. The big tech corps won&#39;t solve it for us."</p>

Should it be under the auspices of an existing group such as FreedomBox?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “Try different things” is the key, of course.32 year programmer here (started at 19).I cannot “amen” this sentiment enough. But probably not in the way most will read it.Most will interpret this at a macro level: Learn some Smalltalk! Now go learn Lisp! And then Clojure followed by Haskell, throw in some Java or C++ so you know what pain feels like! This is OK, it is good to be somewhat travelled in your journeys as a programmer.But I find that there is a micro application that gets overlooked. You can do a lot of “try new things” right in the stack you’re in without having to bust strange new worlds. Most languages end up with many ways to do things. You can and should take time to explore those. Learn the conventions/idioms, but then push/challenge those.I was afraid of C macros until I took time to really try some things with them. It didn’t mean I suddenly used them for everything, but overusing them for a bit helped me better make good choices about them.C pointers intimidated a peer until I forced him to forego index based for statements, using all pointer math instead.Smalltalk context objects were kind of “behind the scene” magic until I decided I’d like to figure out how to implement goto in Smalltalk. After that, they opened up for me.Python decorators are “magic” until you make a few of your own.The examples could go on and on.Try new things."</p>

Instead of being convenient, USB C has become a confusing ordeal of varying capabilities and quality control. It is like we&#39;ve gone back to having many different types of connectors, but it is even worse because they share the same form factor. For any of the devices that use USB C to charge, I only use the cable that came with it when I purchased it.While I complain, I would also like to mention the USB forum&#39;s insane naming strategy and non-obvious labeling system. Remember when USB 3 was easily identifiable because of the blue plastic in the port?"</p>

It seems so much strictly worse than the old world of having different cables with different connectors - yes you had to have a lot of different cables but you couldn’t get it wrong.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has been a big pain, for me.The only docks that have worked for me, have been the CalDigit TSX docks, which I have used for a long time.

I&#39;ll get it, eventually.I have the latest 14-inch MBP (M1Max).The biggest issues that I encounter are:1) External keyboard wake up/recognized.If I use a dock, the keyboard is often not recognized. I found that I need to plug directly into the Mac. Otherwise, it sometimes won&#39;t wake the computer, or the computer sometimes &#34;forgets&#34; the keyboard.2) Monitor Handling.I use a 49&#34; LG Ultrawide (5120 X 1440). I used to have it split into two monitors (3840 X 1440, 1680 X 1440), but now use it as a single, ultrwawide, after Apple started natively supporting that resolution.I found that many docks (even &#34;Thunderbolt&#34; ones) and adapters, refused to allow me to select the ultrawide size. Also, the monitor would often fail to be recognized, after the computer wakes, and I would have to reach under, and unplug/replug, to get it recognized. I have the monitor plugged directly into one of the TB ports, with a TB-to-DP cable, and it works great.From what I understand, the new CalDigit should fix these issues."</p>

And instead of having just 40 videos on rotation, you could have 10,000&#39;s...I don&#39;t have the time to build it, but it&#39;s a hobby project I wish desperately that somebody would![1] https://aerialscreensaver.github.io/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Originally made by Bob Nystrom [1] who now works on Dart, it is now maintained by ruby0x1 who is a game developer and most importantly creator of a game engine that uses Wren as a scripting language [2]. Unfortunately Luxe is still not publicly available (closed beta), which I admit is a bit of a frustration for me as I&#39;ve been following development for a few years, but it does show a lot of promise and in the meantime I&#39;ve become a happy user of Godot. I keep Wren in the back of my mind as an easy-to-embed scripting language in cases where you could integrate Lua (which Wren outspeeds) but not LuaJIT.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=munificent[2] https://luxeengine.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a neat little language. It was created by the author of [Crafting Interpreters][0]; the language in the book (Lox) is essentially a slimmed-down Wren for teaching.[0]:https://craftinginterpreters.com"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wren seems pretty elegant, but it makes the same mistake a lot of languages do when it comes to operator overloading.  If you put the binary operator as a method on the first object, then there isn&#39;t a simple way to have &#34;builtin_object &lt;operator&gt; your_object&#34;.For instance, Wren doesn&#39;t provide complex numbers, so you aren&#39;t going to get a nice syntax for &#34;1/z&#34; or similar.  I could make similar examples with scalar multiplication for vectors, matrices, or Numpy-style arrays, etc...Python and other languages have fallbacks to work around this, but Wren does not.  And really, I think of binary operators as 2 argument functions, not methods on the left object."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Buyer beware - my wife hates Amazon and goes out of her way to not purchase from them. She has encountered several vendors on Walmart marketplace that simply place orders with Amazon at 100% markup - the packages arrive in Amazon boxes w/ a receipt showing the actual cost paid at Amazon. Total rip-off.When ordering electronics from Walmart Marketplace, particularly TVs, I’ve found that the marketplace sellers freely substitute makes and models. Maybe nobody notices if you are shipping a gift to someone else, but since I need specific models from specific manufacturers for development it gets noticed when I order LG model XYZ and get a no-name tv instead. I stopped ordering from Walmart altogether after the second time (out of two, consecutive) that happened.So my advice is anything you buy online at Walmart, make sure it is not a marketplace seller, just save yourself the trouble.In all cases Wal-Mart refunded my money after waiting for a week for the vendor to respond, though I had to lug the stuff to the UPS store to return it. Amazon usually suggests I donate stuff rather then return it.I’ve not had any issues with the items sold by Wal-mart actual, those you can buy with confidence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazon let’s the same thing happen in their store: https://www.amazon.com/s?k=1+tb+flash+drive&amp;crid=1XK7KPUOQ4X...It’s horrible and they won’t do anything about it despite contacting them via help requests and Twitter.3 of the top 5 listings are total scams.And Amazon’s choice for 1TB flash drive is a scam: USB Flash Drive 1TB, Flash Memory Stick for PC/Laptop, Ultra Large Storage USB Drive, Portable Thumb Drives (Black) https://a.co/d/cTi7XqZ"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Flash drives with hacked firmware to pretend to be bigger capacity than they were (along with other evildoing, like counterfeits targeting people paying a premium to get Sandisk quality) were already rampant on eBay IIRC 15+ years ago.I was still seething over some of the storage ones when, a few years ago, I joined an anti-counterfeiting startup.  (Sadly, our successful MVP launch integrated into a high-end factory production line happened just as Covid was breaking out, which spooked our flagship customer, and impacted followthrough we needed, then we ran out of runway while pivoting.)As a consumer, I can imagine a lot of things that the marketplaces like Amazon.com and Walmart.com could do to improve trustworthiness.  I don&#39;t know whether those make business sense.  I&#39;d love to see consumers reward a marketplace that conspicuously kept out the scammers.Ideally, the solution would protect integrity of all brands, not only house brands."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s 2 different things going on here:- The optimal amount of fraud in society is 0- The optimal amount of fraud a business/industry should accept is non-zeroThe simple observation that the cost to prevent each marginal fraud attempt increases; the last 0.1% of fraud costs way too much to prevent compared to the first 99%. Obviously society would be better off if fraud didn&#39;t exist, but since it does the effort expended is only worth it up until when the marginal cost of prevention exceeds an acceptable threshold (when it starts to lose you money).The optimal amount of fraud is still 0, but the optimal amount of fraud prevention lies somewhere on the margin.This is why important transactions like banking have KYC checks, and buying a pair of sneakers don&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This whole article is one giant time sapping piece of click bait.The author makes the unexpected claim that businesses want a non zero amount of fraud. And so as a reader you are tempted to read on because you haven&#39;t heard this before. But essentially the argument is that fraud is needed as an unavoidable byproduct of allowing trust/credit in the system to facilitate transactions. However, if businesses could have the trust without the fraud of course they would. I wouldn&#39;t be so upset if the author had been more upfront about what this was about. I&#39;m sure there are plenty of people out there who are learning about the fraud and trust/credit relationship for the first time. Just don&#39;t try and spin this in a way that it isn&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like this starts with an agreeable premise. Some fraud is egregious, costly, and/or easy to detect. These low-hanging or high-impact cases are most worth pursuing. At some point you reach diminishing returns, where the amount of time / effort / capital you&#39;re putting in to eliminating fraud outstrips the losses from the fraud itself.I don&#39;t know that I agree with the ethical conclusion that the optimal amount of fraud is therefore non-zero. The leap from &#34;anti-fraud efforts are expensive&#34; to these sentences in the final paragraph was not, in my opinion, convincingly made here:&gt;We should, as a society, accept non-zero amounts of benefits fraud. We should accept non-zero amounts of cheating on taxes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"To be maybe controversial...I&#39;m still thinking about it, but I do wonder if diverse casting works in European fantasy stories. The problem I have is that it generally pulls me out of the experience/ makes it less immersive. I welcome diverse castings in modern shows (though we don&#39;t need every show to follow a template &#39;diverse&#39; casting). 
A common counter argument is, well you can suspend your disbelief and imagine a dragon, so why is a diverse community in a small village not ok? It just feels less immersive. Yes, I can go along with it - but I&#39;m not sure it works. It feels like the modern world superimposed in a fantasy setting. I&#39;d prefer to be sent to an alien world.It is problematic, as years of discrimination in the real world for women/ethnic minorities were wrong and we should encourage equality in the corporate world. However the entertainment industry I wonder should in some ways be exempt. Maybe. One area where there isnt a discussion on &#39;diversity&#39; is music and also novels. This is because there are tons of tons of novels and music bands to listen to. No one cares if a particular band is &#39;diverse&#39;. 
So I wonder if the only solution out of all of this, is to have more shows - yes, make diverse inclusive European fantasy shows, but also make traditional european fantasy shows too etc. What I think will happen is that in such a scenario most European fantasy fans will choose traditional like shows. Because the story is more immersive and you are brought more into this old world. Maybe. Like I say, I&#39;m still undecided. For modern/futuristic films I find diverse castings just as immersive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t get reviews saying that TRoP, or some other new prestige TV series, is &#34;terrible&#34;, or &#34;a disaster&#34;, based on the first couple of episodes.Some really excellent TV series have taken more than a whole 26-episode season before they find their rhythm and get properly good. ST:TNG is a classic example, but I&#39;m pretty sure you can come up with others. And some people are claiming that a new series totally worthless, not based on the first series, but based on the first episode? Are you kidding me?I mean, is it OK if the first episode of a series is unevenly paced, and contains too much exposition, and clunky &#34;tell, don&#39;t show&#34; dialogue about who the main characters are and what their deal is? No, no it isn&#39;t. We should ask that writers do better, and trust audiences to have the patience to learn who characters are through action over the course of a few episodes.But just because they don&#39;t do those things, is it really worth writing off the next 5 (or however many) seasons of a show, based on one episode? Who does that? What does anyone gain from that?OK, there&#39;s a lot of prestige serialised TV out there now, and you probably can&#39;t watch all of it even if you wanted to, so some culling is probably necessary at some stage. But does anyone really have to write something off quite so soon? You can&#39;t even give it half a season to try and get up to speed?I don&#39;t get it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Everyone here is so incredibly focused on money as the primary motivator, which I guess given the thread question makes some sense. But I&#39;d like to just put in a little word for money not being everything, and client type / work type actually being a really important part of the equation.HN is a forum where increasingly I see posts every single day about the high level of misery in tech / how can I get out of this rat race / high levels of stress / undervalued / etc etc.I charge £500 a day. It&#39;s not much compared to some of the rates on here, but I work with lovely, interesting clients in the non-profit sector. My clients love what they do and I do good work for them so they love what I do. I have long term, low stress, friendship-like relationships with my clients, not shouty / nasty / high stress ones. I&#39;ve done this work for 12 years, and had to work with maybe a handful of assholes during that time.FWIW I think there is a &#34;lower budget bar&#34; under which demands are insane for the money being offered, and we should all avoid this work unless we actively want to take a race to the bottom. But - I think there is undoubtedly a &#34;higher budget bar&#34; over which the stress level and expectation is made exceedingly high. This (I would imagine; I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ve worked in non profits my whole life) is probably also equated with sector - if you&#39;re in a FinTech environment I would imagine you&#39;re looking at high budgets but also an insane number of highly pressured assholes shouting at you all the time.What am I basically saying? I guess - yes, charge enough (and this is probably more than you think it should be) - but also, look at the bigger picture of your work / sector. Think about happiness, work-life balance, client motivations, etc - and use this to inform what you charge and how you charge for it. That&#39;d be my advice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Anybody who did PS1 dev back in the day will have had to do some crazy hacking stuff to get performance or memory.  The first project [1] I worked on I had a C version of my graphics engine and animation system, and in parallel I&#39;d have a MIPS assembly version which was super optimised (the C version was effectively a reference).I made the whole engine and animation system fit in 4K so it would fit into the instruction cache of the CPU.  The whole frame update cycle wouldn&#39;t need to touch main memory (for the code).Also, because loading from main memory was slow (4 cycles) and the chip was RISC (1 operation per cycle), you&#39;d need 3 NOPs after the Load-op for the register to be loaded. The C compiler (if I remember right) never really filled those 3 NOPs with useful stuff.  So, I&#39;d do hand written concurrency (in MIPS assembly) by loading other stuff I&#39;d need into those NOPs - this was particularly effective when working with 3 dimensional vectors or 4 dimensional matrices.Trying to keep super-optimised hand-written concurrency in assembly, in my head, was a challenge and not something I&#39;d recommend!  Still, the engine had more throughput than Sony claimed of their machine.  Every bit of performance gained would mean an edge over the other games.Then the game was canned by Eidos.

I understand if you want to make it not super racist, but with pornography, I&#39;m not sure it has a point... even more so given the fact that erotic art is very common in the real world and I&#39;m pretty sure this model (and others like it) can&#39;t distinguish between erotic art and pornography (which you can&#39;t blame it for given the legal standard seeming to be &#34;I recognize it when I see it&#34;), meaning it can only ever be used to produce SFW imagery scrubbed of any &#34;risque&#34; factors or themes, because the authors didn&#39;t want to deal with any kind of erotic art due to this impossibility of separating erotic art from pornography.If the point of all of these models is to get to something resembling an artist, then why intentionally kneecap it from the start and prevent it from producing art?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a reason we don&#39;t just &#34;let the builders build&#34;. We used to do that (certainly to a massively greater extent than we do now), and the result was that although a few of them managed to construct monuments we can all be proud of, most of them built a pile of crap and/or damaged the places they built in and the people they nominally built for. This is true of literal buildings, but it&#39;s also true of a great many other things that we &#34;build&#34;.The author of this delightfully titled but almost content-free piece seems not to consider Chesterton&#39;s Fence at all: before you criticize let alone dismantle regulation, you should be able to demonstrate a sound understanding of why it came to exist in the first place. For bonus points, a rigorous explanation of why the reasoning no longer applies in the current time period is helpful. TFA provided neither."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unspoken and underlying the author&#39;s entire worldview seems to be, &#34;the more new things, the better,&#34; a not uncommon tunnel view in the engineering world. The purpose of regulation, ideally, is to ensure that whatever activity/process is being regulated is worth the cost(s) for the majority of people. Defining those terms and making that decision is precisely the job of regulators, who are ideally accountable to a democratic base. In the worldview where all that matters is &#34;growth,&#34; people suffer. Running water is a huge quality of life win for EVERYONE. If you ask most people what would really help make their lives better, it&#39;s not gonna be colonizing mars, building tunnels under LA, whatever, it&#39;s gonna be access to resources we already have. Healthcare, clean water, clean air...perhaps we should think more about engineering as it can be applied to expanding access, and not so much to &#34;making new things,&#34; which most people don&#39;t need or care at all about."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The same Marc Andreesen who complained that there shouldn&#39;t be housing built near him because it would lower his property prices?How can someone who has read Why Nations Fail miss the point? We don&#39;t build for the same reasons that we didn&#39;t from the year -2000 to the Enlightenment. Because it&#39;s now better and easier in so many cases to just rent seek. Why bother constructing housing when you can just have other people&#39;s labour increase your land values? Why should I increase the supply of residency spots when constraining that supply increases my salary by $100k? Why bother with bold bets when you have net work effect monopolies? It&#39;s not talkers standing in the way of builders, it&#39;s leeches."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A better question might be: Why is the private sector responsible for providing accurate health information? As this article shows, the incentives for people running medical websites and the people reading them are not aligned. I&#39;d say the UK NHS website and symptoms/medications pages hit the nail on the head - https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/. It has no advertising and provides short, easily readable and actionable information on the majority of conditions and the correct way to use and take many different sorts of medication.And crucially - if the information present is not sufficient, clear and obvious UI elements that direct the next best steps to get the help you need, whether that be ringing the non emergency helpline or immediately going to A&amp;E. (It&#39;s been commented on before, but the new UK government sites are very consistently structured and open source their design systems https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The phenomenon they describe for health information is, IMHO, absolutely rife across many different domains. Try looking up information about gardening, plant management, home improvement, etc - you&#39;ll find the same thing. Search results dominated by sites that have mastered the art of producing SEO-optimised &#34;content&#34; that is not authoritative, full of waffle, and not especially helpful.For whatever reason, the business model of &#34;draw a huge amount of traffic&#34; outcompetes the business model of &#34;provide a really good source of information&#34;.It&#39;s interesting to ponder why in very specific domains, that&#39;s not the case: for instance, StackOverflow dominates in programming queries, and provides very useful content.Someone much smarter than me should write a really good blog post about this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You are trying to solve a real-world problem experienced by a lot of profitable companies, so there is already a market of paying customers waiting for this.  One of my clients is actively trying to reduce their dependence on Amazon and instead integrate with other marketplaces.I see it&#39;s just Shopify-to-Shopify for now - bravo for starting with probably one of the most costly integrations.  I&#39;m working with a client right now who had to build these integrations using a low-code drag-n-drop platform which allows a quick MVP but has slow job processing, so isn&#39;t great for high order volume.The &#34;amazon&#34; comparison is good for marketing - sure you&#39;re not doing all their marketing, or having their reach but you are connecting suppliers, buyers and fulfilment which is a genuine problem.The companies who would use this often have developers on board already, so providing open source, accepting contributions and turning this into a useful dev-friendly service will almost certainly find paying customers.Following :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few points I&#39;m skeptical of:  simply connect to the seller’s infra instead of locking them in.

One of the value-adds of Amazon is there&#39;s a whole bunch of tech sellers don&#39;t need to know how to write, run, and maintain. You&#39;d need to understand how big the niche &#34;technically literate to run their own e-commerce business, but selling on Amazon for other reasons&#34; is, then how your operation would answer those &#34;other reasons&#34; to make you competitive to the niche.  If, for some reason, the seller is removed from the marketplace, their software stays with them and they can continue accepting orders directly.

Apart from the software systems, there&#39;s a whole bunch of basic business processes that Amazon takes care of, which are less portable. Using FBA? Leaving means learning how to run a warehouse, shipping logistics, pricing, staffing, etc. Not using FBA? How&#39;s your Marketing department doing? Hopefully you didn&#39;t let it get too anemic or too fitted to &#34;people who are good at gaming Amazon&#39;s algorithm.&#34;In short, if your value add is: &#34;Amazon, but you get to take the tech home with you if you leave the platform,&#34; then that feels like a small niche of highly competent businesses, then you&#39;re stuck with &#34;well if they could do all this on their own anyway, why are they choosing Amazon?&#34;Hope that helps and wasn&#39;t just me blabbering. Good luck!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Love open source projects in the eCommerce domain, especially ones that are JavaScript instead of PHP! Two pieces of feedback:- Using a copyleft license like AGPL makes this an automatic non-starter for most businesses, no matter how impressive your tech might be. You&#39;ll have a lot more luck with mid-size and enterprise adoption with an MIT license.- You&#39;ve really built an Order Management System for marketplace use cases, which is in industry typically a distinct domain from a Warehouse Management System (WMS) or a Transportation Management System (TMS) which at large-scale tend to handle how orders actually get fulfilled and shipped to customers. Your naming is a bit misleading - at the very least I&#39;d emphasize somewhere on your landing page that this is an open source Order Management System if you want eCommerce domain folks to grok quickly what you&#39;ve built and how it plugs into a broader architecture."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s always great to see different ways folks are using Firecracker. Snapshot-and-restore is a particularly cool capability, especially if you solve the data movement problems (like these folks have).One challenge to clone-and-restore that they don&#39;t talk about here is making sure that clones don&#39;t behave too similarly (like returning the same cryptographic random numbers). We wrote a paper about that a while back (https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12892), and the Linux kernel community has been doing some great work in that area recently too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Beware that such techniques slow down memory access for the newly running VM quite substantially.For example, a simple memset() call across a few gigabytes of RAM inside the VM might slow down a factor of 1000x after a VM clone like this.Both &#39;parent&#39; and &#39;child&#39; VM&#39;s see the slowdowns.Some types of garbage collector also see really substantial slowdowns.It was a deal-breaker for my project where I did similar sorts of things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not to diminish this work, but I think it&#39;s worth noting that it&#39;s increasingly possibly to launch new VMs extremely quickly too.  FreeBSD/Firecracker can reach userland in 33 ms, and the OSv unikernel boots in under 10 ms.I think increasingly we&#39;ll see Firecracker used with EC2-like setups of &#34;create a disk image with everything preinstalled and then boot it&#34; rather than using snapshots of running (suspended) VMs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Both Kagi and Orion are deeply impressive products. Even though I try every new general purpose web browser and search engine that comes out, this combo is the only one that stuck.Orion: Finally a non-chrome based web browser that can compete with the likes of Brave and Arc. It works much better on Mac than the alternatives, with the same engine as Safari it also benefits from deeper system integration such as native Sign-in with Apple and password management. Also, like Brave, comes with powerful ad and tracker blocker so you don&#39;t need a separate extension. I also love its built-in tree-style tabs implementation.Kagi: It is Google without all the bad parts. It is user centric like some other alternatives, without the poor index and search results.Props to the team, I am looking forward to what&#39;s to come. It is mind blowing how a single small company can make one of the best desktop browser AND search engine AND mobile browser on the market. Hope they are not spreading themselves too thin and can fund the development of all these for a long time!My only complaints are the slow performance of Orion on iOS, and its poor handling of app urls. Latter caused some issues when I had Orion set as the default browser on my iPhone and some payment flow that used app redirects between my banking app and the store app got stuck. I was lucky and I could manually launch the app by pasting the app link in Safari, but I hope it can handle these cases as well as Mobile Safari in the future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I joined the Kagi beta two weeks before it ended and have been a paying user ever since. I find the price to be quite steep but so far it have no regrets and will most likely continue my subscription. I average over 2000 queries per month.- Search result quality is at least equal to Google for most queries and far superior for queries involving discussions or technical topics. Sadly, it is inferior for queries in my area of expertise (Swiss law).- Kagi is the only alternative to Google that I know of (and I have tried many) which is able to produce good regional results and mix them - when appropriate - with international results. Most privacy focused search engines are very US centric.- Blog spam and copy cats are not completely gone but the situation is at least bearable, especially after continuosly filtering them and boosting credible sites instead.- Customization options, filtering options, speed and site layout are also far superior when compared to Google.Apart from the lower quality results from queries involving my area of expertise, the only thing that still keeps me using Google Search are the reviews from Google Maps.All in all, I recommend supporting this product."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t stress how much better Kagi is than Google, I&#39;m a paying user. No more scrolling through tons of ads. Filtering by time and language is great, no more GitHub and Stackoverflow clones in the result. 
Thank you, I actually haven&#39;t realized how small Kagi still is, given how polished that product already is."</p>

I’m here questioning my life, and reduced to worthlessness."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These styles of multi-round interviews inspired by the FAANG collective started picking up in Australia before the pandemic, but it got to a point where most of my more talented colleagues and I all agreed it just wasn’t worth the time for the salaries being offered. 4 round interviews for a ‘senior’ developer position on $120k?When interviewing my own candidates, I use a 1 hour interview mostly focused on approach and personality. We have a probation period to work out if they’ve over-promised, and most of our tech industry is big banks that won’t notice if they waste a few weeks salary trying someone out. Honestly, for the salaries the local market provides, I think 1 interview is fair. Any more and I think we’re wasting peoples time for nothing.Personally, I’ve dropped out of application processes when they’ve indicated there are multiple rounds, and my salary hasn’t suffered for it relative to my friends who put up with them, so I feel like I’m ahead."</p>

But we&#39;re not going to move forward with you! Good luck!!!&#34;) and on my side while pretending I was excited when in fact I was worried about money and the gap on my resume.I dread the next one."</p>

Sure. But like I said, the Meetup docs are pretty clear what happens when you follow their instructions.It&#39;s hard not to read OP as &#34;we took an action without doing due diligence to fully understand the consequences of doing so.&#34; The point at which you make an assumption like this is the point at which you bear equal responsibility for unfavorable outcomes.Edit—the UI is actually very clear about this, and has been for at least the last couple of years: &#34;Your members will be given the chance to become the organizer and keep the group running without you.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has been an issue with Meetup for as long as I remember. The problem is there are two distinct scenarios.One is that the organizer has lost interest or is stepping down for some reason. Allowing the community to continue on Meetup in that case makes sense, by having someone step up to continue paying Meetup.The other is that the community as a whole has decided to move to a new platform. In this case keeping the now defunct community around and making it seem viable is bad. The current active members will know where to go, but new potential members or former members that want to re-engage are going to get confused.I got burned by this a couple of times, finding a group on meetup only to discover that it’s a ghost group, to the point where I’m now suspicious of any meetup group I find that hasn’t had an active event in the last couple of months.This is where I think Meetup is shooting themselves in the foot by not having a way to dissolve a group if the group as a whole decides to move."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This really sucks to hear. What’s unclear to me is whether Twitter is being negligent or abnormal here or whether this is just shitty world politics unfolding partly on Twitter. Twitter is being used by both sides to fight over a narrative. Nothing new in that respect.The author doesn&#39;t really propose a solution other than Twitter essentially siding with him and take (what appears to me to be) a political stance. Of course moderating political topics isn’t outside Twitter’s wheelhouse, but this is what you get as a society when you let arbitrary entities arbitrate speech: ambiguity and unclear expectations.On the one hand, it’s reasonable for the author to expect that Twitter removes clear misinformation from their platform since that’s what they purportedly claim to do. On the other hand doing so would go against a national narrative and piss off lots of Pakistanis. Uh oh.Maybe Twitter was never about being arbiters of facts and instead just pandering to the popular political narrative of the time? Or maybe they are objective and they’re just trying their best and we’re all human and we’ll do better next time? Regardless, this is the reason people get so frustrated with censorship: it cannot be applied objectively and fairly in every case.Twitter and social commentary aside: sounds like the author needs political asylum or at least real protection. Twitter is not the right entity to depend on to handle this situation, I fear."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am sorry for the responses I am seeing on HN. People with cushy lives who&#39;ve likely never faced similar danger seem to just not really get it.I will say that your framing is one that most Westerners will have trouble taking seriously.It might go over better to document known cases where this pattern occurred and show the similarities.  Walk people through it like they are five, so to speak.I know it&#39;s hard to do that kind of objective writing when you are feeling so threatened due to genuine threats, but in my experience that approach works better.I know you didn&#39;t ask for advice. I apologize for my bad habit of trying to be helpful in the only way I know how.I hope something improves soon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Twitter, despite millions of Pakistani users, it seems has no moderation system that understands local dynamics.Many would argue they don&#39;t even understand the local dynamics of the U.S. It&#39;s impossible for twitter to be an arbiter of the truth around the world, and you shouldn&#39;t expect them to be. However, I understand that&#39;s cold comfort for someone facing the threat of torture, death, or exile from their home, and I think your decision to call out twitter using your own platform to act with respect to your specific circumstances is the right thing to do and really the only way to handle this kind of thing.Good luck, I hope you stay safe and that the government doesn&#39;t succeed in silencing you."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My favorite Stephenson&#39;s novel is Anathem with superb world building (as usual) but also a pretty good story and ending.But it&#39;s also a book whose world (specifically the avout society) attracts me. I&#39;ve grown up in a Catholic setting, but &#34;converted&#34; to atheism/agnosticism pretty early. But even with its many failings, there are certain aspects of religions which seem worth preserving - the focus on community, the rituals, a particular rule framework, meditation (prayers) and introspection.The book presents a (on a certain level) pretty attractive model of society which combines the practical religious patterns with a full rationalism.I kind of understand why such &#34;atheist religion&#34; is unlikely to get off in the real world, but it&#39;s still something I would wish for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree, I don&#39;t think diamond age gets enough interest. It&#39;s one of my favorite books and the ending is unsatisfying but at least upbeat. Seveneves is also tons of fun. And if you know anyone who likes history, his older Baroque Cycle is pretty greatI haven&#39;t heard this in an interview or anything but I think now Stephenson is older and successful enough, he just writes the books exactly how he likes. Diamond age feels like he was agonizing over every word to keep everything so short. But Fall, and his newest book Termination Shock (which I also didn&#39;t like most of) ,just feels like an author who likes writing. Both have these amazing moments, which reminds me like a jazz musician, where it&#39;s almost effortlessly insightful and funny. But with no editing or second thoughts"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Much as I love Neal Stephenson&#39;s novels, I really wish he&#39;d stayed around at the writer&#39;s class he surely took until they had learned how to wrap up books and write endings; more often than not, I turn the page on a Stephenson novel only to find it was the last...(While I exaggerate a little, his stories do not end as much as END - I would be thrilled if he could spend a few pages wrapping it up in the end before leaving us waiting for the next title...)The yarns he constructs are definitely entertaining enough for me to cope with this very minor annoyance, though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Funny story: my first task when I joined the original iPhone team was to merge our forked WebKit with master. It was a sort of hazing ritual slash &#34;when else would we do it but when someone new joins?&#34;. Anyways, we used a tool called SVK[1] in order to get very primitive &#34;git-like&#34; abilities. It was basically a bunch of scripts that used SVN under the hood. For example, in order to get the &#34;local everything&#34;-style behaviors of git, the very first thing it did was checkout every single version of the repository in question. For WebKit, this meant that the first day was spent leaving the computer alone and letting it download for hours. I made the mistake of having a space somewhere in the path of the target folder, which broke something or other, so I ended up having to do it all over again.Anyways, I distinctly remember one of the instructions for merging WebKit in our internal wiki being something like &#34;now type `svk merge`, but hit ctrl-c immediately after! You don&#39;t want to use the built-in merge, it&#39;ll break everything, but this is the only way to get a magic number that you can find stored in [some file] after the merge has started. If it&#39;s not there, try `svk merge` again and let it go a little longer than last time.&#34; A few hires later (I think possibly a year after) someone set up a git mirror internally to avoid having to do this craziness, which if I remember correctly, was treated with some skepticism. This was 2007, so why would we try some new-fangled git thing when we had svk?1. https://wiki.c2.com/?SvkVersionControl"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is not even the most famous case of such practice in China, which goes to He Zhili [1].[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_ZhiliThe gist is that she was ordered to lose in one World Table Tennis Championships, but refused and proceeded to be the champion.Later she wasn&#39;t selected for the next Olympic, which she felt was the punishment for her disobedience. She later immigrated to Japan and played for their national team and gave China some trouble for a while.There is also this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton_at_the_2012_Summer_O...The funny thing is, they do that in table tennis (actually also badminton in some other cases other than the one in the article) not even just to secure the gold medal: since China is/was so dominant in this sport, they sometimes do it to ensure certain player can get his/her &#34;grand slam&#34; [2] (to win all the major tournaments in their career).[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis#Notable_players"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FWIW, Ye&#39;s story has been reported on Chinese media since at least 2007: https://web.archive.org/web/20170309082422/http://sports.soh.... Unfortunately Google Translate doesn&#39;t seem to work on wayback machine, but you can copy paste the text.Funnily enough, at least in this particular report, it is her coach who told the story. Really shows how this behavior was normalized enough for it not to be considered too shameful to admit.The reason Ye and her husband are persona non grata is unrelated to the Olympic incident, but because her husband is involved in the &#34;New Federal State of China&#34; (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Federal_State_of_China). Supposedly this is what the &#34;fierce criticism&#34; the article is referring to."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Iranian athletes have been dealing with this nightmare: if in an international competition they face a competitor from Israel, they will be told that they have to avoid competing.This is part of Iran&#39;s Islamic government&#39;s symbolic gesture to show that they do not recognize a country by that name, and so their representatives do not compete against them.This has caused a huge amount of damage on these athletes&#39; professional lives. Imagine an Olympic competition, you might be in the right shape to compete in the Olympic only once, and you miss that not by your chance.No officials in Iran take the responsibility of this decision, no one knows what institute forces athletes to abandon their competition, but this continues.Many of top athletes migrate to other countries (usually just stay in the country they are for the competition as refugees, and do not come back with the team, then they move to another country) for a chance to compete free from this restriction."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While I agree completely with the premise of this article, on the other hand I&#39;m weighing the relatively robust findings by Meehl et al. They find, time and time again, in all sorts of fields, that extremely parsimonious models like equal-weighted linear regression of one or two predictors outperform expert judgment[1].One would think this is cognitively dissonant enough, but it gets worse:This article, with the thesis that good arguments are more important than data, is based on, well, a good argument – not much data. On the other hand, the work by Meehl et al. claiming pretty much the opposite, is based on, well, a lot of data, and maybe not much intuitive reasoning. (There&#39;s some, yes, but the main thrust of why I believe it is that variants of the experiment have been replicated reliably.)I don&#39;t know what to believe. Fortunately, as I&#39;ve grown older, I&#39;ve become more comfortable with holding completely dissonant opinions in my head at the same time.----Edit a few minutes later: This actually prompted me to refresh on the subject. It might be the case that Meehl is actually making the same argument as this article, only it gets distorted when repeated. Some things are reliably measurable; for those things be data-driven. Other things not so much, then use your expertise.----[1]: Here&#39;s just one relatively early example: http://apsychoserver.psych.arizona.edu/JJBAReprints/PSYC621/..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have experienced this first hand, so this article resonates a lot with me.I worked with a manager who prioritized work which was easily measurable, so he could report the good numbers to leadership and get career points out of this. Unfortunately the project we took on was a demanding and technically challenging problem, and in almost a year of work of a team of engineers we made barely any real progress or made any actual difference, but the numbers were great and people were satisfied during presentations. I ended up feeling completely disconnected from my job and losing all motivation to work there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yes, the situation is dire. I live in Lisbon as a foreigner for more than 12 years now. We pay a rent for a small flat that used to be very expensive and now is on the cheap side in our quarter of the city. Luckily, we have an older contract that cannot be changed as easily as newer ones. I&#39;m not thrilled by the possibility that our landlord might cancel it some day, however, e.g. for relatives to move in. Rents in the city have skyrocketed, we&#39;d have a hard time finding anything, even though we both work full-time and have salaries above average. It&#39;s crazy because all new homes and apartments are &#34;luxury apartments&#34; with insanely high pricing both for buying and renting. They&#39;re mostly empty or are (often illegally) rented out as holiday apartments. It&#39;s incomprehensible to me how ordinary Portuguese families survive in Lisbon. I guess most of them have inherited property.Quite honestly, apart from the generally increasing  gap between rich and the poor, one big problem in societies nowadays is that you can simply get richer and richer just from owning property. For example, if you own three ordinary apartments in Lisbon, you can live in one of them and easily make a good living by renting out the other two as holiday apartments. Because cleaning services, guys who do repairs, etc., are cheap in Portugal, this involves almost no work. Moreover, the net worth of your property will continually increase while you do (almost) nothing. I&#39;m not saying I blame these people, I would do the same if I had the opportunity, but this is a huge structural problem in my opinion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This sounds like what happened in the SFbay area(south bay/pennisula), I grew up there and it used to be a great place to live, center left politics, lots of families and a diverse set of industries with many middle class opportunities. right around 10-15 years ago things started to change dramatically for the worse, housing and costs everywhere skyrocketed, homeless population exploded, politics veered hard left. Most of my friends from high school(90%) were forced to leave due to rents going from $1k a month to $3k a month for a 1-2 bdrm apts. Those that owned houses also moved as they were fed up with crime and could get a way better house somewhere else. Middle class jobs all disappeared from the area, families also left, the neighborhoods I lived in San Jose (rose garden/willow glen) had barely any kids for my daughter to play with as there were no families anymore, the rose garden neighborhood had 0 kids on the street, the willow glen neighborhood had 1 family w/ kids who moved away during the pandemic.I was lucky and making really good money in tech but was devastated by how the area I grew up in had turned into a nightmare and everyone I know (even family) leaving the area. I too ended leaving as the cost vs. quality of life didn&#39;t make any sense and I couldn&#39;t see my family living in a place I didn&#39;t even recognize anymore. Most people don&#39;t talk about it but there is a huge diaspora of bay area residents due to the stuff mentioned above and it breaks my heart to think we will most likely never return and familiy/friends I expected to spend the rest of my life with all leaving."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very difficult to change because, in the &#34;Pax Neoliberalia&#34; world we live in, profits are Sacrosanct - and the higher the capital concentration, the holier so.
But some straightforward fixes:1. Flood the market with affordable state housing, Austria-style - with the bonus of building new, boosting the national economy.2. Create very progressive (rapidly rising) taxes based on property value - making untenable the current practice of parking money and profit by simply buying &amp; holding empty flats and the like.3. Raise salaries - currently portuguese salaries, and their weight on GDP, rank the lowest in the EU.(and no, it won&#39;t create an inflation spiral:
the current inflation spike is, first and foremost, the result of a supply shock, price-gouging and speculative/cartel practices - corporate profits being at a record high is proof of that)Unfortunately, incentives are heavily stacked on leaving things as they are, as the ruling class is mostly made up of the landlord class, and, is not sensitive to (sometimes even not aware of) the struggles of assetless commoners that only earn income from their (low) salaried labor. Or, even worse, stands to lose their current large gains on capital/assets if this is fixed - and most portuguese media outlets trumpet their - private - master&#39;s voice and interests.
Additionally, just leaving things as they are, also scores brownie points with the EU by making the Government (even if &#34;center-left&#34;) appear &#34;frugal&#34;. And PM Costa has personal ambitions for future EU high office.(...who will be the next head of the European Commission or the European Council?)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the goals of any code base of significant size should be to reduce the cognitive load (not lines of code per function).Assume the developer working here just had a 45 mins sync, has a meaningless repeat meeting about vapourware in 10 mins and a 2 hours town hall meeting after lunch... and still have to deliver that mess of a requirement you made him promise to deliver before any of these interruptions were even on his calendar!- Always aim for declarative programming (abstract out the how it does it),- limit the depth of the function calls (rabbit hole developers...),- separate business logic from framework internals and- choose composition over inheritance.- Also avoid traits and mixins (run from the dark magic)- don&#39;t over document the language or framework, only the eyebrow raising lines, the performance sensitive stuff and the context surrounding the file if it isn&#39;t obvious.- name stuff to be easily grepableEasy rules to go by, (there are probably more), they can make or break your ability to work, so that you can get interrupted 12 times an hour and still commit work.I don&#39;t find these in books, just decades of sweating and pulling my hair &#34;why does it have to be so hard!?&#34; I have met plenty of senior devs who naturally do the same thing now.The code size fallacy is a prime example of the wrong way to look at it. Plenty of extremely large code base in C++ are far more manageable than small JavaScript apps.Mixing boilerplate framework junk with your intellectual property algorithms &#34;what makes your software yours&#34; is a sure way to hinder productivity in the long term.You write code 3-4 times. You read it 365 times a year.One last thing I recommend if you deal with a lot of interruptions and maybe multiple products, various code bases... keep a    // @next reintegrate with X

The @next comment &#39;marker&#39; is a great way to mark exactly which line of which file you were at before you left this project, for a meeting, for lunch, for the day, etc.  And it allows you jump back into context by searching for @next and go. Also since it&#39;s visual and located, your brain has a much better time remembering the context, since we&#39;re good with places and visual landmarks.It&#39;s far more efficient than roughly remembering what I was doing, looking at the last commit, scrolling endlessly through open files. Don&#39;t commit @next though :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Multiple levels of abstraction kills me, at least without adequate documentation. Conceptually, it&#39;s veey easy to grasp, but in code it becomes a mess making jumps through multiple unfamiliar files in a large code base. Essentially, you end up having to hold all the pertinent information on that code in your head, which largely defeats some of the purposes of breaking them into multiple files."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve often thought of this as &#34;developer empathy&#34; when I was working at Amazon. Generally regarding people who create APIs for other developers to use. The idea being that you can make your API simple or complex, and most developers tend to make their API complex, because they think their system is really powerful and cool and want to expose all the power to end users. But, you need to remember that your users aren&#39;t just using your API. They are using maybe 100 other ones as well. And there is no way for a person to learn the ins and outs of all 101 complex APIs. Add to this the fact that the more complexity you expose, the more unintentionally coupled your API becomes to your implementation (generally). So, make your APIs simple, and provide backdoors if you really want to expose complexity.I will say, this did not get me promoted at Amazon."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve worked at multiple startups sub 50 to &gt;1000 (unicorn status) and have founded and sold my own company. I&#39;ve also worked at a few of the FAANGs. This is common advice, especially among VCs since it&#39;s one of the key benefits used to pitch prospective employees on giving up that fat FAANG salary, but in my personal experience, it&#39;s not so cut and dry.Working in a startup will brand you as a startup person and help you meet VCs which may make it easier to raise. It&#39;ll also show you the problems that that particular startup faces and give you n=1 degree of pattern matching. On the flip side, something like YC can give you the same benefit or just shipping a for-profit side project on the side. Additionally, given how poorly run most startups are today, I&#39;d posit that you&#39;re actually in more danger of learning the wrong lessons than the right lessons by joining a startup. At the end of the day, the truth is likely to be Peter Thiel&#39;s observation that joining the right, highly successful, high growth startup as a very early employee is a great way to learn exactly 1 method of starting a successful company--the way that company did it. But if the startup you join isn&#39;t that rocketship, you&#39;ve only learned how to (or how not to) achieve that particular path of failure or mediocrity.Not particularly great advice though, because then the challenge becomes identify those startups. And if you could do that reliably, I&#39;d suggest you switch careers into VC instead :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Want to get to point X? Visit point Y first!&#34;Just go to point X directly. Too many people shy away from their dreams and delay, because they want to learn first, practice first, and get ready before the real adventure. You will never deplete &#34;more things to learn&#34;. You are only depleting your lifetime. And no matter how close working at a startup is to working on a startup, it will never be as close to it as itself.If you need to save up some money or take care of any other blockers first for your own safety, fine. If there is a great company working on a great problem that you are excited by, great. But if you want to start a new company, then working at a startup is not a practice for starting a new startup. It is a practice for working at a startup and a practice for wasting another day of your life not living the way you really want to live."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish I had had that opportunity back in 1985 when I founded my first one, but being outside of the Bay Area (as in 1500 miles away) there were basically no software startups at all, and with no internet/web/ycombinator etc, no way to learn anything except by trying and failing. We did ship our product, do marketing, make some sales but not enough so we had to sell the product and close down. Today I know all things I did wrong but back then you were working in a world unlike today, and not even one person to ask as everyone starting software companies back then was just as clueless unless you were in a few places in the country. It&#39;s hard to explain to people today just how hard this was (for example I tried to borrow some money at a local bank to buy computers, and when told we were a software company, the loan officer assumed we were making ladies undergarments)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"After using SD heavily for a week, I half agree with this. It is incredibly disruptive, and it&#39;s wild how much it accelerates the creative process. I&#39;ll give you that.But two things I&#39;ve noticed:First, artists will still have a massive advantage over non-artists with this tool. A photographer who intimately knows the different lenses and cameras and industry terms will get to a representation of their idea much faster than someone without that experience. Without that depth of knowledge, someone might have to rely instead on random luck to create what&#39;s in their head. Art curators might be well-positioned here since having a wide breadth of knowledge and point of reference is their advantage.Second, we need the ability to persist a design. If I create a character using SD, I need to be able to persist that character across different scenarios, poses, emotions, lighting, etc. Based on what I know about the methods SD/Midjourney/Dall-E are using, I&#39;m not sure how easy this will be to implement, or if it&#39;s even possible at all. There will always be subtle differences and that&#39;s where being an artist who can use SD for inspiration instead of merely creation will retain their advantage over a non-artist.That said, holy crap. This tech is insane."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is it just me, or do the comments in this thread seem to be the exact opposite of the sentiment in the comments on similar Github Copilot threads?I just find it a bit ironic that programmers are irate about Github Copilot using their copyrighted material to train. However, if it&#39;s an ML model training off of copyrighted artists material, clearly its a transformative work. I just find the opposing sentiments for these scenarios a bit funny."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Andreas, author of the Replicate model here -- though &#34;author&#34; feels wrong since I basically just stitched two amazing models together.The thing that really strikes me is that open source ML is starting to behave like open source software. I was able to take a pretrained text-to-image model and combine it with a pretrained video frame interpolation model and the two actually fit together! I didn&#39;t have to re-train or fine tune or map between incompatible embedding spaces, because these models can generalize to basically any image. I could treat these models as modular building blocks.It just makes your creative mind spin. What if you generate some speech with https://replicate.com/afiaka87/tortoise-tts, generate an image of an alien with Stable Diffusion, and then feed those two into https://replicate.com/wyhsirius/lia. Talking alien! Machine learning is starting to become really fun, even if you don&#39;t know anything about partial derivatives."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe I can shine some light on the debate from an concept artist standpoint that works in VFX and advertising. I worked on feature films (3 of them in the imdb top 100), tv shows (like game of thrones) and hundreds of AD campaigns.In the last 10 year the work of a concept artist changed dramatically we have gone from purely painted concept art to mostly &#34;photobashed&#34;. Photobashed means basically that you rip apart other images and stitch them together to get the desired image. Some start with a rough sketch for the composition or make really rough grey shade 3d model and &#34;overpaint&#34; them. When it comes to &#34;photobashing&#34; the disregard for copyrights was always there and it&#39;s the worst in smaller studios and a bit better in the leading ones. Still most of the time everyone argues that if you only use really small parts of the images it is covered by fair use. There are some examples were studios got sued but mostly without bigger financial impact.A few months ago I started working with &#34;DiscoDiffusion&#34; to generate the images I use to photobash. &#34;DiscoDiffusion&#34; can produce great &#34;painterly&#34; images but struggles with photorealism and is slower, not as coherent as &#34;StableDiffusion&#34;.
Still the adoption rate in the concept art community was insanely fast. This all got topped by &#34;StableDiffusion&#34; in the last week. Ofc there are still people that want to do it the &#34;right&#34; way and not use AI but we had the same discussion years ago when &#34;photobashing&#34; came into place and some artists still wanted to paint the whole image. As concept artist you are mostly paid for your design thinking that means it is less about the process and more about the finished product. The turnaround time for styleframes got reduced from 3-4 hours while painting to 45 min - 1 hour when photobashing with stable diffusion me and my peers in the studio are now at 20-45 min per styleframe. When &#34;photobashing&#34; most people constrain themselves on their image library and ressources like Photobashing Kits. Not only does &#34;StableDiffusion&#34; cut the time in half it also gives greater freedom in composition and design especially if you are using  img2img.So where does this leave us? For the work in fast paced art environments like VFX, games, conept art or advertising &#34;StableDiffusion&#34; is a welcome gamechanger. Tradionalists and Artists outside of the industry might feel threatened but for us in these industries it&#39;s a god send."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just came across this on twitter, every frame appears to be an evolution of the previous frame using img2img paired with a tilt/zoom to create a psychedelic animation.The author claims to have made this with Stable Diffusion, Disco, and Wiggle: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz_n0qxqoPgI believe Wiggle is used to automate the tilt/zoom between frames."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s really amazing is that they used a $2,000 drone, not something super super high end and specialized and out of reach. Plenty of hobby photographers have camera bodies, or combinations of camera body and lens, that cost that much.I have waded into the drone space recently. I had my eye on them (specifically DJI; they&#39;re clearly the leader) for a while (hobby photographer; lover of tech toys), but every time I looked in the past they were too expensive for me to justify. My uncle had one that as $1200 or so, and then a friend had one at like $600, and then just before we were going on vacation to Scotland I looked again and -- HOLY CRAP -- there&#39;s a model at $299.Sold.It&#39;s the DJI Mini SE, and you DO give up some stuff vs. the next level (about $500), but most of it is the drop from 4K video to &#34;merely&#34; HD. (There&#39;s also reduced range, which might end up mattering more.) OTOH $299 is for me a point where, if I fuck it up, I can be sanguine about it.It&#39;s INSANELY easy and fun to use. I got comfortable enough to send it far out over lochs, and to learn to trust its &#34;return to home&#34; function when flying in places where line of sight might obstruct the signal. If you haven&#39;t played with one you probably wonder how it handles losing a solid connection with the operator, and the answer is that, at least at this level, it remembers where it launched from, heads to a previously-set height (to avoid obstacles) and then comes home. At some point en route it&#39;ll re-acquire a connection and you can take back over.(Higher-end models (like the one they took to Everest) are able to navigate around obstacles and fly a more complex path home, but hey, this is the $299 model.)I&#39;m happy to share the video I shot but not publicly here. PM me (is that a thing?) if you want a link. And if you plan to travel somewhere beautiful where drone flight isn&#39;t severely restricted, I strongly suggest you consider getting one, China or not."</p>

A further idea would be to train a network actually good at dedup and not only similarity by training on positive and negative pairs, eg with triple loss.Here&#39;s my plan on the topic https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AryWpV0dD_r9x82I_quUzBuR...If anyone is interested to participate, I&#39;d be happy to guide them to do that.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Data is an excellent place to look at to get a sense of where the model is likely to work or not (what kinds of images), and for prompt design ideas because, roughly speaking, the probability of something working well is proportional to its frequency (or of things very similar to it) in the data.The story is more complex though because the data can often be quite far away from actual neural net training due to preprocessing steps, data augmentations, oversampling settings (it&#39;s not uncommon to not sample data uniformly during training), etc. So my favorite place to scrutinize is to build a &#34;batch explorer&#34;: During training of the network one dumps batches into pickles immediately before the forward pass of the neural net, then writes a separate explorer that loads the pickles and visualizes them to &#34;see exactly what the neural net sees&#34; during training. Ideally one then spends some quality time (~hours) looking through batches to get a qualitiative sense of what is likely to work or not work and how well. Of course this is also very useful for debugging, as many bugs can be present in the data preprocessing pipeline. But a batch explorer is harder to obtain here because you&#39;d need the full training data/code/settings."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I find the article hopeful for the future of free speech on the internet. Even though the ability to host content on the net is one thing and lacking access to most platforms (where the users actually are) like youtube, facebook, instagram, tiktok is another. The most important thing nowadays is access to the siloed user bases for people who try to express dissident opinions, not the access to the net as whole, even though that is important as well.&gt;For instance, when a site that opposed LGBTQ+ rights signed up for a paid version of DDoS mitigation service we worked with our Proudflare employee resource group to identify an organization that supported LGBTQ+ rights and donate 100 percent of the fees for our services to them.I find this section peculiar. Why does the company have &#34;values&#34;? I though companies were supposed to be looking after the intrests of their shareholders, i.e., profit. Do the shareholders consent to the lost profit being donated to political motives? This broader trend of companies becoming political organizations is terrible, frankly.But even with that said, I find their stance in the article to be hopeful, and sincerely wish that they stay true to their words in this paragraph.&gt;To be clear, just because we did it in a limited set of cases before doesn’t mean we were right when we did. Or that we will ever do it again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s rather disappointing that Cloudflare&#39;s policy is to not host content that is &#34;illegal, harmful, or violates the rights of others, including content that discloses sensitive personal information, incites or exploits violence against people or animals, or seeks to defraud the public&#34;, but they do not apply that same policy to content that they provide DDoS mitigation services for.I don&#39;t see why their policies should differ depending on whether they are hosting or protecting the content in question. Either way, they are in part responsible for making that content accessible. I get the feeling that this is just an arbitrary distinction that they&#39;ve made since hosting this content is more likely to have legal consequences for Cloudflare than simply providing DDoS mitigation services for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If this is in response to Kiwi Farms, I would say this is very disappointing.Love CloudFlare, think they are amazingly innovative, huge amount of respect for the people who work there.I see where they&#39;re coming from, but I don&#39;t see how KF is defensible whilst 8chan et al aren&#39;t."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Buried in the announcement is how Snap is shutting down Zenly and firing everyone who worked on it in Paris, France. Zenly is a location-based social application (think: you can see &amp; connect with your friends on a map). Snap bought them in 2017 for a reported $250-350M when they had ~4M installs. Now Zenly is at 40M MAUs, growing strong as I heard from employees working there.Zenly is (was?) popular in Japan, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and the Nordics. In Japan, it is head-on-head as the most used social app with Line.I find it odd that Snap just shuts down an app that was so popular in regions that is hard to gain foothold for any social media team. They could have likely sold it or spun it out, but chose not do so.It&#39;s also not like the app is a major cost to the company. Less than 100 people work on it across Snap, most based in Paris, France."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Evan also released a report this morning. Some departments such as Snap Minis &amp; games, snap originals, and a few other things like that pixy will be cut heavily/stopped entirely.Team members in the U.S. are stated to receive at least 4 months of &#34;compensation replacement&#34;. Those relying on work authorizations will receive additional support and flexibility according to the email.Other notable pieces is that Jerry Hunter is being promoted from SVP of engineering to COO.As a side note: I&#39;ve had several recruiters reach out to me since yesterday. Yesterday (08/30, day of verge report release) I had 9 unprompted recruiters reach out. Door dash, 2 from Amazon, and a few from some lesser known companies as well. This is with my LinkedIn profile set to &#34;not looking for a job&#34;.sources:[1] https://www.axios.com/2022/08/31/snap-restructuring-layoffs[2] I&#39;m a snap software engineer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll never understand the reasoning for social media platforms to get into the hardware business.SNAP getting into drones and phones - you might as well just light stacks of money on fire, which is what happened here.Whatever happened to just doing what you are good at?  Or is the end result for every startup global world domination?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Gorbachev secured his place in history by what he didn&#39;t do. While never endorsing the end of the eastern bloc, he made it clear beginning in the late 1980&#39;s that unlike his predecessors, he would not oppose democratic reforms in Eastern Europe by force. To general astonishment, he kept this promise, and with the regrettable exception of Lithuania this commitment to not repeating the crimes of his predecessors is Gorbachev&#39;s greatest legacy. In 1988 you would have been hard pressed to find anyone who could imagine the mostly peaceful collapse of the Eastern Bloc, but Gorbachev had the moral courage to accept this once unimaginable consequence of his policy and to see it through."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"RIP Gorbachev, one of the few genuinely good people in politics.After he retired from politics, he was featured in several advertisements:- In 1994 for Apple Computer: https://www.upi.com/Archives/1994/10/07/The-first-advertisem...- In 1998 for Pizza Hut: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorbachev_Pizza_Hut_commercial- In 2000 for the ÖBB, the Austrian railways: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLscz8kEg6c- In 2007 for Louis Vuitton: https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/05/business/media/05vuitton...."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Say what you will, he seemed a  politician very keen on world peace, beyond mere lip service. He understood the lacunae of the Soviet system and genuinely set about to reform them. But ultimately it was Ethno-national interests in Ukraine, Baltics and Central Asian republics along with the rise of opportunist power-grabbers like Yeltsin that did him and Soviet Union in.And perhaps his own reluctance  to follow the Chinese model. He prefered to do political reforms before economic ones, while the Chinese prefered the economic reforms first and foremost.He ended the war in Afghanistan. He was more keen on Nuclear disarmament than Western leaders: Western leaders dragged their feet on that matter, and ultimately we didn&#39;t get no where near Nuclear disarmament.He ushered in reforms. See the Soviet films of the period to see a very different picture from cold war era Hollywood depictions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would say: Writing is a test. It tests if you understand the subject well enough, and the &#34;other person&#34; well enough, to communicate it to that other person. Most likely you don&#39;t so then you need to think and/or learn more so that you can redraft it so it works. Write something technical and it reveals how little you know!---It is a trope but it works: Write your problem to the most senior developer in an email/slack but don&#39;t press send. Then there is a probably 50% chance you will solve it, or reduce the scope of the problem to {more focuesed question} that you can ask about."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a tech lead, when you&#39;re asked to deliver more, the first impulse tends to be asking your team &#34;how can we do more work?&#34;The correct question should be &#34;What can we NOT do?&#34; - and usually there&#39;s a long list of things that don&#39;t generate business value - from processes, meetings, reporting and overly detailed planning sessions to technical hurdles including slow builds, pre-check in hooks, sign off requirements etc.I know that most feel that they absolutely HAVE to do these things, since there are part of the business process/ definition of done/company guidelines etc... but here&#39;s the thing: If your team delivers value, people stop asking questions. It might take some forceful pushback and even some fights initially, but even if your team is absent from meetings or doesn&#39;t jump through every hoop, as long as you churn out value, you make yourself, your superiors and the business as a whole look good and in turn will be cut some slack."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A while back I took a couple years off from working. Sometimes I&#39;d still find myself saying &#34;I&#39;ve just been too busy&#34; when asking myself why I didn&#39;t get something done.

I still haven&#39;t fully broken the &#34;I&#39;m too busy&#34; pattern but at least now I know there&#39;s a decent chance that I haven&#39;t actually been too busy and I need to look more at what it is that I have been doing and whether or not those things are truly more important than whatever I was &#34;too busy&#34; to do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I love this quote:&gt; as long as you are doing your work well and continuously working on the next most important thing prioritised by the business, any pressure to deliver beyond what your team is capable of is objectively unreasonable.I feel like this is missing an acknowledgement that &#34;what a team is capable of&#34; actually depends on the manager! Managing people and priorities takes skills that require practice and learning. A manager that, for example, assigns people to work on things they enjoy working on and avoids excess pressure is going to have a team capable of a lot more than a team where the manager doesn&#39;t bother.So, when I see the list of &#34;reasonable ways for the business to exert influence over the work&#34; I feel like a huge missing one is &#34;help the manager manage their workload and the team better&#34;.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You did this? Nice job!&gt; Please also check out Keysharp, a WIP fork of IronAHK, another complete rewrite of AutoHotkey in C# that tries to be compatible with multiple OSes and support modern, v2-like AHK syntax with much more features than this one. In comparison, AHK_X11 is a lot less ambitious and more compact, and Linux only.Fascinating, lots to check out here. Thank you.BTW this kind of work falls into poweruser tools IMO, which is an important area for cultivation of Linux Desktop focus. Traditionally in the Linux community this has been more of a distro-maintainer&#39;s support choice (offer poweruser tweaks and tools, or not) so it&#39;s always nice to see new distro-independent, non-dev-poweruser options coming into being."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see the benefit in this, having one script that works everywhere.It&#39;s also good to know linux has autokey (https://github.com/autokey/autokey) for the same result. The name is close, but it&#39;s a different project.It&#39;s not compatible with autohotkey, but you can script using python. I used it to enter dates, emails and automatize dynalist.io actions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice! I used to love AHK to death, incidentally it also got me my first paid programming job.It‘s about the only software I dearly missed after switching to Mac, but recently I found Hammerspoon and couldn‘t have been happier.Yep, Lua is a bit weird and exotic, but hey, so is AHK. In the end, you trade in some of AHKs terseness for better modularity and compatibility with existing packages.https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the stated goal of MV3 by Google[1] was to avoid extensions with broad permissions:&gt; our new declarativeNetRequest API is designed to be a privacy-preserving method for extensions to block network requests without needing access to sensitive dataThis MV3-based AdGuard extension still requires a broad permission to &#34;read or modify host data&#34; on all sites[2]:    &#34;host_permissions&#34;: [
      &#34;&lt;all_urls&gt;&#34;
    ],

So what you have now is the same required permission to &#34;read or modify host data&#34; as with MV2, but with a network filtering engine capabilities gated by Google (an advertising company).We can&#39;t innovate anymore the filtering capabilities of our content blocker engines as we have been constantly doing over the years.For a recent example, there has been discussions lately with filter list maintainers of whether uBO should support AdGuard&#39;s proposed capability of being able to support pattern-matching for `domain=` filtering option[3] (uBO supports AdGuard lists).That sort of proposition is not possible to entertain with MV3 since only Google get to decide how the filtering engine will evolve, if at all. All content blocking issues will have to be resolved with the Google-controlled filtering engine, and left unaddressed if the solution can&#39;t be shoehorned in the declarativeNetRequest API.* * *[1] https://blog.chromium.org/2020/12/manifest-v3-now-available-...[2] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/Web...[3] https://github.com/AdguardTeam/CoreLibs/issues/1550* * *Edit: removed stray `[` character."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Manifest v3 is going to be a slaughter. Extension developers have known the slaughter was coming, but Chrome users are going to be taken by surprise. Many free Chrome extensions aren&#39;t going to get updated at all for v3, because it&#39;s too much work. Many aren&#39;t going to work right anymore because of the new restrictions. And ad blocking aside, v3 seems like a nightmare in general, and still quite buggy. The service workers vs. background script issue discussed by AdGuard will affect many or most extensions.I&#39;ve been postponing the migration of my extensions to v3 for as long as possible. One extension should be fine, but the other one... I&#39;m afraid of what that&#39;s going to be like."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Correction:Analytics &amp; Ad Blocker by Globemallow.io https://globemallow.io/ was the first Manifest v3 Ad Block extension.I first published on 06/22/2022.Last night actually I asked if AdGuard would want to license the software, and sent them a link to my extension. They are aware they weren&#39;t the first, and made this post after knowing it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You don&#39;t say where you are located, but unless you are in one of the few places where Dell doesn&#39;t offer on-site next business day support then XPS 13 is a great laptop.Their support is amazing: &#34;We&#39;re not sure what is causing it, but we&#39;ll send someone to replace the whole motherboard tomorrow.&#34; &#34;OH, your currently halfway across the world on a island? No problem, we&#39;ll be there tomorrow&#34;I really don&#39;t understand how it&#39;s done. Clearly they must have parts distributed ahead of time.I&#39;m just amazed that it&#39;s included in the price considering the cost of sending a technician out to a customer. The fact that even here on HN a lot of people think Apple&#39;s support is good suggests that Dell might be able to save a ton of money by lowering their support level, so I don&#39;t really get why they offer it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I absolutely love my Framework laptop for dev. I feel the software support is also quite good, at least for Fedora which is explicitly supported. I got the DIY edition and put everything together, including installing Fedora, in under 1 hour. And I&#39;m a really slow guy, haven&#39;t build a computer in 10 years - its too easy with framework.This laptop is really build to be repairable and modular and it does not suck at all. I think it will last a long time.The ability to choose your own edition also means I got a reasonably affordable laptop with loads of RAM, which I find is quite useful for development."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Please excuse the long-winded answer...I have also given up on Apple, but mostly because I can&#39;t see the value in it anymore, otherwise my experience with them has been satisfactory (Intel CPU models).For the past few years I used a Microsoft Surface Pro because it seemed to have good build quality and high screen resolution, but despite this I have had to replace it as part of a recall due to a graphics hardware issue, so it was not without its flaws. On a side note, I found the Windows OS to be OK for non-dev work, but would always &#34;work&#34; on the Linux subsystem... so even though Windows supports it quite well, I would just suggest 100% Linux.For 2022 I decided to buy a &#34;gaming&#34; laptop and switch to 100% Linux. The build quality is a little lower than Apple, and the screen resolution is not as good as Apple or Surface Pro, but it is still good, and when using my external monitor there is no difference.The benefits are clear, however, for less than 50% of the cost I am getting superior performance, discrete GPU, excellent cooling, and NO LOCK-IN. There is also the added benefit of being able to play the occasional video game with great performance.So far I don&#39;t regret it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bought this book the second I found it. It&#39;s incredibly well-put together, and I can&#39;t wait for the print edition. I have already read through the PDF, and there are so many beautiful illustrations that help show what is actually happening inside a component."</p>
