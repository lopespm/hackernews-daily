Infineon and AMD used to do a lot of research and production in Dresden. The AMD fab has since become a part of GlobalFoundries. But there&#39;s still a healthy ecosystem of university research and medium-sized software companies. Or at least there was, when I visited GlobalFoundries in 2014.Also, there has been a growing amount of research activity into chip design in Germany lately, driven in no small part by CERN&#39;s needs.For example

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is moves like this which show the tremendous impact of Tesla.  The old automakers were never going to be the ones to push the switch to greener tech themselves.  Even the companies that we may have thought were forward looking a decade ago like Toyota are now showing that they had no plans to embrace cleaner vehicles as an overall company strategy.  The industry needed an outsider to threaten the incumbents into actually changing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s crazy is I absolutly thought Toyota would be the leaders here. The prius HAD a full electric drivetrain ALREADY. Regen etc etc. Neat dash display. They could have dropped the gas engine out and simplified things, increase battery size and they&#39;d have been well on the way.Instead we have this hydrogen craziness. Billions here in CA have been spent on a &#34;hydrogen superhighway&#34;. Meanwhile, for some reason the EV / Tesla charging network is getting built out naturally - I just did an EV plug at home for my relatives with electric cars -&gt; no govt subsidy needed. If we get an EV (we want to) I will leave the house every day with a &#34;full&#34; tank.The conversion losses are a lot less with electric -&gt; Hydrogen you start with electricity, make hydrogen, compress it, transport it, pump it, use to to make electricity again, run engine.Electricity you can also make locally (solar etc) and hopefully one day use as a battery backup to your house (100kW house battery would be great)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Instead of everybody jumping on bandwagon and siding with every legislature to be PC, individuals and companies have right to challenge those laws or on how practical they are. These challenges will naturally yield better laws considering the huge wave already behind the electric vehicles.&#34;Toyota’s Indian subsidiary publicly criticized India’s target for 100 percent electric vehicle sales by 2030, saying it was not practical.&#34;, the keyword being not practical, country which struggles with electricity during summer and rations farmers electricity is legislating 100% electric?"</p>

Now that Apple has released a patch for it widespread reverse engineering will begin immediately and it&#39;ll only be a matter of time until packaged exploits become part of standard mass-use toolkits. Having a patch ready to deploy is great, but simultaneously means it&#39;s all the more important to get it deployed fairly promptly if it&#39;s something that could have serious root/remote execution potential.Though I suppose if this bug can be used for a jailbreak there may be some people who&#39;d actively want to stay on 14.7 as well.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thank you once again for writing such an excellent article &lt;3In contrast to some other comments here, I love the narrative style. After all, these are half tutorials half entertainment - and the entertainment keeps it enticing. I would not have spent nearly two hours reading about the nitty-gritty of futures implementation details today if it weren&#39;t for the way you write about things.To put it the other way - if I wanted to read a super condensed, concise reference of how these things work, I would, you know, read a reference. The narrative style of building things on your own, solving problems as you face them, picking tools and libraries on the way, feels relatable as the everyday lived experience of software development. It feels appropriate for the medium - it&#39;s a blog after all!Besides, blogs are the perfect place to mention the tiny useful tools and libraries people might not have heard of. References and books might err on the side of being &#34;neutral&#34; and not making opinionated recommendations, but this can also lead to unknown unknowns. People don&#39;t know what they are missing out on! Luckily, blogs have more freedom here. Mentioning things like `cargo-edit`, `serde` and others can probably make some readers feel like &#34;one of today&#39;s lucky ten thousand&#34; - enjoying the newly-gained quality of life improvements."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I don&#39;t know! Why do they truncate stuff like that?Because Linux limits thread names to 15 bytes (not including the required terminal nul).Other unices are better though not great, macOS is 63 I think.By comparison Windows allows 32… kilobytes.Though “runtime” is probably what should be shortened here, “rt” is literally the name of the tokio features for configuring the runtime, so that would likely be more understandable than the trailing “-w”."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So, most people reading this aren&#39;t looking for the marketing section. But I wanted to point something out I see all the time. Take a look at the roles under CMO at a 125 person company:--CMO (15)Director, Product Marketing, plus 3 PMMs (4)Director, Demand Gen, plus 3 marketers (4)Director, Sales Enablement, plus 2 marketers (3)Director, Brand Marketing (3)PR &amp; Analyst Relations (1-2)Events/Community (1)--What I posit is that Product Marketing is useless as a position and should be eliminated most of the time.The role ends up being:
- Jane Doe is the Product Marketer for product X. She&#39;s responsible for growing it as much as possible.
- She works with Anne X. in demand gen to make ads to promote the product to new customers.
- She works with Hillary Y. in email marketing to cross promote to existing customers
- She works with tech to do landing page/funnel testing.However what I find is that the role just adds friction and useless tests to show value. Let the subject matter experts (in demand gen, email, website testing) create the plan for each product holistically. Product Marketers are dead weight 80% of the time.I would only say this anonymously but its true. Source: I&#39;m a marketing consultant that has worked with dozens of fast growing SaaS companies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a good rough outline. As the author says, it&#39;s not meant to be a perfect target that fits every company. Adjust accordingly.I like how he limits the number of C-level titles in the early stages to just a CEO and CTO. It&#39;s a common mistake for startup founders to hand out too many C-level titles to their cofounders and early hires. This causes problems when the company outgrows some (or most) of those people. If you need to bring in a more experienced CMO, CRO, CSO, or other C-level, your only options are to demote the existing C-level and replace them with a new boss or to arrange their exit from the company. Neither are good looks, and neither make people happy.Much better to start with Director and VP level titles in the early days. You can either bring in a C-level above them when the time is right, or promote them to C-level if they grow into the role.That said, most SaaS I&#39;ve worked with would want more people on backend/devops at the earl stages. Having 3 people total handle combined devops and backend development is a big risk, especially if any of them want to go on vacation or leave for other jobs. Downtime and server outages are not a good look for a growing SaaS, so don&#39;t skimp on people who can keep it up and running."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why do the number of front end devs exceed the back end? Does anyone else see a problem here? Front end effort has always been a fraction of back end effort on the systems I&#39;ve developed. If that&#39;s not the case, I can only hypothesize it&#39;s because front end toolchains have gotten overly complex for what they accomplish. Not only that, but I would posit that for most SaaS ventures, the back end is where the differentiation and value is delivered, so that is where the bulk of dev resources should be deployed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Neat. I’ve been looking for something like this for gamedev — being able to model pseudo-realistic simulation of planetary evolution (for my interest, just starting at plate tectonics and going up until wind patterns) to provide a “basis” for further simulation.It’s surprisingly hard to google though; almost all content is simple perlin noise generation that looks kind of correct but ultimately produces total nonsense (so any further derived rules have to also be total nonsense) — generally constrained with further nonsense rules to produce higher level concepts like “animals” and “biomes” that can’t be touched meaningfully.Other material I can find is far too involved, and far too slow — targeting actual simulation of the earth. The few that do it with the goal of “just realistic enough” still end up being 10+ minutes generation time for small worlds. Modeling erosion processes being the main culprit, afaict.Definitely stealing this one, for all my nefarious deeds."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would like to see more work being done to simulate abiogenesis. Essentially, it&#39;s a search problem -- take some elements and probabilistically form increasingly complex molecular machines to the point where they become self-replicating and exhibit the basic properties of life. Once this bootstrapping has begun, it&#39;s a matter of subjecting the proto-lifeforms to evolutionary pressures, and over time, they will &#34;evolve&#34; to become increasingly complex organisms."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great work. Interesting that he didn&#39;t simulate the impact that formed the moon, though. I&#39;m interested in how that impacted (ha) plate tectonics.

I have my own opinion, but he&#39;s been right about stuff I&#39;d disagreed with him in the past before so I&#39;m gun shy about confronting his ideas again.On the topic of unsafe language though, he&#39;s absolutely right. We don&#39;t have to put up with this. We could pass a law and ban new code in unsafe languages from national security threatening devices like phones or cyberphysical devices like self-driving cars and we would be the better for it in under a decade. We could even have taxes to give breathing room during a transitionary period to encourage it before outright banning it, but we don&#39;t. We don&#39;t because so often it is less of a hassle for the government to trust the private sector that it is to take some real position on the regulatory issues that matter.

It makes some sense even here - that bad code is as common as bad law - and often for the same reasons, politics, money, and hard questions&#34;Engineering&#34; is a wide subject - the big stuff is carefully built and highly regulated -  bridges and buildings.  But as we go down the scale we see engineering give way to the problems of politics and money - tower blocks collapse for example, and then we see human level engineering - factory tools that try to meet  inflicting goals, dangerous toys and so much more.The software world should not beat itself up for not being like all those engineers - when lives are not on the line engineers get tied up just the same as the rest.   And when lives are on the line, software and hardware engineering have learnt a few things - reduce the scope to the barest possible essentials - have a lot of redundancy and stick to well known designs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I did a Ph.D. in number theory, published a few dozen research papers, and have programmed a lot and this post sounds about right to me.  I did CS as an undergrad, before doing a math Ph.D., and remember being very surprised that math papers weren&#39;t a lot more wrong than they actually are (since computer software is so often full of bugs, and all it takes is one single bug to completely invalidate an entire paper).  When I was a grad student at Berkeley, I once asked Serge Lang (who I think wrote the most advanced math textbooks of anybody who ever lived) why mathematics research papers don&#39;t have a lot more incorrect results in them.  He responded that it was because people secretly &#34;proved&#34; everything to themselves in multiple ways, but only wrote up one proof, and it was unlikely that multiple very different reasons for something being true would all be wrong.  Of course, there are serious mistakes and gaps in the literature, though what one person considers a gap, somebody else who knows more might not consider a gap.  For example, I remember once that Ernst Kani was complaining to me about a big gap in a paper by Ribet; I didn&#39;t believe it, so I read the relevant section and was able to fill in the gap in a few hours sufficiently to satisfy him.   In any case, I&#39;ve spent decades both programming and doing number theory, and despite some similarities, they are very different things.    Another related way these threads come together is with Kevin Buzzard&#39;s big project to formalize mathematics using LEAN; he&#39;s another number theorist, and he told me that a few years ago he started really worrying about the correctness of a lot of number theory papers, and that strongly motivated his interest in LEAN."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If anyone is interested in number theory and would like to help some incarcerated people that are working on a number theory paper:I&#39;m a director of the Prison Math Project: http://prisonmathproject.org/We have a few advanced mathematicians in jail who don&#39;t have access to computers. They need help with formatting their work in LaTeX and stuff like that to make it ready for publication (credit offered).They have previously co-authored some papers from within jail eg&#34;Linear Fractional Transformations And Nonlinear Leaping Convergents Of Some Continued Fractions&#34;&#34;Math And Art In Prison: A Collaborative Effort Across The Ocean&#34;please reach out if any interest in helping them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Anyway, despite the fact that error-correction is really hard, publishing actually false results was quite rare because &#34;people&#39;s intuition about what&#39;s true is mysteriously really good.&#34;I don&#39;t find that mysterious.  One aspect of number theory is that results have arbitrarily deep implications and relations.  If you are wrong about something you can often substitute it in somewhere else and produce a wrong answer or a contradiction.Doing something wrong which still looks right after being tested from a few different perspectives is extremely tricky.Like finding a pseudoprime for some probabilistic primaility test-- it&#39;s not likely to also be a pseudoprime for an unrelated test.  So pretty much the only way to pass a collection of independent probabilistic tests is to actually be prime.  (Note the &#39;pretty much&#39;-- a bunch of approximate proofs isn&#39;t a necessarily proof, but it at least explains why false things are seldom believed even when their headline proofs aren&#39;t solid)I don&#39;t just mean through different reviewers -- when you publish a proof of something you&#39;ve probably satisfied yourself that it was true through multiple avenues.  The proof you published was just the one you thought was the most convincing. Unfortunately, making an error in it can be something that makes a proof more convincing (until the error is found), but fortunately having an incorrect proof of something doesn&#39;t make the underlying fact untrue."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi there, Signal-Android developer here. I updated the issue to reflect this, but this bug has been fixed. I was tracking it on a separate issue, and had forgotten to close this one.We do, in fact, take issues like this very seriously. This bug was extraordinarily rare, and because we have no metrics/remote log collection, there was an initial period where we had to spend time adding logging and collecting user-submitted logs to try to track it down. As soon as we were able to pick up a scent, it was all we worked on, and we were able to get a fix out very quickly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Several years ago, when I worked at FB, I ran into a similar bug on an early internal version of a Messenger rewrite. Sent pictures to one chat, showed up in another.My bug report on it kicked off an absolute maelstrom of dev activity and investigation. High level engineers showed up in the comments. Lots of immediate followup. The severity was clearly understood and resolving it was clearly prioritized.I exclusively use Signal now, but the discrepancy between what I see here and what I saw there is pretty disheartening. This kind of bug is not only a massive privacy risk, but it also massively erodes user confidence and trust."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some additional context for those who don&#39;t follow professional cycling: the Dutch women&#39;s team was incredibly strong coming into this road race. All 4 riders on their team are stars in their own right, and the only reason there wasn&#39;t a clear favorite for the race overall is that people weren&#39;t sure which Dutch rider would win.So you have a complicated group dynamic, where the majority of the peloton has no interest in pulling the group to catch the break, since they would just get beat by one or more of the Dutch riders, and the Dutch riders didn&#39;t seem to have a clear plan on how to control the race and who would sacrifice their chances and work on the front for the rest of the team.As others have said, there were no radios allowed for riders in the race, so all information about the breakaway came from the race director&#39;s car trailing the peloton. This was a well known fact about the race coming in, and it&#39;s the same way that the annual World Championship race is run. It&#39;s normal for riders to drop back to the team car to get information about the break, and the lead moto for a group of cyclists will occasionally show time gaps on a whiteboard.At least one of the Dutch riders claimed to have known about the lone rider off the front [1], but somehow that information didn&#39;t make it to the rest of the team. It seems that most of the peloton didn&#39;t know (or didn&#39;t care) how many riders were up the road, and the Dutch team failed to communicate amongst themselves and establish a plan.All that leads to Kiesenhofer&#39;s solo move working out. All credit to her for an extremely strong ride.[1]https://netherlandsnewslive.com/miscommunication-and-underes..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fantastic ride and if you follower her Twitter she&#39;s been doing a lot of very detailed exploration of her endurance limits in preparation.When the lead group fell to 3 they had an 11 minute lead.She broke free and went solo with 40km to go.When she finished that lead had eroded to 2 minutes as the front group she dropped had been caught.So in those 40km she lost 9 minutes of lead she had built with the help of the breakout group.This was all strategy and then a tremendous physical performance on her part.Dutch team needs a serious kick in the ass for underestimating an &#34;amatuer&#34; in this regard.  It was obvious she was in it for the gold or nothing; and they fatally assumed it would be the later.Fantastic win when you consider training, strategy, and performance all came together to pull it off.  This is what olympians are all about!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"(More related to the comments than the article) I&#39;ve seen tons of takes on this since watching the end of the race this morning and, although it certainly played a part in deciding the outcome, it&#39;s a shame that more focus has seemed to be on making excuses or how the Dutch riders messed things up instead of Dr Kiesenhofer&#39;s incredible story and ride.Kiesenhofer was on a fantastic day: van Vleuten&#39;s earlier attack from the peloton made no inroads to Kiesenhofer, assuming the time gaps shown on the TV were correct.Watching on the TV we knew there was still a rider out front and, even if the race &#34;ardoisier&#34; (blackboard holder) wasn&#39;t the best, team management should have figured out a way to get that information to the chasing pack. I mean, the race finished on a motor racing circuit with pit lanes containing team helpers! It&#39;s not like it was like stage 16 of this year&#39;s Giro, where poor weather stopped race images being broadcast[1].[1] https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/gallery-amazing-images-from-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Pretty much. The best way to insert supply chain exploits is to embed them in a stack exchange answer to a beginner&#39;s question.This isn&#39;t new, we&#39;ve always had programmers who programmed by &#34;recipe&#34; rather than first principles, and DRY paints that as a feature, but it underlies a lot of pain and cost over the years.To give some context, I inherited some kernel code when I worked in the Systems Group at Sun Microsystems in the 80&#39;s that was written by a mathematician who had become a programmer because the money was in programming, not applied math. They had cut and pasted code they didn&#39;t understand in order to achieve the result they wanted out of the code they were &#34;writing.&#34; When I inherited it I read through it and found a couple of dozen ways the code would panic the kernel[1]. Once fixing those obvious issues, it became clear that the original owner of the code didn&#39;t really understand what computation did. They had an idea, and mathematically they could show that it was correct, but literally no ability to express that algorithmically.This is not a &#34;new&#34; problem but it is an important one that managers of software engineers need to watch for.[1] At the time the only difference between &#34;kernel&#34; programmers and &#34;application&#34; programmers was that kernel programmers recognized that unsafe code crashed the whole system, not just the application. So they tended to be cultivated from paranoid programmers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I freelance fixing and maintaining legacy web apps, almost always PHP.Anecdotally I see SQL injection vulnerabilities  in about half the code I look at. It’s one type of problem among many other problems and vulnerabilities in code written by amateurs and often copy/pasted.PHP programmers can find lots of resources online. Some of those are terrible, either very old or written by amateurs excited to show how they got something to work.I have seen the same kind of thing with Java and Python, but the popularity of PHP means there’s a lot of junk info and examples online.PHP has supported safe SQL and safe HTML for decades, but the programmer has to understand the problem and the solution."</p>

Ten hours worth of XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, badly coded authentication, you name it. When confronted, the instructor said that he did not want to confuse the beginners with all of that security stuff. I just thought &#34;ok&#34; and moved on.Now I went back to this guy&#39;s YouTube channel and saw that half a year later he finally did upload a bonus episode on how to mitigate SQL injections. One person in the comment section actually thanked him for the much needed video because their site was getting hacked. It is pretty hilarious to see this unfold but I do feel bad for the ~10k people who watched his videos."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author of the Damn Interesting post here. Internally we worried that there would be some fallout from abandoning our Facebook page--by the numbers we had more followers there than any other social media platform, by far. But the response from our audience has been almost 100% positive, even from our Facebook followers[1]. It put only a tiny dent in our site&#39;s daily traffic. It resulted in many new subscribers to our email list. There was a flurry of new donations, with attached supportive comments about the amputation. Facebook was exactly the gangrenous thing it appeared to be, and we are better off without it. If you will permit me the indulgence of quoting my own post:&gt; Some call it a “necessary evil,” but if that’s the case let’s do all we can to make it unnecessary.For any organizations considering the same move, I cannot recommend it enough.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"So Facebook is no longer showing all posts to people who intentionally subscribe to a page? If so, what, if anything, does “subscription” or “following” mean, then?I realize I’m showing my age here, but I remember when missing an issue of a paper “subscription” was cause for anger and resulted in an apology from the publisher (and usually a redelivered copy). But I also remember when “follow” meant “show me all new posts from this user” on Facebook, too, back before they fucked up the News Feed in the 2010s and turned it into their manure delivery system."</p>

To that, they add chemical toilets, a water supply and (I&#39;m not sure why) 24/7 security staff. For this, the city pays around $60k per tent site per year. I&#39;m not sure if this is in part due to some unsavory relationship between the org administering the program and some city official.
Recently the program was extended. It would be cheaper to rent apartments at current market rates, even in San Francisco.Our revealed preference seems to be that we&#39;d rather have homeless people live in tents than have poor people get free or nearly free housing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The fundamental problem with Agile is the fundamental problem with all product development:The customer doesn&#39;t know what they wantAgile assumes as a first principal that including the customer throughout the development process will align the building team and the customer to come to the same conclusion.This is almost never actually true. Having built and managed a lot of products I can state fairly confidently that the amount of time the customer has, and clarity about the problem they want solved is orders of magnitude more ambiguous than is required to actually build and deliver something to their satisfaction.In my opinion successful products, and I mean ones with significant flywheels with customers and viral growth and stickiness are with few exceptions - accidents. It was someone who had an interesting thought and a lot of people for whom the product was good enough for their desire that they often didn&#39;t even know they hadYou can&#39;t write down how to do that, it&#39;s like asking a nobel prize winner how they came up with their discovery. It&#39;s not repeatable. Some people have better intuitions than others and these are the people who are repeatably successful with products. But it doesn&#39;t generalize.That said, the fundamental problem isn&#39;t wrong in theory, it&#39;s just naiive in practice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Agile is a generic umbrella term that involves a vast array of complex, subtle knowledge and skills. It&#39;s like saying &#34;Engineer&#34;, or &#34;Chef&#34;. Each has a shared skillset, to be sure. But each category&#39;s members can&#39;t just work the same way at all jobs, and there&#39;s no book on how to be an Engineer or Chef everywhere.The Agile Manifesto is a failure at trying to make Agile happen because it can&#39;t tell you how to make it happen, because it varies wildly. No manager can read a book on how to &#34;Agile-ify&#34; their org, they have to apply their brains and figure out how their specific version of &#34;Agile&#34; will work. But the skill-set required to do this is not a Managerial skill, it is a lower-level-worker skill. But it&#39;s also a very advanced lower-level-worker skill.And that&#39;s why things like &#34;Agile&#34;, &#34;DevOps&#34;, etc will fail. People at the higher end have no clue how to make it happen, and people at the lower end who have an idea how to make it happen don&#39;t have the power to make the organizational changes to do so. You need a way for the lower-end people to tell the higher-end people what to do, and have the higher-end people listen to them, and make the changes happen. This is very hard in a traditional organizational hierarchy, because higher-end people have big egos and bigger concerns over things like politics."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not an expert on this subject, but I feel like &#34;agile&#34; could be summarized as &#34;a process for actively incorporating feedback early and often&#34;.That doesn&#39;t mean you need points or tshirt sizes or constant status meetings. You just need channels of communication with the right people and a chance to adapt to what they say."</p>

They use technical terms and true technologies to lie about their security issues and measures. Flash memory should easily withstand north of 10k write/erase cycles, base on type.

Specifically, the idea of small communities where a group of people maintains the underlying tech, and - kicker here - everyone in the community knows more or less everyone else in the community.That offers a bit more security/safety/continuity than just self-hosting everything, while still not ceding control to a faceless corporation.Granted, there will always be other reliances outside of the community - like internet and electricity providers - but a line has to be drawn somewhere."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The biggest most successful and best run organizations I&#39;ve worked for have not worried about hosting their software. They&#39;re concerned with delivering value to customers and doing it quickly.The most fractured and worst run companies have been concerned with self-hosting and frankly they sympathized with a lot of the stuff I&#39;m seeing on here.But I recognize we still need people self-hosting because it drives innovation and competition. I believe there are ways of doing things well while self-hosting, but I&#39;m not sure what those ways are."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fun fact: you can overload the Python import system to work with other languages that you create.I use this for my Python-based Lisp: https://github.com/shawwn/pymen/blob/ml/importer.py  import foo

checks for &#34;foo.l&#34;, and if found, compiles it to foo.py on the fly and imports that instead.It&#39;s so cursed. I love it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are two things that are annoying about Python&#39;s import system.Number one is that relative imports are weird. My intuition about imports is good enough that I never bothered to learn all the rules explicitly, but sometimes something simple is just not possible and it bites me. I think the case is importing files relative to a script (and not running with python -m ...).Number two is, in order to do package management, you have to create a fake python installation and bend PYTHONPATH. Virtualenvs are the canonical way to do it, but to me it feels like a hack - the core language seems to wants all packages installed in /usr. So now I have all these virtualenvs lying around and they are detached from the scripts.Why couldn&#39;t the import system resolve versions, too? You could say `import foo &gt;= 1.0` and it would download it to some global cache, and the import the correct versions from the cache."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Python import system is by far the worst one I dealt with. Using Setup.py and regular or namespace packages, relative import, having complex sub packages and cross importing, running a script from somewhere inside one of your sub packages, and many more craps like these. Import system must be intuitive and easy to use!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In particles physics, they have a different explanation of electromagnetism that is also very natural, almost inevitable. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics#Mathem... The explanation in particle physics is compatible with Quantum Mechanics and Special Relativity, but no one is sure about how to extend it to General Relativity. I&#39;m not sure how compatible is it with the proposal in the article discussed here.Non technical version (ELI25):In quantum mechanics the wavefunction Ψ is has complex values. If you multiply everything in the universe by -1, nothing changes because all the physical results use ΨΨ* (where * is the complex conjugation). You can also multiply everything by i or -i. Moreover by any other complex number of modulo 1 because ΨΨ* does not change. (The technical term for this is U(1) global gauge symmetry.)But you can be more ambitious and want to multiply each point of the universe by a different complex number of modulo 1. ΨΨ* does not change but the derivatives of Ψ change and they are also important. (When you use the same complex number everywhere, the derivatives is just a multiple of the original derivative. When you use a different number in each point, it changes.)The only way to fix the problem with the derivative is to add a new field A. When you and multiply each point of the universe by a different complex number of modulo 1, then A changes in a simple to calculate but not obvious way. The change in A fix the problem with the derivatives of Ψ.So now the equations of the universe with Ψ and A don&#39;t change when you make this change. (The technical term for this is U(1) local gauge symmetry.) When you write carefully how a universe like this look like, the new field A is electromagnetism. (Actually, you can get the electric field and magnetic field using the derivatives of A.)This explanation looks more complicated than the explanation of the article, but the article is full of technical terms that you really don&#39;t want to know, like:&gt; Riemann curvature tensor is more than just Ricci curvature—electromagnetic fields stretch and bend the spacetime"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not an expert in GR, but the linked paper seems nonsensical[0]. It postulates a highly degenerate decomposition of the metric tensor, for which they postulate a contrived action which then seems to correspond to the Einstein-Hilbert, through mathematically unsound manipulations (how can you raise indices with the metric being nowhere even close to invertible?).Besides, how can you talk about unifying general relativity and electromagnetism without mentioning Kaluza-Klein theory[1]? And what about one of the most beautiful principles in physics, gauge invariance[2]?I don&#39;t want to be rude, but I&#39;m very curious as to how this got through peer review.0: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1956/1/...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is not really coherent. It seems like a bunch of random statements about physics, strung together without explanation. This paragraph for instance is a bunch of true-ish sentences but overall is gibberish:&gt;  The metric tensor of spacetime tells us how lengths determine in spacetime. The metric tensor also thus determines the curvature properties of spacetime. Curvature is what we feel as &#34;force.&#34; In addition, energy and curvature relate to each other through the Einstein field equations. Test particles follow what are called geodesics—the shortest paths in the spacetime."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When they say 10k miles, do they mean 10k miles of land or of cable?  Asking because my military unit used individual cables to exaggerate numbers.  i.e. 6 strands at 1 mile would become &#34;6 miles of cable run&#34;.  Either way, great they are doing this.  I hope they prevent some fires and save some lives."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We&#39;re taking a different approach in Australia (the state of Victoria specifically), and not only are we replacing bare wire overheads with buried cables [0], we are also implementing Rapid Earth Fault Current Limiter (REFCL) technology to lower the risk of bushfires due to downed wires. [1]When powerlines come into contact with the ground or a tree, arcing can occur. If the line remains live and continues arcing, the risk of fire is quite high.REFCL tech works by detecting the phase-to-earth faults that occur when a one of the three-phase powerlines breaks and falls to the ground. REFL instantly reduces the voltage on the fallen line, and boosts the voltage on the other two phases. REFCL will then test the faulted line after a few seconds, and if the fault was intermittent full service is restored. If not, the whole line is removed from service to prevent fires and make the line safe to work on.On Total Fire Ban days (very high risk of fire due to weather conditions), the REFCL settings operate at increased sensitivity.There&#39;s a requirement in Victoria that by 2023 all high risk zone substations have to install REFCL technology, and all HV customers connected to those zone subs have to be REFCL compliant (their equipment must be able to handle the over-voltages that occur during REFCL operation).[0] https://www.energy.vic.gov.au/electricity/powerline-replacem...[1] https://www.energy.vic.gov.au/safety-and-emergencies/powerli..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a question I haven’t seen anyone address so far: how much can we expect this to reduce the frequency of wildfires? Intuitively, to me, the effect would seem to be negligible. All of the conditions for wildfires will remain in place. It’ll simply be something else that lights the spark. If it’s not power lines it’ll be lightning.So then to follow up: what is the point? To deflect blame from PGE? And who pays for it?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I agree with the author that the real estate agent described something most people want, and not necessarily what the author himself wanted. I think it&#39;s unfortunate that the agent didn&#39;t hear what the author wanted and just pointed him to the general public&#39;s preference anyway.However, I disagree with his take that America&#39;s housing development model is to develop into outskirt suburbs, let middle class move in, let it deteriorate in 30 years, and build more outskirts.Now, maybe I live in California and things are different. In the bay area even old areas with very old houses rise in values, and in fact, they rise more than newer developments. Demand for housing everywhere in the bay area + surrounding areas are high regardless of how new they are and how deep in town or out in the outskirts they are. Areas developed 30+ years ago continue to have high demand from middle to wealthy families. These areas didn&#39;t just not deteriorate but have grown into larger and more modern areas and in some cases developed their own downtown.Admittedly California and bay area specifically is probably a bubble and behaves differently than much of America. But I have a feeling more than a few popular cities are going through something similar. Appleton might not be, and maybe he&#39;s right that the new development outskirts will deteriorate in 30 years, but I doubt that&#39;ll be the case in new developments around Phoenix or Denver."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"| All of America’s institutions are focused exclusively on churn.Planning prior to 1990s was predicated on the assumption of continued  upward mobility, middle class persistence and strength of US production of goods and services (a/k/a wealth).Instead, the US exported all of that to China, and praised its new service-led, consumer-based, greener economy.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;&gt; In 1995, 2% of schizophrenia diagnoses in the country were associated with cannabis use disorder. In 2000, it increased to around 4%. Since 2010, that figure increased to 8%, the study found.Worded that way, causation isn&#39;t the first thing this suggests to me. If percentage of cases associated with marijuana rise, it could also be that a larger percentage of the population is smoking and admitting to smoking marijuana regularly. If cases themselves rise, it could also be increases in the percentage of cases that actually get diagnosed, etc.It could very well be that marijuana puts you at higher risk of schizophrenia - I certainly have an acquaintance in mind for whom recreational drug usage seems to have led them to a paranoid and narcissistic personality described here in other comments - but the connection in this article feels weak. Certainly weaker than the connection we see between marijuana law enforcement and the negative fallout of that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can only speak from personal experience, which is of course limited.  I smoked occasionally in my 20s, but not since (I&#39;m middle-aged now).  I&#39;ve been friends and acquaintances with many people that smoke a lot.  I see a trend among these people - not necessarily schizophrenia (I&#39;m not a psychologist and probably wouldn&#39;t even notice a mild case) - but instead a consistent arrogance and self-importance.  It&#39;s peculiar - they may be contributing very little to society (or maybe a lot), but regardless there&#39;s a sense of superiority that seems to crop up among them all.  Maybe even narcissism?I could be completely wrong.  I don&#39;t express this to assert it, but rather to ask if anyone else has noticed anything similar."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As usual, a sensational headline averring a research article&#39;s causal hypothesis, of which the PI even calls for reproducibility. Reading such paltry science articles makes me really appreciate papers like Quanta, whose reporters seem to actually have a semblance of domain knowledge.Indeed, no discussion of the existing link between schizophrenia and tobacco smoking, in conjunction with the increased availability of marijuana?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"On the Hotel California EffectIf it&#39;s expensive to move data out of AWS, it&#39;s not just about making it hard for customers to leave AWS. It means that any third-party service that wants to sell to AWS customers must also use AWS.For example, Snowflake can&#39;t really run its own data centers. They need to rent from AWS. If you&#39;re a company on AWS, you won&#39;t want to spend $0.08/GB sending things to Snowflake.The high egress cost gives Amazon a lot of power to keep the third-party ecosystem within AWS and without as much negotiating power on things like EC2 costs. Snowflake can&#39;t say to Amazon, &#34;if you don&#39;t give us a great discount, we&#39;re going to move our operations to DigitalOcean&#34; because Amazon would just say, &#34;no you&#39;re not. Your customers aren&#39;t going to pay $80/TB to load things into Snowflake when you&#39;re charging them $23-40/TB for storage. They&#39;d be paying 2-3.5x your storage costs just to load the data into your system!&#34; Yes, I&#39;m sure that Snowflake does get a discount from AWS, but having less negotiating power can make discounts smaller.There are other reasons to want a third party to use AWS if you&#39;re on AWS. Still, the egress pricing seems to make it very hard for third-party tech providers not to use AWS if their customers are using it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Working in realtime games that require high bandwidth usage, AWS and basically every other public cloud is fundamentally unusable for us because of this exact problem. Our bare metal infrastructure for the Hypixel Minecraft network uses 3-4PB per month, so we simply lease a 100gbps transit link billed at 95th percentile.Last I checked, AWS wanted ~$200k per MONTH, for just bandwidth (no compute, memory, storage, or anything else). We&#39;d love to be able to use the cloud, but not at the cost of increasing our monthly expenses by an entire order of magnitude, so we just stick to bare metal colocation.I honestly believe that if you have the technical skill in-house, and are spending more than, say, $30k/mo on public cloud hosting, that you should seriously evaluate whether bare metal could significantly decrease your costs."</p>

I wonder if it is because Cloudflare has data transfer agreements with GCP, Azure, and Alibaba! But that would mean this is a shoddy hit piece to strong arm AWS into an agreement with them. Nonsense, I&#39;m sure Cloudflare would never do that...Edit: I&#39;ve removed claims about Cloudfront&#39;s pricing since it isn&#39;t actually clear what they charge for egress and seems to vary on a number of factors.

Probably that doesn&#39;t matter for the exports though since the paper and original version are both there.More interesting thing is that they&#39;ve been making the dataset available [3] for $20 (even before BirdNet).

I am sincerely sorry that this was the case. No offense was meant.@peteretep, you have my sincere apology. It was a flippant remark. At the time I wrote it (mid-1990s), Perl was the best way to write portable server-side code. I took the time to learn it, and got fairly good at it.
Since then, I have found my muse in other languages, but I sincerely did not want to give offense. I doubt that deleting the comment would help."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In university, I learned Perl out of curiousity. It was the first scripting language I tried; I was only familiar with Java, C and Scheme at the time.After reading Programming Perl from cover-to-cover, I suddenly felt like I had superpowers. I probably would have felt the same if I&#39;d taken the time to learn bash scripting, but that&#39;s not how it worked out.I tried to automate everything in my life with Perl. I&#39;d walk to class in the morning and a script had already scraped and downloaded my lecture materials and sent a print job for me. It emailed me if it couldn&#39;t find notes for one of my scheduled classes. Others would manage my assignment submissions. I wrote scrapers to detect what events on campus might offer free food.This was the first time I felt like I could write programs that actually had the power to improve my life. It changed my perspective on what I had the power to do as a programmer. I&#39;ll always be grateful to Perl for that.I also learned how to quickly develop a thick programmer skin by asking questions on comp.lang.perl, but that&#39;s another topic altogether."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Syncthing is one of the &#34;fire and forget&#34; kind of programs. It takes some time to setup when doing for first time, but then you pretty much forget its there, and when you need it, you realise it has been chugging along doing its job.Two things I like about it in particular, are1. It can and favors syncing over local network. This has a huge cost savings in developing world. Even when you do have massive bandwidth, local network sync still has more throughput and lower latency. My music is shared between devices and if I add a track, it takes less than a second to appear on my other devices.2. You can set conditions, such that delets can be ignored. Eg. I have a WhatsApp message+media backup going back almost 7 years now, ~65GiB. But I don&#39;t need all that on my phone. So I just disable syncing delets on my storage. Now my phone can get away with ~3 GiB of whatsapp data (only because I don&#39;t delete very often) and I still have complete backup in case I need it.3. Absolute rock solid stable. At $DAYJOB we use syncthing to sync multi dozen GiBs of new data every day, total file count in 10s of thousands in about ~300 directories. And in past 5 years we have had about 3 instances where we had something that needed attention, out of which 2 were not syncthing&#39;s fault.I&#39;ve been using Syncthing for years and have absolutely zero complaints against it. Everyone with 2 or more devices should give it a try, just to see there are better options out there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using Syncthing for years now, between ~10 Linux servers, Linux desktops, Linux and Windows laptops and Android smartphones, over LAN, wired and wireless Internet.I&#39;m synchronizing less than 100 MiB of data, but it&#39;s changing all the time. I&#39;ve not yet had a single issue with it. I&#39;ve a few conflicts every week when the same file is changed in different locations at the same time, but Syncthing keeps all versions of a file until I resolve the conflicts; I can&#39;t see how it could handle that better.Long story short: I highly recommend this tool."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On of my favorite program, and it keeps getting better.You can even set an encryption key per share, and if you want to use an untrusted device in your nodes, you can simply not provide it with the encryption key and it will simply synchronize the encrypted payload across nodes.So if you have a shady/cheapo VPS, you can use its storage without worrying about the plaintext data being stored there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fantastic blog post. I highly recommend reading it in full, and also checking out the work of the European Spreadsheet Risks Group, and Felienne Hermans specifically (referenced in the original post). I&#39;ve been working on a spreadsheet startup [1] for the past 8 months or so and those folks have a large amount of absolutely upsetting-but-helpful research on spreadsheet usage/errors.After the past few years working with spreadsheet power users, here&#39;s how I like to think about them:
1. Most spreadsheets are just used a lists/trackers [2].
2. Some spreadsheets are very calculation heavy, and are better understood as complex software projects (usually modeling something; s/o to those PE mfs) than as anything else.
3. Spreadsheets make the transition between (simple list/tracker) and (complex software project very fluid. This flexibility usually means that the (complex software project) that is created is buggy as hell.Spreadsheets give not-super-technical users an incredible visibility into their data. Spreadsheets give not-super-technical users a way to program data transformations in what I would argue is the most generally intuitive way that exists. Spreadsheets give not-super-technical users tools to build software without introducing them to proper software development methods. Ya know, like maybe a test. Or a code review. Or no global variables. Etc.If you want to see how we&#39;re attacking the spreadsheet problem, check us out. Feedback highly appreciated! [1][1] https://trymito.io/hn

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#39;000s of rows of data in a spreadsheet - sigh. But say &#39;database&#39; to some people and they hear &#39;The Devil&#39;.Excel is a glorious tool which welcomes all, the savvy and the unskilled but imaginative newbies alike. There is something about all those little cells that presents an itch everyone wants to scratch, and you just know that for some that scratching is going to produce something akin to a spreadsheet version of gangrenous melanoma.On the other hand, some people are happy to say that the complexity of sophisticated Excel models means they would have been better off built in a code interface. Ha ha ha!Even with the right mix of functional and object-oriented code and suitable documentation and version control applied to code, I respectfully disagree.Data handling capabilities could benefit from skill in all of these tools: error checking (including analytical review); pen &amp; paper; calculators; databases; spreadsheets; math &amp; stat techniques; Word processors (&amp; clear logical explanations).Together, they form a rich menagerie of tools which will probably all be around until we have an AI that follows us around and we just tell it what we want. Actually, even then, it would be good to know them so that we can grasp the underlying logic and frame the concepts leading to the actions that we ask the AI to assist with..."</p>

I had credits at large companies, posted talks online (interviewers rarely looked at them), but if I forgot how to write binary search in 10 minutes in an interview it didn’t matter.This actually made me realize being just an IC wasn’t actually my goal though. Once I started interviewing for management and sales, all of those things _really_ mattered. Now that I’m running workshops and talks professionally, posting publicly is _critical_.Moral of the story: if you enjoy posting in public and teaching in public, but you feel like its getting you nowhere career wise, maybe you are in the wrong career like I was. Once I decided to double down on my strengths and spent nights and weekends at public speaking training instead of grinding leetcode things started to click."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are two modes of hiring:1. General purpose: Typical FANG like where hire first and then do team matching later2. Targeted hiring: Companies want specific people and they try to recruit themA sizable number of top open-source contributors get recruited are in #2. Eg. 1) Top contributors in Rust lang hired by AWS. 2) FANG companies targeting top AI researchers from academia.One&#39;s open-source presence needs to be really prolific and the project has to make an large impact to be in #2 category.For #1 category folks, your public profile does not matter that much (atleast for FANG companies)Other way to think is #1 are treated as cattle, #2 are treated as pets.The famous incident where author of homebrew was rejected by a top company because he could not invert a binary tree got in the wrong channel (#1) to begin with where he was treated as a cattle.Note: Recruiter from FANG calling you still goes in #1 category for most people"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a few jobs interview recently. Here&#39;s what I got out of it:If you have something you want to promote (or is on your CV in general), be ready to talk about it. I&#39;m very lucky because I can talk about things on the spot very easily. If that&#39;s not you, make a list of the few main points that you want to talk about and try to memorize it. If you always get the same questions, it may be a good idea to address them before people even ask them, or to memorize an answer to them too.I really underestimate the amount of stress that can be felt when you&#39;re alone facing 6 people for a job that you want. I don&#39;t have a good answer on how to handle it, although I think having my canned answer ready helped. It got better once this started to be a conversation. The good part is that I developed a lot of empathy for people that talk about interview stress.It&#39;s going to be my first &#34;real&#34; job so these are probably obvious, but it might help someone so I&#39;d rather share."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Deploying k8s has gotten a lot easier these days -- some alternatives in this space:- https://docs.k0sproject.io (https://github.com/k0sproject/k0s)- https://k3s.io (https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/)k0s is my personal favorite and what I run, the decisions they have made align very well with how I want to run my clusters versus k3s which is similar but slightly different. Of course you also can&#39;t go wrong with kubeadm[0][1] -- it was good enough to use minimally (as in you could imagine sprinkling a tiny bit of ansible and maintaining a cluster easily) years ago, and has only gotten better.[0]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/[1]: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubeadm"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried a few incarnations of self-hosted k8s a few years ago, and the biggest problem I had was persistent storage. If you are using a cloud service they will integrate k8s into whatever persistent storage they offer, but if you are self-hosting you are left on your own, it seems most people end up using something like nfs or hostPath - but that ends up being a single point of failure. Have there been any developments on this recently, aimed at people wanted to run k8s on a few RaspberryPi nodes?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"(Full disclaimer - I&#39;m an engineer at Talos, but I believe it&#39;s pretty relevant here)If folks are interested in this kind of K8s deployment, they might also be interested at what we&#39;re doing at Talos (https://talos.dev). We have full support for all of these same environments (we have a great community of k8s-at-home folks running with Raspberry Pis) and a bunch of tooling to make bare metal easier with Cluster API. You can also do the minikube type of thing by running Talos directly in Docker or QEMU with `talosctl`.Talos works with an API instead of SSH/Bash, so there&#39;s some interesting things about ease of use when operating K8s that are baked in like built-in etcd backup/restore, k8s upgrades, etc.We&#39;re also right in the middle of building out our next release that will have native Wireguard functionality and enable truly hybrid K8s clusters. This should be a big deal for edge deployments and we&#39;re super excited about it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Makes sense. The end state appears to be that humans should only be supervising ML that generates goal and outcome based behaviors for robots, and the machines will construct tools to solve problems themselves.The leap from an AI model learning how to replicate a behaviour (e.g. evolving walking to solve problems https://unitylist.com/p/2id/walking-ai ) to reasoning about it in terms of actuators and physical feedback, to assembling a physical model out of a relatively small list of parts seems like a solvable engineering problem when it is broken out into a pipeline.Those robot parts are basically a version of mechano with actuators that a model would map a behavior to, and the robots in the article would assemble them. When you look at something like Lego or Mechano as an intermediate representation to construct buildings out of, where all objects made from it are essentially a directed graph of those elements, robots designing and building robots seems like less than 20 years away.e.g. we could functionally specify to an ML model, &#34;produce a digraph of these element parts that has these degrees of freedom, and then load or derive a model that solves for this outcome within the domain of those degrees, where outcome is &#39;plug cables into a board&#39; &#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s sort of mentioned, but not emphasized in this review that connection dropouts happen every few minutes for a few seconds. That makes starlink fine for any kind of asynchronous content like web browsing, torrenting or video streaming, but unusable for video calls, stream hosting, voip, or online gaming. It&#39;s implied that this is due to the trees obstructing a full view of the sky, but I have actually heard these connection dropouts are just about universal due to the constellation not having enough infill. Just a warning that for most of us we are still several hundred satellites short and some connection handoff updates away from this being a useful internet connection.I have a property where Starlink would be perfect and I would pay triple the price to be able to do zoom calls over the connection."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve had Starlink for about 6 months and it is a massive improvement on upload speed at 10-25 Mb. Download speed is a mixed bag wildly oscillating from 5 to 100 Mb and back. It&#39;s okay for downloading things but it&#39;s terrible for any sort of video conferencing. There are brief dropouts on average every 6 minutes or so and my obstruction map is better than the author&#39;s. My neighbor up the street got slightly better service by mounting his dishy on a 20-ft antenna pole above his house.Local ground service is 20 Mb download and 2 Mb upload. And that&#39;s just barely sufficient for watching streaming video and video conferencing. Gigabit service is but a mile and a half away but no one is going to pay to lay the fiber into our neighborhood. So the last mile and a half is copper from 20 years ago. I think that&#39;s going to require political will to fix and I don&#39;t think that political will exists right now nor will it in the near future. We could have paid $5,000 per house to lay it ourself but our own neighborhood couldn&#39;t come to consensus on that. Now imagine that at a national level.So if they just deliver 100/100 within a year or two, this is an epic win IMO and I will cancel ground service. And if they don&#39;t someone else will so I&#39;m not worried. But it took Teslas to spark the electric vehicle industry. Now there&#39;s a lot of choice. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if something similar happens here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m typing this message from Starlink. For me it&#39;s absolutely transformative; 10x the bandwidth I can get from any other source and very reliable.Except for outages related to obstructions. That&#39;s a real problem and the author&#39;s situation is not good. There&#39;s ways to work around it on your property; a taller mount, a tree install, cutting some trees. But ultimately Dishy needs a clear view to the north and there&#39;s no getting around it.I have some smaller obstructions for my install and it was a little annoying but fine. But in the past week or two it&#39;s gotten way better: my packet loss went from 2% to 0.6%. Details here: https://nelsonslog.wordpress.com/2021/07/20/starlink-improve..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article doesn&#39;t mention it - and I can&#39;t find it anywhere - but in any neighborhood what is the highest proportion of units that are short-term rentals. Five percent? Ten percent in the super touristy areas? I have no idea and even before the other flaws in the study I am skeptical than anything short of 20% would make an impact on any major attribute of an area.I see one stat in the paper that &#34;40% of buildings had airbnb listings in some tracts&#34; but if the buildings had 10 units in them each this still may mean a relatively small number of total listings were from Airbnbs. In fact, even in Boston there are some tracts where I suppose that the average building must have 30+ units which would meant that if 60% of buildings had no listing the total percentage of listings that are Airbnbs is relatively small.&gt;higher levels of violent crime did not appear immediately after Airbnb listings became available to tourists, but rather developed over the course of several years, the researchers said.Alternative theory. Every area had some Airbnbs. In neighborhoods that were being wealthier/more popular/had more jobs decided it was easier to just do long-term rentals. In areas where landlords had trouble renting them out to anyone long-term (because locals know if a neighborhood is nice or not) they turned more units into Airbnbs because outsiders don&#39;t know/don&#39;t care."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sigh. This appears to be one of those cases of media exaggeration for eyeballs. The study says:&gt; the effect on violence was only consistent visible for the measure of Airbnb penetration–or the extent to which buildings in the neighborhood have one or more listings (and for the measure of density, or the listings per household in the two-year lags). It was never present for overall usage, or the estimated quantity of Airbnb guestsAnd&gt; A second and related concern could be the potential bias due to omitted variables. Though the DID models control for the initial conditions of neighborhoods, they do not necessarily control for trends in these variables that parallel the increases in both Airbnb presence and crime. For example, there is some evidence that gentrifying neighborhoods experience increases in certain types of crimeAnd&gt; we have tested this hypothesis in a single citySo there&#39;s apparently a correlation between a single metric and a single class of crime in a single city, and there&#39;s a multi-year delay in the effect. The author speculates that erosion of social fabric is the culprit, but doesn&#39;t actually back this theory up with either data or references. One would at least expect some references to some other study about the correlations on emigration and violence (my two cents here is that it feels more likely that the former is caused by the latter, if a correlation exists at all). They even acknowledge that the correlation could be due to a factor that isn&#39;t being accounted for.But then the article writer drops all nuance and blasts a title pegging blame squarely on AirBnB, even though it isn&#39;t even established that correlation is consistently true everywhere, let alone causation.I mean, yeah, I get that people don&#39;t like predatory real estate renting, and want to hear that there&#39;s a neatly convenient evil entity to blame, but come on now."</p>

It&#39;s like they think it&#39;s 1995 and MeToo never happened.In the suit, the state even attempted a mediated resolution to prevent it from going to court. But Blizzard refused to cooperate, essentially taunting the state to bring a case, which they now have.It really makes you question whether Bobby Kotick is the right guy as CEO.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Blizzard&#39;s full response: &#34;The DFEH includes distorted, and in many cases false, descriptions of Blizzard’s past. We have been extremely cooperative with the DFEH throughout their investigation, including providing them with extensive data and ample documentation, but they refused to inform us what issues they perceived. They were required by law to adequately investigate and to have good faith discussions with us to better understand and to resolve any claims or concerns before going to litigation, but they failed to do so. Instead, they rushed to file an inaccurate complaint, as we will demonstrate in court. We are sickened by the reprehensible conduct of the DFEH to drag into the complaint the tragic suicide of an employee whose passing has no bearing whatsoever on this case and with no regard for her grieving family. While we find this behavior to be disgraceful and unprofessional, it is unfortunately an example of how they have conducted themselves throughout the course of their investigation. It is this type of irresponsible behavior from unaccountable State bureaucrats that are driving many of the State’s best businesses out of California.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Story time!I grew up in eastern Europe in the communist era, in a country where entire factories were run using Commodore 64 computers that were smuggled in, bypassing export controls and sanctions.The programmer at one such factory was a friend of my father, and we&#39;d go over to his place for dinner semi-regularly. He didn&#39;t have kids, and I was six, so I was bored to tears. No toys and nobody my age to play with!He did have a C64, which was the only other one in town apart from the one at the factory. He was using it to practice programming after-hours at home. There were no games on it, but he did have a book of games.As in: a literal printed book of the source code for several simple games. That you were supposed to type in to be able to play!So I did. I had nothing else to do, so I whiled away the hours while the adults chatted poking away at the keyboard, typing in the BASIC code of the shortest, simplest game first.It didn&#39;t work at first. There were some errors. With help, I fixed the typos, and hey presto, the game worked! I still remember the elation, the feeling of accomplishment after all that work. I didn&#39;t even play the game for more than a minute or so, I immediately got to work on entering the next, longer game&#39;s code. I was hooked.Eventually I tried all three or four of the games in the book, and got bored. However, I was allowed to borrow the BASIC introductory problem set book, which I took back home with me to study. I solved the problems one at a time on grid paper (to match the fixed-width screen layout). I &#34;ran&#34; the programs in my head, debugged them by working out the variable values step by step on paper, and then tested my solutions on the real C64 computer whenever my parents went over for a social dinner. Most of my programs worked, and ran at ludicrous speed compared to the glacial pen &amp; paper solutions I had worked out. I instantly understood that Computers were levers for the mind. Learning to control that raw power was intoxicating.We fled across the iron curtain as political refugees, and I took that textbook with me. I had no access to computers for nearly a year, but when we finally got settled permanently in the West my dad bought a used C64 at a garage sale for a few dollars. This was a computer that back in my homeland would be the carefully guarded control hub of a factory. Here it was a discarded plaything. Even at that age, that blew my mind.I learned more programming languages in quick succession. Pascal at the age of 11, C and Assembly at 12, C++ at 13. I had written 3D engines by the time I went to University.Statistically, if you know programming, you probably learned it in a tertiary education setting, most likely in your late teens or early twenties. Just like learning a foreign language at that age, you&#39;ll never be perfectly fluent. You&#39;ll always have an accent, no matter what you do.To me, programming is my mother tongue. I&#39;m perfectly fluent and unaccented. You probably can&#39;t even tell, you can&#39;t hear the difference.Programming for you is something you do at work.I&#39;ve had dreams in C++"</p>

One of the biggest German healthcare contractors - famous for terrible code - had managed to creep their S/MIME demo implementation derivative code as a standard for secure communication in the healthcare world. With a MITM at each Kassenaerztliche Vereinigung(i.e. the people that represent the doctors and that charge ~2% per transaction for charging the public insurance companies). So it&#39;s unaudited &#34;E2E&#34; with a MITM by design. Given the complexity of this codebase, I do hope that they just use it unmodified.EDIT: one of the reasons why the KVs rolls/ed their own is because of inherent distrust between the physicians or the institution representing them and the governments health ministry getting that data. They believe that the government is incentivizing hospitals to take over physicians share of the cake.

That&#39;s complete with running DB migrations in a sane way, updating public DNS records, SSL certs, CI / CD, having live-preview pull requests that get deployed to a sub-domain, zero downtime deployments and more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a Kubernetes outsider, I get confused why so much new jargon had to be introduced. As well as so many little new projects coupled to Kubernetes with varying degrees of interoperability. It makes it hard to get a grip on what Kube really is for newcomers.It also has all the hallmarks of a high-churn product where you need to piece together your solution from a variety of lower-quality information sources (tutorials, QA sites) rather than a single source of foolproof documentation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So the basic problem with *nix is its permission model.  If we had truly separable security/privilege/resource domains then Linux wouldn&#39;t have needed containers and simple processes and threads could have sufficed in place of Borg/docker/Kubernetes.There&#39;s a simpler and more powerful security model; capabilities.  Capabilities fix 90% of the problems with *nix.There&#39;s currently no simple resource model.  Everything is an ad-hoc human-driven heuristic for allocating resources to processes and threads, and is a really difficult problem to solve formally because it has to go beyond algorithmic complexity and care about the constant factors as well.The other *nix problem is &#34;files&#34;.  Files were a compromise between usability and precision but very few things are merely files.  Devices and sockets sure aren&#39;t.  There&#39;s a reason the &#39;file&#39; utility exists; nothing is really just a file.  Text files are actually text files + a context-free grammar (hopefully) and parser somewhere, or they&#39;re human-readable text (but probably with markup, so again a parser somewhere).Plenty of object models have come and gone; they haven&#39;t simplified computers (much less distributed computers), so we&#39;ll need some theory more powerful than anything we&#39;ve had in the past to express relationships between computation, storage, networks, and identities."</p>

Compared to my former colleagues, I&#39;m an infant in this area, so take this with a heaping of salt.In general, I think the author&#39;s cynicism about productivity research is justified, but I think it could have been directed more productively. (NB: the following comments say nothing about areas of software engineering research outside of productivity.)Commercial software engineering is a creative endeavor; it is not a science, nor is it a manufacturing process. It does not have natural, universal laws. What makes a team &#39;productive&#39; varies massively based on constraints imposed by business model, product, customer expectations, leadership values, and of course the individuals of which it consists.I do not believe in the possibility of a &#34;General Theory of Productivity.&#34; I&#39;m highly skeptical of attempts to quantify the precise relationship between error discovery stage and cost in a way that is generalizable, although I think it might be possible given a large group of engineers using a highly homogenous process, tools, and accounting. Google is pretty close to this (common dev infrastructure across tens of thousands of engineers), and even across Google this kind of generalization would be extremely difficult.There is no universal physics of software engineering. As a result, academic research into productivity can be difficult to generalize (which is why, I think, you often see researchers twisting themselves into knots). Instead, my rec is to focus on a few key metrics that are aligned with your business&#39; or team&#39;s goals (search for DORA for a good starting set) and to reflect often on what you feel makes your team work well and what doesn&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was reading this thesis the other day[0], which is on precision machine design. It got me comparing precision machine design to  software engineering.A big part of why we&#39;re able to design extremely precise machines (the author worked on a lathe used for machining optical parts for the National Ignition Facility) is because we can characterize exactly where errors will come from (e.g. structure isn&#39;t rigid enough, temperature variation causes parts to expand by different amounts, parts not round or flat enough, etc.). Once we know what errors we need to control and their rough order of importance we can start improving the machine design to control them better.In theory, something similar could be done in software engineering (formal methods are part of this, but not a full solution). Rather than an error budget, you&#39;d have some sort of bug budget, where you tracked what sort of bugs were caused by what sort of constructs, and design your program in such a way to minimize their chance of being introduced. I&#39;ve never heard of anyone except Dan Bernstein[1] actually doing anything approximating this. Probably because the perceived level of effort is too high.I actually don&#39;t think it would take that much effort, but it would require quite a bit of organization to track where bugs are introduced and what their root causes are. This is probably why Bernstein, an individual, is able to do this, while no large team (that I&#39;m aware of) has done anything similar.Of course, just like your toaster doesn&#39;t need to use precision machine design techniques (an over-engineered toaster is a bad toaster), most software doesn&#39;t need the effort/expense of a rigorous design process either, but some would benefit from it.[0]: https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/9414[1]: https://cr.yp.to/djb.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I went into this software engineering productivity research rabbit hole a decade ago and came away similarly depressed with the lack of rigor in our field.What I’ve come to believe:- Software engineering is not an engineering discipline, it is a craft. It may or may not one day become an engineering discipline, I find this impossible to tell.- The difference between a feature and a bug is largely one of semantics, not of substance. A defect is a mismatch between expected behavior and actual behavior. A bug is when the expectation was that of the programmer that wrote the code. A feature request is when the expectation was that of a user. There is no real difference for the user between a missing feature and a broken feature. Hence why we so often get side-tracked into fruitless “bug or feature” discussions and why users don’t care when we say it is by design.- Errors will happen. People are flawed and produce errors at a more or less set average rate for each person (unless they’re tired or enjoying a ballmer peak). Errors in every step of the process, from design to deployment, are inevitable. We can however catch these inevitable errors, with automated error detection tools, or by having a fresh set of eyes look at the work. The consequence is that making high quality software necessitates taking a look at the whole process and introducing error detection steps in every part of it, whether they be automated like linters and unit tests, or human like design and code review or mentoring and pair programming.- Errors in design are more costly because they cause entire features to need to be written or rewritten, which is the most costly kind of defect to resolve. We do not need research to know this to be true. We solve this by having short feedback loops with real users, which is the only real form of agile development."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"See the section titled “What the Magnuson-Moss Act Does Not Require” of the FTC’s “Businessperson’s Guide to Federal Warranty Law”[1] to understand why this is not even close to “enforcing right to repair”. Aside from the fact that the FTC can’t enforce a right to repair law that doesn’t exist, the promise to enforce the Magnuson-Moss Act doesn’t even scratch the surface of what right to repair aims to accomplish. For example, farmers who have famously campaigned for right to repair for years (decades?) aren’t covered by the Act because their equipment is for commercial, not consumer, use.Edit: Even though I think it’s beyond ridiculous to paint this as “right to repair” I am absolutely going to report Microsoft’s Xbox to the FTC for their egregious Magnuson-Moss violations. Maybe that stupid sticker will finally disappear.[1]https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/bus..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;First, the Commission urges the public to submit complaints and provide other information to aid 
in greater enforcement of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act and its implementing regulations. 
While current law does not provide for civil penalties or redress, the Commission will consider 
filing suit against violators of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act to seek appropriate injunctive 
relief.&#34;&#34;Second, the Commission will scrutinize repair restrictions for violations of the antitrust laws. For 
example, certain repair restrictions may constitute tying arrangements or monopolistic 
practices—such as refusals to deal, exclusive dealing, or exclusionary design—that violate the 
Sherman Act.8 Violations of the Sherman Act also violate the prohibition on unfair methods of 
competition codified in Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. &#34;We&#39;ve had these laws on the books for a long time. I&#39;m not confident that they&#39;re going to be effectively applied, unless the FTC has significantly increased in size and capability recently."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I bombed an interview at a game company because I gave a right answer that I couldn&#39;t get them to understand.I don&#39;t remember the exact problem they wanted me to solve, but the answer involved a dynamic collection and they wanted it to grow with constant time complexity. They were probably looking for a linked list. But I said I&#39;d use a dynamic array because those have constant time when averaged over a series of appends.I don&#39;t know if I remembered the term &#34;amortized complexity&#34; or not, but it was clear that they had never heard of doing amortized analysis across a series of operations and they absolutely did not get my answer. They got hung up on the idea that some appends force the array to grow and get copied. I tried to explain that that was only true for a predictable fraction of them, but they were stuck on the idea that this meant dynamic arrays had O(n) worst case performance. They clearly thought I didn&#39;t know what the hell I was talking about.I&#39;m pretty sure that was the point where they decided to pass on me.But now I&#39;m a senior software engineer at Google and I just finished writing a textbook that explains dynamic arrays including their amortized analysis, so joke&#39;s on them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can&#39;t really comment on whether that was the correct way to handle the situation, given that passing the interview was the goal. However, I would have a hard time giving an incorrect answer on purpose. I also consider an interview as an opportunity to learn about the company I&#39;m going to work for, and especially my future colleagues.I would probably try to give a full answer, such as &#34;there&#39;s a widely-held concept X, but my understanding is that this is not completely correct, and in fact a better model is Y.&#34; A technical lead that can&#39;t work with an answer like that is one I probably don&#39;t want to work with."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s not a lot of context given about the behaviors exhibited in this interview, but as many others here have said, red flags abound in this anecdote.&gt; But the problem was, that this guys manager was sitting next to him. If he didn’t know, I would totally humiliate him in front of his boss. So either he would stick to his guns and refuse the correctness of my answer, to save face. Or he needed to agree that he was wrong, and lose face.I would love to ask the author if their team lead ever confirmed these suspicions. I would doubt it, but happy to amend my position if wrong. Regardless, to me this sounds like the exact type of culture I wouldn&#39;t want a new hire bringing in. I don&#39;t need to be managed or protected, especially from my own manager. I need honest answers, not what I want to hear. I wasn&#39;t in the room, I can&#39;t read the vibes like the author did, but I&#39;ll consider the omissions here telling-- there&#39;s no description of an anxious or frazzled team lead, or an imperious manager peering down. It seems like the only thing the author saved the team lead from were problems in their own head."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The other peril of M1 ownership is the lack of alternative operating systems. The other way I reinstalled an older Macbook through &#34;internet recovery&#34; and it downloaded the version it was originally shipped with - macOS Mojave.The UI was a breath of fresh air compared to Big Sur. Despite the screen being smaller than my M1 the information density was higher and it felt more like a tool than a toy. The lack of bullshit apps such as Apple TV, News &amp; co and useless &#34;widgets&#34; was also good (for all of iTunes&#39; flaws, it&#39;s still better than its modern successors), and it somehow felt faster despite being less than half the processing power of the M1.I now wish I could run this on my M1 but alas I can&#39;t. At least with PCs and older Macs you could always switch to Windows or Linux, but with the M1 you&#39;re currently screwed - if Apple drops the ball or decides to take their OS in a direction you don&#39;t like you currently have no alternative (and all the &#34;security&#34; around locking out the user from their own machine doesn&#39;t bode well for alternative OSes)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow I&#39;m so happy I&#39;m moving away from Mac administration. I currently manage a big userbase but we still don&#39;t have M1s in our environment as our antivirus solution (Cylance) is really slow in supporting it.Apple is introducing more and more mechanisms in the name of security but they keep access and information very close to their heart. All us Mac admins have struggled with SecureToken in combination with AD accounts and it took two major releases for Apple to actually introduce a way for us to manage these properly through MDM. In the mean time most information had to be gathered through blogs such as this one.Another issue is that more and more enterprise management features are becoming dependent on managed (federated) Apple IDs. But Apple requires that the email and identifying account address (UPN) are the same which will never happen in our 200k user environment. So we&#39;re stuck with more and more things to work around.This is really something that should have been considered from the start. And this owner key thing sounds worse. Security is good but the end user or corporate admin should have the keys to every lock. Not just the vendor. Now my successor can deal with this stuff.I used to be a big fan of macOS personally too but I moved over to FreeBSD 2 years ago and I&#39;m glad I did. I really want an OS that answers to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems like these changes have good intentions (i.e. improved security), but introduce a lot of complexity that can have unintended consequences for end-users. This reminds me somewhat of my process setting up UEFI Secure Boot on my Windows PC that wasn&#39;t originally configured for it. Not in the exact steps, but in that there is a ton going on behind the scenes and the UX is horrendously bad.Unfortunately, vendors haven&#39;t really thought about how to explain these changes to end-users. They are trying to make them fairly transparent, which probably works at least 95% of the time, but for a small percentage of people, becomes a big PITA."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fire up the throwaway!Not 100% related to the article, but directly related.I worked as developer for a product in the same niche (&#34;democratizing adult content&#34;). I spent almost 2 years working on the frontend, devops, and building out the  analytics engine (all pre-covid).Anyway, on to the comment at hand.We had a small number of users compared to OnlyFans (when I left, there were about 20K active content creators). The average monthly payment was $5000 (skewed massively by the top 5%).We had phone support for our larger creator. One very common request was to instantly delete all data and stop processing future orders. Usually, the requester was in a pretty agitated/distraught state (I&#39;d occasionally get escalated calls to &#34;confirm&#34; that all data would be deleted ASAP and no copies would be kept).I spoke to a few of our creators and most would be desperate to scrub all of their content form the internet because:a) A parent/relative found out.b) A fellow employee at their 9-5 stumbled on their account.c) A &#39;fan&#39; went nuclear and was waging all out digital war. One creator had a former subscriber sending data dumps to all their Facebook and Instagram friends (they also spammed every public email address at their &#39;normal&#39; workplace, which was a local government).We would occasionally get demanding letters requesting the removal of content from third party sites (Pornhub, Reddit, etc). The creators would somehow be surprised when they realised we couldn&#39;t remove content from other websites.The experience was very depressing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So our kids are getting older so I&#39;ve been paying more attention to popular social networks and it&#39;s wild how many YouTubers, Twitch&#39;ers, TikTok&#39;ers, Instagram&#39;ers have OF content directly linked from their non-porn bios.I don&#39;t like it, but I&#39;m not sure what a good solution is. I mean, people are free to do what they&#39;d like, but it&#39;s hard to police screen time 100% of the time and their peer group has a lot more access than they do so even if I can block it 100$ they&#39;ll be exposed to it somewhere else.

They have a business model, that is perfected to extract as much money from whales as possible.  Performers appear to have ‘relationships’ with their subscribers, encourage them to tip, buy ‘customs’, and ‘engage’ with them.These sad lonely sexless men spend all their money on this shit.  It consumes them, until they are out of money, then it destroys them.  It warps their expectations of relationships further impacting their datability, driving them even more towards onlyfans.Now, this is only a minority of their users, but makes a large proportion of their revenue.  For healthy people, only fans can be great."</p>

I don&#39;t know how often I encounter a lot of the stuff the author seems to consider &#34;fundamentals.&#34;I have spent a good part of my life doing things like device control, and direct, native, user interface. These can get mui hairy.It&#39;s difficult to talk to a lot of folks about these, as everyone is focused on &#34;the Big Picture,&#34; to quote Peter O&#39;Toole.Device control, in particular, has a lot of aspects that are unique, and not particularly applicable to many other disciplines. With the advent of some of the new communication techs, like Bluetooth, and advanced serial buses (like USB and Thunderbolt), we&#39;re starting to see a bit of cross-pollination with communications (another discipline that many software developers never need to worry about).UI has always been best served (not exclusive, but best), as native. This means that each platform tends to have a specific framework.Learning frameworks, SDKs, and APIs has always (for me) been the most time-consuming part of adapting to a platform or system.But that&#39;s just me.

The coding exams were done ON PAPER in a Pascal-flavored pseudo code.When I found and started reading those papers it was like finding life in another planet. It completely changed my way of thinking. I dropped out school and focused on learning as much of the cool stuff as possible (on the internet). It payed off well :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Since this is a long article, here’s a summary for fellow readers — it’s mostly about the negative side effects of meditation that the author believes is under-documented or under-reported due to the ‘hype’ of meditation as the 21st century cure-all. He talks about dissociative experiences (which is well documented in medical research), it being a pseudo-religion, and lastly, his belief that the extended use of meditation is the ‘opposite’ of stoicism in the way that it can render a person not less, but more susceptible to breakage from smaller stresses, like one of a traffic jam. He also attempts to make a biological argument on how this works by invoking something he calls the limbic system feedback loop, however I have found that argument unconvincing due to lack of any actual evidence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This terrain was fresh. I had never previously experienced a psychotic episode and have no history of mental illness besides occasional bouts of mild anxiety and depression.
...
&gt; Why did I start meditating? The short answer is that in 2009 I started a fist fight in a French Quarter bar over some jambalaya, a steamy kiss, and a stray comment I didn’t take fondly. The evening ended hours later after I broke a window with my fist, misplaced my shirt, and guzzled about 16 bottles of Miller High Life.YYMMV, but I feel the author is having problems they dont want to really accept.  That is what the contradiction in the two quotes above indicates.Aside from that, I couldn&#39;t help but think about people having access to too many psychedelics.  For a while, tripping can give you the most profound experiences ever.  But after a while, it sort of becomes mondane, and this is when the bad trip probability suddenly skyrockets.  Or, put another way, even Siddhartha didn&#39;t find awakening in the samana practices.  They were only the first step (of three) to reach his goal.  You can overdo everything, even the very very nice things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ha! I thought it might have been vipassana.  My own experience of this (a 10 day silent retreat, not having done meditation before) was a full blown manic-psychotic experience (never having had any such thing before, nor in family history). If you&#39;re interested, I made some audio files [0] talking about what happened.I honestly think it&#39;s _insane_ that they (vipassana) will take regular people who haven&#39;t done meditation and allow them to do a 10 day silent retreat. I honestly think it&#39;s like taking a regular person and allowing them to go down a grade 4 or 5 river. They might make it, but they might get seriously hurt too.I actually raised this point with the local (New Zealand) health and disability ombudsman. I said that vipassana ought to have a psychologist to assess people as they left, or at least _something_ like that. Nothing changed as far as I am aware.I hope the author continues to get better. It was a long journey for me.[0]. http://livingvipassana.blogspot.com/2010/02/bipolar-chronicl..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing that many people (including myself at times) are prone to is an irrational fear that their idea will be stolen. This wouldn’t be such a big deal if this fear didn’t cause people to repeatedly shoot themselves in the foot. Countless ideas never got off the ground because the innovator refused to talk to investors or partners without an NDA or withheld important details.By far the biggest risk to any idea is that it never gets off the ground. It’s orders of magnitude more likely that you’ll get a zero outcome than anything else. Zero users. Zero adoption. Zero product.For anyone in this position, you’d be better off if the idea was stolen. Because at least you’ll be known as the original version of the thing that big tech ripped off. That’s almost certainly good for a few percent market share. Which is way better than zero."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Imagine if your spouse told you, “I have an idea for a delicious 10-course meal. You should spend the next few days researching each dish, buying the ingredients, testing different versions, preparing the final meal, and serving it plate by plate at a dinner party. We’ll split the credit 50/50.”This is brilliant. I am going to use this next time someone tells me they want to give me equity for building their entire product."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Many of them want a partner–they’ll be in charge of the idea, and I’ll execute it.Boy, does that sound familiar. In my experience, they&#39;ll also get most of the money and credit, and will plan to kick me to the curb, once it gets to alpha.&gt; I hate to break it to you, but your idea–any idea, really–is worthless. An idea only has value when it is executed, and it only has a lot of value when it’s executed well.And that &#34;executed well&#34; is important. I have seen so many promising ideas and systems destroyed by being written by &#34;lowest common denominator&#34; implementation talent."</p>

It&#39;s a free museum with a great restaurant, cool exhibits, a nice park across the street. Nearby is The Book Thing, a free book store. Also another (non-free) book &amp; record store, Normal&#39;s. And another, Urban Reads. And another bookstore/coffee shop, Bird in Hand. And a farmer&#39;s market. And a vegan restaurant. And the quirkiest diner ever, Papermoon. And a small rock venue. And a worker-owned co-op coffeeshop that President Obama visited. All in a four block radius.Dang, I miss Baltimore."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Also notable is the Broad Museum in Los Angeles. Their guards are also docents, so you are encouraged to talk to them about the art and ask them questions. After experiencing this more human interaction, it was a bit of a shock for me to go down the street to the Museum of Contemporary Art, where I asked a guard a question and they flat out rejected my asking, haha!Arts workers need to be paid well and also have enriching roles in the museums. And I don&#39;t think this sort of thing necessarily requires a 4-year degree or whatnot. I believe people are naturally curious, and we need to lean into that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is peculiar because it treats security guards as humans and challenges unspoken hierarchy. It also implies the museum doesn&#39;t save on security (17 guards is a lot) and there isn&#39;t a big turnover (unless there&#39;s a special type of security guard that mostly works in museums). It&#39;s borderline unthinkable in the 5th roundest country in the world where I live. They would hire students.I was hoping it would be more about burglaries, stealing famous works of arts, selling stolen works etc. The law enforcement / security perspective. Instead it appears to be a pretty standard exhibition except with an unusual method of selecting curators."</p>

Go through the documentation&#39;s getting started guide while following along4. Immediately start building something with the new thingTreat everything beyond this as question driven development[0] or basically JIT (just in time) learning.For context the first 3 steps are usually no more than a weekend or a few days.I do this loop all the time and it hasn&#39;t really failed yet for learning all sorts of things (5+ programming languages, a bunch of stuff about Linux, Ansible, Docker, Vim, Terraform, Kubernetes, video production, and the list goes on). These are learning things very quickly at a level where you can comfortably bill out freelance work or get employed.[0]: https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/learning-a-new-web-framework-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; If you only follow guided resources, you&#39;ll wind up in tutorial hell.I disagree very strongly here. You can wind up in tutorial hell if you only read surface level small to medium sized posts.My &#34;career superpower&#34; is that I&#39;m always working my way through one textbook or another. You get serious depth this way and avoid getting stuck with a surface level understanding. Plus, with depth you can end up with really strong fundamentals, which make learning the next thing that much easier.I know a lot of people who read tons of blog posts on topics but never crack open a textbook, or people who watch youtubers explain academic papers yet never open up the actual paper.Maybe my &#34;learn stuff quickly&#34; trick is... don&#39;t. Spend a decade accumulating deep knowledge slowly, and it&#39;ll add up.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;With software development, though, mistakes are free! If we make a mistake, we can tab back to our editor, change the code, and try again. We even have helpful error messages that can (sometimes) point us in the right direction. This is an incredible luxury, and not one that we take advantage of enough.&#34;This is definitely very underrated and partly why I think computer science education is still sort of broken in some universities. Trial and error should be embraced as a a part of the process of building things. But instead, many curriculums in universities use exams to test your knowledge without any sort of debugger or console. You just have to go off of what you know, getting things as close to correct as you can in the first pass.All evaluations in CS should surround some type of project based work, it&#39;s a huge luxury other fields don&#39;t have. Students studying architecture or mechanical engineering, for example, simply can&#39;t build a functioning bridge as a test due to the cost of raw materials and how fatal an error may be (that would be really cool though). It&#39;s an advantage that we literally can build the bridge equivalent as a project in the CS world."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think some businesses are going out of businesses because they stubbornly refuse to raise their wages.In the vacation community where I live, there are two grocery/delis about a mile apart from each other. One is at a marina, the other is at a beach. They have almost the same business offering. Traditionally, both are fully mobbed during the sunny seasons.Two weeks ago, I visited the one I usually go to -- at the marina. They had a sign at the front door, &#34;Due to the labor shortage...&#34; and they weren&#39;t operating their deli counter. No sandwiches. When I sent inside, it was empty. No customers. The one employee at the register was on their phone. Nothing going on. A couple of people pulled up in their cars, read the sign, pulled out and left immediately.Drove up the road a mile to the other one. No sign -- it was busy like it usually was. Full house, busy counters and registers.My son asked me why the other place wouldn&#39;t just raise their wages.. I couldn&#39;t answer, but I guessed it was more on a matter of principle than calculated reality. There&#39;s no way they were surviving or thriving. I joked that maybe the owner was an old cahoot who remembered when a soda was $0.05 and there was no way they were going to raise their hourly wages to $15 or more."</p>

Flight attendants, park rangers, government clerks, the anecdotes are everywhere, in whispers and on social media.A good friend of mine is a doctor and he has a hair-raising story for me nearly every day, often indistinguishable from fast food customers’ behavior. I’m trying to get him to retire before he gets shot by somebody who was told they’d have to wait 3 days for an appointment.What’s going on?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just the other day I suggested using a yubikey, and someone linked me to the Titan sidechannel where researchers demonstrated that, with persistent access, and a dozen hours of work, they could break the guarantees of a Titan chip[0]. They said &#34;an attacker will just steal it&#34;. The researchers, on the other hand, stressed how very fundamentally difficult this was to pull off due to very limited attack surface.This is the sort of absolutism that is so pointless.At the same time, what&#39;s equally frustrating to me is defense without a threat model. &#34;We&#39;ll randomize this value so it&#39;s harder to guess&#34; without asking who&#39;s guessing, how often they can guess, how you&#39;ll randomize it, how you&#39;ll keep it a secret, etc. &#34;Defense in depth&#34; has become a nonsense term.The use of memory unsafe languages for parsing untrusted input is just wild. I&#39;m glad that I&#39;m working in a time where I can build all of my parsers and attack surface in Rust and just think way, way less about this.I&#39;ll also link this talk[1], for the millionth time.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article says that although &#34;you can&#39;t have perfect security,&#34; you can make it uneconomical to hack you. It&#39;s a good point, but it&#39;s not the whole story.The problem is that state-level actors don&#39;t just have a lot of money; they (and their decision makers) also put a much much lower value on their money than you do.I would never think to spend a million dollars on securing my home network (including other non-dollar costs like inconveniencing myself). Let&#39;s suppose that spending $1M would force the US NSA to spend $10M to hack into my home network. The people making that decision aren&#39;t spending $10M of their own money; they&#39;re spending $10M of the government&#39;s money. The NSA doesn&#39;t care about $10M in the same way that I care about $1M.As a result, securing yourself even against a dedicated attacker like Israel&#39;s NSO Group could cost way, way more than a simple budget analysis would imply. I&#39;d have to make the costs of hacking me so high that someone at NSO would say &#34;wait a minute, even we can&#39;t afford that!&#34;So, sure, &#34;good enough&#34; security is possible in principle, I think it&#39;s fair to say &#34;You probably can&#39;t afford good-enough security against state-level actors.&#34;"</p>

For instance, on Rust, trying to simply pass an usize (Rust&#39;s equivalent of size_t) to a function which expects an i32 (Rust&#39;s equivalent of int) will not compile; the programmer has to write &#34;size as i32&#34; (Rust&#39;s equivalent of &#34;(int) size&#34;), which makes it explicit that it might truncate the value at that point.(Some Rust developers argue that even &#34;size as i32&#34; should be avoided, and &#34;size.try_into()&#34; should be used instead, since it forces the programmer to treat an overflow explicitly at runtime, instead of silently wrapping.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t think the problem is with the &#34;lie&#34; that the innocent need not fear surveillance. Most people will agree that mass-surveillance will negatively affect some people that are indispensable to healthily functioning liberal society: journalists, activists, academics, public figures...The problem is that even if most people don&#39;t subscribe to the &#34;nothing to hide&#34; argument in general, they do not care about themselves being the target of surveillance.Having unsuccessfully tried to make family and acquaintances more aware of privacy issue, I can confidently say that the &#34;nothing to hide&#34; argument is nothing next to the &#34;I don&#39;t care&#34; attitude. It&#39;s not just being the target of a wrongful accusation, arguments about unintended public shaming, identity theft, negative economic consequences (higher insurance premium or mortgage rates if your bank has more information about you), none of it will work.I think there is some sort of a Tverskyan study to be done here about expected value and perceived risk. Overall for most people the equation is always: (probability of data being mishandled) * damage &lt; time and effort required to maintain my privacy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a fight we are only ever gonna lose.I.e. in Germany, I have seen wave after wave of surveillance passed. People try to fight back each time. Often the supreme court cancels the unconstitutional laws.But they always try again. And it only takes a football euro cup or Worldcup, or Olympic games or a natural catastrophy to provide the distraction for the public to pass another law.Our governments want to surveil us, and they will do it whether we like it or not.People only stand up and fight if the damage if the fight is smaller than the damage of what they are fighting against. We live comfortable, so we will take a lot of this type of immoral behaviour of our leaders. The figth will only start after enough innocent surveillance victims are harmed in the real world (i.e. their data is leaked or worse) and enough people have felt negative consequences of this surveillance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the fight against mass surveillance needs first to be lost in order to even start. Right now the average citizen has not witnessed an impact on his life and there&#39;s no shortage of other problems he has to deal with.I&#39;m not saying techies should just stay passive though. Special cases - journalists, activists, politically involved - need to be protected right now, and when the problem will be generally understood we need to have solutions ready for the average person: information, software, proposed legislation, etc."</p>

SIS filed a police report which said they had video evidence showing the perpetrator.They then put out a &#34;BOLO&#34; with the innocent man&#39;s name, had him arrested, figured out they have the wrong guy, do nothing about it and had him arrested again.When Bah appeared in court to answer charges and Apple was asked to present the video that would have cleared Bah, Apple claimed that the video had been deleted.  The video was later found by Bah&#39;s attorney during discovery.  This happened more than once.  A warrant was issued for Bah’s arrest and contained the photo of the imposter.  Bah was arrested even though the he doesn&#39;t resemble the imposter, other than being Black.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Apple then told the Suffolk County prosecutor &#34;that the video evidence of the impostor, which would have completely exculpated Ousmane Bah, had been routinely deleted.&#34;Why would anyone routinely delete evidence of crime instead of making a copy of it before it was deleted? What&#39;s the point of having surveillance equipment and footage if it&#39;s just routinely deleted even if there was a theft?&gt;The video from an October 2018 theft misattributed to Bah in Rockaway, New Jersey, was also deleted.Oh wow, again?&gt;And as it turned out, the video of the Boston incident turned up eventually – Bah&#39;s attorneys found it during the discovery process. It showed the impostor, not Bah.They should open a criminal investigation into what happened with the video. Intentionally accusing someone they know to be innocent, taking their time and freedom is completely inexcusable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;identified the individual as Ousmane Bah based on the examination of the temporary learner&#39;s permit he is said to have had on himSo essentially a kid stole another kids ID. Because the (thieving) kid had gotten in trouble with the same ID before it was also a match in the database.It does seem like a true failure but the headline makes it sound like this was an AI falsely accusing someone based on pure randomness. Even without the tech, the police would have had the name of the wrongly accused person because the security guard only had the fake/wrong ID and the person&#39;s ability to match faces was not great."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recently had the privilege of trying to do the right thing when I identified fraudulent research carried out by an institution in Austria. The initial response of the institution was positive but when I pressed for further details on how such things could happen suddenly nobody anymore would take my call. The research was paid for by a private company to pimp a nonsense product. The research was never published in a research journal but it didn&#39;t stop the company using the name of the university alonside exerpts from the paper in marketing material alongside gushing claims of &#34;proved by science&#34;.The company threatened to sue me and the university threatened me as well. Neither has followed through on threats. The company wants to keep selling their rubbish magnetic health ding ding and I assume the university wants nobody to look into how positive results for the product came out of their institution. Allround an education on how the real world works."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When you want to do a proper work, your grants and papers get rejected because they are not innovatove enough or don&#39;t go far enough. So it is not a surprise that people that lied in their applications about what they can realistically do also lie when it comes to reporting results. Unfortunately there is no way out. I stopped counting how many reviewers of my grants disagreed on what was proposed, one saying that it was not innovative, the other saying that is was too risky to use this approach. We have a big problem in science, peer-review is broken and everything relies on it. And many reviewers are way out of touch about what happens in their field, I see reviews that clearly show the reviewer was sleeping for the last 10 years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I want to know is how does this issue impact the notion that we all seem to buy into that we should &#34;follow the science&#34;.Scientists themselves have a hard time &#34;following the science&#34;. Add to it the observation that when an issue is getting lots of attention outside of academia, then there are usually some really strong incentives (profit, prestige) associated with doing the science and applying it (e.g., epidemiological science during a global pandemic).The question seems not to be about how can normal people &#34;follow the science&#34; but rather, why should normal people trust at all that any touted science is anything more than bullshit spouted by highly-motivated sophists?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Curious to see comments quipping that some of the math problems geared towards young kids are too hard. I&#39;d recommend taking a look at Singapore Math[0] to get an idea of what kids in those age ranges are actually capable of doing, provided that adults shed preconceptions that children ought to be &#34;sheltered from hard scary stuff&#34;, and instead encourage them.There are also great math-oriented games these days (I had some good success w/ prodigygame.com[1]).My youngest daughter is 6 and can solve simple multiplication and division problems. Sometimes she even surprises me. Some time ago, we were introducing ourselves to a new neighbor and the convo went somewhat along these lines:- my son: how old is your dog?- neighbor: she&#39;s 8- son: she&#39;s so small, is she a puppy?- neighbor: oh no, she&#39;s grown up. 1 dog year is about 7 human years, so-- daughter [interrupting]: oh wow, so then she is 56!The other day, she came to me beaming to explain how she had just solved 38/2 (by doing 40/2, 2/2 and subtracting the results). Gotta say it&#39;s a joy to see a kid that enjoys math.[0] https://www.singaporemath.com/[1] https://www.prodigygame.com/main-en/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On a related subject, here is a recent experience and I dont know how to deal with it.I have been helping my kids with their homework during the pandemic, I thought it would be easy since I got very good grade 25+ years ago. And then when I sat down doing it. I couldn&#39;t remember a thing. Not a single thing. All of a sudden, apart from basic algebra, all of the maths were gone. Zip, Zero. I couldn&#39;t remember how sin cos tan works any more. It was like a few years of memory in my brain went missing. For some people it may be funny and have a laugh about it. For me it was shocking, quite horrifying and depressing.I am thinking if I should relearn all those maths again. If so how do you go about it? Most of my friends aren&#39;t any good at maths so they thought not remembering any thing was not a problem.But for some strange reason all the basic for Physics, Chemistry and Biology were still there. At least half of it. It was just maths. I dont know if anyone else have similar experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They&#39;re interesting to adults, too! Simple enough that it feels like you should be able to blurt out the answer, I&#39;m more than twice the maximum recommended age and a professional engineer, but (at least for me) it takes some thought. The top recommended three:&gt; 1. Masha  was seven  kopecks  short  to  buy  a  first  reading  book, and  Mishalacked one kopeck.  They combined their money to buy one book to share, but even then they did not have enough.  How much did the book cost?&gt; 3. A  brick  weighs  one  pound  and  half  the  brick.   How  many  pounds  does the brick weigh?&gt; 13. Two  volumes  of  Pushkin,  the  first  and  the  second,  are  side-by-side  on a bookshelf.  The pages of each volume are 2 cm thick, and the cover – front and back each – is 2 mm.  A bookworm has gnawed through (perpendicular to the pages) from the first page of volume 1 to the last page of volume 2.  How long is the bookworm’s track?I do take objection to the answer to question 13 - the author seems particularly set on one way of loading the bookshelves as correct."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My shield updated to this the other day. I&#39;m pretty furious about it, it&#39;s not a cheap device, and it&#39;s certainly not Google&#39;s. To be adding these &#34;features&#34; without asking, irrespective of whatever agreement between me, Nvidia or Google exists, is ridiculous.I know it&#39;s in whatever terms I, uh, &#34;accepted&#34;, but there&#39;s just no escaping it in this day and age.Fortunately, I know how to use ADB and just installed another launcher, but most other people just have to bend over and take it. No doubt ADB tricks won&#39;t be sufficient in future updates and I&#39;ll be playing more silly games with a device I own.Apple is seems almost as bad too. There&#39;s recommendations that I don&#39;t want. It&#39;s certainly worse in that I would have even less control and be unable to remove them.It&#39;s certainly a good thing that I don&#39;t live anywhere near a Google office, otherwise I&#39;d be launching this POS through one of their windows if I did."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve had the Shield for years and set them up for a few family members. I still believe it&#39;s the best device of its kind on the market and I&#39;ve recommended it every chance so I have a lot of friends with them as well.In the most recent update, the until-now ad-free homepage was defaced with an ad banner that takes up half the screen and can&#39;t be removed. This wasn&#39;t a change made by Nvidia but by Google to the Android TV Launcher. To add to this, some of the ads have been deemed inappropriate or offensive to certain users adding to the frustration of ads being introduced to this long-standing ad-free experience.I, like many Shield owners, am considering installing a third party launcher. This can be done pretty easily by watching an instruction video on Youtube and most users will go this route without consideration of security - potentially opening large numbers of the devices up to vulnerabilities."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Test your backups&#34; is so easy to say, but quite difficult for many to do. There are a lot of shops that probably don&#39;t know how to recreate a machine from scratch. How many systems are developed as balls of clay. Little bits added and smeared in over time until the ball just gets bigger, but each piece lost in the process. How many folks can go through their local config files and explain all of entries, how many can even tell which ones they have changed, or why? Especially when they were changed by Frank, but he left 2 years ago.You&#39;d like to think you can just restore the system from backup and it&#39;ll just light back up. But how do you test this without cratering your existing system? Like a boat in a basement, many system are built in-situ and can be very rigid.Modern environments like cloud computing and creation scripts can mitigate this a bit organically, but how many of these systems are just a tower running Windows w/SQL Server and who knows what else? Plus whatever client software is on the client machines.How do you test that in isolation?At least read the media to see if it can be read (who doesn&#39;t love watching a backup tape fail halfway through the restore).Simply, it takes a lot of engineering to make a system that can be reliably restored, much less on a frequent basis. And this is all engineering that doesn&#39;t impact the actual project -- getting features to users and empowering the business. Which can make the task even more difficult."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I&#39;ve always wondered: How do you prevent ransomware from ruining your backups, too?Lots of ransomware tends to be &#34;delayed&#34; – it can&#39;t encrypt everything instantly, so it encrypts a little bit each minute. During those minutes, isn&#39;t it conceivable that the now-encrypted files replace your old backups?I suppose this isn&#39;t really a &#34;backup&#34; but rather a &#34;mirroring strategy.&#34; But for certain kinds of data -- photos, video, large media -- can you really afford to do any other kind of strategy?The other question I have is related to that first point: since ransomware can&#39;t encrypt everything all at once, how is it possible for your system to continue to function? As you can tell, I&#39;m a ransomware noob, but it&#39;s quite interesting to me from an engineering standpoint. Does the system get into a &#34;half encrypted&#34; state where, if you rebooted it, it would fail to boot at all? Or does ransomware targeted at businesses tend to be more of a surgical strike, where it targets and wipes out specific datastores before anyone notices?(It&#39;s the &#34;before anyone notices&#34; part that I&#39;m especially curious about. Isn&#39;t there some kind of alarm that could be raised more or less instantly, because something detects unexpected binary blobs being created on your disk?)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This really hits home, decades ago - I was working at this place that did daily tape backups.  I remember thinking, this is unreal - there&#39;s literally a room filled with tapes.One day, I asked if they ever had performed a recovery off of the tapes, as I questioned if the tapes were even being written to.  (NOTE:  Backups was not my job at all. )Why had I brought this up?  I would be in the server room and never saw the blinky lights on the tape...well.. blink. Everyone literally laughed at me, thought was a grade A moron.A year later, servers died... Pop&#39;ed in the tape... Blank.  No worries, they had thousands more of these tapes.  Sadly, they were all MT.  They had to ship hard drives to a recovery shop, and it was rather expensive.I left shortly after this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Congrats!I tried Julia for the first time last week and it was great.I&#39;ve been playing with the idea of defining a hash function for lists that can be composed with other hashes to find the hash of the concatenation of the lists. I tried to do this with matrix multiplication of the hash of each list item, but with integer mod 256 elements random matrices are very likely to be singular and after enough multiplications degenerates to the zero matrix. However, with finite field (aka Galois fields) elements, such a matrix is much more likely to be invertible and therefore not degenerate. But I don&#39;t really know anything about finite fields, so how should I approach it? Here&#39;s where Julia comes in: with some help I was able to combine two libraries, LinearAlgebraX.jl which has functions for matrices with exact elements, with GaloisFields.jl which implements many types of GF, and wrote up a working demo implementation of this &#34;list hash&#34; idea in a Pluto.jl  [2] notebook and published it [0] (and a question on SO [1]) after a few days without having any Julia experience at all. Julia seems pretty approachable, has great libraries, and is very powerful (I was even able to do a simple multithreaded implementation in 5 lines).[0]: https://blog.infogulch.com/2021/07/15/Merklist-GF.html[1]: https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/92139/using-rando...[2]: https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I played with Julia a bit in grad school. Although I didn&#39;t end up using it much after that I thought it was a lovely language. Forget python, I hope Julia manages to kill off Matlab and its weird stranglehold on various pockets of academia. Congrats to the team here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Congrats to the Julia team.I am a python developer who has dabbled with Julia but it never stuck for me.I think Julia was built by academics for other academics running innovative high performance computing tasks. It excels at the intersection of 1) big data, so speed is important, and 2) innovative code, so you can&#39;t just use someone else&#39;s C package. Indeed, Julia&#39;s biggest successful applications outside academica closely resemble an academic HPC project (eg Pumas). I think it will continue to have success in that niche. And that&#39;s not a small niche! Maybe it&#39;s enough to support a billion dollar company.But most of us in industry are not in that niche. Most companies are not dealing with truly big data, on our scale, it is cheaper to expand the cluster than it is to rewrite everything in Julia. Most who ARE dealing with truly big data, do not need innovative code; basic summary statistics and logistic regression will be good enough, or maybe some cloud provider&#39;s prepackaged turn key neural nets scale out training system if they want to do something fancy.I think for Julia to have an impact outside of academia (and academia-like things in industry) it will need to develop killer app packages. The next PyTorch needs to be written in Julia. Will that happen? Maybe! I hope so! The world would be better off with more cool data science packages.But I think the sales pitch of &#34;it&#39;s like Pandas and scikit but faster!&#34; is not going to win many converts. So is Jax, Numba, Dask, Ray, Pachyderm, and the many other attempts within the Python community of scaling and speeding Python, that require much less work and expense on my part for the same outcome.Again, congrats to the team, I will continue to follow Julia closely, and I&#39;m excited to see what innovative capabilities come out of the Julia ecosystem for data scientists like me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m an engineering software contractor and every client has a whole bucket load of outdated IDEs and random USB interface drivers they want me to install on my machine. Often this stuff has weird specific version dependencies, kernel level drivers that cause weird things to happen (like the computer to BSOD if you boot it up with other USB devices attached), random system level crashes, and when you go to the driver download page there are always an unsettling list of simple security vulns noted.The #1 thing that I&#39;ve ever wanted is a Linux that lives between the bootloader and Windows that lets me achieve native performance on the Windows VM, but gives me an environment where I can easily do all the things that you can usually do in HyperV like create snapshots, clone installs, share Sharepoint drives between images, etc. But I do need something that is perfectly stable and just works. This is the right technology (thank you so much for working on it), but just not yet at a maturity that makes me feel comfortable about putting livelihood on the line.Edit: actually, please, if anyone knows something that suits this use-case, even if it costs decent money, please leave a comment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If anyone is interested, the main developer, who goes by &#39;gnif&#39; spends a decent amount of time on the dedicated Looking Glass sub-forum on the Level1Techs forum, here:https://forum.level1techs.com/c/software/lookingglass/142Level1Techs also has a ton of information and help both on the forum, and their YouTube channel, about setting up Looking Glass and VFIO. The main host of the YouTube channel, Wendell, has forgotten more about nitty-gritty system administration than I will likely ever know in my lifetime. He also just seems like a genuinely good human being."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I run a VFIO setup with a single GPU - the linux host is headless, and Windows runs on top with the GPU. Its pretty awesome. Windows runs at native performance - no problem gaming or running other heavy workloads. The linux host acts as a devbox and runs a few other homeserver style services.It&#39;s difficult to set up right but it taught me a lot about VMs and hardware. Once you get it setup well enough, its relatively painless. Like I haven&#39;t messed with my VM settings in over a year, everything just continues to work smoothly. Including windows updates, driver upgrades, most online games with anti-cheat etc. If i upgrade my hardware, it might take a day or two of tinkering to get it back up. Based on my benchmarking it runs within ~5% of native perf.This is still the best guide IMO if you want to set it up - https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF. Single GPU is basically the same as dual GPU, except you have to ensure the linux host does not take over the GPU or load any drivers for it during boot."</p>

You&#39;re wondering if it&#39;s about to crash or go on fire.I&#39;ve always kept a Desktop PC on the go for this reason, a well cooled desktop just doesn&#39;t have these issues. With a laptop, I always feel like I&#39;m compromising a bit.I got an M1 Macbook Pro recently and it just doesn&#39;t have these issues, I fire up my whole dev environment and get busy, and it&#39;s still quiet and (mostly) cool, and I can&#39;t notice anything slowing down.I don&#39;t care so much about the architecture differences, x64 vs ARM etc, but the fact that I can finally use a laptop like a desktop is massive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is funny.  For the last ten years I&#39;ve used Mac laptops as my primary machine.  Of course the fan noise was a great auditory clue to tell me to check out Activity Monitor/top for rogue processes and help me optimize which tasks took too many resources.I didn&#39;t realize how much I relied on that cue until I temporarily switched to a Mac desktop machine during the pandemic when I didn&#39;t need to travel.  The desktop fans pretty much stay at 1200rpm all the time.  I think I&#39;ve seen them spike once.  I&#39;d forgotten how much better desktops can be for some things.Now I&#39;m looking for a better remote access solution so I can consider sticking with a desktop at home and then maybe just an iPad for travel with good remote access and file sync."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s pretty hilarious.  Until recently I didn&#39;t think of the CPU fan as an auditory cue for how hard your system is working.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Big tech censorship will not solved without addressing the other half of a problem with two sides.Without systems that promote quality, non-ideological, nuanced, original, tolerant dialogue we will keep running into the false dilemma of unmoderated cess pools or heavy handed moderation.If we are to avoid this dilemma we need systems that organically promote constructive, tolerant and inclusive communication, and original, nuanced, intelligent, non-ideological ideas, instead of the opposite.This cannot be done by organizations whose profit incentive is aligned with user attention instead of user satisfaction.Those organizations benefit from degraded communication until strong moderation is both continually demanded and decried.---On a side note, I am so disappointed in the constant framing of ideas as right or left. It dumbs society down incredibly to view so much through the filter of two (often arbitrarily correlated, historically shifting) clusters of supposedly disjoint options.In the real world, communes work well sometimes, markets often work better at scale but not for everything, markets require &#34;social solutions&#34; like non-commercial criminal and civil justice systems, education and health could be explicitly tested and then managed as investments with a pay off of lower taxes (including for the rich) instead of as charities forced on the rich, etc.The Right/Left and associated ideologies are all self-defeating when believed in isolation and the nuances of their ragged edges, their limitations, and constructive combinations ignored."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This all sounds very nice, but there&#39;s a bit of sleight of hand here since the article goes out of its way to avoid details. That way everyone reads into exactly what they want, and it&#39;s totally non-obvious whether this is actually a workable proposal or not.But what&#39;s the concrete proposal here? How would things actually work? Will the services be forced to accept whatever unmoderated feed of filth the linked to service sends their way? If not, how is this supposed to fix the moderation problem?How are you supposed to link together applications with totally different data, interaction, and identity models? Obviously you couldn&#39;t link e.g. say Discord to Instagram and have the interactions between the systems make any sense. Are we just going to have a predefined ontology of possible social networkign apps, populated with the currently existing models, and define an API for all of then? When and how does that ontology get redefined? Or define a single lowest common denominator covering everything? What happens with features that don&#39;t fit into the models? They&#39;re entirely forbidden? They need to go through a multi-year public review bureacracy?Who exactly will be forced to interoperate, and who gets a free pass?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;First of all, the internet’s “marketplace of ideas” is severely lopsided at the platform levelThe marketplace of ideas itself has been show to be a bust in recent years, IMHO.Better ideas, better models of truth and reality don&#39;t win out. People have not shown themselves interested in intellectual debate or argument. We do not see the &#39;best&#39; ideas rise to the top. And before anyone asks who I am to judge the best ideas, I&#39;ll answer - nobody, but I can see that factually incorrect, scientifically illiterate, conspiratorial, harmful crank ideas gain legs in the online world we&#39;ve created. Often at the root of these is a profit motive.Is censorship the best way to deal with it? Probably not. But we do need to recognise this as a problem as well as getting het up about giant internet platforms deplatforming people."</p>

Every time. Why are we even surprised."</p>

It is in great part because of the conflict. Te SIGINT units are huge and among the people who graduate from the army with this kind of knowledge you will certainly find many who will turn a blind eye to ethics for a huge paycheck. Not to mention that the research itself that the defense apparatus needs attracts capitals from other countries that will buy some of it and use it for unorthodox means.

I am looking for more ideas to experiment. Here&#39;s one idea which someone from another forum gave me: exploring recursive queries and using SQLite random methods to do the insertions.Another crazy idea is to learn about SQLite file format and just write the pages to disk."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can go even faster if you can organize your problem such that you simply start from a copy of a template SQLite database each time (it is just a file/byte sequence).We do SQL evaluation for a lot of business logic throughout our product, and we have found that starting from a template database (i.e. one with the schema predefined and canonical values populated) can save a lot of time when working in tight loops."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Database optimization posts are always interesting, but it&#39;s really hard to do any apples to apples comparison. Your performance is going to depend mostly on your hardware, internal database settings and tunings, and OS level tunings. I&#39;m glad this one included some insight into the SQLite settings disabled, but there&#39;s always going to be too many factors to easily compare this to your own setup.For most SQL systems, the fastest way to do inserts is always just going to batched inserts. There&#39;s maybe some extra tricks to reduce network costs/optimize batches [0], but at it&#39;s core you are still essentially inserting into the table through the normal insert path. You can basically then only try and reduce the amount of work done on the DB side per insert, or optimize your OS for your workload.Some other DB systems (more common in NoSQL) let you actually do real bulk loads [1] where you are writing direct(ish) database files and actually bypassing much of the normal write path.[0] https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/insert-optimization....

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Do Signal, Wire, or Matrix do this transcript consistency thing, or is there some other way by which they prevent message reordering? From what I know, encrypted messengers almost never implement that. At least in Wire I noticed reordering at some point and it uses an implementation of what is now called the Signal protocol.And that&#39;s the most severe vulnerability from the article. The second one is &#34;mostly of theoretical interest&#34; according to the researchers themselves, the third requires &#34;an attacker [to] send many carefully crafted messages to a target, on the order of millions of messages&#34;, and the fourth &#34;requires sending billions of messages to a Telegram server within minutes&#34;. So while this is not bad research, not at all (it&#39;s really great that people take this close a look!), the title sounds rather more severe and people will obviously jump to the conclusion that &#34;See, MTproto is bad like we said all along!&#34; without reading anything. Good research, bad article?«Obligatory notice in Telegram comment threads: the real issue in Telegram is that end-to-end encryption is optional and made extremely inconvenient to use: no implementation at all in TDesktop, can&#39;t use it across multiple devices, doesn&#39;t work for group chats at all... That is the main reason Telegram isn&#39;t secure: they can read all your chats except when you use this stupid inconvenient mode.»"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Given how bashing on MTProto is a favourite cryptographers&#39; activity from the day-0, I&#39;m actually kinda encouraged by the fact that&#39;s all they found. It&#39;s especially nice, that htey could fix all of them without breaking back-compatibility, which isn&#39;t really a given for crypto protocols. Would appreciate more technical and less dumbed down responses from the Telegram team, though. I have no idea what the fuck &#34;counting grains in the bags of sound&#34; is supposed to mean.(Also, it&#39;s funny, but being accustomed to SMS and such I always somehow assumed Telegram messages can be reordered by chance too, if I send them fast. I never really thought about it, obviously, but simply didn&#39;t expect it to be otherwise.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While bashing on Telegram is basically HNs favorite past time, there aren&#39;t many other alternatives that work just as well in the area that I care the most about: being a great chat app. Telegram is fast, has native clients instead of a garbage web ui (or electron based app), has better stickers than the alternatives, is easy to write bots for and has a larger user base where I&#39;m at than any of the alternatives other than WhatsApp."</p>

Persistence is achieved via firing the 0-click again. Because the 0-clicks they&#39;re using appear to be quite reliable, the lack of traditional &#34;persistence&#34; is a feature, not a drawback of the spyware.

Everyone there is working hard all year long, charging for tourist services very cheaply. Yet there are many examples of places with year long tourism, but you can still find mass closures during siesta.Everyone, through culture, decided not to overwork and there&#39;s no one &#34;hard-working&#34; enough to have their business open during siesta.

If you choose to try to opt out of automatic item detection, that choice is also sent back to their servers (where it then returns a 4xx and tells you to sign up or sign in to fakespot with an account to save settings).The extension itself is many megabytes of heavily packed and obfuscated JS.

Also, running a full node long-term (without pruning) currently eats quite a bit of disk space:   $ du -sh ~/.ethereum/geth

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My favorite book for learning SQL is “The Art of PostgreSQL”. https://theartofpostgresql.com/I found the combination of real-world problems, general SQL advice, and the broad range of topics to be a really good book. It took my SQL from “the database is not much more than a place to persist application data” to “the application is not much more than a way to match commands to the database”. It’s amazing how much bespoke code is doing a job the database can do for you in a couple of lines."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SQL is both slightly ugly (which I attribute to the historical decision to use natural language words instead of the mathematical symbols of the relational algebra notation - the symbols make the expressions more readable once you learn them) and very beautiful. I&#39;m sad most of the people have forgotten it and prefer to use ORMs today. Most often (except when coding a stupid low-feature phonebook/todolist tutorial) it seems to me writing SQL queries manually is a way more efficient (not only in terms of execution speed but also for  developing) solution than using an ORM, except you have to have some fluency in SQL which the most of the today coders seem to lack. Designing a normalized entity-relation model as well as writing the queries for it also feels great, very satisfying."</p>

This assumes we&#39;ll discover some magical bullet, that we haven&#39;t thought of, that will counteract erosion of topsoil, water shortages, and climate change. Another implicit assumption is that we&#39;ll be able to move forward unilaterally with such a solution, instead of it becoming a political football until it&#39;s too late to do anything, like climate change.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was an undergrad I discovered blogs about peak oil, the limits to the growth, and Turchin’s cliometrics. As an adolescent I really enjoyed Asimov’s Foundation and all of this knowledge resonated with me.I had a fried who read Von Mises’ Human Action and he labeled me as a neo-Malthusian . And, according to his “school of thought”, my understanding of the world and economics incorrect. We had many interesting discussions about what we thought we knew.Now I’m in my 30s and my thought has changed drastically. I believe that reductionist (materialistic) approaches to analyze human endeavor are misguided. There is a bit of hubris in thinking that a computer simulation can predict the entirety of human action. I am definitely not suscribed to the Austrian school of thought, however."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting. My stack ranking of unethical tech companies would have Twitter at the very top. None of the others have caused as much societal harm as Twitter. I saw research recently that as much as half of all trending topics in Turkey were manufactured by malicious actors to spread propaganda. Also, it&#39;s just an endless pit of addictive negativity. I once had a girlfriend who would browser Twitter for hours on end and was perpetually angry. Not a good way to live.Google, on the other hand, has a bunch of products like Maps, Drive, Docs, and Meet that are legitimately helpful and useful. I would have no ethical qualms about helping to make Docs better. This is not to say Google is an ethical company in the aggregate, but there are certainly a lot of roles you could take there that would not require you to question your morality every time you start a new task."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;Maybe we were just a bit naive,&#34; Cornet said.They likely were, and think of me what you like but I&#39;ve noticed the same with most Americans I&#39;ve known. Not sure why that is but apparently there&#39;s some good amount of propaganda going on in the USA and people apparently believe it. Meanwhile people have to pay $5000 after an ambulance picks them up. Or $90000 for semi-trivial medical procedures.I believe asking yourself &#34;is my country really like I believe it is?&#34; is a good food for thought even it&#39;s a bit sideways to this here topic at hand.--On topic:I can sympathize with the author. I know what it is to have been a long time in a company; it becomes much more than a workplace. You have friends, you even have people you invite to your Sunday barbecues. It&#39;s also very likely that a number of internal processes are going smoother for you because you know whom to ping and what exactly to write in a form so your stuff gets done quicker. You have job stability and unless you are rocking the boat too much your seat is likely 99% safe.All of those become true stoppers when you start pondering leaving. They pull you back and make you doubt yourself and your idea of switching company.But unlike a number of commenters here I find nothing hypocritical about the decision to go to Twitter. We don&#39;t know how Twitter operates internally; maybe it&#39;s still better than Google. Or maybe they are still after FAANG level of wages so are ready to make some ethical compromises for them?In any case, immediately discounting somebody&#39;s opinion on a corporation because they joined another corporation misses a lot of context, is flamey and non-constructive and almost smells like a paid troll, and is something I don&#39;t expect HN to condone. But sadly, here we go, it&#39;s the top comment here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems to me the author&#39;s divergence of views may be due to his increasing focus on politics, with a particular orientation that explicitly shows through the comics. It may just be a reflection of what&#39;s happening at scale in Silicon Valley&#39;s tech world, a movement which Twitter, which the author joined most likely not coincidentally, is at the forefront of."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had trouble finding a good FI planning and simulation tool that could model things in enough detail to finally ditch my spreadsheets... so I decided to build one: ProjectiFihttps://projectifi.io/A while back I posted a very early version here (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26969173), and just released a major overhaul with loads of new features and enhancements, many inspired by the initial HN commentary:- Monte Carlo mode with customizable simulations, variables, probability distributions- Backtesting on historical data- Multiple data persistence options for subscribers: cloud synchronization, localStorage only, or manual import/export- Stock/bond allocation curve over time- Improved support for international use cases (currency + locale selector, custom options and contribution limits for financial goals)- Ability to quickly switch between deterministic and probabilistic modes- Many new event types to model a broader range of scenarios- Better support for married filing jointly / couples planning (perhaps still not perfect, but definitely better)- Redesigned landing page, additional UI improvements- And more!If you feel like checking it out, I would love to hear what you think. Most of the functionality is free, but for anyone interested in upgrading to Premium, you can use coupon code &#34;HN-15&#34; for 15% off all plans :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually have a draft open in gmail that i was meaning to send to you, so ill post it here instead :)I saw your initial release of this many months ago, tried it out, was like, ok thats kinda cool, put it down.But then recently i needed to do some serious life financial planning, remembered your tool, searched for the HN post and gave it a real go.... and WOW.  Im so impressed. It does exactly what i need; give me a semi-realistic long term plan of finances, retirement, how much house i can afford, effect of jobs, stocks, etc. Being able to play around with scenarios like &#34;what if one of us didnt work for a few years?&#34; really easily. I probably could do all this stuff on a spreadsheet, but the fiddly details of things like inflation, raises, tax, etc are incredibly tedious to model. theres a lot of near term budgeting type apps etc out there, but there was no other product i found that works so well for long term macro stuff. So its well worth the premium subscription fee to me, on a time saved basis alone.The UI/X is mostly great(ill email you some minor suggestions :) ), and your development velocity is really impressive.Perhaps the total market for a tool like this is niche, but hopefully it turns into a profitable enough endeavor for you so you can keep working on it forever :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Somehow it feels odd that an implementation detail like the programming language it&#39;s implemented in is so prominent in the project&#39;s description.

Probably, but does anyone even notice that in the context of all the other things that we do _with_ it?Are there any benefits I&#39;m missing that come from it being implemented in Rust?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing to note - the headline of the article itself is incorrect. It says &#34;GM Will Suck Lithium From the Salton Sea&#34; In fact the lithium is being extracted from brine thousands of feet below the Salton Sea, as is stated in the article itself. Also GM is not doing the work, they signed an agreement with another company that is actually doing it. HN reworded headline is better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find that area geologically fascinating.  It&#39;s one of the few above-water rift zones in the world.  According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salton_Trough the sediment fills it in as quickly as it sinks, so you have sediment in some areas going down 20,000 feet.The earthquakes seem to come in swarms out there, which I think is a result of the pulling apart.  In a thrust fault or strike-slip fault, you have a release of energy and while the stress is transferred somewhere else, that seems to be the end of the movement.  When you pull two plates apart, you create a gap and the stuff above it sort of settles down into the gap, probably causing the successive earthquakes as it all settles into the new position.I really wish we had a canal to the Salton Sea.  Having a new inland port and a source of fresher water would dramatically change the area."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Part of my job is to help the executives that I report to understand why things went wrong from the security perspective in our business unit. These are purely internal discussions, not even investigations. There are no penalties, but really, for things as egregious as hard coded passwords. As will become clear in a moment, the fact that my executives care is quite unusual.Culturally the result is coverups and lies.Engineers lie, managers lie, test people lie, directors lie, senior directors lie, vice president lie, external interesting teams are negotiated into minimizing certain critical failures, and so on. Managers don’t want to hear it so that they can’t be accused of lying, vice presidents don’t wanna know, SVP’s just want green squares on the cross-BU PowerPoint.This is internal discussion of revenue impacting incidents. Do you know what executives do care about? Revenue. Lost deals. If the people who care about money, including the account teams, don’t care about security and severe quality issues enough to be honest enough to get to improvement, how could an external board accomplish anything for those very few incidents that actually become publicly visible?This isn’t like the NTSB; I spent my life reading NTSB accident reports. They have actual real authority, there are potentially issues that might impact someone more than being caught distorting things."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In Washington State we have a system to track cannabis, the enforcement officers are supposed to be able to get reports from this system.  The system is super buggy and also doesn&#39;t have meaningful reports.  So there is a secondary system for officers to export to Excel documents.  In one of the trainings they&#39;ve been instructed to look for anomalies -- not real analisys, not even a pivot table.  One thing they find is &#34;negative quantities&#34; -- but how can that be? (hint: it&#39;s bugs in the tracking software).  Then enforcement shows up at the cannabis business to audit these negative numbers (or demand the business try to correct the data (which they cannot due to bugs)).So, crappy software gets law enforcement officers to basically review data &#34;anomalies&#34; created by bugs by visiting a business. The second most expensive method for data sanatization I can imagine.  It&#39;s a poor use of their time and disruptive to the business.The system in WA is so buggy that the agency has opted to freeze the software rather than try to fix the issues.  The future of government software is bleak -- so long as they keep using closed source packages from low-cost bidders."</p>
