								<p class="story__comment_others">"We did a similar kind of experiment some time back and found both FB ads and Google ads were doing jack shit for us. Google was better. FB ads were absolutely useless. So we stopped our ad spend. We observed no change in our customer acquisition.Another way these ad engines extract money out of you is by allowing competitors to bid for your brand name keyword. Try searching for Ozonetel on Google. There will be six competitor ads and then our website will show up :)In our early days we used to be scared and bid for it.Lost a lot of money doing that. Then we talked about it and stopped. Again, no change in customer acquisition. Turns out, customers scroll down the ads and still click on our website.Are our competitors getting some of our traffic?Of course.But my business is not built on the assumption that people will not find my competitors. Its built on the fact that people will explore options and try to find the best fit for them. So its ok."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I still remember Craig Silverstein being asked what his biggest mistake at Google was and him answering &#34;Not pushing for ECC memory.&#34;Google&#39;s initial strategy (c. 2000) around this was to save a few bucks on hardware, get non-ECC memory, and then compensate for it in software.  It turns out this is a terrible idea, because if you can&#39;t count on memory being robust against cosmic rays, you also can&#39;t count on the software being stored in that memory being robust against cosmic rays.  And when you have thousands of machines with petabytes of RAM, those bitflips do happen.  Google wasted many man-years tracking down corrupted GFS files and index shards before they finally bit the bullet and just paid for ECC."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I beg this, every time this conversation comes up it’s the same answer “I don’t see a problem”.It’s so easy to chalk these kind of errors to other issues, a little corruption here, a running program goes bezerk there- could be a buggy program or a little accidental memory overwrite. Reboot will fix it.But I ran many thousands of physical machines, petabytes of RAM, I tracked memory flip errors and they were _common_; common even in: less dense memory, in thick metal enclosures surrounded by mesh. Where density and shielding impacts bitflips a lot.My own experience tracking bitflips across my fleet led me to buy a Xeon laptop with ECC memory (precision 5520) and it has (anecdotally) been significantly more reliable than my desktop."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who has had to read thousands of random game crash reports from all over the interwebs (you know when Windows says you might want to send that crash log?  like that), I totally agree.Of all the things to be worried about, like OS bugs, bad hardware configuration, etc. bad memory is one of those really troubling things.  You look at the code and say &#34;it&#39;s can&#39;t make it here, because this was set&#34; but when you can&#39;t trust your memory you can&#39;t trust anything.And as the timeline goes to infinity, you may also get one of these reports and be asked to fix it... good luck."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Apart from those benchmark games a lot of real world C is a lot less performant than people think it might be. I spent a fair amount of time reviewing C code in the last 5 years - and things that pop up in nearly every review are costly string operations. Linear counts due to the use of null terminated strings and extra allocations for substrings to attach null terminators, or just deep copies because ownership can’t be determined are far more common than exceptional. This happens because null terminated strings feel like idiomatic C to most people.Rust avoids those from the start by making slices idiomatic.Another thing I commonly see is the usage of suboptimal containers (like arrays with linear search) - just because it’s there’s no better alternative at hand (standard library doesn’t offer ones and dependency management is messy). Which also makes it less surprising that code in higher level languages might perform better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Once LLVM fixes some bugs with `noalias`, at which point Rust will begin using it again in more circumstances [1], I&#39;d expect to see Rust get even faster in these benchmarks, given that the Rust compiler knows much more about which pointers do/do-not alias than most other programming languages [2] and the myriad optimizations this knowledge allows.[1] https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54878#issuecomment-...[2] https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/aliasing.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have many fond memories of my first real job as sysadmin/render wrangler for a small animation company about fifteen years ago.Cores and memory were indeed what mattered, and as long as frames could be fitted into memory then the machine was left to render the frame and then save it back out to shared disk. There was no virtualization, just raw compute hardware running at full capacity 24/7. The scene was already split into different layers and rendered as sequences of frames that were then composited into final products.First job, first mini-datacenter in a new building, and there I am asking contractors to knock a hole in the building to fit air handlers due to the heat we were expecting to generate. Was great fun.It taught me a lot about automated systems management."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am one of the few people that inspects the source-code of extensions. It&#39;s easy to do, for Firefox for example, just right-click and save-as in the extensions site, then rename your extension to a .zip file and extract e.g:    addon.xpi --&gt; addon.zip

Then manually sift through the code looking for obvious malicious intent (or not so obvious malicious intent if the author is doing obfuscation). Note: obfuscation is a red flag! A simple scan for `https://` / &#39;http://&#39;  would usually yield interesting URLs where data is sent. I have actually spotted malicious addons in the wild this way and reported them to Mozilla. They were thankfully removed.Note: Obfuscation is NOT the same as minification, and I don&#39;t mean minification when using the word obfuscation!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been telling everyone who will listen[1][2][3] that as an extension developer, I&#39;d love to be able to guarantee through the Chrome App Store that an extension matches a git commit (or auditable build pipeline artifact) exactly.It wouldn&#39;t fix everything (for example, you could still put a payload in an innocent-looking dependency), but it would at least fix the blatant problem that a maintainer can add code when uploading an extension even if the extension itself is open source and therefore (appears to be) auditable.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23265699

								<p class="story__comment_others">"We need to talk about how difficult it is to monetize browser extensions. Most of these problems occur when a reputable extension gets sold to a less reputable owner, frequently for a relatively small amount of money (4-5 figures). Even very popular extensions have a hard time monetizing. Unfortunately, Chrome has recently made the situation worse by deprecating Chrome Web Store payments, and Firefox eliminated their paid extension store several years ago.If the only way to monetize an extension is to exploit its users for data, this kind of thing is going to keep happening. It&#39;s perfectly understandable how someone who is doing a lot of work for no pay will eventually get tired of it or have other priorities in life, which is what happened in this case. Perhaps we all need to stop taking it for granted that browser extensions ought to be free? Or maybe the browser vendors themselves can find ways of financially supporting extension authors. I feel that money is essential to both the problem and the solution.Of course, paid upfront software gets sold to new owners too. But if the software is paid upfront, the expectation is that the new owner will perhaps do a better job of maintaining and marketing the software, and that&#39;s why the new owner buys it. When the software is paid, the new owner has an opportunity to make money legitimately, without secretly exploiting the existing user base."</p>

All the people playing video games have mastered skills that aren’t being taken full advantage of. Anyways, coroutines in Unity can be used to do interesting things over time while attached to the game loop.My point, despite my digression, is just how there are still basic/intermediate topics I have only been able to appreciate recently.

If these are not helpful, the participant will be invited to sit up, take off the eyeshades and make visual contact with the therapists and the room.  The therapists may offer reassurance that such states are to be expected and are likely to be short lived.&gt; Responding to marked agitation&gt; If the subject displays significant or marked agitation and previously mentioned interventions fail, the therapist will consult with the physician regarding the possible administration of benzodiazepine or antipsychotic medication.

After only an hour, I am overwhelmed by the sheer beauty and mature design of this language - it almost reads like Python or as well as any compiled language can. I cannot believe that I am smitten by Rust within an hour. Its features seem, obvious. My experience with Go was frustrating since I felt like I had to give up elegance for practicality. I did not expect to learn 1-2% of Rust when I woke up today.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Funny, I actually have an open Pinetime in front of me right now. I use it for my masters thesis and it&#39;s a really nice project. If you want to try out some embedded development (that you can actually show to friends who don&#39;t aren&#39;t developers), I think this is the perfect project."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d be the perfect target for the products of a company like Pine. A long-time geek who uses open-source software on nearly all of his devices, a tinkerer who doesn&#39;t mind recompiling a kernel or picking a solderer to make things work, and someone who seeks for absolute flexibility from his devices with zero corporate compromises.Unfortunately, the mediocre hardware used in their devices keeps holding me back.First came a phone with a 9-year-old A53 Cortex chipset. Then a tablet with the same outdated chipset. Then a laptop that ships with a Rockchip RK3399 with 4GB of RAM, in an era when 4GB barely suffice to run a browser with a few tabs. And now they are releasing a smartwatch with a 64 MHz core and 64 KB of RAM - some specs you would have expected from a very cheap smartwatch released 7-8 years ago.Why should I use a device whose hardware is almost a decade old at the time of purchase? And how do they even expect anyone to actually use these devices as their primary daily drivers, and not as proofs of concept, nice toys to tinker on every now and then or show off to friends?I understand that Pine wants to use 100% open hardware, and that comes with heavy compromises, but are these compromises worth it?If you ask even the geekest user out there whether they prefer a device whose source code is 100% pure and doesn&#39;t contain any binary blobs, or a device that doesn&#39;t start freezing/lagging after a couple of minutes of normal usage, I bet that anyone would opt for the latter."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ok, just to make sure I understand this correctly.- This is basically a commercial smartwach (the Colmi P8) that is based on a well documented SOC, the nordic nRF52832- The open source version comes with an enclosure that is not glued shut, so that it is easy to access testpoints on the pcb.- Development is done by accessing the nRF51 SWD interface with pogo pins or similar. The programming interface can be a standard SWD interface such as an STLink cloneOk, sounds easy enough. It should be possible to just buy one of those smartwatches and crack them open? But OTOH the developer version is not much more expensive.The main question is now: What software to run on it, that goes beyond a few experiments? Is there any kind of open source smartwatch OS that would run on this?Edit: Corrected typo, of course I meant SWD interface, not SWM. (SWM or rather SWIM is for STM8)"</p>

But what&#39;s really weird is it seems to not be available anymore. I&#39;m guessing export restrictions or massive demand for thermal cameras during Covid along with supply chain issues. IIRC it is also 25 frames a second, which is unusually high for thermal cameras due to export restrictions.Edit: Here&#39;s a post on creating panoramic images with therm-app. https://www.flickr.com/groups/therm-app-users/discuss/721576..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some ideas on this topic:1. Inconvenience based solutions don&#39;t address the problem: using apps to restrict phone use, physically hiding the phone etc. Once you leave those carefully constrained conditions, you are more vulnerable than ever. Not to mention the contradiction with the core issue that it&#39;s a symptom rather than a cause.2. Turning abstinence as an ongoing status condition (e.g. &#34;X days since I did Y&#34;) is a trap. It sets you up for later failure by burdening you with a perpetually unfinished objective with psychological consequences that only increase as the &#39;highscore&#39; increases. This could work with things that are less easily accessible like heroin, but it&#39;s not going to work with something as easily accessible as a phone or computer.3. The solution that works with 1 and 2 is probably urge surfing as it tackles the issue directly4. It&#39;s easier to think of it as an addiction to browsing rather than an addiction to the phone itself. You have to catch yourself during any browsing moment in any context to eventually make progress. Be intentional in almost every action instead of going on auto-pilot, although obviously resting at the end of the day is fine. It&#39;s more a general philosophy than a hard rule meant to exhaust you.5. The eventual goal is a rich life where you no longer feel the need to distract yourself"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The paper they are basing the opening sentence &#34;phone addiction is one of the biggest non-drug addiction(sic) in human history&#34; on is written by a Doctor of Business Administration, a dean that has &#34;particular industries of interest are banks and non-profit organizations&#34; in his bio and a third researcher with 2 publications total, including the article in question (published 2011).This may in no way weaken the point that some of the brightest minds of today are working on producing digital Skinner boxes, black on top, with humans as the rats, interfaced via phones.But basing an attempt at a strong argument about the addictive nature of cell-phones on an article with low relevance in scientific fields specializing in addiction could be described as suspect (most citations on g.scholar on the piece could be delineated as in the fields of business and management )."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I basically discourage addiction by making things “difficult” for myself on my phone:- Minimal web bookmarks (i.e. I have to type in most web sites I want to visit; this is just enough of an encumbrance that I won’t flip open things like Reddit every 30 seconds).- I never install apps meant for content consumption, I use their web sites.  (This is usually a better experience anyway, since the vast majority of them are somehow worse than their web sites, packed with ads/notifications/spying/crap that no one should want anyway.)- Certain web sites I refuse to use at all on mobile.  This gives me a much larger and more useful view anyway, and I can enforce sanity with a lot more plug-ins that way.- As of latest iOS, I shove most apps into the Library so they are not even on my home screen.  That way, they are straightforward to retrieve with a swipe-down search but not as easy as just tapping them open.  I find that I use them slightly less this way.- I turn off many notifications, since app-makers have long abused them anyway (as virtual ads, or designed in some way to suck people back into their apps for no reason; I drew the line when apps started outright lying about things, e.g. red dots implying messages that were not actually there, etc.).- I set it up so that my lock screen will not show most things without an extra step."</p>

There is simply no good way to share a filesystem between Windows and Linux that is both 1. fast 2. fully correct - i.e doesn&#39;t break some code.SMB/NFS just never work super well because they are slow, or programs think they are local filesystems so things break (e.g VScode won&#39;t detect new files created on the linux side of a SMB mount without a manual refresh). Plenty of details on getting permissions right too. Not to mention extended attributes which differ slightly and break stuff. Network file systems in general are just too different to local FS&#39;s for programs to work seamlessly.The 2 non-ideal solutions I&#39;ve found are 1. keep all files in linux + edit over network using VSCode Remote or IntelliJ Remote support or 2. keep a copy of the dev workspace in windows, and use something like unison (or manual git) to sync."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Stepping back a bit, I feel the argument is analogous to how music is becoming more mainstream and generic, how casual gamers &#34;corrupt&#34; the art form of gaming, how clickbait and stupit stuff is overshadowing lovingly curated independent websites, eternal September etc.One answer to all these propositions is that the valuable stuff is still there, you just have an additional flood of mediocre boring predictable stuff. You can still find enough indie music and games and movies to spend all your free time on.Similarly, if you know where to look and whose papers to watch out for, you can read more interesting stuff. The existence of more bullshit makes the filtering somewhat more effort, but it&#39;s bearable.Most papers are never deeply read anyway, outside of the reviewers. Even citations don&#39;t mean someone really read the paper in depth.So, most medíocre, boring papers get ignored.It&#39;s an illusion to expect that every researcher can pump out multiple really interesting non-boring papers every year. So we pretend. We write, we cite, we present, overiflate, overpromise etc. It must look like there is steady hard noble work and toil. It&#39;s like a ritual. The scientists are writing all these papers so tax payers can sleep well that their money is paid for hard work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing to keep in mind is that some of the papers which reviewers consider very marginal turn out to be breakthroughs. For example Jim Allison, who later won the Nobel Prize:&#34;Allison was hoping to be published by one of the leading peer-reviewed research journals. But nobody at Cell or Nature or any of the A-list, peer-reviewed journals was willing to publish the findings of this junior academic from Smithville, Texas. “Finally, I ended up publishing the results in a new journal called The Journal of Immunology.” It wasn’t Science or the New England Journal of Medicine, but it was in print, and in the world.“At the end of the paper, I said, ‘This might be the cell antigen receptor, and here are the reasons why I think that it is the T-cell antigen receptor,’ and I just listed it out, all the reasons.” It was a bold announcement regarding the biggest topic in immunology. “And nobody noticed it,” Allison says. “Except in one lab.”&#34;https://www.wired.com/story/meet-jim-allison-the-texan-who-j...So you really need to publish the marginal stuff to make sure the breakthrough stuff gets published as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"But on the other hand, with a severe replication crisis in science (https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21504366/science-replicat...), isn&#39;t it a good thing that we have a bunch of boring papers that are close to stuff that&#39;s already happened? It&#39;s not people replicating others&#39; findings exactly, but it at least gives points of comparison that can help to weed out some of the problematic work out there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Posting anonymously for obvious reasons.Unlike others, I actually find this story fairly believable.When I first joined Apple, straight out of college - a good program, top three in the country - I was abused similarly. I joined a team that was on a project behind schedule.Our manager was a brusque, no-nonsense sort of dude. But he clearly had anger problems. On the team were 2 senior engineers, me, and a junior engineer that had just completed his internship and was on a work Visa.As the project got closer to the deadline, and the scope increased, the manager got agitated. In our team meetings, he would start yelling at us. People down the hallways would stare at us with those &#34;looks.&#34; In our 1:1s he told us we might not have a job if our product doesn&#39;t ship on time (we were competing with another internal team to beat them to the punch.)The two senior engineers decided they&#39;d had enough and quit the team. The manager told us to work overtime (no overtime pay, but we had to for fear of our job). He promised us that if we did it that we would get a month of vacation on him, and that he could secure it for us.The product released. After countless nights of overtime we did it. Our manager left, our guarantee of a month of vacation evaporated, and for the next three months, us two junior engineers were left on 24/7 primary/secondary on-call for a critical service. It was a nightmare. Calls at 3 AM, 6 AM, on weekends.Our manager got a promotion and is fairly high up at Apple now.Horrible experience. I left for a new company that pays me nearly double."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I dont quite remember the meeting room names in Mathilda 3 over at the Apple on Mathilda Ave, but if the MA03 (in the screenshot) refers to &#34;Mathilda 3&#34;, then this story is totally believable.I worked at Apple and it was absolutely horrible. I remember sitting on the train and actually thinking about killing myself. Reasons were many, but mostly I just didn&#39;t fit in there, I think.I felt like people there were also a bunch of whiny little bitches to be honest. Always having some problem with a hand or a back or some family problem or whatever which demanded that they take days off. There were a few people whom I felt were probably talking some shit behind my back, but I couldn&#39;t really believe it until I read this story. It was just a horrible horrible place and I can also recognize that thing about having a predecessor, who was apparently a &#34;bad person&#34; and thus had to be terminated.Every other day I would have people telling me how great a place it was and how lucky we were to be working in a place so big while still having that startup feeling. I have worked at startups and I always just imagined to myself that 40 year old &#34;dude&#34; who refuses to grow up. That is Apple..Never again.I got dragged through the whole white boarding experience also for the first time and it was fun enough, but in hindsight, they should just have asked me if I would suck Steve Jobs dick, if he came in that door. The answer to that question alone would have provided them with enough information about whether I would have been a good hire or not.I am 45 and have never every experienced a work place like that. Always had positive feedback and never had any problems with colleagues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is awful. I&#39;m sorry that happened to you. However,  If Apple refuse to take actions, I will interview with major media outlets describing the experience in more details and I will release a list of all individuals involved from senior management to the HR director and all the evidence as public record.

You&#39;re wasting your time if you think they&#39;re going to do anything with this kind of approach. Get a lawyer first before thinking on doing any of that, though.And let this be a reminder to everyone else that HR isn&#39;t there to help you - it&#39;s there to help the company.In this kind of environment it almost feels like one needs to record everything that&#39;s happening in order to defend themselves. Cops use cameras, maybe it&#39;s time for employees to start wearing them too. Maybe."</p>

They create ads offering your expert development services, ostensibly competing with your existing website, but with intentionally slashed pricing and a ‘creatively’ misrepresented offering (aka growth hacking). Then they subcontract the job to some crappy outsourcing firm that bungles it, but who cares, they got their cut and you signed the TOS.Now bad reviews are piling up online about the bad experiences people had with your business, your reputation is destroyed, and your business is next.I know it’s not a perfect analogy but try to empathize with the restaurants here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it would have been much better to outlaw misrepresentation and advertising without prior agreement (ie the pizza place that did not agree to partnership should only pop up in the search results if the user searches for it) and there should be a warning mandated like &#34;Startup Inc is not affiliated with the Moms and Pops Pizza. If you proceed, we will place your order by calling PHONE_NUMBER and pick up your order from ADDRESS&#34;. It should still be legal for the end users to have a service do chores for them including picking up food but only if there is no confusion on the side of the user what is happening here (incl. the fact the pizza may get cold through a no  fault of Moms and Pops Pizza).Edit: oh, the law would also outlaw food picking apps from delivering from Walmart too (&#34;The code defines food facility [...] as an operation that stores, [...] or otherwise provides food [...] at the retail level.&#34;)"</p>

It was a plugin to the VFS framework (KIO) the desktop and all the apps use, so it would also work e.g. in Open File dialogs from anywhere within the toolset.I remember using this regularly to mass-download the images embedded into a page - open the page this way by replacing http:// with a pseudo-protocol, copy all, paste, done.KDE always came with a lot of VFS trickery like that. Ripping a music CD into MP3s was similar - you&#39;d open the volume in the file manager and see your tracks along with a virtual folder full of MP3 files. The rip and encoding would happen on the fly, and you could do this e.g. straight from the file attach feature in an instant messenger.Desktop Linux was a lot less friendly to get working smoothly back then compared to now, and feature discovery was by word of mouth more than anything, but it sure felt like living in the future early."</p>

The one thing that&#39;s frustrated me is the relative black box that my browser represents, and writing a shim between my WM and browser tabs has been on my TODO list for a long, long time (through a couple of aborted attempts due to a combination of Chrome&#39;s at-the-time obsolete documentation and probably-necessary security model).I&#39;m cautiously optimistic that this is going to represent a dramatic step function in ease-of-use of my OS, in the same way that i3 was.EDIT: I should clarify that I did read the author&#39;s note that this is experimental, not secure, etc. I&#39;m mainly just excited about having a jumping-off point to play around with and possibly hack on a little."</p>

They routinely fail to catch harmful junk—I&#39;ve shut down a few top-grossing bogus antivirus apps for Mac, and the publisher of Untitled Goose Game routinely posts screenshots of clones that are trying to make money off confused users.They&#39;ve banned apps like Phone Story and a drone strike tracker for being &#34;objectionable and crude,&#34; yet they don&#39;t apply any content moderation to the Book Store or to Music or TV (or to Safari for that matter). They&#39;ve yet to provide a cogent justification for why they&#39;re inconsistent on this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I thought I should look at the App Store and see what this app is doing in comparison to similar apps.The logo is basically a big pill and the tagline &#34;Powerful keep-awake utility&#34; which is clearly alluding to the drug. https://imgur.com/a/RJXHaBaThis was consistent with the feedback the author received: &#34;[the] app appears to promote inappropriate use of controlled substances. Specifically, your app name and icon include references to controlled substances, pills&#34;Almost all of the other top apps in the app store in the same category use some reference to caffeine either in the name or tagline or description (e.g. &#34;Jolt of Caffeine&#34; or &#34;Owly&#34; which has a logo of an owl in a cup of coffee) https://imgur.com/a/yySBqELThere&#39;s one other, much less popular app called &#34;Coca&#34; which appears to reference cocaine, but doesn&#39;t also have a drug-referencing icon or tagline, and which only has 15 reviews. By comparison, Amphetamine seems to be the most popular result, at least for the search term &#34;awake&#34;, with 1.37K reviewsThe guideline in question doesn&#39;t seem to consider excessive use of caffeine as problematic to encourage. &#34;1.4.3 Apps that encourage consumption of tobacco and vape products, illegal drugs, or excessive amounts of alcohol are not permitted on the App Store. Apps that encourage minors to consume any of these substances will be rejected. Facilitating the sale of marijuana, tobacco, or controlled substances (except for licensed pharmacies) isn’t allowed.&#34;Overall, Amphetamine did seem to be pushing the drug-use angle much harder than other apps in the category based on the logo, tagline and title, especially if you consider caffeine abuse not problematic.Added: I don&#39;t have a strong opinion on this one either way, other than edgy naming has pros and cons. Word of mouth is easier, but sometimes a problem like this happens."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A fun anecdote from my youth near a US seaboard was that our elementary and middle school buildings were designed by the same person who designed a few prisons around the area.When I bounced around cities later in life, I was surprised at how many of my peers said the same thing as a conversation piece.Maybe they used the same governmental bidding process. &#34;Needed: a building. One food preparation and eating area. Hallways suitable for lining up and proceeding in rows with many small rooms. One yard with sporting facilities.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who&#39;s been to prison and school, lots of comments here sound pretty tone deaf. Prison in the USA is really bad. Yes school is authoritarian, but most popular entertainment on prisons downplays how bad it really gets. Watch some interviews of people who have actually been to prison. Murder and rape is common (I saw it happen), you will get your possessions stolen under the threat of murder/rape, you&#39;ll probably spend 10-30% of your time in solitary confinement for reasons outside your control (torture according to human rights groups: I&#39;ve been there, I&#39;d prefer nonpermanent torture), you have to learn violence and get into fights with people who might be carrying a knife or else get taken advantage of indefinitely, ... It&#39;s bad. And psychologically, you have no freedom whatsoever: no you cannot poop or drink water whenever you want to. You can only poop when your cellie isn&#39;t around (1-2h/day). You will be abused by prison staff (false accusations, physical abuse, food deprivation, ..)The whole thing is an abomination. It serves no useful purpose to society to subject most criminals to prison: it doesn&#39;t serve as a deterrent (based on talking to ~50 prisoners about this), it only radicalizes them further against &#34;the system&#34;, making it easier for them to break further laws.Why don&#39;t we have more outrage against this outdated institution created out of 1600 era values?The amount of human suffering it creates... It&#39;s astounding. Most prisoners would probably rather a super old school punishment like chopping off their arm over the prison sentence they get. And it would be more effective."</p>

Working for a company that is publicly known enough for people on HN (and Reddit) to comment about it. It has been hilarious and scary to read comments from people who don&#39;t work at the company say completely inaccurate things like they are facts.In this case, it&#39;s easy for me to recognize they are wrong. But what about other topics (or companies) I don&#39;t know much about? I have no easy way of recognizing inaccuracies so I default to mostly accepting them. Sadly, you need to be skeptical of almost everything you read even when the person sounds like they know the subject matter."</p>

Be it metalwork, mountain biking, computing, drones or any other hobby regularly discussed online.The reality is you can make do with in so many different ways that if you can&#39;t afford the best you can still have oodles of fun on cheaper equipment. Half the fun is learning all this &#34;expertise&#34; the internet has on your own.Can&#39;t afford a Bridgeport mill? Buy something cheaper and work around the edge cases. Can&#39;t afford a full suspension bike? Get a hardtail and have tonnes of fun.Someone is always quick to add in the caveats, but guess what, a new rider doesn&#39;t give a shit that he can&#39;t send 8ft drops on his hard tail. There are hours of fun on the bike ahead, none of it sending 8ft drops.

They are not normal people from a statical standpoint.On average a person does not do any one spicific thing.Everyone online has contributed to the internet, everyone has written something and everyone has excersised.I&#39;ve seen this brought up before that only 2-3% of redditors contribute, like it&#39;s a bad thing or a unique thing.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Chimera section claims:&gt; Pangolins and bats don&#39;t usually cohabitate, making this somewhat unlikely in nature.Horseshoe bats are nocturnal animals that roost in caves during the day but sometimes practice perch feeding at night [1]:&gt; The other strategy is known as perch feeding: Individuals roost on feeding perches and wait for prey to fly past, then fly out to capture it.Pangolins [2] and palm civets [3] are nocturnal and arboreal. The bat viral RNA sequences come from anal swabs of netted animals so they are primarily gastrointestinal infections. All of these animals are found in the Lancang/Mekong [4] catch basin. Bat guano seems like a good vector for the virus.Gain-of-function experiments require two viral isolates that recombine during passage. The lab theory assumes that the RNA sequence of the original viral isolates were never shared. I find this scenario unlikely but I am open to changing my mind based on evidence. SARS-1 is evidence of a very similar zoonotic scenario.Humans that encounter bat guano in this region also seem like a good host for a recombination event.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_bat#Diet_and_foragin...[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangolin#Behavior[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_palm_civet#Feeding_and_d...[4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mekong"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Whenever this topic comes up, the discussion seems to consist largely of _extremely_ strong opinions against the perfectly plausible hypothesis (don&#39;t forget, the evidence of zoonotic origin is equally thin on the ground).My question is, why? What does it matter whether the virus originated from a lab or from a wet market - it isn&#39;t any more dangerous if it came from a lab, nor does knowing the origin really help dealing with this crisis at all.It is certainly interesting to know where it did originate, and that knowledge could inform a debate on the future of (respectively) wet markets and animal husbandry practices, or BSL facilities, but these don&#39;t strike me as particularly emotionally charged topics, and in any case the posts I&#39;m referring to don&#39;t mention these debates...Anybody care to explain why you would respond so strongly to claims of lab origin?"</p>

You really can&#39;t expect any sort of reasonable sensor technologies to detect wide ranges of potentially harmful contaminants in water supplies while you can use mussels, clams, etc. as biological sensors--the modern &#34;canary in a coal mine.&#34;I worked with a research project that was sensing, collecting and analyzing types of mussels in rivers that were used as an indirect measurement of water quality in the river. The assumption is that the mussels can act as a proxy for certain contaminants. In fact, they actually filter a lot of water daily so you can occasionally analyze one as to what sort of contaminants it absorbed as a proxy for whats probably in the water.Meanwhile, water intakes typically only monitor for known and suspected contaminants. They have to rely on other indirect measurements like changes conductivity as a signal to analyze the water and these are noisy and fairly unreliable compositional change detection proxies.Neat stuff."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I agree with most of the points raised by the author but as a Venezuelan Bitcoin is a godsend. If you live abroad and want to send remittances to your friends and family it can be pretty easy in a normal country , with wire transfers,western union and so on. If your family lives in Venezuela your options are extremely more limited.These are some of the options Venezuelans have had to use:1. Ask the money to be sent to Colombia with WU and then travel hundreds of kms to get  what usually amounts to a few hundred dollars at most.2. Use Zelle, send dollars in the US, and receive Bolivares in Venezuela. But for that you need to have an US bank account, and find a person you can trust also with an US bank account and plenty of highly volatile Bolivares in Venezuela willing to make the exchange.3. Use paypal, same as above with way higher commissions and the risk that paypal (and the other person) will fuck you.4. Buy Amazon gift cards and use the same schema above, be exposed to scams and high commisions fees.Trading bitcoins in say localbitcoins.com, you have a very liquid market and somewhat secure transactions (Bitcoins are not liberated until you check the money is in the Venezuela account). There are risks of course, especially because of BTC volatility but at least is a fast,convenient,widespread option. I wish something like that, only more stable and with less of that Tulip-craze whiff BTC has."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bought my smartphone from Hong Kong, in part because I wanted a specific variant that would be more likely to work with open-source ROM&#39;s.The seller initially requested payment via Transferwise, who sought crazy amounts of personal information and bullied me into a privacy-hostile customer agreement.  Days went by and they still hadn&#39;t activated my account.Growing frustrated, I convinced the seller to accept Bitcoin, which was comparatively instant.  The phone arrived a few days later, meanwhile the Transferwise morons still had their heads up their arses with no movement and no good explanation.  I&#39;m not a financial risk; I&#39;m a good little citizen with no red flags.  Reading between the lines my sense was their staff were overloaded or their onboarding system was simply broken.Bitcoin was incredibly helpful for me that day, and my favorite feature about the phone is the way I paid.  In addition to a great story, I&#39;ve got to admit there was something liberating and empowering about giving what felt like a big middle finger to the slow, decrepit, old-fashioned institution who couldn&#39;t even deliver on their core business proposition.  Like saying &#34;screw you, I don&#39;t need you and your crappy service anymore, come back when you can compete on merits&#34;.Whatever else you criticize about Bitcoin, it&#39;s still &#34;cash you can email&#34;, and even if that&#39;s all it ever amounts to I still find it a bloody useful innovation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have no idea what he is talking about.I use bitcoin to buy things both onchain and via lightning and the experience is so smooth and much much better than the circa 2017 period when fees were high. Don&#39;t keep it on exchange. The real thing that is stopping adoption is countries trying to classify it as a commodity and insist to pay capital gains on every microtransaction. Some countries are backwards (US, UK) than the others. Germany and few other countries are forward looking. No VAT on bitcoin transactions and no CGT if held for a year."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a *nix sysadmin since before Google was a thing, I find articles like this frustrating and arguably dangerous.They lay out a set of &#34;rules&#34; the author has collated as a dogmatic doctrine that only a fool would not follow. But they provide no &#34;why&#34;, take absolutely no context in to account, and talk only about their perceived upsides.Anyone reading this should take each point as &#34;here&#39;s a possible thing you should go and research yourself&#34;, because there are consequences to most of these rules.I&#39;m not saying anything they&#39;ve written is wrong (though there is a lot of unsubstantiated opinion there), just that you should learn what any of these changes truly do before implementing them AND that your particular context is really important.Edit:There is a disclaimer at the top which mustn&#39;t be forgotten while reading.&gt; DISCLAIMER: Do not attempt to apply anything in this article if you do not know exactly what you are doing. This guide is focused purely on security and privacy, not performance, usability, or anything else.I do appreciate people putting work into producing this sort of content, but I think the article could be improved by phrasing the various steps as suggestions and perhaps linking out to more detailed documentation on the &#34;why&#34; elsewhere."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some omissions IMO: never let people SSH in with a password, and for the love of god, stop leaving private SSH keys on servers. Privat SSH keys should never leave your physical proximity. They should be on your laptop, or desktop, or your yubikey, but never on servers. Also SSH agent forwarding is the devil. Don&#39;t do it.Lots of really braindead advice in there too, like disabling RDRAND because there might be a backdoor.. come on.. even Linus knows that&#39;s obvious bullshit.[1][1] https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/09/11/rudest-man-in-li..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This list is cool, but I think it would be more useful with some quick notes on side effects. I think all but the most hardcore Linux lovers won&#39;t have enough breadth and depth to understand the full ramifications of many of these config changes.I&#39;m no Linux expert but even having used it for a fair number of years, I only have a shallow understanding of most of the things that are tweaked here, if I&#39;ve even heard of them at all. For example, it says &#34;kernel.kexec_load_disabled=1&#34;, and points out the threat which I can understand, but I don&#39;t know what that&#39;s used for in the first place. Perhaps it isn&#39;t really ever used for anything, but it&#39;d be nice to be told that, because my initial line of thinking is that these defaults must be defaults for a reason and that makes me hesitant to actually make any of the changes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In 2004 my brother and I developed a buttplug shaped like George W. Bush - we called it the Bushplug. Manufacturing was more expensive than we had expected but we sold about 100 of them - presumably as novelty gifts. Our price point was too high for a novelty gift and the nose was a little too pointy to be an enjoyable sex toy. We made our money back and had some fun with being featured on BoingBoing and Fleshbot. Someone tried to sue us. We sent the last of the Bushplugs to the Smithsonian&#39;s presidential museum. We made our investment back but didn&#39;t become buttplug millionaires."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I built a Tinder-like matchmaking app where users log in with their Facebook account and the app then auto-matches users by their FB likes. I thought taking the hassle out of swiping could give my app an edge over Tinder.It was working fine for a week or so before Facebook caught up and revoked my API keys (effectively killing the app). They didn&#39;t give any reason besides some vague recommendation to review their Terms of Service. A few months later at their F8 developer conference they announced they&#39;ll be launching their own matchmaking service which will work pretty the same way I built my app.Moral of the story: never trust big tech.P.S. I open sourced the app a few years ago: https://bitbucket.org/stonepillarstudios/workspace/projects/...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In 2006/2007 I built HTMLButcher, a C++ desktop application to slice PSD/image website designs made by designers to HTML.
 In these years sites where made with tables, so for slicing a design I had to cut the images and fit then into borderless HTML tables.
I took 2 years to build it, and in this timeframe people started building sematic websites with CSS, and abandoning table-based designs.
I managed to sell 100 copies, for some reason 90% to India.
After some years without selling nothing, I open sourced it: https://github.com/RangelReale/htmlbutcher.
The good thing is that I REALLY learned C++ with this project, and this knowledge was the basis for my current company where I made a digitalsignage application in C++ that runs in some of the largest DOOH places in Brazil, in Windows, Linux and MAC (targets of HTMLButcher). So in the end it was a good investment!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The tweet mentions that you could &#39;just&#39; send an SWF file to someone and it played. Well, if anybody had to fix a computer, or hosted anything Flash-based during that era, then they would know that&#39;s bullshit. Sure maybe with the standalone Flash player it worked allright, but that&#39;s not how people really used Flash. Even in my experience, a single SWF running locally didn&#39;t always work across all versions of Flash player.Flash on the web only worked if you had Flash player plugin installed. Both browser and Flash updates themselves would break the Flash plugin constantly. That was across all browsers and platforms. Keeping plugins updated and reliable was a mess, for a long time there weren&#39;t even auto updates.Flash was a mess the whole time. Let&#39;s not pretend that it ever really &#34;just worked&#34; because it didn&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is true but it is a common misunderstanding imo. Nobody is arguing a tool like Flash shouldn’t exist; it should. People are arguing a runtime like Flash shouldn’t exist, and that HTML5 has all of the components that are needed to be that runtime and then some. A tool should give us what Flash did but with the HTML runtime.So why doesn’t that tool exist?Well... as far as I know it does. I’m pretty sure this is exactly what Adobe Animate is meant to be:https://www.adobe.com/products/animate.htmlSo why isn’t it causing a Flash-style revolution?In my opinion... Because of YouTube. Twitter. Etc.Before everyone had heaps of bandwidth, you needed to consume smaller files. A full 1080p video was unfathomable with the codecs, compute and network bandwidth available in the early 2000s. Swf files however were small and easy to distribute. The perfect storm occurred due to the structure of early internet, and communities like Newgrounds flourished.I honestly think Flash just got a bit stale. It stopped being new and exciting, and for animations video sites were probably going to win out anyways. For games, a lot of indie devs now target PCs and game consoles. Unity and Construct export to HTML5. People wanted to do more advanced things to the point where Flash itself started doing things like 3D rendering, at which point the appealing aspects of Flash started to make less sense anyways.Many seem to argue passionately, probably from an emotional place, that Flash was killed. Honestly, I just don’t agree. Flash was dying either way. Everyone just gradually decided to cut off the life support.The era it ushered in will be missed, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve come across a lot of similar sentiment from ex-Flash devs, who romanticise its heyday as a period of fertile creativity (true) and say that HTML5/JS/CSS/SVG is an inadequate replacement (false).In truth, the fundamental capabilities of the modern web platform matches and typically exceeds anything that was offered by Flash. What these people are really lamenting is the ease of authorship that Flash provided to non-technical users.Macromedia/Adobe provided a suite of powerful tools for authoring Flash animations and applications. There is no free equivalent available targeting HTML/JS. This is not a problem of capability in the platform technologies. It is because there is no economic incentive to make and give away such tools. What equivalents do exist in this sector cost money.When it comes to Flash, the old adage, &#34;if you&#39;re not paying for the product, you are the product&#34; holds true. The Flash authorship tools were free because 3rd party authors creating Flash content were assisting in the promulgation of a proprietary platform that was gradually replacing open web standards. Had they succeeded, Macromedia/Adobe would inevitably have looked to squeeze and monetise their domination of the web.Programmers are often accused of not understanding what Flash offered to artists. Maybe that&#39;s true, but I&#39;ve not encountered many artists who conversely understand the above."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To me, what sucks about JIRA (and would suck about any well-designed tool that replaces it) is not &#34;feature x&#34; but the entire JIRA mentality. All of it.It encourages micro-management. It encourages more and more process. It is the enemy of getting better at the DORA metrics, which requires streamlining process.tickets in JIRA are not the work itself, never was and never will be, it is a LARP of the work, but it gets taken for the central thing. This is an illusion.  Fixing a bug without filing a JIRA ticket is in itself progress. Moving a JIRA card without any other change is not. Yet the second is what&#39;s visible and therefor what&#39;s rewarded.Any problem gets solved with &#34;more JIRA &#34; which stops working when the remaining problems are caused by too much JIRA. And yet they keep trying, because it gives &#34;control&#34;. JIRA is a like metastatic tumour that will grow until it kills the host.In case the cancer metaphor didn&#39;t make it very clear, I don&#39;t like JIRA much. Yet if JIRA were to die today, the middle management who live by JIRA would replace it with something else equally bad, if not worse.Filling in missing features won&#39;t and can&#39;t fix that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a hundred small issues with Jira, but there&#39;s one huge one:  It&#39;s slow. Really, really slow.Atlassian seems to make a lot of money, so I guess they&#39;re optimising for something that matters to someone, but from my point of view I have a simple process for evaluating tools:1) Can I use it at all? 2) How many of the features I want does it have?I&#39;m pretty sure Jira would score great on the second question, but since it hard fails the first, I&#39;ll never know. And it&#39;s been slow for so many years now, I assume they have no interest or ability to fix it. And their slow drift towards cloud installs over letting people self host isn&#39;t helping them either since, embarrassingly, their cloud instances seem to be even slower.(Incidentally, there&#39;s a lot of competition in that space, but I&#39;ve been pretty happy with Clubhouse. I wouldn&#39;t mind a few more features, but it&#39;s good enough. More importantly, the UI is clean and snappy, and that hides a multitude of sins.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every bullet point says &#34;Missing...&#34;, but I feel like the main issue about Jira is that it has waaay to many features, and that it&#39;s super slow!The only bullet point I do agree with, is that Jira is missing an easy (or IMHO a minimalist / simple) interface. The tool is a mess, and the people using it are probably also using it in the wrong way, making the whole situation way worse.Don&#39;t get me wrong, I like Jira to some extent, but its performance and messy UI are really making my life harder rather than simpler."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Slightly off topic:Something funny is happening in my native Belgium. Some people drop their fifth formal working day to become bicycle couriers, Uber drivers or whatnot in the &#34;sharing economy&#34;. The reason is taxation regimes.80% or 100% gross wage as a median income employee will hardly make any difference in net wage around there. A friend for example recently got a promotion from an entry level job (with tax discounts) to something more in line with her qualifications (without tax discounts). 600€ gross salary increase translated to 155€ net salary increase. All the rest got eaten by tax and social contributions increases.Belgium combines high formal job taxes combine with a low tax scheme meant to formalise &#34;sharing economy&#34; jobs. These enjoy super low 10% taxation up to 500€ per month. Many people actually do the math. They switch to 80% formal jobs hardly losing any income. Some actually increase their income by becoming pizza couriers or Uber drivers in their 20% time...UPDATED: corrected the net wage delta from 100 to 155€."</p>

I&#39;m kind of partial to this idea myself.But increasingly we seem a long way from achieving this. Amazon reviews have become such garbage, I&#39;ve fallen back to pretty much relying on name brands as my placeholder for product quality.There&#39;s still a lot to be said for established brands. Brands can afford widespread advertising because they have thriving businesses that generate lots of cash. Brands can get stocked in major retailers because you need decent products to make it through Walmart&#39;s buying process.These are signals that are harder to fake, and they&#39;re kind of the best we&#39;ve got right now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Skip the Amazon resellers and order direct from China on Alibaba. Their reputation system is less spammy than Amazon&#39;s.One of my areas to watch: solid state relays.Here we have yet another fake Fotek solid state relay on Amazon.[1] Note the &#34;Made in China&#34;.Here&#39;s the real thing.[2] Note the &#34;Taiwan made&#34; from the real Fotek. Costs a lot more.
That&#39;s because it will actually handle the rated current. The fakes are notorious for overheating and burning out. The real thing has overheat and surge protection, will shut off if it overheats, and can stand a big short term overload for motor starting or when a short is in the process of tripping the circuit breaker upstream.Here&#39;s a similar solid state relay from China, from the actual manufacturer.They actually provide a table which shows how much they
exaggerate the ratings. They&#39;re over-rated by 2X for
a resistive load, and 6x for an inductive load.
&#34;For a motor with rated current of 15A and the motor
is inductive load, the formula is 15A x 6 = 90A, so
you should choose to buy 100A solid state relay&#34;.For a little extra, you can have your own fake label. Minimum order 200 pcs.Here&#39;s a fake Fotek.[4] What&#39;s amusing is that this is the actual manufacturer in China selling the fakes. They&#39;re in Guangdong, and they&#39;re selling under their own name, but with a fake label. No shame.There are legit manufacturers in China selling solid state relays.[5] They put their own name on the product, show pictures of the inside their rather grubby factory, and have realistic numbers on their data sheets, along with pictures of UL certification documents. About 4x more expensive than the fakes. If you&#39;re in China and are building industrial equipment which needs these components, you need ones that won&#39;t fail and shut down a manufacturing line.Here&#39;s a teardown of a fake.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the biggest problems in science (in general) is that your reputation and therefore funding is highly tied to a particular subfield.  Everyone in a subfield knows each other and gives positive grant reviews and external tenure letters to other practitioners.  If you try to move on to new areas of research, your reputation and funding are gone.  The outcome is that areas of research interest become quasi-permanent, even when they are no longer interesting. I talk to the people today that still work in my specialty of nuclear physics (relativistic heavy ion physics) and I&#39;m shocked at how little intellectual progress has been made.  At the risk of offending people it&#39;s time to give up and declare victory, but the consequences would be dire (hundreds of professors all over the world without grants)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In computer science, researchers who had spent decades working on feature engineering for images got completely blown out of the water by deep learning.  All those decades of papers would never get another cite.  Everyone moved on.String theory doesn&#39;t actually do anything though, so there&#39;s no way to say it&#39;s better or worse than anything else.  It&#39;s like someone saying they&#39;re working on solving the halting problem or something and eventually they&#39;ll get there and they&#39;ve been working on it for 20 years without any code that actually works.  At some point, you just have to give up and do something else.  They keep getting grants to work on this stuff though for some reason.  Someone needs to interview the people who are giving out string theory grants and ask them why the heck they are still giving these people money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"1. Don&#39;t try too hard to make science funding more efficient / market lead or whatever - just fund more - double the science budget tomorrow And again every five years for a generation.  We are about to go through a societal refactoring with solar / electric / digital / climate change hitting at once.  Spending a few quid to help out the fundamentals won&#39;t hurt anyone.2. The above might upset people but string theory is a good example - partly yes people are held hostage by funding (much like it&#39;s hard to avoid being typecast as an actor).  But the solution to that is to fund lots more (experimental) movies, not to hope studio heads can pick better winners.I am perfectly happy for a slice of my tax dollar to go on someone thinking about Pram theory (#) for a decade simply because we have no idea whatsoever how to tackle the big ones in physics, so spray and pray is going to be a lot better than most other options.(#) Red Dwarf episode. worth watching episode just for this joke."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As long as companies Apple are not legally responsible for their supply chain in front of developed countries’ courts nothing will change. In Switzerland a law that would have changed this was recently rejected. Hopefully another country makes the first step."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Recently, Apple&#39;s supplier, Wistron faced revolt after treating workers unfairly here in India. And India is not really the most shining example of protecting our workers from unfair and harsh working conditions. So, if such treatments don&#39;t fly here, I don&#39;t think they will fly anywhere else. The kind of labor expectation that these companies have after their stints in China is ethically incompatible with most other countries. So, I can&#39;t see the condition improving in the near future, companies will continue chasing profits at all cost and China will remain the most fertile ground to do that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Traditionally slavery was an alternative to death for the conquered.  I&#39;m morbidly curious what the effects of all Western corporations banning slave labor would be.  I doubt it would result in liberation.  Would working conditions for the slaves worsen when they worked for local, lower-margin factories instead?  I can&#39;t imagine them improving.I have little faith in legal remedies to liberate slaves.  Arming them seems the only long-term effective solution.  Otherwise the man with the gun will order the slave back to work the second the man in the wig isn&#39;t looking.  And the man in the wig will remain silent, to avoid revealing his impotence.Slave labor is inefficient, so perhaps the best way is to topple inefficient slave societies through full-spectrum competition, from military to economic.  This pressure incentivizes efficient human resource utilization.One thing&#39;s for sure:  Individual Westerner guilt over whether to buy the next iPhone will add zero value."</p>

Allows them to get more widespread level of some protection with dose 1 before later boosting protection."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks like they approved the two-dose 62% ~effective~ efficacy  regiment.There was a lot of hope for the one-dose given the supply constraints or a retrial for the more promising half+full dose for greater efficacy.I wonder if people will ask which vaccine they&#39;re receiving. 62% is kinda underwhelming when there&#39;s two 95% ones (Pfizer/Moderna), a 92% one (Gamaleya), and a 79-86% one (Sinopharm). With the latter two also not needing subzero temps."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazing news, and so happy to see a lot of good sense here from the UK.They have distanced themselves from the US with the fastest approvals of Pfizer and Astrazeneca, the smartest targeting of the population (a focus on saving lives by targeting most vulnerable groups first), and the enormously helpful focus on getting some immunity first before worrying about second doses.The UK is no longer constrained by manufactured doses or anything else. The faster they put that existing supply into people, the faster they are done.  They could be done with the pandemic by the end of January."</p>

Wikileaks does not concern itself with this phase. Yet, the CIA’s Pompeo is trying to paint a narrative that Wikileaks is doing this by labeling them a “non-state intelligence agency”, thereby justifying the CIA’s actions to attack Wikileaks.In brief:Narrative #1 - the CIA attacking an “Idealistic Free Information Publisher”.Narrative #2 - the CIA attacking a “Non-state Dark Intelligence Agency”The CIA is actively trying to create Narrative #2, which is a bit concerning."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m one of those people who is entirely bemused by violent videogames and films (I&#39;m sure there are plenty of people who would be bemused by my pastimes too). I&#39;m not trying to argue to stop anyone doing it, but I would really like to understand it better.Many video games are essentially simulators of things that we&#39;re prevented from doing in reality, because of the laws of nature or society. Whether that&#39;s dropping blocks into place, building a city, chasing and eating ghosts, flying a plane, performing magic spells, or engaging in physical violence.And there&#39;s a never-ending push to make experiences more photorealistic, to make simulator even better. From that I can only conclude that people want to get as close to the experience of perfoming the prevented act as possible.Chopping someone up is heavily frowned upon in real life, but perfectly acceptable to emulate in someone&#39;s living room. Somehow the simulation escapes the taboo. And that escape seems to be absolute: In the range of violent acts you could commit, from a gentle nudge to grisly murder, simulation of the most extreme extent is permitted.But if that&#39;s the case, why is the realistic simulation of some societal taboos (e.g. physical violence to the point of murder) mainstream, but others (e.g. sexual violence in any of its forms) not? They are both very serious offences, but somehow one gets a free pass to let anyone pretend to do it, but the other not.Is it a reflection on the ultimate limits of those taboos in the society that produces most of these games? Or is my logic broken somewhere?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of when I was at grad student in that area. It was really frustrating to read all of the studies from e.g. Anderson and Bushman asserting the links between violent media and aggression.These publications were headline-grabbing, but some of the study design was laughable. The whole state of affairs led me to leave the discipline (which led me to a career as a software engineer). I&#39;m glad that I did, because the reproducibility crisis hit hard within a few years of me deciding to do something else with my life.Some of the studies that I read made me think that there was a link between frustration (caused by e.g. undesirable outcomes in videogames, or performance issues like high latency) and aggression, but of course the researchers assumed it was the violence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s worse than I thought. They measure &#34;aggressive behavior&#34; based on a questionnaire.They look for a correlation between the &#34;class&#34; of gamer; literally &#34;people who play a lot at younger ages, drop, and then increase&#34;, &#34;people who play a moderate amount at younger ages, drop and then slightly increase&#34;, and &#34;people who play only a little bit at a young age but increase&#34; and report no correlation between those classes and the aggression assessment based on the questionnaire.I admire the fact that they didn&#39;t do more work to p-hack their way into a correlation; they went with one methodology and showed that it didn&#39;t produce a correlation, and reported that. But even though I agree with the article&#39;s conclusion, I don&#39;t think the data support it in any meaningful way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I didn&#39;t know who Boston Dynamics was, I would have said that this is just CGI. The animations look so fake. I think the issue is that they&#39;re aggressively smoothing the motion since mechanical systems don&#39;t have the ability to accelerate &amp; jerk as fast as biological systems. Cheap mocap animation has the same problem because the frame rate of the capture system is too low.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked at a company that heavily used the maps API in 2018. The 1,400% price hike really was an eye opener. It wasn&#39;t just the money involved, which was large, but the fact that it came so suddenly and with so much magnitude.Google&#39;s choice to bump these prices made me realize that they could do the same thing with their compute cloud pricing or other APIs, again with little notice. That, in turn, led to the realization that we needed to remove our reliance on Google&#39;s entire stack, and quickly, or we&#39;d be in a terrible bargaining position later.This one choice by the maps team likely cost Google significantly in the medium to long term, if any other companies realized the same things we did."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really want to use Apple Maps full time on my iPhone, just because of how much clutter Google Maps has accumulated on the screen.If anything tells me Google is losing the ability to innovate it&#39;s the newly added pill buttons for pre-set searches and branded POIs on the map. I remember when this was added to MapQuest circa 2010, and was the transition from trying to have an excellent mapping experience to just adding revenue focused features.Google is still operating from an extremely strong position, by nature of having nearly infinite budget and owning their mapping and search dataset. It&#39;s concerning that the iOS app seems to be suffering from the same issues that preceded the gradual downfall of MapQuest from a product perspective."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great article, but I think the conclusion about Google Maps languishing because it’s a low margin product is wrong.While Google Maps as a distinct product has a bottom and top line I think the author underestimates the value that the underlying places data has for Google’s core search product.The local place data is _massivley_ important to search. I don’t see any foreseeable way Google let’s the product that generates it languish. It’s far too strategic for them. Not to mention the amount of brand value maps has for them as an ecosystem.My view is that as Google’s Maps advantage dwindles, they’ll do more and more strategic acquisitions of places data sources. Tying more data into their closed ecosystem. Whether the new tech anti-trust landscape in the US and EU allows this is another question."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In-person social organizations.Social isolation is probably the biggest cause of unhappiness in advanced countries. Having a strong social network has lots of advantages including providing better romantic and career opportunities, as well as improving physical and psychological health.Humans have a long history of dishing out lots of money to be parts of strong communities too--country clubs and fraternities have high fees. Church goers regularly give up 10% of their (gross) income to be part of that group. Cult members might even hand over ALL of their possessions to join.The camaraderie and experiences that go along with being part of a strong, long lived community tends to be the thing people value most in life. Yet finding those communities has become increasingly difficult in the modern era. People move away to different cities, or just don&#39;t run into the same set of people everyday. With the rise of remote work, social disconnection is only going to rise. I think there&#39;s a lot of room to create new social organizations with pretty minimal technology, and make a pretty profit from doing so. Humans are still human--they want those connections--they mostly just need an introduction."</p>

It is so incredibly frustrating to look outside the Apple ecosystem and feel like the entire PC industry is content to sell the bare minimum of quality (outside of Gamer hardware, which looks obscene - but I get that it&#39;s subjective).It&#39;s a horrible business idea on the numbers and nobody would do this, but if some lunatic out there wants to blow the money, build and sell a laptop at whatever price point you want that:- Supports CoreBoot- Isn&#39;t a rebranded Clevo shell and has close enough fit and finish to a recent MacBook. Read: No. Plastic. Case.- If there is ever the phrase &#34;panel lottery&#34; uttered about your machine, you&#39;ve messed up.- No logos, or throw them on the underside like Purism.- The screen has to be relatively close to the MacBook in brightness + viewing angles. Give me an option for a glossy screen.- Trackpad must be glass. You won&#39;t get close to the MBP trackpad on the first or second pass, but try.- Go for some crazier vertical integration ala the M1. I don&#39;t care if it blocks upgrading certain parts, since I consider the industry to move fast enough that I won&#39;t _want_ the machine anymore in 4-5 years.- There is no need for touch of any kind, nor the ability to flip the screen or anything. Just make a damn laptop.- Edit: high quality boutique feeling support. I don&#39;t need an Apple Store equivalent, but at least invest in this.I get why Apple can do all of the above. I would pay literally twice what I pay Apple for a competing product. Currently, every laptop that I try feels like stepping back a few years.The upcoming Purism Librem 14, in terms of images, feels like it could _feel_ close - but I&#39;m not impressed with their other products so I&#39;ll believe it when I see it.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Standardized interchangeable packaging for consumer goods.Ever been to a book store in Japan? Practically every book is the same size. As a result, bookshelves also are designed to be the right size to optimally fit books. This allows people to fit more books in small homes. It makes books easier to transport in book-sized boxes and book-sized bags too. You can get perfectly-fitting reusable cloth covers to protect your library books.American bookstores are a war between publishers to stick out from the shelves as much as possible. There&#39;s not much that a bookshelf designer can do except guess and have adjustable, oversized shelving.That also describes the state of today&#39;s packaging. With more shopping happening online, the need for items to stand out on a shelf is lower, and the need for them to fit nicely in boxes is much higher.Nobody would force you to design your products to fit the closest available standard package size, but companies would tend to do so more often because of the efficiency gains. Logistics companies like Amazon or Fedex could offer incentives."</p>

&gt; I&#39;m super bored in lockdown. Add a Raspberry Pi 400 and a few tiny displays...I feel like there are two distinct kinds of lockdown experience. One, you have kids, and you have absolutely no free time because now your kids are home and you&#39;re working from home. Two, you don&#39;t have kids, and you&#39;re super bored every day. Seems like not much in between."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is a weird spot in the display market that is painful as a embedded developer:Displays under 400x240 pixels, usually the gfx buffer can be managed in the ram of the MCU. Nothing fancy needed, can get decent framerate on SPI bus running at 16 MHz. Anything above this range gets super ugly: no good displays exist and if they do, they&#39;re expensive or outdated (800x480 resolution is basically impossible to obtain). Furthermore, driving this display requires crazy shit like multiple SPI channels (QSPI), or some neutered version of DSI protocol...impossible to find docs for and if they have docs, theyre in Chinese.Then there are ultra high resolution displays, for e.g. cell phone market or laptop screens. You&#39;re now looking an entirely different beast. MIPI/DSI hardware support is required and a bunch of NDAs, need dedicated GPU and a proper linux running.Ideal display tech would be 5&#34;inch diagonal, OLED (low power consumption), 800x480 (or similar) and can be run using ARM Cortex-M4 or similar microcontroler arch. That would open up opportunities for so many device categories that doesn&#39;t exist today. Imagine a VT100 terminal clone running on 8&#34; 1024x768 resolution screen with a cheap ESP32 + display driver chip. Or a slightly more beefy Cortex-M7 running zephyr/linux. So many things we could build."</p>

If you use offsets and you’re on page 10, and someone deletes an item on page 1, the whole list shifts and you can accidentally skip an item on page 11. Likewise if someone adds an item on page 1 and you’re on page 10, one of the page 10 items will also show up on page 11.Cursors elegantly sidestep these issues."</p>

It gives customer a clear overview of how many products there are and customer can also navigate faster to get a better understanding of what general prices are. If the table/list doesn&#39;t have good filters, customer can easily act out binary search to find what they are looking for in an ordered list of items.Same with highscores, forums threads and other similar things. Say you are browsing highscores and you want to see what scores are around 10000th position etc.As a user I find having only prev/next buttons a bit claustrophobic in this case. I think UX should trump whatever performance gains there are from it."</p>

Assuming everyone knew one of their grandparents, it&#39;s more like 40 interpersonal &#34;links&#34;.I honestly feel like if Europe didn&#39;t have the Early Middle Ages (~500-1000AD), we would feel pretty connected to all the history that happened before in the same way that we feel pretty connected to Copernicus developing Heliocentrism or Columbus arriving in the New World.I wonder whether civilizations with seemingly more continuous histories like China feel more connection to the rest of their history. India&#39;s history was sort of interrupted by Islamic invasions starting from the 1200s. The Middle East, despite its tremendously long history, experienced a significant shift in culture with the rise of Christianity and then Islam.If Chinese people don&#39;t feel that historical connection, on the other hand, it might mean that our disconnect with ancient history might more just be a product of Modernity and the rapid change of the last couple centuries."</p>

If I think a coworker saved me on some project, I tell them. If my partner is making me feel warm and fuzzy, I tell her. If someone impresses me, I say so. I don’t think people express these things nearly as often as they feel them, and I expect that many of the positive things that do end up communicated have another motive behind them. Simple earnest positive comments are very much worthwhile."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been on the receiving end of such gratitude, and it always brightens my day. It&#39;s easy to think your hard work isn&#39;t noticed, until you realize how seldom you acknowledge other people&#39;s work.Unfortunately, explicit gratitude is very rare. Donations are even rarer. The &#34;ask a question&#34; and &#34;support this site&#34; buttons on my website are next to each other. I get 15 questions for every donation. About 30€ per 100 000 visitors, from 1-3 visitors. Those who email me with questions never donate. I&#39;m not complaining about any of this, just illustrating my point: you can&#39;t use gratitude as a metric for the value of your work.Critics, on the other hand, are disproportionately loud. As a community moderator, I learned that for every complainer, there are dozens of quietly happy users. You can only tell by the votes. No one will create a thread to say &#34;everything is fine, keep it up&#34;.If someone made your day easier, or if they created something good, take a minute to thank them. If they saved you a ton of work, consider a small donation. A lot of people are tirelessly, thanklessly creating things that benefit you. It costs nothing to acknowledge it. Never let a compliment go unused.In the last few years, I became better at expressing my gratitude to creators, maintainers, colleagues and friends."</p>

This leads to a classic parlor trick: if you try to visit http://3232271615 , Chrome will load http://192.168.140.255.This was the source of one of my favorite “bugs” ever. I was working on multiple mobile apps for a company, and they had a deep link setup that was incredibly basic: &lt;scheme&gt;://&lt;integer&gt;, which would take you to an article with a simple incrementing ID.  This deep link system “just worked” on iOS and Android; take the URL, grab the host, parse it as an int, grab that story ID. Windows Phone, however… the integers we were parsing out were totally wrong, returning incredibly old stories!Turned out that the host we were given by the frameworks from the URL was auto-converted to an IP in dotted-quad format, and then the int parser was just grabbing the last segment… which meant that we were always getting stories &lt;256, instead of the ~40000 range we were expecting."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My dad had a similar story about a bug report. This was back in the day when terminals still used paper rather than CRTs; actual teletypes. The bug report was something like &#34;if I print a page feed on such and such terminal model, it will catch fire.&#34;The bug report form (which was paper in those days) had a few of the usual checkboxes and fields to fill in, including one for &#34;is the problem reproducible?&#34; That box was checked. Someone had actually gone to the effort of standing by their terminal with a fire extinguisher, running the same command and putting out the fire when it caught fire again.It turns out the problem was in some software that emulated page feeds by doing repeated line feeds. Some overflow or underflow bug caused an integer to wrap around, so instead of advancing a few lines to the next page, it would try to advance thousands or millions of lines. This particular terminal model was a new, high speed one, so it would try to advance the paper really fast. It was using those perforated strips at the sides, with the pegs that went into the holes. The pegs and holes weren&#39;t perfectly aligned, so the pegs would sometimes clip the holes a bit, causing some bits of paper to shred and get kicked up as dust. Along with a spark, I don&#39;t recall if it was from the motor or just static buildup caused by the friction of the paper, and the paper dust would ignite, causing the terminal to catch fire.I just love the image of whoever submitted that bug report, seeing the &#34;is it reproducible&#34; checkbox on the form, and standing by the terminal with a fire extinguisher to put it out while doing the same thing to make sure the problem was reproducible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tell me if this is a bug...After driving a new car to work for 2 years, the traction control started kicking in on certain curves. I take a windy road to work and had never had traction control activate. When it kicked in, it pulsed the right front brake and slowed the car quickly, likely unnerving the guy tailgating me. This happened several times, both going to and from work. The road was perfectly dry, no snow or rain. Same turns at the same speed as always.The clues are was that my rear tires had worn and I replaced them a few days before. And, I drive a Tesla Model 3. It&#39;s a rear-wheel drive version and the front tires still had good tread so I didn&#39;t replace them.Why the right front tire?What I finally brained out, which you may have quickly realized, is that the diameters of the worn front and new rear tires were then slightly different. The front had a lower diameter than the rear and therefore turned at a slightly faster rate when driving.When I took a hard bank, the outside wheels also turned faster than the inside as they do in any turn. That increased the delta in spin rate the most between the outside worn front tire and the inside new rear tire. The traction control determined that the right front must be slipping and pulsed the brake on it.I replaced the front tires and everything went back to normal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I may have told this story before (perhaps back in 2008 if this was posted then) -- but my first gig in tech was QA for Hewlett Packard testing printer/scanner/copier units. At some point I scanned a photo of my then-girlfriend and crashed the unit. Was able to do it repeatedly, provided I scanned the image in straight/cleanly. I didn&#39;t come across any other images that reproduced the issue, only this one photo. The underlying bug was a buffer overrun of some sort, was fixed before shipping -- and the image became a part of the durable regression test suite for that department."</p>

I was surprside by this part though:&#34;Over many years of experimentation, it was found that if the U in RNA is replaced by a slightly modified molecule, our immune system loses interest. For real. [...]  The really clever bit is that although this replacement Ψ placates (calms) our immune system, it is accepted as a normal U by relevant parts of the cell.&#34;This sounds like a serious backdoor or attack vector to me - would there be any risk in introducing this Ψ, allowing some natural occuring permutations to turn wild or dangerous?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This reminds me of “The Bell Jar” by Sylvia Plath, which has a quote Aziz Ansari used in his series “Master of None”:&gt; &#34;I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn&#39;t quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn&#39;t make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Much of my life hasn&#39;t played out how I expected. I had dreams like many people in high school and none of them came true. Instead of finishing college I joined the military after the stock market collapse in 2008/9. Impressions were left on me throughout my early life that I only came to know as an adult. My family got sick, I ruined the relationship that I&#39;d worked for, and at times I alienated people close to me out of my own sense of self-defense. I pushed myself to the brink repeatedly. My twenties were filled with stress, frustration, confusion, and at times anger. These things taught me acceptance and forgiveness of both myself and others. Looking back, I would not trade them for an easier or more prestigious life.When I came back from Afghanistan I had to scratch, claw, and climb a ladder without a degree thanks in much part to people who saw in me what I could only hoped to have seen in myself. I looked around me when I arrived and I saw Ivy League and top school graduates with multi-million dollar homes, Teslas, and their own literal fig trees in their back yards that complained about everything in life. I&#39;ve now had the opportunity to live in multiple cultures with varying degrees of prosperity. These things taught me to know my value but to have perspective on what I&#39;m really asking for.Here I am considering selling all my belongings, buying a truck and an RV to go embrace the new open road that is remote work. Life isn&#39;t about looking back. It isn&#39;t even about getting what you want. It&#39;s about navigating the road in front of you and making the best of the opportunities in front of you and for everyone around you. All that to say, I&#39;ve embraced the idea that whatever lies ahead is where I&#39;m supposed to be and I needn&#39;t look at what my neighbors value or what they have because I don&#39;t care. This life is mine to live."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a fascinating subject. It looks like many people are commenting about alternative realities and that exploring them is a fool&#39;s game (BTW. I concur with that).The thing which bothers me is upbeat comments about living here and now and planting the seeds for future changes. It feels like current problems (and desire to wish them away via woulda/counda/shoulda) didn&#39;t happen entirely randomly. These problems are a result of systematic behavior/decision making.As an example, it&#39;s too easy to say to yourself, &#34;I will start doing sport tomorrow&#34;. However, you wake up tomorrow and notice that your day is so busy that you don&#39;t have time to do sport until 9pm and by that time you are exhausted and can&#39;t do sport. And you repeat the cycle saying, &#34;maybe tomorrow&#34;. You start teasing your day apart and find that to squeeze in sport won&#39;t require you just to add it, but also to kick something out. And that all the things you have the energy for in the day, you implicitly regarded as more important than sport. And as a result, you are stuck in the loop wishing to do something better but being limited by your other priorities.And frankly, this bothers me way more. The immutability of the past is normal. Being so set in your ways that you can&#39;t change the future - this is what scares the shit out of me."</p>

In a tiny apartment! This trend lasted for a month, after which I sat down to actually implement this.I thought it was just me being autistic but it&#39;s interesting to know others do it as well :)I never worked in an office setting, but I can only imagine it would be extremely prejudicial to people like me and the author.

I can&#39;t pace there because I don&#39;t feel comfortable doing so, and that alone is enough for me to not be able to tackle challenging problems there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To solve a problem, we need to be smarter than the problem - or the problem needs to be dumber than us.When vocalizing something, you&#39;re forced to constrict the blob of complexity you&#39;re carrying in your head into a linear narrative, which is by definition simpler. Now that you have simplified the problem you are more likely to get hold of it and solve it.This happens all the time - when I am solving a technical/logical problem, sometimes I feel like my wife thinks I am just staring blankly at the screen day-dreaming. So I get insecure and start to explain to her how hard the problem is, but because she&#39;s a physician I have to translate it into common language first, and 99% of the time I say &#34;never mind, got it&#34; before I have a chance to really bore her.Come to think of it, this may be how therapy works. You are forced to take all the &#34;mess&#34; that&#39;s in your head and narrate it to someone else, in the process getting much simpler perspective on it.Writing is the same way for me. For example, all the ideas in this post were in my head in some amorphous way, but now that I wrote them out they became neat little analogies I can use in the future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is partly why Rubber Duck Debugging[1] can sometimes work, especially if you&#39;re vocalising the steps. I&#39;ve often started typing a question on Stackoverflow when suddenly I solved the issue just by the act of verbalising the question as I type.I&#39;ve found this to also help when I&#39;m doing any sort of creative work or brainstorming, simply talking and explaining as if I&#39;m presenting to an audience helps me generate ideas. Never spoken out loud to myself in public though...[1]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"E Ink is a great example of how the patent system stifles innovation.One company developed a small, expensive, newspaper-quality electrophoretic display with a refresh rate so terrible it was only suitable for books, decided that that was good enough, and 15 years later every comment in this thread is looking forward to finally seeing some innovation in this space &#34;once the patents expire.&#34;That is some first class bullshit. We could have had large form, glossy brochure quality displays with video refresh rates by now, but nobody outside of China wanted to get anywhere near this patent minefield."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a 13.3-inch Dasung e-ink monitor, and use it daily for three to six hours (basically, whenever I use my PC). Some days ago the HDMI cable it came with broke, so before I had the opportunity to replace it, I had to switch back to an LED monitor for the time being. Well, surely anyone can already guess what happened... After just a couple of days, I came upon a long forgotten enemy: eye fatigue. Blurry vision, trouble focusing it, and a light headache.Like many others here, I wish the technology could have advanced faster and been made more accessible for everyone. Without the obstacles it still faces, I&#39;m sure we would already have color screens with a good refresh rate. C&#39;est la vie."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It looks like the breakthrough here is in making a large (bigger than e-reader-sized) e-paper display available as a self-contained, HDMI-compatible monitor instead of just a display assembly for OEMs and experienced DIYers.While I don’t expect this to also be a breakthrough in terms of pricing, hopefully it starts driving the volume that will eventually make this type of display more accessible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s no intentional or manual effort at Google to promote pinterest.Pinterest shows up because they understand how the Google algorithm works and built their website to display all the signals that Google looks for in relevant image content.They understand user intent and generate URLs that present content in a way that google expects to see.Examples of how they do this from their engineering team:https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/demystifying-seo-wi...More:https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/tagged/seo"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related: in the last several years, there started appearing these StackOverflow mirrors. It&#39;s gotten to the point that you can&#39;t google a programming question without running into at least one. Some copy the questions and answers verbatim, some use machine translation to (crappily) translate them into my native language. Sometimes they even rank higher than the real StackOverflow.I really wish there was a non-hacky way to ban sites from Google search results. I also feel like Google&#39;s ranking algorithm is utterly broken since it&#39;s amenable to this kind of exploitation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One big reason why Pinterest ranks so highly, and why you are seeing different tld&#39;s in the results, is because they have a variety of tld&#39;s that they use and those tld&#39;s all have separate crawl budgets from each other. So Google crawls Pinterest about an order of magnitude more than most other sites. You can read more about this here: https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/how-switching-our-d...Source: I run a think tank focused on Google’s web crawling advantage and have been studying stuff like this for a couple years now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; &#34;But why&#34;, I hear from the back. Having Linux available makes it easier to port emulators and fb or console games.&gt; Most importantly, because I can.Good. All I can say is at least it is something different to what I keep seeing on HN. (React, Rust, Kubernetes, JAMstack, JavaScript, etc.)Probably present this somewhere in a conference (CCC, FOSDEM, etc). Who knows who could be looking at this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To be clear, this is a tech demo; we&#39;re long past the point where running anything useful on a system with graphics and 4MB (8MB with expansion) of RAM under Linux is reasonable. You can barely get the kernel itself that small. There&#39;s a reason why even cheapo consumer routers have at least 64MB of RAM.So it&#39;s for fun; you won&#39;t be able to run any existing &#34;normal&#34; Linux emulators and you&#39;d be better off porting stuff to run on bare metal than trying to squeeze it in under Linux on an N64. Cool project, fun, great that it&#39;s getting upstreamed... just keep in mind it&#39;s not really useful for end users for anything (unlike, say, Wii Linux, where with ~80MB of RAM you can actually get somewhere, though still with many limitations).OTOH, as other people have mentioned, it makes a good test case for N64 emulators. If they can run this, that&#39;s good validation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is, of course, cool. No doubt. I have an EverDrive 64 and I’ll probably test this out later today or tomorrow.I am skeptical that this would be the preferred way to port emulators or graphical games. You’re not getting a budget SGI workstation out of this, because the OS kernel itself is only a small part.The N64 is built around a chip called the Reality Control Processor, or RCP. This contains the RSP, stripped-down MIPS CPU core with a fixed-point SIMD vector unit, and the RDP, a rasterization engine that does simple trilinear texture interpolation and color blending. This is the hard part of programming the N64, and it’s not something that’s addressed by swapping out the OS kernel.There are… a number of major challenges you will still have to face if you want to make homebrew software for the N64, unless you are okay with just having something on the CPU and writing to the framebuffer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the original paper&gt;&gt; SrTiO3 is a suitable photocatalytic material for the assessment of this possibility. This compound is a well characterized photocatalyst with a bandgap energy of 3.2 eV (ref. 11–14), and its EQE for overall water splitting has been improved by up to 69% over the past years using various refinements.Here, we increased the EQE to its upper limit by constructing highly active HER and OER cocatalysts on SrTiO3:Al particles site-selectively. This was accomplished by using a stepwise photodeposition method instead of an impregnation process, which results in random dispersion of the cocatalysts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The abstract of the paper makes it sound good:&gt;Overall water splitting, evolving hydrogen and oxygen in a 2:1 stoichiometric ratio,  using particulate photocatalysts is a potential means of achieving scalable and economically viable solar hydrogen production. To obtain high solar energy conversion efficiency, the quantum efficiency of the photocatalytic reaction must be increased over a wide range of wavelengths and semiconductors with narrow bandgaps need to be designed. However, the quantum efficiency associated with overall water splitting using existing photocatalysts is typically lower than ten per cent1,2. Thus, whether a particulate photocatalyst can enable a quantum efficiency of 100 per cent for the greatly endergonic water-splitting reaction remains an open question. Here we demonstrate overall water splitting at an external quantum efficiency of up to 96 per cent at wavelengths between 350 and 360 nanometres, which is equivalent to an internal quantum efficiency of almost unity, using a modified aluminium-doped strontium titanate (SrTiO3:Al) photocatalyst3,4. By selectively photodepositing the cocatalysts Rh/Cr2O3 (ref. 5) and CoOOH (refs. 3,6) for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively, on different crystal facets of the semiconductor particles using anisotropic charge transport, the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions could be promoted separately. This enabled multiple consecutive forward charge transfers without backward charge transfer, reaching the upper limit of quantum efficiency for overall water splitting. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of overall water splitting free from charge recombination losses and introduces an ideal cocatalyst/photocatalyst structure for efficient water splitting.Not so sure about the fuelcellsworks article clickbaiting up the &#39;quantum&#39; bit when all it means is one photon splitting one H2O."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Illiad.  As the foundation of Western literature, it may have received the greatest amount of hype that it is possible to receive.I had attempted to read it and The Odyssey when I was much younger, in middle school, maybe too young, and failed miserably.  But as it is always with cultural touchstones, references to it are inescapable, and a few years ago, in my mid 50s I overcame the reluctance accumulated in the intervening time and set out to read the Samuel Butler prose translation of 1898.  Most of the translations I&#39;d previously approached were in verse, which is in some ways its own hill to climb when one is customarily a prose reader, so this seemed perfect.And so it was, and I was bowled over.  It was a mind bending experience for me the likes of which I experience much to infrequently as age and experience take their toll on the novelties of youth.  I can&#39;t say the last work I read I experienced as electrically.  For all the stiltedness of epic story telling, the personalities of Agamemnon, Achilles, Zeus, et al are both vivid and convincing; the violence of battle is  horrible, electric, and wierdly beautiful in a way that will resonate recognizably with fans Sam Peckinpaugh or Hong Kong action movies.  Though the characterizations are far more stereotyped, as befits the age in which it was produced, than modern readers are accustomed to, they still evince a polish that rises above conventional story telling into true literature.  Worth every ounce of effort you expend to summit this one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Wire.I&#39;d tried to watch it a few times, but only a few months ago actually got past the first two episodes. I think it helped that I quite quickly saw it as a morally ambiguous discussion of the institutional ineptitude of conservative western cultures in mitigating the effects of crime, rather than a typical &#39;good vs bad&#39; cop show.With that mindset, the possibly-underwhelming finale of S1 is much more effective, and the sudden pace-change in S2 is more meaningful."</p>

That team calls you back from numbers that cannot accept calls.  That team is not available by chat or email and every other department has no access in the tools to effectively cancel a service.I escalated to the crtc and opened a case.

I thought I would never get a hold of any programming language ever. One day I tried this mysterious language from Japan(That&#39;s how I knew Ruby at the time) on tryruby.org. Ruby was breath of a fresh air. Code read like English. I was making small CLIs which required so much work in every other language. That was enough to get me hooked. Then I learned about Rails and never looked back.
Happy to see this language making new strides with this release. This is a thank you note to Matz and the community."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember when Rails first was released. I kept the source code for Ruby and for Rails handy, and it was sort-of possible to wrap my head around both. One of the most fun non-AI conferences that I ever went to was Merb Camp in San Diego where the Merb team announced merging with Rails.I have such good memories of the four or five years when Ruby was my main driver. Great job by Matz and core team with the 3.0 release.I have gone back to my 1980s roots and now once gain use Common Lisp as my main driver, except for deep learning where I need to use Python (tried Julia and Swift).I think Matz has it exactly right. As programmers it is important to be happy using a language. Life should be fun most of the time, and there is nothing wrong with trying to optimize life for maximum joy we bring to ourselves and other people.BTW, happy holidays!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been working as a developer for9 years. For most of that time I gravitated toward the DevOps/SRE/Platform niche because I care about quality, but the process of developing resilient, maintainable and clean code in all the languages I had used seriously (PHP, Python, JavaScript, C, Go) just didn’t work with my mind. I couldn’t wrap my head around it and make myself apply the discipline.A year ago I was dropped in as the lead on a large Ruby project. Suddenly everything clicked. Now all the reading I’ve done on domain driven design and TDD actually has meaning and I’ve written more solid code in a year than the rest of my career combined.And on top of that, while every corner of tech has its toxic personalities, the Ruby community is overwhelmingly friendly, welcoming and mature."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Too bad, maps.me was by far the best maps application for non city use, and ideal for hiking. Commendable initiative to bring it back in its original version!A few examples of why it was so great:Simple, non social bookmarks. As in: place a bookmark so you don&#39;t get lost while hiking, or when you find a nice spot you want to come back to later. Yep, a utility feature that doesn&#39;t somehow map to some stoopid business OKR in advertising. I am sure this is possible with Google maps or Apple maps somehow, but only after you&#39;ve created an account, logged in, and made sure you have the equivalent of a South Korean inner city internet connection.Also, easily downloadable maps that just stay on your phone. I am hiking, I don&#39;t have internet and need the map on my phone. 
I know Google Maps allows you to do that but it is tedious unlike maps.me, which is instant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is an existing f-droid version of Maps.me [1] and this looks like a separate effort.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One time when I was younger, in my late teens, I was walking through the city around 8pm. I suddenly felt rather cold, and went through the typical 15 seconds of internal grumbling. I then had an epiphany, and walked into a nearby department store to purchase a jacket. Somehow I&#39;d never even considered that as a possibility previously.As silly as it may seem, I use that singular point in time as the reference for when I commenced adulthood. I&#39;ve got no idea if others have similar experiences (I grew up very poor, so I was probably primed against the idea of spontaneously buying something to begin with), but the contents of this list seems to be very much in the same vein."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of an old video of Steve Jobs. His idea is simple, but it&#39;s really powerful. In short: the world is something you can change, not merely participate in.When you grow up, you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world, try not to bash into the walls too much, try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money.That’s a very limited life. Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact, and that is that everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.And the minute that you understand that you can poke life and actually something will, you know if you push in, something will pop out the other side, that you can change it, you can mold it. That’s maybe the most important thing. It’s to shake off this erroneous notion that life is there and you’re just gonna live in it, versus embrace it, change it, improve it, make your mark upon it.I think that’s very important and however, you learn that, once you learn it, you’ll want to change life and make it better, cause it’s kind of messed up, in a lot of ways. Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYfNvmF0Bqw"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My findings:Sleep until noon every day.Work only as much as you need.Work from home, or anywhere else for that matter.Have multiple romantic partners in parallel.Have platonic friends of the opposite sex.Share multiple flats with multiple people (i.e. live in multiple places, but cheap)Study 10 years.Make your own iced tea in the fridge.Buy food in bulk.Drink tap water.Create your own dishes by mixing ingredients.Cook/fry/bake food you would usually eat raw.Eat food raw that you would usually cook/fry/bake.Sleep everywhere in your home.Learn languages, instruments, or sports after you turned 30.Drink no alcohol at a party and still have fun.Start/stop smoking and drinking after 30.Found a company like you would buy a game console.Take no VC money.Take muliple years and tries to create a good product.Write music/give concerts for yourself or your friends only.Don&#39;t wear shoes outside.Don&#39;t have an opinion on a topic.Overall:Don&#39;t play pre-defined games in your life, but ask if they make you happy. You only have one life, make the most out of it.Sometimes you have to play by some rules made up by other people to get into a better place, but look at them closely, it could very well be that they are more open to interpretation than they first seem."</p>

Big banks are, therefore, incentivized to underprice IPOs as much as they can get away with. And employees themselves are subject to long lockup periods. With the recent success of direct listings, cutting them out of the process is a logical step."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; You are known as Azure BugOk, that’s cute.I would perhaps delay showing the funny name until at least one other machine is detected, it makes it feel like my name is being broadcast over the public Internet for anyone to connect to, and not just a LAN connection, the way it is.But worked perfectly for me to send a few photos back and forth.LAN connections seem like the perfect application for WebRTC not having to deal with TURN or STUN.It is a bit unnerving that there’s no permission request before being able to do network discovery on the LAN however.How is one machine finding the other? Central server matching the public IP used to then share their private IP? Or does WebRTC provide a discovery service?Edit: Ok, Looking at the server code [1] there is indeed a “room” per public IP and the server passes messages between peers in the same room.[1] - https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop/blob/master/server/in..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not really an AirDrop equivalent if it requires you to be on the same network. AirDrop is really useful when you&#39;re out and about somewhere and you want to send someone a file. In those cases there&#39;s possibly not a WiFi available or in the case of visitors to your home; only you are on the network, not your friend. So I would not see the point of using this instead of AirDrop unless you have to send a file to someone using Android."</p>

In addition to supporting literate programming (&#34;code as literature&#34;) and exploratory programming (&#34;code as scientific notebook&#34;) in a live coding environment, Howard explains how notebooks can improve documentation, learning and sharing, testing, and deployment. And add-ins and tools, like Howard&#39;s own nbdev, can help address what&#39;s missing in Jupyter Notebook.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a UI/UX agency that focusses on B2B SaaS, I’ve always found Fantasy UIs fascinating. It’s the complete opposite of the simple &amp; clean interfaces clients ask us to design.I’ve spent some time thinking about why these Fantasy UIs are so fascinating despite the fact they seem not very user friendly.My conclusion was that fantasy Interfaces are very much like the early web. Lots of moving parts (dancing banana gifs) and you had to figure out the navigation on each website you visited. Today, everything looks and feels the same and we lost the creative spirit of interface building.Figuring out the interface might not be best practice. But at the same time, I remember sharing websites with friends purely based on how fun the navigation and overall controls were.We lost the Art of interface building and turned it into a complete science. There are arguments for both sides.My wish is that... Hopefully.. one day, someone will contact us with a project that allows us to build the first fantasy UI for a real-world SaaS product."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The fantasy UI of Neon Genesis Evangelion[1,2] left a deep impression on me when I watched the original series for the first time.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The single biggest common denominator between so many fantasy UIs, is transparent (HUD-style) interfaces. I was just watching the latest episode of The Expanse, last night, and saw them all using these transparent PDA/phones.Ever try using a transparent UI? It&#39;s absolutely maddening.Looks cool on the screen, but is pretty much unusable IRL."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Looking up who Roderick Colenbrander is (person who submitted the patch over at https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-input/patch/20201...), it seems they are the &#34;Director of Hardware &amp; Systems Engineering&#34; over at Sony. I&#39;d expect them to spend time on more higher-level things, but seems here they either was involved with actually writing the driver, and/or are just the public face for the patch. Seems unusual though. Kudos if directors at Sony still get to write code, especially low-level code like this.Edit: Seems there is more details in a almost year old article on phoronix (https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Sony-HID...):&gt; Roderick Colenbrander of Sony who serves as their Directory of Hardware &amp; Systems Engineering, chimed in on the matter of adding this Gasia controller support (And, yes, this is the same Roderick Colenbrander who in his spare time serves as a Wine developer and if going back to the early 2000&#39;s was the NVClock NVIDIA overclocking tool developer as opposed to being some eager Sony employee):So seems Roderick is a true hacker! I&#39;ve used both Wine and NVClock in the past so if you&#39;re around here, thanks for your work on all these things and upstreaming them as well! :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I still remember that I connected a PS4 controller a few years ago to test a unity game that I was making. I typed apt search ps4 but could not find something so I pressed some buttons and magicly the UI changed. It all just worked no setup no nothing. I also used the controller on windows 10 but you had to use the xbox driver with special software to map the controls to that driver. The fact that everything just worked on linux amazes me to this day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sony support PS4 and PS5 remote play on Android, so having Linux support for their controllers makes sense (the PS4 controller driver is in Android 10, but DualSense controllers aren&#39;t supported there yet)"</p>

So for me YouTube is a fountain of knowledge, visual and musical aesthetics etc. Every day I get inspiration, healthy kind of fun and learn something cool, useful and healthy.But people who watch stupid and destructive stuff (even once) are doomed because they are going to get the same and worse kind of content recommended over and over. This is a particularly underestimated social problem indeed.That&#39;s why I recommend to avoid signing-in into YouTube. Better watch anonymously so you can always clean the cookies and get out of the pit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know I&#39;m old but dang for some reason I really dislike recommendations from almost any company.For media I grew up in the 70s and had the TV Guide. I&#39;d look through to see what I wanted to watch, circle some things and then watch. No spying what-so-ever.So, I like for example HN where AFAIK I&#39;m not tracked so much and I choose what I want from the top of the list.Conversely I mostly hate Amazon, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, Youtube, Twitter, Instagram, and all the ad services and any other service that uses some algorithm to decide what to put in my face.It&#39;s to the point that 3 out 4 time I&#39;ll open videos in private windows so they don&#39;t get added to my profile and used for recommendations.I don&#39;t mind going to a tech sight and seeing ads for tech or a car site and seeing ads for cars. Do mind visiting an apartment listing site and then going around the net and having every other sight shove ads for apartments in my face."</p>
