								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This has happened to me frequently at my current company. I get pulled into a meeting about something that I have no context on because it touches my area of expertise, and the discussions have apparently been stalling out.I brace myself to be the idiot. I&#39;m going to waste everyone&#39;s time asking questions that everyone knows the answer to, and I just got looped in, so everyone&#39;s going to feel like they need to walk through all the super-obvious stuff to satisfy the one guy who didn&#39;t do his homework.So I start asking questions, and slowly begin to realize that nobody in the room has any idea what they are talking about. That there are fundamental misunderstandings and misconceptions about existing systems. And, naturally, it turns out that the questions I have are questions that other people have.This has happened to me so often now that you would think the sinking feeling I get before I brace myself to look stupid would go away, but it never does."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was younger, I often met people who seemed kind of dim to me, at first, and later found the majority of them to be orders of magnitude brighter than me.
It was not hard to connect the dots, the reason they were so much brighter was (in part) exactly because of what made them initially seem dim.. They asked questions, honestly. Not the showoff kind of question you ask to show how much you know, but real, honest questions that not only showed how little they knew, but importantly, allowed them to actually learn and understand, rather than just nod and not get it.My intuition has changed from this, I find it that most times, when someone shows genuine interest and asks honest, revealing questions about some new topic, they often excel at many other things (and will likely on the new topic as well).I&#39;m adapting this myself, being honest, asking honestly, and sometimes looking really stupid (because, in that context, I am!), and I appreciate greatly both the wealth of information that allows me to access, and that almost anybody worth their salt recognizes this trait as well.Failing an interview due to looking stupid is probably a blessing in disguise, you don&#39;t want to be hired by people who can&#39;t see this, and you don&#39;t want to work next to people who&#39;s just pretending to understand, not learning because they can&#39;t afford to look stupid when they are (and thus stay stupid, and be much more inclined to try to pass blame to someone else, like you, who look stupid)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One way to prove that he truly doesn&#39;t mind looking stupid would be to list times when he risked looking stupid... and it turns out he actually was.It&#39;s happened to all of us though we dont like to admit it.I&#39;m sure it&#39;s happened to him too  and I looked but I didn&#39;t see any of those examples listed.Giving only examples of when people thought he was dumb and it turned out he wasn&#39;t... that&#39;s kind of just a roundabout way of humblebragging that you&#39;re an unrecognized genius.Sadly I think this undermines the point of the article which otherwise makes a good point."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The thing that burns out web developer is web development. The constant shift of technologies (just for the sake of it) and the nerfed (to oblivion) environment is hell. As a web developer, after you learn the basics (~5 years)  there is no feeling of where the &#34;up&#34; direction is. Everything feels like sidesteps. There is no feeling of permanence to your knowledge, unlike a lawyer or a doctor. The knowledge feels like water pouring into a full container - as much of it goes out, as it goes in.Switched to embedded systems 7 years ago to avoid the burnout. It is better, in my opinion. Funny enough, there is a natural barrier to entry that keeps most programmers away - You have to understand how computers work, how operating systems work and you have to be able to code in C/assembly. I have a lot of fun and actually picked up electronics as a hobby, which will help me better myself professionally. I think there is enough here to keep me entertained until I retire."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; 64. DRY (don’t repeat yourself) is a luxury for when you have a coherent theory in your mind of the app’s code.&gt; It’s for when you have that theory contained in a worldview in your mind that helps you quickly test out decisions and plans against that theory.&gt; Until then, you should repeat yourself. Seeing your code repeat itself – when rhyming phrases start to pop up throughout – is a vital tool for building a theory about your app.Wow, this is the best explanation of how to apply DRY that I&#39;ve ever heard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice read. I&#39;ve been doing web dev for 15 years. What has got me burnt out now:-Spend most of my time dealing with tooling issues.-Increasingly complex demands. Even the simplest problems now seems to be multi layered with dozens of edge cases to be accounted for. It&#39;s seemingly impossible to get anything right. You can spend hours testing a responsive design on every browser, every viewport - send it to the client and you&#39;ll get after 5 minutes a list of 50 issues, half of them totally asinine.-Lack of respect/authority/autonomy. After 15 years I&#39;m considered a subordinate to a PM with 6 months experience and zero technical knowledge. This one can be improved a little by working remotely I think. But it just comes down to how management view or value different roles. We are a liability to them, something to be managed, coerced and controlled.-Oversaturated market, learntocode, let&#39;s be honest and say for 95% of companies, web devs are a commodity. I don&#39;t have an issue with people who are excited and want to learn coding, but the reality is the job market is over stuffed.-Leetcode interviews. I just don&#39;t have the energy, desire and sometimes specific knowledge to deal with these interviews. Its a straight no from me now, if i get contacted by a recruiter requesting I do one of these.I can see clearly that other people in non technical fields are getting paid better or the same as me and dealing with far far less work and far less stress.It&#39;s like there are two type of work category: &#34;reviewers&#34; and &#34;implementers&#34;. Reviewers are the stakeholders, they make all the demands and do none (or very little/superficial) of the actual work. Implementers, well we are the ones who do the heavy lifting and deal with all the real problems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel pg’s point is similar to musicians. As an example, Glenn Gould was a classical pianist and renowned Bach interpreter. He had awesome technical ability at the piano, and a fantastic memory. But lots of incredible pianists have these abilities. Go to any university or observe any competition and you’ll plainly see awesome talent. These qualities are analogous to “being smart”.However, what set Gould apart from his colleagues was his innovative and iconoclastic interpretations of well-known works with “standard” prescriptions. He had fundamentally different, but wholly consistent, ideas about musical interpretation, recording technology, presentation of music to audiences, and so on. He’s remembered as a pianist not because his fingers were quick and sensitive, but instead because he pushed boundaries in completely original ways.Leonard Bernstein—a noted conductor and pianist—quips about this when he conducted the Brahms Concerto in D minor, with Gould at the piano [1]. I recommend listening but I’ll copy his words (from [2]) for posterity.&gt; Don&#39;t be frightened. Mr. Gould is here. He will appear in a moment. I&#39;m not, um, as you know, in the habit of speaking on any concert except the Thursday night previews, but a curious situation has arisen, which merits, I think, a word or two. You are about to hear a rather, shall we say, unorthodox performance of the Brahms D Minor Concerto, a performance distinctly different from any I&#39;ve ever heard, or even dreamt of for that matter, in its remarkably broad tempi and its frequent departures from Brahms&#39; dynamic indications. I cannot say I am in total agreement with Mr. Gould&#39;s conception and this raises the interesting question: &#34;What am I doing conducting it?&#34; I&#39;m conducting it because Mr. Gould is so valid and serious an artist that I must take seriously anything he conceives in good faith and his conception is interesting enough so that I feel you should hear it, too.&gt; But the age old question still remains: &#34;In a concerto, who is the boss; the soloist or the conductor?&#34; The answer is, of course, sometimes one, sometimes the other, depending on the people involved. But almost always, the two manage to get together by persuasion or charm or even threats to achieve a unified performance. I have only once before in my life had to submit to a soloist&#39;s wholly new and incompatible concept and that was the last time I accompanied Mr. Gould. (The audience roared with laughter at this.) But, but this time the discrepancies between our views are so great that I feel I must make this small disclaimer. Then why, to repeat the question, am I conducting it? Why do I not make a minor scandal — get a substitute soloist, or let an assistant conduct? Because I am fascinated, glad to have the chance for a new look at this much-played work; Because, what&#39;s more, there are moments in Mr. Gould&#39;s performance that emerge with astonishing freshness and conviction. Thirdly, because we can all learn something from this extraordinary artist, who is a thinking performer, and finally because there is in music what Dimitri Mitropoulos used to call &#34;the sportive element&#34;, that factor of curiosity, adventure, experiment, and I can assure you that it has been an adventure this week collaborating with Mr. Gould on this Brahms concerto and it&#39;s in this spirit of adventure that we now present it to you.Because some took this as an attack on Gould, Bernstein followed up with the remark:&gt; Any discovery of Glenn&#39;s was welcomed by me because I worshiped the way he played: I admired his intellectual approach, his &#34;guts&#34; approach, his complete dedication to whatever he was doing.Anyway, it’s an interesting parallel in the arts world. Jacob Collier is a musician of today that has similar qualities of “being smart with good ideas”.[1] https://youtu.be/SvWPM783TOE[2] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Philharmonic_concer..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another way to frame this topic: intelligence doesn&#39;t always lead to impact, and impact is what matters.Example: I met a ton of trivia &#34;nerds&#34; through a friend a few years ago. They had all met at an Ivy League college, they were clearly &#34;smart&#34; in that they knew a lot of information and could follow a logical argument but somehow none of them were able to use their smarts for anything practical. They had jobs you didn&#39;t need to be that smart for, and their personal lives were sort of messy. I didn&#39;t really know what to make it them at the time, now I think they had the &#34;smarts&#34; but they didn&#39;t have the &#34;drive&#34; so their brains sort of did them no good.Another example: Plenty of people are constantly frustrated that they are misunderstood. &#34;I am so smart but I can&#39;t get anything done around here because everyone&#39;s an idiot.&#34; Some people go through their whole life believing this. Luckily I had a job that disabused me of this and taught me to communicate my ideas clearly and persuasively to others. But without that, without the ability to persuade people of your ideas, you might as well not have them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hamming (of Hamming codes) has a famous Bell Labs talk &#34;You and Your Research&#34;, describing how to have a large impact. It covers a lot of the same ground, but in more detail:https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.htmlA few points from it:You&#39;ve got to work on important problems.How about having lots of `brains?&#39; It sounds good. But great work is something else than mere brains.The people who do great work with less ability but who are committed to it, get more done that those who have great skill and dabble in it.The prepared mind sooner or later finds something important and does it. So yes, it is luck. The particular thing you do is luck, but that you do something is not.One of the characteristics you see, and many people have it including great scientists, is that usually when they were young they had independent thoughts and had the courage to pursue them."</p>

Now that I&#39;ve moved to Germany, I know what it feels like not to have to file every year (I still have to for the US but it&#39;s trivial now due to FIEC).There&#39;s nobody hounding you here, no stress regarding your taxes unless you&#39;re filing for a return or have extenuating circumstances, and even then there&#39;s a government-provided online portal for direct communication with the Finanzamt (finance department).Every American should be upset with Intuit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Going to paraphrase a quote from a podcast that stuck with me.&gt; What (the left) needs to do is clear out rents. Not just housing rents, but rent seekers. The economy is riddled through with people who do nothing, but get paid because structurally that’s who gets paid.Intuit is one of those companies. They produce a few real products, QuickBooks for businesses and Mint, but overwhelmingly their money comes from the fact that they charge rent on filling your taxes. They’re a parasite on our society.Fortunately the podcaster wasn’t talking about the US; their country was worse off than America in this area by far. But unfortunately it seems like we’re on the same glide slope if we don’t do something about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate wasting at least a day if not more of my life every year filing. As time goes on and i have more assets the time to file goes up as well and gathering all the required documents with every bank having different timelines is a nightmare.But what can I do about it? I would imagine if it went to a vote overwhelmingly people would say no I don’t want to file like this every year. But here we are and honestly I don’t have much energy left these days to be mad about anything as it’s wearing on my health."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I served in the Georgia legislature during a portion of a similar story. Without a doubt, the calculations throughout the story were political not technical.In the Georgia version, the technical details of the exposed information in the Secretary of State&#39;s office were facepalmingly simple (misconfigured apache directives) yet the story dragged on politically for years.Quickly, a hired security researcher for a corporate client found all registered voters info and instructional pdfs with credentials for the elections system publicly indexed by google. They responsibly disclosed. The apache configuration was updated to &#34;use encryption&#34; (moved from http to https) but still left the info indexed by google over https vs. http.    Eventually, this information became public.The state attempted to prosecute the security researcher but found no state statutes they could use. They then used this incident as a base to create a bill to criminalize the security researcher&#39;s actions.As a state rep, I worked very hard to push back on a bad bill spawned by the incident that would&#39;ve criminalized responsible disclosure.Only due to bi-partisan efforts from technically versed people were we able to get the Governor at the time to veto the bill.https://www.snopes.com/ap/2017/06/15/researcher-finds-georgi...https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/comp..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find the article title kind of curious, given that it states Parson has &#34;doubled down&#34; which suggests that the video the article references is an active effort on Parson&#39;s part. It then goes on to state that the video was produced by a PAC Parson created but doesn&#39;t give direct input to. Comes off as unnecessarily inflammatory to me I suppose.Having said that, this situation in particular really tests my willingness to assume good faith on the part of the governor and his body of advisors. Is he legitimately without a single person close to him that could inform him of how misguided this line of aggression is, and how fortunate it was that the individual who identified the security problem acted in such a helpful manner? On top of that he assigned the Missouri State Highway Patrol to investigate, because given his perceived severity of the situation that&#39;s the best agency at his disposal? It all just seems bananas.I try not to assume that totally inane actions from elected officials are exclusively the result of political calculus, and I suppose I don&#39;t have any evidence to assume that&#39;s the case here either. But I&#39;m at a loss as to how this situation could blossom into something so ridiculous."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is pretty good overview. One fun tricks we would regularly do was move all the background audio off the disk and into GPU ram. We&#39;d stream just enough that we wouldn&#39;t saturate the bus but could get back 20-30mb of system memory.There was also that time we ran out of open file handles ahead of key demo at one of the tradeshows. I remember rewriting the whole audio streaming subsystem to piggyback on the seekfree texture loading system so that we could use the that single big file as a source for both streaming texture and audio data. Did that in 24 hours less than 2 days ahead of the show, fun times.[Edit]Another fun thing from that era was that almost no one other than the in-house Sony Studios used the SPUs well. X360 came out just ahead and had tooling that was miles ahead(PIX!) so everyone started from the X360. None of the workloads we&#39;re vectorized so it was absolutely brutal to get them to fit into the SPUs. For a long time a good chunk of that silicon was just idle. If you did start from the PS3 though because of the vectorized workloads you had insane cache coeheranch and usually ran better on the X360/PC as well."</p>

It&#39;s already merged, but not yet announced to be planned for any specific Cargo version. It will allow users to create custom profiles with different build parameters from the standard ones, so you can e.g. create a &#34;profiling&#34; profile which is based on the &#34;release&#34; profile, so that it has all the nice optimizations, but with debug information included, so that it works well with cargo-flamegraph:  [profile.profiling]
  inherits = &#34;release&#34;
  debug = true

[1]: &lt;https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9943&gt;And then there&#39;s the less fireworky, but still appreciated, Iterator::map_while[2], which is going to be in Rust 1.57.[2]: &lt;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/89086&gt;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was a fantastic read; thank you for sharing.I saw escorts for a couple of years.  It was often weird, when I just didn’t click with the woman, but I met a few really awesome people.There are other down sides to escorting.  One of the women I had seen a couple of times, was later murdered. They ended up catching the killer- another escort, I don’t know why.  It was hard to grieve; we were not real close; her family probably didn’t want clients showing up at the funeral or any other reminder like flowers.I ended up falling in love with one of the women I met and we dated for a while.  It was a serious emotional roller coaster being in love with someone who was having sex with other men until she was ready to “go exclusive”.  But in the end we got married after she retired.Now it’s ten years later. We have a son and are still happy as can be.If you’re thinking about seeing escorts, remember that since intimacy with other people is involved, there are often strong emotions as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a fantastic article: informative, well-written, thoughtful, human, and funny. And it’s especially interesting to see it posted here at HN, because while reading it I kept thinking there are some solid lessons here about entrepreneurship, sales, and product pricing that could certainly be applied to your average start-up SaaS.I mean, anchoring your price high, to better capture the businessman/enterprise market? And that this market also happens to be less likely to be time-suck jerks about little issues, or constantly asking for product changes/features? Literally better b̶a̶n̶g̶ ̶f̶o̶r̶ ̶y̶o̶u̶r̶ ̶buck for your bang.And it’s right out of the classic @patio11 essays, too. Charge more, indeed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually read the entire thing. It was worth it imo. Some stand outs were her kind words about her clients (almost strange to see men as a class described with such positive words). She is clearly a very rational and intelligent person and this is a business to her like any other. Yeah I really don’t get why this stuff is illegal, even though I have no interest myself."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very cool stuff.I remember being at Build 2018 and asking the PM on the Live Share team if they had any plans to bring VS Code to the browser. Maybe do managed environments for labs and companies (what GitHub code spaces now is), would be great for education. Lots of students (especially non-CS nerds, like the physics kids with a CS requirement) find environment setup to be one of the hardest parts. He seemed to think I was a piece of shit for not ‘getting’ what Live Share was all about and how those other offerings (code spaces, running in the browser without install) were bad ideas not worth considering.I think the moral of the story is, if you’re a PM, don’t treat your most enthusiastic customers like shit. Or maybe do, because it won’t actually have business impact."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems really cool, and seems like it took a lot of man hours to put together.However, I&#39;m not sure who this is for. Downloading and installing an application is not a particularly big ask for the type of people who use VSCode. The browser version will always be a compromised experience, given the inherent limitations of browser applications. Even if it works 99% of the time, that 1% would add enough friction to make it more of a hassle then it&#39;s worth.The post gave some use cases involving hardware that can&#39;t easily run Desktop VSCode (e.g. iPads and Chromebooks). I just don&#39;t see that being much of a use case though, except in desperate circumstances where a more capable dev machine isn&#39;t available.If there are some use cases I&#39;m missing, I&#39;d love to hear about them! This is a pretty new concept, and I certainly don&#39;t know how everyone likes to code. But from my perspective, I struggle to see any situation where someone would choose to use this, and few situations where someone would have to."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ve been using Brave search for several months now. I switched the day that it was announced. The quality is fairly good, but I’m having troubling telling whether it’s just my own halo effect or if the initial quality that experienced has started to slip a little as it indexes more widely or something. At first I was impressed with how little spam ended up in top results, but lately exact queries for Python functions or prominent API functions have lots of spammy content above the actual documentation. Talking about sites that just republish GitHub issue threads, republished StackOverflow questions, w3schools-likes, etc.I’m still rooting for them, but in general
I continued to be baffled why such blatant spam can consistently make it into top results on Google, DDG and now Brave. I really wish a search engine would empower me to provide a URL ban list that gets applied server-side instead of filtering on the front end (if anything)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You know what, I welcome a new search provider, even if it&#39;s by a cryptocurrency company. I&#39;d rather see Qwant succeed, but their search is having trouble competing with even duckduckgo.What I don&#39;t see is where Brave gets its image search results from. After Microsoft blatantly started serving the CCP by blocking queries for &#34;tank man&#34;, which as far as I know they&#39;ve never actually apologised for, just explained it as &#34;a filter with more impact than expected&#34; or some BS like that, I found out that most &#34;competing&#34; search engines bought all of their image search from Microsoft, leading to the same kind of censorship on platforms such as duckduckgo.Brave says it&#39;s using &#34;third parties&#34; to generate the results but I can&#39;t easily see which third party that would be. If they are using Bing like all the others, I wouldn&#39;t trust their image search engine in the slightest.Personally, I&#39;ll just assume they are for now, because they don&#39;t seem to clarify this further anywhere else.From what I can tell, there are four image/video search providers in the world: Google, Bing, Yandex and Baidu. The rest all seem to license their results from one of the big four, mostly from Bing. When I need to pick from those four, I&#39;ll stick with Google; their censorship is relatively mild. I was hoping Brave Search would prove to be an alternative in this area, but that doesn&#39;t seem to be the case."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For non-technical searches, mostly stuff relating to news, politics, or Covid, Google is next to useless at this point due to their attempts to combat misinformation. Even their autocomplete functionality guides potential search queries in an entirely unorganic manner. For instance, something may be trending according to google, while simultaneously being blacklisted as an autocomplete option- if it has Any elements of wrongthink about it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"An interesting counter-factual that comes to mind - if the Norse Greenlanders had brought smallpox or other diseases with them, then Native Americans would have had 500 years to recover (and keep immunity?) - The conquistadors would have faced millions of not-dying-natives.  A much different world would have resulted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are plenty of valid claims that many other civilizations contacted America:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Columbian_trans-oceanic_co...But it is meaningless since they did not write about it nor they stablished commerce. The fact is that before 1492, most civilizations in Africa/Asia/Europe did not know that America existed and that other humans lived there. After 1492, that changed forever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Icelandic sagas suggest that the Norse engaged in cultural exchanges with the Indigenous groups of North America34. If these encounters indeed occurred, they may have had inadvertent outcomes, such as pathogen transmission7, the introduction of foreign flora and fauna species, or even the exchange of human genetic information. Recent data from the Norse Greenlandic population, however, show no evidence of the last of these.Is it possible the Vikings were not in that location long enough for populations to mix? Or they were so remote (physically, culturally, and linguistically) that limited opportunities arose? Or something else?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"No idea why you would write this up or share it honestly.

Especially since the outcome didn&#39;t lead to anything, just was &#39;something different&#39;. Truly what is the message here?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice story, but I think people here have the wrong takeaways from it. Having an outburst or sharing personal anecdotes isn&#39;t going to help you in an investor pitch. Had it happened earlier in their YC interview things wouldn&#39;t have gone any different, as they make it seem. The fundamental questions and doubts would have all been the same.If you don&#39;t have solid differentiators, growth charts, revenue models a touching story will not help your startup."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What is telling about this example is that what seemed to have made the biggest impression was the least rehearsed, thought out, planned answer he could give, but rather the one that was the most sincere and most &#34;down to earth.&#34;I think there is so much about the YC format which really hints at that strategy likely being your best route of success -- the time constraint, the lack of pitch deck, etc. I mean, these are people who quite literally go through thousands of these. I can&#39;t really see any other way to possibly stand out than to try to be radically genuine and sincere, even when that seems (as the author seemed to have thought!) that it is the &#34;less fancy&#34; or &#34;not the thing you are supposed to say.&#34; Quite literally anything else will be something they will have heard, at a minimum, dozens of other times."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I got mine down to 160 bytes with some pixel tweaking and converting it to a 16-color indexed PNG. It&#39;s not a lot of work or very difficult (I&#39;m an idiot at graphics editing), but you do need to spend the (small amount of) effort. I embed it as a data URI and it&#39;s just four lines of (col-80 wrapped) base64 text, which seems reasonable to me.Haven&#39;t managed to get my headshot down to less than 10k without looking horrible no matter how much I tweaked the JPEG or WebP settings, and thought that was just a tad too big to embed. Maybe I need to find a different picture that compresses better.I got that 280k Discord favicon down to just 24K simply by opening it in GIMP and saving it again. I got it down to 12K by indexing it to 255 colours rather than using RGB (I can&#39;t tell the difference even at full size). You can probably make it even smaller if you tried, but that&#39;s diminishing returns. Still, I bet with 5 more minutes you can get it to ~5k or so.It&#39;s very easy; you just need to care. Does it matter? Well, when I used Slack I regularly spent a minute waiting for them to push their &gt;10M updates, so I&#39;d say that 250k here and 250k there etc. adds up and matters, giving real actual improvements to your customers.The Event Horizon Telescope having a huge favicon I can understand; probably just some astronomer who uploaded it in WordPress or something. Arguably a fault of the software for not dealing with that more sensibly, but these sort of oversights happen.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The difference between the Apple “precomposed” and standard icons had to do with the gloss effect on icons on pre iOS 7 home screens.When adding a website/webapp to these earlier home screens, the OS would apply a gloss effect over the icon in order to match the aesthetic of the standard apps.
The precomposed icon was a way for the developer to stop the OS from applying this effect, such as if their logo already had a different gloss effect already applied (i.e “precomposed”) or other design where adding the glossy shine wouldn’t look right.
The standard icon allowed the OS to apply the gloss effect - which was a timesaver as Apple did tweak the gloss contour over the years: hence using a standard icon ensured that the website/webapp always matched the user’s OS version."</p>

I hope they do well, and I hope they don&#39;t change too much in the pursuit of a profit.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I believe the thing we often need to learn is the thing we&#39;re afraid of learning. We often (always?) have weaknesses that can/do jeopardize our strength and closing those weaknesses is crucial.The famous Scott Galloway (whom I had as a b-school professor) made this point like this: if you are a great guy, great father, great boss, etc, but once in a while you get violently drunk and hurt people in your life - THAT thing offsets everything else. You won&#39;t become better by &#34;doubling down&#34; on what you&#39;re already good at, but by fixing this flaw.Another case - I used to manage a C++ developer. If you gave him a tight spec, he&#39;d implement it perfectly. But the world we lived in required him to go talk to people to figure out what the real needs are, and he was bad at that. So his code always solved the wrong problem unless someone was helping him with this stuff.Every year, his own developmental goal was to go learn the next C++ standard. And that would have been useless because he was already a great C++ programmer. Going from 97th percentile to the 98th wouldn&#39;t matter. The much bigger bang for the buck would be figuring out how to go sit down with a sales rep and say &#34;OK, what&#39;s our client actually trying to do here?&#34;It sounds simple but I believe this held him back not just in work but in life. I happen to know that he didn&#39;t have great communication with his wife and kids either - solving this thing would make him so much better at all parts of his life.The thing is - we all have glaring things like this - obstacles in our own trajectory that if we fix, our existing strength would really shine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can relate to the “looking at data” as a skill bit, especially the part where he mentions that it’s not a skill most data scientists necessarily have. I have observed that too. (I’m one myself)Many data scientists like to jump into feature extraction and modeling the data with ML/DS tools because for us that’s the fun part. (we might look at some plots and summary statistics but we don’t dwell there for too long.) Few have the patience to just sit with the data for a week just to look at it, checking it against our intuition about the real world and the domain and basically just trying to put 2 and 2 together without models (except a mental model of the world) and just turning the data over in Tableau (or Excel). It’s actually not an easy skill to learn because it requires other meta skills. For one it requires an ability to match numbers to the real world — and for that you need experience and a good intuition of how the world works.My first manager was exceptionally good at doing this. I’ve noticed too that folks in senior management — at least competent ones — tended to be good at looking at data and picking out things too. I suspect this is actually a make or break ability to get to senior management at most companies.Data scientists, not so much. (Unless they worked in the field or came from the business side of things.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The bit about compilers reminds me of this quote about Feyman, but sorry of the inverse where you hold tricks in your head instead of problems.Richard Feynman was fond of giving the following advice on how to be a genius. You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say, &#39;How did he do it? He must be a genius!&#39;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We are seeing a long term consolidation between hearing devices and headphones.On the headphones side, we are getting smaller, truly-wireless headphones with some ambient sound features (such as noise cancellation, and iOS hearing features). New trends like AR would just accelerate the change due to the need to solve all day worn audio devices.On the hearing aids side, almost every hearing aid today acts as an always connected set of headphones for your mobile phone (and has been like that for years on iOS).Deregulating this could bring the tech industry innovation to hearing aids through natural progression of headphones technology.This trend would make hearing aids not just target hearing impaired people, but also individual with normal hearing. For example, features such as protecting your ears against a sudden loud noise, silencing a loud restaurant so you can have a quiet conversation or improving the audio of a soft speaker could be useful for everyone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How much would you pay for:*Hearing test* Hearing aid fitting* Usage counselling* Follow up adjustments* Annual retest of your hearing* Replacement of lost hearing aids* Unlimited repair for 3 years
??======
I got out of the Audiology field in 2015.
At that time all the above was included for every hearing aid we sold (Prices varied from $750 / ear - $3600 / ear.When I was in that field many companies tried &#34;pay as you go&#34; models, instead of bundles.You know what happened? 
People paid the minimum (test, and fit)
the never returned for repairs or re-tunings.And then complained to everyone that &#34;hearing aids don&#39;t work&#34;.Buy a hearing aid today from any major provider in Canada and you get:Initial testInitial fittingFollow up testsFollow up re tunesCounsellingrepairs - including full replacement in case of lossBatteriesIn-clinic repairs and cleanings.100% return, and in some cases $0.00 3 month trial period.There is far more to fixing your hearing issues that just amplifying sound. Sadly, most people wait too long before trying a hearing aid, and give up because they hear too much noise.Imagine returning your eye glasses because you still see ugly people.I truly wish hearing aids were far cheaper, and that was a very hard part of my job and one of the reasons why I changed careers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are a number of healthcare areas in the US that have been protected by regulation, but it’s increasingly unclear if this is good for patients, consumers, or public health at large. The increasing sentiment seems to be probably not.Vision care is another area I’d expect to see more changes and disruption coming down the pipeline. Vision care is very important and advanced cases require special skills, but it’s also unclear why many routine checks couldn’t just be done by a family doctor.The US requires one to see a “doctor of optometry” to get a basic single vision prescription. That industry used to make its money turning around and selling you glasses from the same office but that whole industry has been turned upside down by online retailers like Warby Parker and such. Why the US can’t follow the models followed most elsewhere in the world is unclear, but it would remove a lot of extra steps and costs in getting a basic care of glasses. Ophthalmology (medical doctors) are still very much a thing but most countries don’t have this model of needed a “prescription” from an optometrist for a basic pair of single vision specs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just as important as recycling these batteries is making it possible for older EVs to have their batteries replaced years down the road with 3rd party batteries.In 2031, it should be possible to by a long-past-warranty 2021 EV, replace the battery pack (with one made from recycled EV batteries!), and have it just-work.   Just like you can replace the engine of a classic car today if you are so inclined.It should be possible because the electrical connection of the batteries to EV drivetrains are relatively simple - although I&#39;m sure that will take a lawsuit (like was launched against Nespresso to allow 3rd party coffee pods) for EV manufacturers to release the specs required for this to happen.It would be unfortunate if EV batteries were non-serviceable except by the manufacturer after they were out of warranty, like phones are today.   Instead, battery replacement would potentially allow the tertiary used EV market to flourish, and make them more accessible to people of modest means."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We need to design devices such as batteries for recycling and long life from the design phase of the products. Solid-state Lithium batteries will probably be easier to recycle due to no sandwiching. &#34;The immediate benefit of switching from a liquid to solid electrolyte is that the energy density of the battery can increase. This is because instead of requiring large separators between the liquid cells, solid state batteries only require very thin barriers to prevent a short circuit.&#34; This separator material complicates recycling in conventional Lithium ion batteries.Instead of assuming we have endless resources we should design all products to recyclable from the start design phase. This is to lessen global warming and environmental impact."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thanks Google. Think I’ll be buying this.I want as little to do with Google’s services as possible in my life, but they really deserve credits for making a modern usable smartphone that is reasonably open. There is just one single feature I will be buying this for - the 5 years of software updates. While good image processing is definitely a pro, all of these software you’re presenting features I really don’t give a damn about. Just give me a phone that is meant to last a little while - and allow me to run what I damn please. This looks to be like a continuation of the Pixel 5, which allows you run your own software like /e/OS and CalyxOS aside to just being a lot less of a walled garden on the stock ROM.The Android market is completely dire, and no vendor can be trusted to provide openness, reasonable taste or security updates. They sell you a phone, and once you’ve clicked buy they’ve already stopped caring. So last year I switched to an iPhone 12. I needed to vote with my wallet to get a phone that lasts. But although I get what’s appealing about iPhones and the walled garden, I started feeling claustrophobic. Feeling claustrophobic about what I can tailor about my browser, how easily I can run Game Boy games, what ads I can block, and Apple’s stated intents to actively incriminate you by scanning your photos on a personal device. I will continue to recommend those phones for most people (pending what they’re going to do with trying to incriminate you), but it’s not for me.Finally here’s a seemingly good Android phone with 5 years of support - from the only phone vendor outside of Apple who appears to give a damn about that aspect. Don’t get me wrong: 5 years is still too short in my view, and not as long as Apple provides support for on their stuff [1]. But the market needs change, and I’ll put money towards that.[1]: The iPhone 5S has just hit 8 years of _kernel_ security updates last month with iOS 12.5.5. One can dream on the Android side, but I’ll take 5 years in the current market."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate the trend that the &#34;pro&#34; versions of all these flagship phones need to be an XL Phablet monstrosity. Human hands haven&#39;t gotten any bigger. I have owned most of the Nexus &amp; Pixel phones throughout the years. After having the Nexus 6 as my daily driver for 2 years, I have always opted for the smaller option ever since.I would totally pay flagship prices for a regular ~5.5-6&#34; phone with flagship specs, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one. Make it 50% thicker if there are space/heat concerns, but making it wider and taller just makes it super difficult to use consistently with one hand. I also say this as somebody with larger-than-average hands!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I couldn&#39;t wait any longer so I purchased a very expensive Samsung S21 Ultra ($1200) because no Google phone could lure me away from my fading Pixel 2 XL.My mistake, because the Samsung phone had preloaded software that took considerable effort to remove (more than most people could/would deal with). It wasn&#39;t the software itself that bothered me, but rather that there were notifications for apps I don&#39;t use that I could not turn off. That&#39;s enough to make me hate a company for a long time.Bloat my phone all you want, but notifications take my brain-space, not my drive space. At least with a Google phone I have a semblance of control over the core function of the device. Looking forward to the Pixel 7 or equivalent once this Samsung device has served its purpose."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve always felt like there were two types of frameworks. Both types make the first x% of work relatively easy, but then the two types differentiate based off of how easily it is to drop down and go custom.A framework with strong primitives makes it easy to create custom functionality that is still consistent with the framework&#39;s conventions. But a framework that relies too much on magic makes this much harder. It&#39;s like all of a sudden you&#39;re surrounded with old Mainers saying &#34;you can&#39;t get there from here&#34; while you desperately try to cobble some kind of solution using ancient lore documented once long ago in a forgotten scroll."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The hammer analogy breaks down from the get-go for me. The main distinguishing factor between a framework and a library is the classic &#34;you call a library, but a framework calls you.&#34;A better (but still imperfect) analogy might be buying a timber frame (with plan) versus home-rolling a stick frame from the ground up. With the planned timber frame house, the rough layout of the rooms and plumbing and such is somewhat predetermined, and as such it &#34;calls you&#34; in the sense that you&#39;re building out the amenities, but with the ground-up stick frame, you&#39;re explicitly making all the framing decisions too.Like all things, there are bad frameworks, but scoped appropriately (simply) they can be incredibly useful. Just like houses, it turns out there are many ways in which web services are similar to each other and can benefit from a common framing."</p>

If government investigation, findings of wrongdoing, admission of lies, and punishment aren&#39;t enough to shake Tether users out of their trees, then what would, exactly?Ethereum allowed a claw-back of funds lost fair and square to a defective contract. Where is Ethereum now? Oh yeah, near an all-time high and a market cap approaching half a trillion dollars.What non-users don&#39;t get is the fanatical level of devotion by users.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Since the article mentions it, the amount of carbonation in any given beverage actually varies by a lot. The traditional measurement of carbonation is in &#34;volumes&#34;, which is the amount of space the CO2 would take up at standard temperature and pressure (32F and 1 atm). Coca Cola is usually packaged at 3 volumes; if you took all the CO2 out of the soda it would occupy 3x the volume of the soda it came from.Alcoholic beverages on the other hand have a pretty wide range of regular carbonation levels. On your lower end you have stouts and Scottish ales at 1.9-2.1, and on the high end you get your dubbel and heffe weisen at 3-3.5 volumes. Champagne is regularly in the 4.5-6 range, which necessitates a different bottle and closure design to handle the 2-3x pressure it contains compared to beer.On a particularly dumb note, ciders are limited by law to 0.64g per 100ml, or 3.2 volumes. Above that level they cease being ciders and instead become a sparkling wine. This is very important because natural cider is taxed at $0.226 per gallon, while sparkling wine is taxed at $3.30 or $3.40 per gallon depending on how the carbonation is added. This is a difference of roughly 30 cents per standard bottle, or $1.79 per six pack; enough of a difference to make similar products more attractive on the market place shelf.https://www.ttb.gov/tax-audit/quick-reference-guide-to-wine-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Putting gaps in is also a useful trick to have up your sleeve if you&#39;re 3d printing internal threads.  If you print threads as continuous bodies, the filament on each layer is effectively a ring which is (because of thread geometry) less supported for part of its length. When it contracts slightly as it cools, it can pull the overhang section of the thread away from the body of the object, and you end up with loose filament strung across the gap.If you cut gaps along the thread, when it prints you&#39;re effectively building a lot of small separated ledges out from a side wall. You don&#39;t have that cooling/tensioning effect and there&#39;s nothing to pull the filament away from where it&#39;s laid down so you end up with a cleaner thread.That&#39;s as long as your retraction settings are well tuned, mind - continuous thread is one long extrusion with no retractions, whereas thread with gaps is potentially lots of islands, depending on how your slicer reacts to the geometry."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A Jury in Delaware decided already that Google Earth doesn&#39;t violate the 1995 Art+Com patent. So the thing is settled.But the fact remains that Art+Com had a working system in 1994 and the Keyhole founders had learned about it working at Silicon Graphics.As it looks like there were multiple teams in the US working on something like or comparable to Terravision. Heck, I wrote a program in 1984 showing the world as a ball with the contours of the continents at the ZX Spectrum. I bet hundred&#39;s if not thousands of people did that as well, it is not that hard and requires only a little trigonometry.I have no further insights into the story, but folks here should at least respect that a small group of hackers and and artists build a working system a good decade before Google Earth was published. I have yet to see any demonstration or video that comes near to Art+Com&#39;s TerraVision in 1994. There are papers written at the same time, a DARPA project working for a single military installation and a lot of work done shortly after TerraVision had been publicly demonstrated, but so far I have yet to see a video from 1994 or before comparable to Art+Com&#39;s TerraVision."</p>

During this time, I was at a company trying to fit browser tech into consumer electronics, so we had to build the technology to run on actual inexpensive and cheap systems. Which became a core unmentioned technology, now called AJAX. Several engineers went to keyhole right at the time of the Google purchase, and did very well. Also remember Earth did little for Google, it was all maps - which had no flying demo, it was just 2d (ish) and useful."</p>

Things people on the internet inclusive but not limited to HN said they will never come back because the future is USB-C.Now I just want to know if the new keyboard has more key travel distance back to the like of MacBook Pro 2015.In case anyone wants to know the thickness difference.MacBook Pro 13&#34; 2015  - 1.8 cmMacBook Pro 13&#34; 2016  - 1.49 / 1.55 cmMacBook Pro 14&#34; / 16&#34;  2021  - 1.55 / 1.66cmSo basically even the new 16&#34; is still thinner than the MacBook 2015 era. Which I think vast majority of people were happy with.Edit: Both 14&#34; and 16&#34; have 254 PPI, up from ~220. Apple tends to stick with same PPI for a very long time. So this is interesting. 3456-by-2234 or 3024-by-1964 is 14:9 Ratio. So somewhere in between the old 16:10 and 3:2 which is current trend of Lenovo and Surface Laptop."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is about the processors, not the laptops, so commenting on the chips instead. They look great, but they look like they&#39;re the M1 design, just more of it. Which is plenty for a laptop! But it&#39;ll be interesting to see what they&#39;ll do for their desktops.Most of the additional chip area went into more GPUs and special-purpose video codec hardware. It&#39;s &#34;just&#34; two more cores than the vanilla M1, and some of the efficiency cores on the M1 became performance cores. So CPU-bound things like compiling code will be &#34;only&#34; 20-50% faster than on the M1 MacBook. The big wins are for GPU-heavy and codec-heavy workloads.That makes sense since that&#39;s where most users will need their performance. I&#39;m still a bit sad that the era of &#34;general purpose computing&#34; where CPU can do all workloads is coming to an end.Nevertheless, impressive chips, I&#39;m very curious where they&#39;ll take it for the Mac Pro, and (hopefully) the iMac Pro."</p>

This also means that every chip Apple creates, from design to manufacturing, will be 100 percent carbon neutral.But what they won&#39;t do is put the chip in an expandable and repairable system so that you don&#39;t have to discard and replace it every few years.  This renders the carbon-neutrality of the chips meaningless.  It&#39;s not the chip, it&#39;s the packaging that is massively unfriendly to the environment, stupid."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good article, thanks for submiting!The challenge for AWS is one lots of incumbents have experienced: they created a market and it&#39;s economics 
and now they&#39;re being attacked by the next generation of market entrants who&#39;ve structured their businesses to _specifically_ attack those economics.What&#39;s interesting is that challenge can be a really big problem for incumbents, as those economics can form a core (very rigid) part of their operating model; it can make it VERY hard to address without fundamental (read: risky) change to a business. There aren&#39;t many examples of incumbent businesses doing it successfully, as it needs a kind of &#39;self-inflicted disruption&#39; that&#39;s very hard to do in large organisations where politics and empire building can make it difficult.If someone could do Managed NAT Gateway next I&#39;d appreciate it!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; So while AWS has 17 ways to run containers and 7 ways to do async message processing, all overlapping and reinforcing and supporting each other, Cloudflare will tend toward introducing singular primitives, stuff them in a box, and try to ship those boxes to as many places as will possibly take them. If they could install Cloudflare on your mobile phone, they would (this gets them dangerously close to being a real life Pied Piper).I think this statement resonates with me the most - it feels a lot like how I prefer to design systems (ahem, thanks Unix!): simple pieces or types, chained together into systems that are easy to understand, maintain, and scale.We&#39;re still only using Cloudflare&#39;s workers and it&#39;s integration with caching, but it&#39;s getting close to the point where I&#39;d have enough primitives to ship some of the functionality of our system architecture to Cloudflare and gain a net-win for latency and simplicity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Minor quibbles about game remarks:Contrary to what the article claims, draws in chess are very common (on the other hand, they&#39;re exceedingly rare in Go, and often impossible due to fractional komi).Sente in Go does correspond to having the initiative, but a move that compels a player into a particular follow-up move should be called a &#34;kikashi&#34; (forcing move)."</p>

He and the others had uncovered DoS, specifically a BGP DoS that would automatically cascade across the Internet.Mudge was a musical prodigy and an alum of BBN, one of the key players in creating ARPAnet.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;From now on I will stay 100% with Vimeo but, as we know, they have a fraction of the viewership of You Tube – primarily because so few people know they even exist.Websurfer awareness is not the primary reason Vimeo has less viewership.The cause &amp; effect before the buildup of awareness is the incentives that prevent content creators to upload videos to Vimeo in the first place:- platform membership fees:  Youtube is $0 to upload and host, Vimeo used to be $240 and now has some new pricing plans[1] with a low-use free tier (too limited for high-res 4k uploads)- no advertising partners : Youtube enables monetization without content creators asking audiences to pay for subscriptions.  This financial model covers a wide variety of videos especially for unknown creators.The financial model of Vimeo is fine but its inherent costs will keep it smaller than Youtube because both the uploaders and the viewers don&#39;t want to pay.[1] https://vimeo.com/upgrade"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"YouTube seems to have three main priorities with their copyright system:1) Eliminate legal liability and risk of lawsuits. Technically all they need to do is comply with DMCA requests, but YouTube would rather not be sued by a major record company or film studio, even if they could win the case.2) Become friendly with major content creators (record and film labels, television studios). YouTube wants a good working relationship with these companies, to ensure that these companies post their content on YouTube. YouTube really wants the views they get by hosting SNL clips and Beyonce music videos.3) Actually help the independent content creators deal with copyright claims. This is a very, very distant third.Because of these priorities, YouTube has decided their best course of action is to offload all of the work on copyright claims onto the independent content creators, in order to keep the big media giants happy. After all, NBC doesn&#39;t need YouTube, but a solo channel with 50k subscribers absolutely does."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a music producer myself who makes music for film, I haven&#39;t had too many problems with use of my music in the work I do despite being distributed on all the usual major platforms. This is usually because content ID on YouTube gives credits and royalties to the original music creators, and most of my (remixed) uploads are not monetized once I publish them on YT. My distributer handles royalties for my all original music and pays me based on streams. I also make more money off spotify than YouTube even though I&#39;ve been on YouTube for a lot longer than on Spotify... Overall though, the best comes from licensing my music in films outside of Internet platforms.I gave up caring long ago about gaining money from views, my most profitable upload was in 2015 when I filmed my parrot falling off my kitchen counter... That video likely succeeded because it wasn&#39;t something that would provide me residual success that overshadowed YouTube&#39;s normal (controlled) revenue pipelines.I do however mysteriously get my own music blocked frequently on uploads to TikTok, and there is only complete and demoralizing frustration in trying to report the issue, because they don&#39;t care about small creators like me because we don&#39;t make them enough money probably.... TikTok and many social platforms keep support only as an afterthought, and finding the right place to get problems solved on most platforms is damn near impossible.The social media creator economy is dismal and highly competitive for musicians and film makers right now. One of the biggest copyright issues is people who completely hijack and fake &#34;original content&#34; as their own in order to get views in order to profit or sell popular accounts to influencers later.I&#39;d recommend primarily pursuing contracts with Amazon Prime or Netflix for independent films, rather than trying to battle YouTube because there is simply too much content ID activity on YouTube that is out of control, whereas on the alternate streaming services, they&#39;re geared more towards movies than to managing creator communities.If you are a film maker who needs music for a film project, contact music makers directly (producers that don&#39;t use samples in the work you need) in order to generate new, original, and exclusive music that they won&#39;t license or release anywhere else perhaps, make them sign a contract too... That might help in the future...?"</p>

I dabbled for a while and tried using PyBullet. Did not go that well.Also thought about creating custom environments in Unity and then apply Deep RL in there. But it took too much effort.Creating a complex enough environment and getting used to it were, in themselves- full projects that took long term commitment.As a result, I did not learn much Deep RL to be able to apply it to complex, real-world-like scenarios.I think that it is going to change.I am excited about books, blogs, and videos that are going to be created as MuJoCo is open-sourced and available for free.I, personally, will get back into Deep RL the next opportunity I get."</p>

The sheer breadth of plugins, themes, and other community-driven tools that have been generated in 18 months is spectacular. It makes it easy to recommend Obsidian because you can shape it into whatever you want.There are a handful of plugins like Dataview, QuickAdd, Kanban and Periodic Notes that make Obsidian an incredibly powerful environment for thought.I made a theme for Obsidian called Minimal that attempts to make the app feel more native, especially on Mac:
https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal...and published a couple of my own plugins and a Web Clipper bookmarklet: https://gist.github.com/kepano/90c05f162c37cf730abb8ff027987...The Obsidian community is just so fun, friendly, and collaborative, that you can&#39;t help but get involved and work on making the ecosystem better."</p>

The db is on a remote server but copied to Dropbox every day (and in any case all the emails also exist in my sent folder).It is surprisingly effective at storing not just what I did with my day, but random thoughts and ideas, solutions to bugs, etc. All I have to do is type something every day.In 2 years I have typed around 150k words. For reading he whole thing is just one plain html page, searchable in the browser.I&#39;m currently experimenting with documenting my reading, while the book is being read (instead of a summary at the end). We typically forget what we expect while we read, and only remember the final impression. Taking notes at the end of each reading session, not just about what I just read, but also about what I think will happen next, and revisiting that later, is surprisingly interesting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My biggest protip for Obsidian would be to never look at the connections graph. If you&#39;ve got any kind of &#34;completionist&#34; mindset, it&#39;s easy to waste a bunch of time trying to perfectly format your notes so every node has a bunch of connections to other nodes. Once I got out of the habit trying to maximize the amount of backlinks in each note, it became a useful tool instead of a chore."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"IPFS needs to decide what it wants to be. Is it about being a decentralized caching layer? Is it about permanently storing content? Is it about replacing my web server? Is it about replacing DNS? Is it about censorship resistance?Right now it does none of those things well. The client chews through CPU and memory when seemingly doing nothing. If I try to download content, it is far slower than BitTorrent unless I go through a centralized gateway. If I add content it takes ages to propagate, making it utterly unsuitable as a replacement for a web server. There is no system to keep content alive so links will still die. The name system is byzantine and I don&#39;t think anyone uses it.Unfortunately, they are now unable to pivot because they did that asinine ICO. The right thing to do is to give up on the FileCoin nonsense and build a system that solves a problem better than anything else, but that is no longer allowed because they already sold something else to their &#34;investors&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like IPFS, I really do, but whenever I try to use it, it&#39;s either too slow to become usable or sometimes it plain doesn&#39;t work. I pinned a whole bunch of files on IPFS a while back to experiment with it and the system seems to work, but every time I try to fetch those resources from a location that hasn&#39;t cached the content yet, it takes several seconds to show me the HTML/JSON/PNG files.HTTP may be inefficient for document storage, but IPFS is inefficient for almost everything else.I like the concepts behind IPFS but it&#39;s simply not practical to use the system in its current form. I hope my issues will get resolved at some point but I can&#39;t shake the thought that it&#39;ll die a silent death like so many attempts to replace the internet before it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pretty interesting. A lot of people here are focusing on permanence, but for me the main difference on addressing by content vs by host name is the loss of authorship it opens up for the web. Since a research paper of essay is referred to by its hash, the owner effectively gives away all control of the work when it&#39;s first published. There will be no editing, no taking down unwanted work, and no real way to build an interactive website that allows dynamic linking to other materials by the author.It&#39;s interesting how the same people promoting the &#34;creator economy&#34; also tend to promote the cryptocurrency space and IPFS without an ounce of self-awareness. IPFS sounds awful for creators of all kinds in the same way as BitTorrent was awful for artists. I can definitely see a use case for IPFS as a file storage for trustless systems such as smart contracts, which are designed as immutable, trustless systems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Schopenhauer used an equation with the answer of 42 to make a metaphysical point in “The World as Will and Idea.” I suspect this is the meaning Adams had in mind:As time has only one dimension, counting is the only arithmetical operation, to which all others may be reduced; and yet counting is just intuition or perception a priori, to which there is no hesitation in appealing here, and through which alone everything else, every sum and every equation, is ultimately proved. We prove, for example, not that (7 + 9 × 8 - 2)/3 = 42; but we refer to the pure perception in time, counting thus makes each individual problem an axiom. Instead of the demonstrations that fill geometry, the whole content of arithmetic and algebra is thus simply a method of abbreviating counting. We mentioned above that our immediate perception of numbers in time extends only to about ten. Beyond this an abstract concept of the numbers, fixed by a word, must take the place of the perception; which does not therefore actually occur any longer, but is only indicated in a thoroughly definite manner. Yet even so, by the important assistance of the system of figures which enables us to represent all larger numbers by the same small ones, intuitive or perceptive evidence of every sum is made possible, even where we make such use of abstraction that not only the numbers, but indefinite quantities and whole operations are thought only in the abstract and indicated as so thought, as [sqrt](r^b) so that we do not perform them, but merely symbolise them.I tried to add this on Wikipedia a while ago, but was overruled by an editor.Source: https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/38427/pg38427-images.htmlMore on Schopenhauer: https://www.locserendipity.com/TitleSearch.html?q=Schopen"</p>

And it left me feeling as ambivalent as I felt before reading it.As the comments here evidence, people read much into it, and the number 42. This is great. I felt books like The Ugly American [0], Honey Badger (Robert Ruark) and King Rat [1] had more to offer. My opinion hasn&#39;t much changed - but I feel the problem lies with me, in that depth and meaning are what I value.Is humour the entirety of the draw for Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide, or  (probably more likely) have I missed something?[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ugly_American[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Rat_(Clavell_novel)"</p>

This “best” is a benchmark not only on my own understanding but also on advancements in APL over the years.&#34; and then shows one he wrote in 1981, one from 1987, then &#34;I worked on perm from time to time in this period [1990-2007] but in J rather than in APL&#34;, then one from 2008, and one from 2015, and where future improvements might be found. In a video talk on it he says &#34;some of these sub-expressions can be improved, but the APL language cannot yet express the thought that I have&#34;[2].

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I suspect the dissenters and Dan are not as far apart as one would expect. What I see in the dissent is a rejection of the specific brand of Silicon Valley rah rah productivity cult. There&#39;s a lot of mysticism in SV style productivity, whether it&#39;s the new hottest app or the latest lifestyle craze. It&#39;s also almost always directed at squeezing more work out of someone who&#39;s already working far too much. What Dan&#39;s proposing is a much more concrete, much more grounded sense of productivity. It&#39;s the difference between trying to get an overworked line cook to fulfill the job of 3 regular workers and watching a master chef work with no extra movements, no wasted energy.I&#39;m sympathetic to the analogy of practice. Too many people are extremely static in their assessment of their skills. They make overarching claims like &#34;oh I&#39;m just not good at cooking&#34; or &#34;I just can&#39;t type very fast&#34;, when they can remedy these issues with practice. Of course they aren&#39;t obligated to do so, but it&#39;s a useful mindset to see weaknesses as potential places of improvement instead of permanent failings. It&#39;s also true that if you&#39;re racing against someone who doesn&#39;t see it as a race, you&#39;ll win. Granted they probably won&#39;t care, but sometimes people get to the end, realize they did care about the race, and were just never clued into the fact that it was a race."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem I have with discussions about “productivity” (including 10x engineer chest-beating) is that no one ever defines what they mean by the word. Is it lots of lines of code? Is it clean design and architecture that’s easy to maintain and extend? Responding quickly to business needs? Making a lot of money in a short time?Too often, people arbitrarily choose what they’re good at, or what someone else they admire is good at, call that “productivity,” and then come up with a post-hoc rationalization of why that’s good.Note: I only skimmed the article, so consider this a comment on productivity discussions in general rather than the specific article.(Oh, and a pet peeve: the agile concept of “velocity” originally introduced by Extreme Programming is absolutely not a measure of productivity. It’s a way of predicting your capacity for the next iteration. I’ve taken to calling it “capacity” instead of velocity for that reason.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who also tracks time in some amount of detail (to bill clients for it), communication, and _written_ communication in particular takes a surprising amount of time. All those Slack threads you might not even think twice of engaging in can easily destroy half your working day, even if you ignore the cost of context switching. Emails take longer than you think. Design docs take _much_ longer than you think. Code reviews take longer than you think also.For me at least coding seems to take less time objectively than subjectively, but it&#39;s also quite obvious that most of my time is not spent on coding, sadly. A good chunk of it is completely unproductive bullshit that simply has to happen because that&#39;s how the company chooses to operate. I tell them it&#39;s not the only way to do things, but they insist on wasting ~1.5 person days a week on &#34;standups&#34; and &#34;scrum&#34; (the team is 12 people, excluding me). They could _easily_ move 50% faster if they shed that bullshit and just gave people sizable tasks and some degree of autonomy and personal responsibility. Instead it&#39;s down to who can _appear_ the busiest during standup."</p>

That feature happened to break 3rd party seeking. It probably wasn&#39;t intentional, just incidental.Because they have no internal requirement to support this, nor anyone/anything testing for it, it silently broke.It was probably not malicious, even if it feels like a step backwards to this extension developer.Whether it _should_ be fixed of course, is a different matter, but when I see statements like &#34;DRM vendors REALLY want you to buy a smart TV&#34;[1] I frown, as it is contains an assumption of intent that I suspect isn&#39;t there.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28896614Edit: The title of the article (and original title here) is &#34;Netflix&#39;s new player is an open web nightmare&#34;.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sorry, a little off topic gripe about the article itself. I have gigabit internet and still noticed the two images for this article loading line by line, top to bottom. Upon inspection I see they are using massive (5.67mb &amp; 3.6mb) .png images with a resolution of 2832x1838. However, the maximum size they are ever displayed is 836x546.It took me less than 1 minute to do a quick and dirty optimization bringing them down to less than 100kb each.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The boolean tracking appears to be something like an asset state machine / tracking running in the virtual player. Manually seeking the video tag is likely an unexpected change triggering an exceptional transition in the logic.The thing to keep in mind here is that the seeking timeline of a video tag element does not need to represent the actual media timeline when you are using MSE. It can represent any time the virtual player running in JavaScript wants to maintain and is usually more related to the buffer timeline and ensuring pts continuity across segment appends. Netflix has historically had relatively simple streams which may have allowed this to be the actual seek time, but looks like some deeper streaming changes are landing. For a more complicated example take a look at how multi-asset vod and live streams in a single video tag surface times.I don&#39;t work for Netflix, but do work in the field and since it&#39;s relatively small know some of the folks over at Netflix. They definitely aren&#39;t out to break things purposely, it&#39;s more likely not a case they exercise and broken by a change like someone else has said. If you want to patch the functionality it may be worth exploring the dispatch of mouse clicks on the seek bar. That probably does a translate to time and then calls the virtual player seek API which would be the new hook point you want."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"1. S3 Standby/suspend support.If your laptop supports that, you can close the lid and it will power ~everything except the RAM down (sometimes a USB port still charges). In &#39;new&#39; laptops, including almost everything Tiger lake and Intel, S3 is being phased out for Microsoft&#39;s &#34;Modern Standby&#34;, known as S0ix (or sometimes InstantGo). This is much more like a mobile phone, where it stays on but attempts to use as little battery as possible.So, peripherals might shut down, but you might still be able to get critical Windows Updates or receive an important notification -- all while your laptop is unplugged, lid closed, in your bag overnight. This is pretty bad for heat, battery, and often not what you might expect. My new laptop uses about 15% battery overnight, just doing nothing.In the future, perhaps this mode will work as well as S3 used to for battery life, but finding your laptop fans on while it&#39;s closed inside your bag and getting really hot is not fun. This applies to lots of laptops currently.2. A good screen. Brightness that goes high enough to be seen outside (400, or more) - and it&#39;ll usually auto turn down the rest of the time to save battery. Hard to go wrong on a Mac, but really variable screen quality across other brands and models. You&#39;ll spend a lot of time looking at the screen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; if I&#39;m missing on any new developments since 2015Yes, you missed something huge.Apple Silicon M1 or nothing.  It&#39;s just too good.  Low power consumption allows the laptop to actually be used as a laptop.  The power use-to-performance ratio is unmatched by anything on the market. Apple is breaking us free from decades of stagnation on the hardware front.Nothing else on the market comes close. I expect this to change in the future. Will happily switch to a linux laptop once an energy efficient alternative to x86 becomes mainstream for linux.  There&#39;s just no way I can go back to x86 after tasting the sweet nectar of M1."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"0. Linux compatibility, I am not super picky about getting everything to work perfectly but I should be able to trust that the software I prefer to use will run and my laptop will connect to wifi and play audio properly and so on.1. IPS screen (mostly a given nowadays, but this wasn&#39;t always so)2. Trackpoint, I hate trackpads. Pretty rare option so I could possibly be convinced otherwise if the trackpad is particularly good.3. Decent keyboard, any laptop will always be primarily a text processing machine for me.
 (tablet version)
4. User serviceability, with battery and RAM being highest priority but expandable storage is nice too, and all other replaceable parts are a nice bonus.5. General ruggedness, the whole point of a laptop is being able to travel with it and it&#39;s the kind of tech I expect to last me for years.6. Battery life, though I am not super picky about this.7. Everything else including performance, higher resolutions than 768p, thinness, appearance, touchscreen (roughly listed in order of preference).Posted from my trusty Thinkpad X230t which is the only laptop I&#39;m aware of that ticks nearly all my boxes. It&#39;s bulky and makes a vacuum cleaner noise when compiling and the battery only lasts 4-5 hours of normal use, though. Still, good enough for web browsing, various forms of text processing, watching videos, listening to music and the vast majority of what you might use a computer for.I did look into the Framework laptop recently but while it&#39;s probably the closet things in a long time the keyboard doesn&#39;t look good and there&#39;s no trackpoint (nor even physical mouse buttons)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked in Python for years and while I suppose I&#39;m glad for any improvement, I have never understood the obsession with true multi-threading. Languages are about trade-offs and Python, again and again, chooses flexibility over performance. It&#39;s a good choice! You can see it in how widely Python is used and the diversity of its applications.Performance doesn&#39;t come from any one quality, but from the holistic goals at each level of the language. I think some of the most frustrating aspects from the history of Python have been when the team lost focus on why and how people used the language (i.e. the 2 -&gt; 3 transition, though I have always loved 3). I hope that this is a sensible optimization and not an over-extension."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder how many folks think they&#39;re writing thread safe software with ease, and are unaware that they are leaning on the GIL?Could be that the impact of this change is far broader than just a few key libraries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; These changes are major enough that a fair number of existing Python libraries that work directly with Python’s internals (e.g., Cython) would need to be rewritten. But the cadence of Python’s release schedule just means such breaking changes would need to be made in a major point release instead of a minor one.Maybe time to rethink? https://www.techrepublic.com/article/programming-languages-w...If this is as promising as it sounds, it seems Python 4 now has its &#34;thing&#34; and is on the horizon.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"For  some reason I enabled the ‘auto refill’ on my new canon printer because that is what our office did (somehow).Don’t do that: it kept making purchases because it didn’t receive the ink as fast as it expected due to supply chain issues. It took a long time for Canon to cancel the orders that had never left the factory and give our hundreds of dollars back.It’s a fun story at least!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Last month, my friend&#39;s HP Laserjet Pro printer started flashing &#34;SUPPLY PROBLEM&#34; error message and wouldn&#39;t print anything. Apparently, all he did was update the firmware after a message popped up on the printer urging him to do so.Well, that firmware update included new DRM checks for non-HP toners. The printer would just refuse to work with 3rd party toner cartridges.I had to help him and had to find an old firmware and downgrade to an older one which didn&#39;t contain the DRM. The firmware didn&#39;t come from HP&#39;s website because they deleted all old versions so I downloaded the version off someone&#39;s Google Drive. Who knows if that FW contains something malicious. Also, I had to install Windows because old firmware update is a Windows program. You&#39;re SOL if you use macOS or Linux.This incident didn&#39;t make my friend go and buy $200+ worth of original toners like HP intended. All it did was make him anxious of updating anything and of using HP products and has wasted a lot of his and my time. He said he won&#39;t buy another HP printer again.If you want to learn more, search for &#34;HP supply problem&#34; with your fav search engine. Or see this link on HP support forums [1]. And don&#39;t update your printer&#39;s firmware if it&#39;s working fine... because who knows when they&#39;ll disable FW downgrade option and you&#39;ll be stuck with a DRMed printer.Edit: Just in case you found this comment through a search engine or this has affected you, I recommend downloading FW from this page [2]. It also has a list of affected HP Color LaserJet Pro printers (there&#39;s quite a few models.. the page lists 11 models). That blog also has a full saga of HP&#39;s shenanigans and their attempts to block aftermarket cartridges [3].[1] https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Printing-Errors-or-Lights-Stuc...[2] https://borncity.com/win/2021/02/02/firmware-downgrade-for-h...[3] https://borncity.com/win/2020/11/08/hp-firmware-update-for-i..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Would be great if Spotify had* &#34;good fit&#34;/&#34;bad fit&#34; button — I like a wide variety of music, but it needs to be appropriate to context. If I start a radio from a song, I&#39;d like to teach it to tailor the suggested songs better but that doesn&#39;t mean I dislike the songs it _is_ suggesting.* Ability to give the social context — a band playing at a music festival will lean more towards hits in their back catalogue. At their own gig they may play some obscure stuff that die hard fans will really like. Similarly, what I&#39;m listening to will be different if I&#39;m having a party, friends over for dinner or on my own. On a family account, you should also be able to say who is listening &amp; it should tailor to music that you might all enjoy.* I get that they don&#39;t want to block artists/songs completely but they _should_ allow limiting how many times they suggest it per day. If I&#39;ve listened to Everywhere by Fleetwood Mac on one playlist I probably don&#39;t want to hear it again an hour later on another playlist"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A dislike button would be handy. There is that feature on some of the generated playlists, but I don&#39;t think they do anything. My two biggest issues with Spotify right now are:
1. Release Radar filled with re-releases and remixes, often from artists who have long since passed away. I want new music as in released for the first time.
2. Name collisions. I&#39;m surprised this is an issue, but I will often get songs from different artists with the same name. And then I&#39;m unsure if selecting &#34;I don&#39;t like this song&#34; or &#34;I don&#39;t like this artist&#34; will affect the actually intended artist.I&#39;ve also reached a tipping point where I no longer find new music through algorithmic recommendations. To be fair it&#39;s taken about 5 years to reach this point. Now the good music I find comes from searching for curated playlists. It&#39;s come full circle as before streaming I got my music recommendations from blogs and friends."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m apparently in the minority, but I long for a return of the 5-star ranking.  I really miss that about itunes, being able to rank each song, and set up smart playlists based on genre and how much variety (how deep in the star rankings) I wanted.I&#39;d have to think an intelligent recommendation engine could do a ton more with star rankings than a simple up/down too.  5=love, 4=like, 3=ok, 2=dislike, 1=hate.  It could even be optional; they could just treat like and dislike as 4 and 2 or something, and let people who want more precision use them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a good example of making the mistake of conflating implementation details and user interface design.Firefox always had two boxes: URL bar and search. One of the big changes Chrome made when it was born was to have the Omnibar, being of course one bar that does both.If you think about this as an engineer, Firefox&#39;s design decision makes sense. You don&#39;t want to accidentally leak things to a search engine. URLs and search bars are just different. There are also corner cases where you&#39;re not sure if something is a URL or a search term, mostly to do with intranets (eg &#34;go/foo&#34; can be a URL internally).But users don&#39;t care about any of that. Users don&#39;t have the mental model to differentiate search terms and a URL. Chrome&#39;s decision was correct. It&#39;s surprising how long Firefox stuck with their bad (IMHO) design.Here&#39;s another example of this: IIRC one of the most frequently searched terms on Google is &#34;facebook&#34;. Tech-savvy people will just type &#34;facebook.com&#34; but users will just search for &#34;facebook&#34; and click on the (hopefully) first result. That happens a ton.So the lesson is don&#39;t leak technical and implementation details into interface design. Your users don&#39;t care about any of that.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"serde is one of the best things about Rust in practice.It is more convenient to use serde to serialize/deserialize to some standard format like JSON or YAML than it is to write your own half-baked format and serialization/deserialization code --- even for the simplest tasks --- so you just stop doing the latter. This is a fundamental shift, and very good for your software.&#34;Convenience&#34; here actually covers a lot of ground. The APIs are convenient. Boilerplate code is minimal (#[derive(Serialize)]). serde&#39;s attributes give you lots of control over the serialization/deserialization, while still being convenient to use. cargo makes importing serde into your project effortless. All of these are necessary to achieve that shift away from custom formats.Before Rust I used to write a lot of one-off half-baked formats. Pernosco uses Rust and serde and it uses no half-baked formats. Everything&#39;s JSON, or YAML if it needs to be more human-editable, or bincode if it needs to be fast and compact and not human-readable or extensible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Whilst not classical de/serialization I wrote serde_v8 (https://github.com/denoland/serde_v8), an expressive and ~maximally efficient bijection between v8 &amp; rust.It has powered Deno&#39;s op-layer since 1.9 (https://deno.com/blog/v1.9#faster-calls-into-rust-with-serde...) and has enabled significant improvements in opcall overhead (close to 100x) whilst also simplifying said op-layer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me, Serde is one of the killer features of Rust. Once you realize how much of programming is (for better or worse) shuttling data between different representations, it&#39;s hard for me to program in a language where I don&#39;t have a tool like Serde.A big part of its flexibility is how modular it is. Most common Rust libraries support serde serialization (at least as an optional feature), so if you use crates that do, you can plug any backend in and serialize those data structures to it. It doesn&#39;t even have to be string-based; I&#39;ve been using Serde to store arbitrary data structures as objects on Google Cloud Firestore."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Trust busting can seem like it’s anti free market, but when a company has a monopoly on a network it stops functioning as a company and basically becomes a government. The problem with Facebook/Amazon/Google is that they have a monopoly on a specific information network, for Facebook the social graph, internet discoverability for Google, and online shopping for Amazon. It’s similar to if a single company owned the road systems or the internet, since the structure of these networks means that competitors can’t exist, there can only be one network for it to have value, so the first company to build it will have a monopoly and be able to indefinitely milk it for a profit.The same thing happened with railroad barons in the 1800s and also in other areas of the economy, and the trust busting response the government took seems to have worked well to bring back a fair market. Government should keep the information networks predictable and accessible.This is a core theme in George Gilder’s controversial but imho extremely insightful book Knowledge and Power: The Information Theory of Capitalism and How it is Revolutionizing our World: https://www.amazon.com/Knowledge-Power-Information-Capitalis..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sigh, another day, another blame of Facebook for destroying Snap.Fundamentally, products are always gonna get copied. Google tried to do it to Facebook, back when FB was the size that Snap was at the time, how well did that work?Fundamentally, while competing with a megacorp sucks monkey balls, Snap shot themselves in the foot with their boneheaded product strategy.They literally didn&#39;t invest in their Android app because they wanted to be exclusive. Given that the vast majority of countries are majority Android, this gave FB the space to clone their product and put it in front of hundreds of millions of users who&#39;d never seen the concept before.Ultimately, while I do agree with most of the articles points (breaking up the internet behemoths would probably be a good idea), I really dislike the Snap analogy, as they could easily have beaten FB to the punch if they&#39;d had an effective growth strategy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As Wu and others have rightly pointed out, the straightforward Chicago School standard overlooks, among other things, the stifling effect monopolies can have on innovation. As a case in point: when AT&amp;T was broken up in 1984, a torrent of new products came on the market, everything from the first answering machines to early ISPs.This is a oversimplification and wrong.  
AT&amp;T was controlled by the government until 1984 and only because of this we were able to got technical innovations like UNIX, The C Programming Language and reusable open-source software. This formed not only the foundation of Linux and C but also later the Internet. And all of this happened because AT&amp;T was actually controlled instead of split up. They were not allowed to enter new markets and therefore we benefit all. What happened next? UNIX-Wars, Lawsuits and disastrous situation which enabled especially Microsoft.The lesson learned here is that - just mere splitting up - doesn&#39;t fix anything. The government subsequently did actually nothing against Microsoft and it&#39;s contracts with PC-Manufacturers. What I cannot say is whether the government still doesn&#39;t understand what software is and it&#39;s influence?Especially mass gravitation through user. Or if just no market regulation happens since the 1980ies.I wonder how Personal-Computers and the handling of source-code would&#39;ve been evolved if BSD and SysV were have been better friends? The appreciation of source code availability? And maybe an simple option at the store which sold that IBM-PCs with the 386 processors. If you got that &#34;UNIX&#34; thing on our PC with the source - you would probably wondered a lot that the spreadsheet application doesn&#39;t came with the source...especially when you pay for it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The view I share with a majority of Germans: Costs of nuclear energy are very much a burden that future generations will have to carry. A hundered thousand years of safe storage is not part of the calculation of the energy price. It is also clear now that the the companies running the plants will not pay for the deconstruction of the plants after they reached their end of life. Tax payers have to pay for this, and a large part of the remains will need to be stored safely for millenia as well. This is the opposite of sustainability and fairness towards future generations. Worldwide there still exists only a single final storage solution for nuclear waste - in Finland for the finish waste. In densly populated Germany the search for a storage site has been going on since the late 1950s, so far without success. All this on top of the risk of a system failure that would devastate huge territories.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s worth noting that nuclear is really expensive when factoring in insurance and disposable, a lot more so than wind and solar.&gt;The cost of generating solar power ranges from $36 to $44 per megawatt hour (MWh), the WNISR said, while onshore wind power comes in at $29–$56 per MWh. Nuclear energy costs between $112 and $189.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-energy-nuclearpower/nucle..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One generally underappreciated aspect to nuclear energy opposition is the intrinsic link to nuclear weapons.  Some of it is scientifically illiterate nonsense (a lot of people seem to think power reactors can have a nuclear explosion).  And some of it is just historical association.  But some of it is a lot harder to dismiss.A world without nuclear reactors or enrichment facilities is a world without nuclear weapons.  Any medium or large industrialized country with power reactors could build nukes very quickly.  It&#39;s bad enough half a dozen already have.  This notion keeps some people up at night, I think.  If you consider nuclear weapons to be an existential threat to the species -- perhaps worse than climate change -- then building infrastructure that would allow their more easy construction might seem like madness."</p>

My usage is sparse, and I use messenger to talk with people I know, it kept us together. I can see how community and bringing old friends together is precious.But, recently, I realized someone I used to be very close has mental problems. Undiagnosed, but there is no other way I can explain his behaviour to myself. Obsessive behaviour, can only talk about his conspiratorial obsession, erratic, spends most of his time &#34;learning&#34; about a specific conspiracy. And I see how Facebook is exacerbating this. I see how these things are poisoning his mind, fantasies weaved by other mentally ill people. It&#39;s just sad, when I thought about it and dawned on me  most of those _wild_ conspiracy theories are people that need help feeding each other&#39;s sickness.And then I look on my dad&#39;s wall, and saw the same hatred and resentment growing, and it scared me, the possibility he might drift even more this way.Now I changed my mind. I think it is harmful and it does induce bad states in people that would otherwise be better, or at least... Surrounded by better support systems. But I still think it&#39;s not _just_ Facebook. It&#39;s a confluence of factors."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a side note, I&#39;m a little saddened when I see friends apologize for their posts. There&#39;s such a reaction to &#34;influencer culture&#34; that people feel like foodgrams and humblebrags are a terrible thing, and in excess they certainly can be, but I think from most people it&#39;s a billion times better than strawman political arguments and manipulative media that is far worse for our mental health than just comparing ourselves to someone&#39;s good day.I had a friend post a picture of food made from ingredients they had made in their own garden, and it made them feel so good to eat it because they had had a rough year and it was a good personal win, so they apologetically posted a photo of it.Forget the rest of the trash on Facebook - seeing a friend I haven&#39;t seen in a while experience something good and being able to share that with them is something we need more of in the world. I&#39;d trade away all the &#34;only geniuses can remember the order of operations for this future scam page&#34; or &#34;you won&#39;t believe how this person misrepresents their opponents views and tears that misrepresentation apart!&#34; and keep stuff like this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Despite its reputation, Kubernetes is actually quite easy to master for simple use cases. And affordable enough for more complex ones.The fundamental abstractions are as simple as they can be, representing concepts that you&#39;d already be familiar with in a datacenter environment. A cluster has nodes (machines), and you can run multiple pods (which is the smallest deployable unit on the cluster) on each node. A pod runs various types of workloads such as web services, daemons, jobs and recurring jobs which are made available (to the cluster) as docker/container images. You can attach various types of storage to pods, front your services with load-balancers etc.All of the nouns in the previous paragraph are available as building blocks in Kubernetes. You build your complex system declaratively from these simpler parts.When I look at Nomad&#39;s documentation, I see complexity. It mixes these basic blocks with those from HashiCorp&#39;s product suite."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been running a production-grade Nomad cluster on Hetzner for the past 1 1/2 years and it&#39;s fantastic. It was amazingly easy to set up compared to Kubernetes (which I also did), the UI is awesome, updates haven&#39;t broken anything yet (as long as you follow the changelog) and it&#39;s stable. I really like the separation of concerns the HashiStack offers. You can start out just using Consul for your service meshing, and then add Nomad + Vault to get a similar experience to Kubernetes.Yes, it doesn&#39;t cover as many features as Kubernetes, but it should be good enough for most software and you can still make the switch later. I would never go back.You can read more on our blog if you&#39;re interested: https://pirsch.io/blog/techstack/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It has a Quectel EG25-G modem.I&#39;ve not used this particular device, but I have used Quectel GNSS modules, and they&#39;ve been a surprisingly helpful company to work with. I&#39;m a nobody, and working with Sony, Trimble, or ublox has been an exercise in frustration; you have to convince a salesperson that you&#39;re a big company and you can sell thousands of devices in order to just read the datasheet.  This one does have some of the documents locked behind an access request, but in my experience, they&#39;ve been very generous with those grants.The modem supports the following bands:    LTE-FDD: B1/B2/B3/B4/B5/B7/B8/B12/B13/B18/B19/B20/B25/B26/B28

    WCDMA: B1/B2/B4/B5/B6/B8/B19

which is pretty good. Americans will want 4G bands B2, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14, 17, 20, 25, 26, 29, 30, 41, 66, and 71; this implements 9/15, it&#39;s missing bands 14, 17, 29, 30, 66, and 71. Those missing bands are either subsets or supersets of other bands (which could be interesting from a firmware perspective - will a tower with a band 66 antenna give this modem some of the central band 4 subset, or will it try to negotiate a channel that this can&#39;t access?), little-used ATT bands, or the 600 MHz T-mobile band 71, which has a wide rollout but poor device support."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I received a Pinephone in the latest shipment, about three weeks ago. I also got the convergence dock to be able to attach a monitor, keyboard and mouse. I am extremely motivated to get off Android on my phone, and yet my Pinephone has already been discarded (and I never even put a SIM card in it).There are far too many out-of-the-box bugs and glitches to consider this a usable product. For example, the convergence dock will not display on a monitor. Firefox browser displays too wide for the phone screen, so unusable. A dozen other issues on first day.Even a development board should work better than this, have documentation of the known problems, and have some support mechanism that works.I don&#39;t think better/more expensive hardware is the problem. It&#39;s software, caused by lack of users, lack of investment, and too many &#34;competing&#34; distributions of Linux."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While I don&#39;t have any sympathy for this pilot, I also find the FAA&#39;s excuses here to be less than convincing. Basically, their position is &#34;Well, we trusted this Boeing employee to tell us the truth about the new flight controls, and he didn&#39;t.&#34; But if the regulators had actually done their job and independently evaluated the new flight controls, they wouldn&#39;t have had to take the word of any Boeing employees. I realize that that&#39;s the way the FAA does things now, but this whole debacle should be a warning to everyone that that method of regulation is not acceptable. The whole point of independent regulation is to not allow obvious conflicts of interest to harm the public."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Internal Boeing e-mails between various Chief Technical Pilots and other Boeing staff are available at [1]. It shows that there was an overarching requirement for the program to to ensure that 737 pilots could fly the 737 MAX with minimal &#34;Level B&#34; training (e.g. no need for hours of simulator training).Per [2], MCAS was poorly designed and exhibited a failure mode (e.g. AOA sensor failure) that required immediate pilot action to avert disaster. For pilots that were aware of the MCAS failure mode and how to respond, simulation showed they could respond and avert disaster within typically 4 seconds. A delay of 10 seconds from a pilot to respond correctly to the failure event would be catastrophic.A Boeing staffer wrote to the Chief Technical Pilot now indicted[^][1] regarding the pilot action required in those critical few seconds:  &#34;I fear that skill is not very intuitive any more with the younger pilots and those who have become too reliant on automation&#34;

The Chief Technical Pilot now indicted[^] responds:  &#34;This is the path with least risk to Level B. We need to sell this as very intuitive basic pilot skill&#34;.

Boeing it appears then opted for updating Non-Normal Checklists (NNCs) for pilots instead of:* Fixing the MCAS flaw to remove the failure mode altogether* Ensuring pilots were trained to handle an MCAS failure in a simulator* Otherwise ensuring that pilots were aware of the non-intuitive nature of MCAS and the particular failure mode requiring immediate &lt;10sec response from pilotsIf the failure mode with MCAS did occur, pilots didn&#39;t even have 10 seconds to find the NNC and go through the checklist steps before catastrophe was set to occur. They were not aware of MCAS being present on the aircraft and per the Boeing staffer raising the concern, &#34;that skill is not very intuitive&#34; in relation to acting on the failure mode should it have occurred.[1] https://transportation.house.gov/imo/media/doc/Compressed%20...[2] https://www.incose.org/docs/default-source/enchantment/21031...[^] Assumed from job titles in the e-mails, as names are redacted."</p>

My entire marketing strategy is just sharing all my ups and downs, instead of paying for ads.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not a solo founder, but I do a lot of ops professionally. Unless you have a specific reason, I say it’s best to avoid complicated tooling until later.k8s, ci, etc are all really useful and solve a lot of hard problems, but god are they a bitch to set up and then monitor, fix when something weird happens, secure from nasty people outside, patch when some update becomes necessary, resist the urge to “improve”, etc. This doesn’t include the time it takes to work these tools into your project, like k8s for example really requires you grok its model of how stuff it runs is supposed to look. There’s a reason entire companies exist that simply offer managed versions of these services!If you’re using fewer than like 10 boxes and don’t work with many people, you can get away with spooky arcane oldhat sysadmin deploy techniques (scp release to prod hosts, run deploy script, service or cron to keep running) and honestly it’s pretty fun to just run a command and poof you’re deployed. Then you can just wait until it starts making sense to use fancier tooling (more load, more sites/DCs, more services, more people/teams, etc). Monitoring is always good to start with, for other stuff a  good litmus test is that price points for hosted k8s &amp; ops stuff will start to make sense, you’ll be paying in time in any case. Who knows, maybe when that happens something new will pop up that makes even more sense. Until then, reducing the amount of stuff you need to worry about is always a good strategy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots and lots of best practice exists specifically to help teams, and especially teams with some normal amount of turnover.The problems of a solo dev are very different than a dev on a team. Knowledge silos don&#39;t exist. Distributed expertise doesn&#39;t exist. There&#39;s no one to mentor, no shared vision to maintain, no intertia to combat.I consult on big complicated team projects. I also manage multiple solo projects.On solo projects, deployment is a script I run from my dev machine. I&#39;m the only person who deploys; anything else would be solving a problem I don&#39;t have.The only &#34;CI&#34; is running the tests before I run the deployment script. I&#39;m the only one who needs to see the outcome of the tests. Anything more would be solving a problem I don&#39;t have.Architecture is whatever makes the most sense to me personally -- which is often miles away from what I would recommend to a client, who needs something any new hire will recognize and be able to work with.I pay a service to manage backups so I can walk away from a solo project for months and know it&#39;s ticking away.The point is: solve problems you actually have. Don&#39;t try to run a &#34;professional&#34; operation by doing what big teams do all by yourself. Big teams have different problems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have no idea why there&#39;s nothing here saying &#34;don&#39;t&#34;. Go and get a Heroku account, hook it up to your Github repository&#39;s master branch for deploys, use Github Actions for CI, and then get on with life.Yes, you&#39;ll pay more for a Heroku Postgres instance than you would for a VPS on Digital Ocean with Postgres running on it, likewise you&#39;ll pay more for Heroku Dynos than another VPS to run your application server. On the other side though, your backup, rollback, deploy, and scaling strategies can all be &#34;Heroku does that&#34;, and you can focus on the much more valuable job of building a business."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When developing a webapp these days, I use a local proxy.This allows me to type a staging/production URL into Chrome, and get the frontend and the backend from either my local machine or staging/prod. I can mix and match any combination by checking/unchecking a box in Proxyman.This means there is no need to whitelist localhost for CORS, and other hoops. Another advantage is that you&#39;re experiencing the app with SSL, so you may notice bugs that you would miss if you&#39;re used to work with HTTP locally. I&#39;ve had these bugs which &#34;only happen on production&#34; in the past, and it&#39;s a nasty thing to deal with because it will be in a rush, since it happens as a surprise, and impacts users immediately. It can also bypass QA if the QA environment is also using workarounds and not a prod-like setup with SSL and the likes.I recommend giving it a try. It&#39;s a workflow I haven&#39;t seen promoted anywhere before."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can tell you how to lose at CORS in Chrome. If your browser caches a response, and sometime later you mutate the request by adding the &#34;Origin&#34; header it (e.g, add attribute crossorigin=&#34;anonymous&#34; to a &lt;script&gt; tag), Chrome won&#39;t make a new request. What it will do is use the cached response, which is missing the ACAO response header, and thus the browser rejects a file from its own cache via draconian security policy.There are many ways to lose at CORS and this one is my story."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bonus fact: I wanted the &#39;app&#39; (https://jakearchibald.com/2021/cors/playground/) to allow the HTTP method to be set to anything, which meant I needed a server that could accept anything.I usually use NodeJS, but it turns out the HTTP library they use turns the HTTP method into an enum, so only a subset is supported (https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/d798de1c653efa5ec0015d44...). This restriction only exists in their HTTP/1 library, their HTTP/2 library supports any method.Anyway, I couldn&#39;t use that, so I used Deno via Deno Deploy. Their HTTP library supports any method, and the APIs they use are very similar to web APIs, so it was really easy to get started. Here&#39;s the server code: https://github.com/jakearchibald/cors-playground/blob/main/i...."</p>

While browsing our plan options, I noticed the url used a scheme like marketplace.org/employers/341/plans.aspx. Of course, I tried changing the number in the url to 342 to see what happened. To my astonishment, it loaded up the next company&#39;s plans, including a list of employee names, ages, plan cost, and SSNs.After I shopped a few other companies to see how our plans compared, I notified the marketplace operator via the only link on the website for customer service. Within about an hour, someone from their IT department rang me on the phone and started grilling me about how many other plans I browsed, and insisted that I clear my cache and browsing history, and notified me that they would be watching to make sure nobody at our IP address didn&#39;t access any other plans while the issue was being fixed.I was pretty surprised at his response, and assumed they would be more grateful for exposing a pretty basic flaw, but I guess a natural human tendency in these situations is to try to externalize the blame.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Often overlooked things when discussing esbuild here:1. It&#39;s not just a faster replacement for a single %tool_name% in your build chain: for the vast majority of cases, it&#39;s the whole &#34;chain&#34; in a single cli command if you&#39;re doing it right.That is, you don&#39;t just stick it inside, say, webpack as a faster replacement for babel (although you can). No, you look carefully through your webpack configs and its myriad of plugins, ask yourself whether you really need to inline css in jsx in png while simultaneously optimizing it for IE 4.0, realize you don&#39;t, through out the whole thing, and use esbuild instead.I have two 50K+ LOC projects using esbuild, and I would use it even if it was slower than webpack/babel/tsc simply not to worry about the build chain breaking due to an update to some obscure dependency or plugin.2. It is fast because it&#39;s written from scratch to do a set of particular things and do it fast, not just because it&#39;s Go and parallelized.If you look at the commit log you will notice a lot of performance tweaks. If you look into the issues, you will find a lot of requests for additional features rejected, often due to possible negative performance impact.3. The most impressive part about esbuild development is not just that it&#39;s one guy writing it: it is the level of support and documentation he manages to provide alongside.The release notes alone are a good course into nitty-gritty details of the web ecosystem: all the addressed edge cases are explained in detail. To top it all off--all opened issues, no matter how uninformed they seem, find a courteous response."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Work on esbuild started at the start of 2020. It is primarily authored and maintained by Evan Wallace, who, in addition to making this tremendous contribution to the JavaScript ecosystem, is the CTO and co-founder of Figma. Incredible output."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bun [1] is a JS bundler based on esbuild’s source, but written in Zig. And it is about 3x faster than esbuild. I think its author Jarred is on HN as well.Probably worth a submission on its own but I am just waiting till it is fully open source.Edit: ( Deleted those Stats, since it may not be a fair comparison and it was probably not meant to be a fair benchmark in the first place. The details are still in the linked tweets. I do not know the author or am I in anyway affiliate with Bun. )I am also wondering how much of those optimisation could be used on ESbuild. Since Rails 7 and Phoenix 1.6 will be using esbuild and not Webpack.[1] https://twitter.com/jarredsumner/status/1390084458724741121"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Syncthing works brilliantly! The web UI is excellent, warns you when you&#39;re about to do something ill-advised, and stuff like QR codes makes adding clients and folders fairly easy. The separation between folders and devices is handled well. You can easily have half a dozen shared folders between several computers with any mix-and-match combination including which one is &#39;authoritative&#39; and so on.I used to use it on Android to keep my &#39;camera roll&#39; synced to my desktop. I preferred setting the ignore file to exclude android&#39;s thumbnails directory, but otherwise it worked great. I&#39;d take a photo with my phone and almost before I could open the shortcut on the desktop, boom, the photo was there, since the android client detects changes in the filesystem.I also used it to sync my password database, and a cross-platform notebook app&#39;s database. Worked flawlessly for all of them.Ditto for a folder shared between my MacOS laptop and Windows desktop.Lots of controls, especially in the forked android client. Don&#39;t want the sync client to run on any network other than your home network? Done. Don&#39;t want your syncthing clients to try and do NAT transversal / discovery outside whatever network it&#39;s on? No problem.The biggest bummer is that there&#39;s no iOS client. Had to switch to Nextcloud, which so far has been working OK, but the number of people that have problems with the iOS client is quite high (problems such as syncs being so slow it takes days to sync a camera roll), and it&#39;s generally sluggish and doesn&#39;t work in the background (yes, I know, Apple&#39;s fault.) However, Nextcloud does allow me to sync contacts and calendars (I think. I haven&#39;t tried to set it up yet.)One warning: Sycnthing really does not like it when you delete the dotfile folder inside the shared folder(s). Don&#39;t do that :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have switched from Nextcloud to Syncthing. The former was a resource hog that was eating up too much everything on my modest VPS.I share the files on my local network at home between phone, laptop and desktop. My only issues so far:- I need to manually start Syncthing on the devices, whereas Nextcloud was always running on boot. Not sure if I should start it every time, especially on the Android phone which cannot sync while away from home. I do not want to empty the battery while outside of my LAN, + the persistent notification &#34;Syncthing is running&#34; is annoying.- I need to power up at least the laptop or desktop to backup my phone data. One solution that I will try is to install a headless Syncthing instance on my NAS. This way the phone can always sync to the NAS every time, and then laptop/desktop can sync from NAS when needed.The joys of peer2peer! At least, I am sure that my moderately sensitive files are not leaving my local network to be stored on my VPS, which can be hacked someday.I also need to figure out how to install Wireguard on my router to allow to access my NAS from my phone while on a trip, but that&#39;s another story."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been wanting to use PCVR for a long time, especially for virtual desktop scenarios, not even just for gaming.  But the reality is I will never buy anything that puts money in Facebook&#39;s pocket.  End of story.  I really appreciate the work the developer did on this, but philosophically I see things like this that attempt to break the walled garden as a net-benefit to a bad actor (Facebook) rather than a net-benefit to consumers and users.  It&#39;s actually better for the world and better for users if they have to make a hard choice about the ethics of their purchases, rather than feeling like they have an &#34;out&#34;.  So I commend the work, but Oculus is a no-go for anyone who gives any care at all about ethics for SO MANY reasons, Facebook owning it just being the largest (read the origin story for more)."</p>

We were deploying database changes to facilitate the new product.  This was a long time ago, and the organization still deployed things by hand, so there was no tooling for us to automate the deployment.  Part of the deployment process involved pasting some SQL to create the tables and populate the initial data into a JIRA ticket for an administrator to run in production.Said administrator was a fan of the cloud-to-butt plugin, and dutifully copied and pasted the SQL that they saw, like we instructed.  When our code failed, an inspection of the production database revealed the culprit.  Fortunately, &#39;cloud&#39; and &#39;butt&#39; are close to each other, alphabetically, so we didn&#39;t need to search very long.We never let that admin live that down."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice article! I used similar techniques to find solutions for a game called “DStar”… including the choice to write the solver in Rust. You can play the game and see the optimal solutions on the web (not tested on mobile):https://www.moria.us/games/dstar/playA state in this game is:  enum Active {
    Ball,
    Block,
  }

  struct State {
    coins: u32,     // bitmask of which coins remain
    active: Active, // which player is active
    ball: Point,    // location of ball
    block: Point,   // location of block
  }

I thought about writing an A* solver for this, but a simple BFS found all the solutions quickly enough. With a single-threaded solver, each level could be solved in 40s or less. The longest solutions are around 100 moves long, and the entire set of 25 levels is solved with 2.5 minutes of CPU time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Generally I&#39;d say product reviews are one of those ideas like passwords that work but don&#39;t survive introduction to the general public and mass use. The problems of authenticity are obvious, but I&#39;ve also noticed that people who rely on word of mouth from their friends and colleagues are generally happier. And why wouldn&#39;t they be? A colleague tells you this e.g. monitor is perfect for your line of work so you get it and find it also good. No fuss, nothing nerve wracking, no time wasted. Compared with reading through dozens of reviews that even when authentic raise good points that are maybe entirely irrelevant to you.I try to buy stuff in shops now. It&#39;s more expensive only if my time spent on reading reviews is free. And these days it&#39;s not even more expensive to buy in real shops anyway."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a small side project (a Google Docs plugin) that makes a trickle of money. One of my competitors launched one day and somehow they had 10 5-star reviews already, but the gSuite marketplace said they had only 3 users. One of those users had the same name as the author, but wrote their review as if they&#39;d just stumbled upon it that day. Another literally had the name &#34;Fiverr User&#34; on their Google account next to their review.I think this has become so common that many people assume it&#39;s a necessity of doing business. Maybe it is. Since I don&#39;t depend on my project to survive, I choose not to do these things, or even to give discounts to incentivize reviews. Many platforms don&#39;t care at all, and don&#39;t even try to combat fake reviews.EDIT: Another thing worth mentioning: the natural review rate for these plugins is really low. Maybe half a percent of users leave any kind of review, at least in my experience."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In Germany Amazon pressured third-party sellers to use their fulfillment/warehousing service, which would reveal to them where those sellers source their goods from. They then just went to those sources and offered them a better deal, cutting out the third-party seller. So basically third-party sellers are doing free market research for Amazon: They take on the entrepreneurial risk and if they&#39;re successful Amazon will know exactly how many goods they sell to which customers and from who they get those goods. They can then use that information in their own product strategy and simply take over the business of their most profitable sellers. Really clever strategy IMHO, albeit not very fair."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The grocery stores I visit do the same in the Netherlands, maybe even worse, especially the biggest one here, Albert Hein (Ahold), is very skilled at it. They copy the most popular products, sell them slightly cheaper, similar designs as the most popular brand, then go on and display their products at eye height and move the big brands down. Yet every court case against them they&#39;ve won. And the sentiment is far less negative about them than Amazon. They have a similar significant market share (35% of grocery market) as Amazon here. Maybe in the end, it&#39;s slightly more ethical since their strategy is mostly at the cost of the big corporates (Unilever) who can handle and fight them and not the smaller companies; and arguably, the consumer wins in the end."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is this shocking to anyone? I don&#39;t mean to sound cynical but I thought we already knew this. It is fairly obvious if you search anything and the first product is a Amazon Basic product that they are toying with the results. There is no way a Amazon Basic product is the #1 in every category there is one. Just search &#34;batteries&#34; in Amazon Canada, Duracell has 30k reviews and 5/5, the only reason it is &#34;above&#34; Amazon Basic is because they pay (sponsored). A regular search shows two Amazon Basic listings (AA and AAA) both have less rating (4.8/5 versus 5/5) and reviews then the Duracell equivalents. Quiet clearly rigged."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"APT&#39;s progress bar does have issues though. When you shrink the terminal when the progress bar is visible, you&#39;re going to have gibberish in the terminal. That&#39;s because the terminal commands to move the cursor by lines work on visual lines, not semantic lines, so they aren&#39;t invariant under the operation of resizing the terminal window. That&#39;s a really rough area of Linux terminals: when you resize a window, the terminal is going to rewrap the lines according to semantic lines (based on line feed characters), so it&#39;s clear that all major terminals understand this distinction, but the terminal API doesn&#39;t give applications access to moving by semantic lines, so we&#39;re left with bugs like these.I think PowerShell has the concept of progress reporting specially recognized? That sounds like a good idea. It could be used to render a GUI progress bar and leave the pipeline alone, for the objects. That&#39;s just my vague idea, since I didn&#39;t spend much time with PowerShell."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s good to know the underlying low-level terminal commands that make this work like this article explains. But I guess most people will use a terminal abstraction library that has a higher level API to move the cursor, clean the screen etc.Terminals are complex beasts and they can do powerful things. If you&#39;re interested in this, I can recommend reading the source code for Tmux, JLine3 and some other libraries shell formatting or TUI libraries."</p>

They are still there during daylight but we are less likely to see them.  After noon we are moving onto the &#34;lee&#34; side, the back side of the planet that gets less meteors.  This one hit just before midnight, right at that line between front and back sides."</p>

But, y’know what ol’ Billy Ma’s performance marketers couldn’t then do: prove their value to their bosses.&gt; [picture of that search term and williams sonoma ads with shopping links]The main problem here is that if Williams Sonoma was not advertising on that search term, Lodge and Food52 etc etc would, and then those companies would be above the Williams Sonoma organic placements.The spend is necessary in a defensive way because Google creates a bidding war even for the hyper relevant.edit: I just checked and if you search &#34;williams sonoma skillet&#34;, if WS was not paying for [green] then the very first &#34;result&#34; (ad) would be Food52 [red] https://imgur.com/a/9Nnxs6hI just tried &#34;airbnb paris&#34; and the first result is, somewhat predictably, an ad that is not airbnb. But the second one is also an ad, this time from airbnb. So they clearly didn&#39;t keep their spend dialed down to zero, and are aware of the need to advertise on their own keyword."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are so many holes in these arguments that you could drive a truck through it. Which is so infuriating, because a big part of my professional career consisted of watching all of Rand&#39;s SEO videos and really appreciating them. I really thought he was a genius. But then over the past few years, he started sharing more general views on entrepreneurship, and those takeaways just didn&#39;t really make much sense. Basically, his own VC-funded company turned into a shit show and suddenly he started advocating against VC in general (as opposed to taking an honest look at the mistakes that his company made). So in the past few years, I tried to reconcile in my head: how can a genius make such imperfect conclusions? My initial takeaway was that he&#39;s blinded by his own mistakes and shifting the blame, which seems perfectly reasonable and understandable. Frankly, I would probably feel and act the same way.But after reading this article, it finally dawned on me. He makes imperfect conclusions in everything he touches, it&#39;s just that in some fields those conclusions can be more easily proved to be wrong than in others. SEO is the perfect field where a polished presenter can get away with imperfect conclusions for years - trust me, I know, I made a living for years in this field, and I am very familiar with the nature of this work. Most of the time, you have no idea what the black box really does, and instead you&#39;re just trying to guess what might have happened. Most importantly, there are many ways to skin a cat in SEO, and just because your approach is net positive doesn&#39;t mean that you truly are delivering the global maximum (or that the net positive gain was ROI positive). In short, it&#39;s impossible to know who&#39;s right and who&#39;s wrong, and Rand&#39;s videos convinced me that he&#39;s right, but I am no longer sure. I just rewatched one of them, and can easily see how his conclusions are just... opinions.While we may or may never find out if his SEO opinions were the global maximum, we can quantifiably demonstrate that his opinions on content marketing are not solid. This whole essay he wrote can be replaced with &#34;hey performance marketers, don&#39;t trust the platform numbers and instead do your incrementality studies.&#34; Platforms like Facebook will give you those for free if you reach a certain spend level, and you can also get them from 3rd party providers like measured.com. In other words, if you&#39;re a performance marketer and you&#39;re not conducting incrementality studies, then you&#39;re very early in your career and are not following the best practices. Simple as that - no need to extrapolate from there and reach all sorts of additional conclusions (which is obviously a pattern in Rand&#39;s behavior) - calling into question a perfectly investable marketing channel, conflating the needs of a public company with everyone else&#39;s needs, using words like scam, etc.I am really disappointed to have to write this, but you would have been better off not reading this article. If Rand is really advocating that the majority of entrepreneurs should follow his advice and focus on PR instead of performance marketing, then perhaps an honest thing to ask would be - how is that working out for his own company? AFAIK, SparkToro is nowhere close to replicating the growth of his previous company, which is honestly disappointing for someone with such a huge reach and name recognition."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was at one company several years ago and made two big changes to digital advertising:#1 - Eliminated all paid search other than some limited branded search terms and shifted all the money to affiliates who were way better at making profits on the keywords we were competing on#2 - Eliminated all display advertising after running numerous experiments showing it provided almost not incremental conversions, even though the platforms happily took credit for them.Those two things drove our blended CAC down substantially and by building better affiliate relationships, sales actually increased.The lesson here is that you need to try a lot of things out and you should be continuously questioning what you&#39;re doing and running specific experiments to gut check effectiveness of any ad platform that is slapping cookies on wide groups of users and claiming conversions.My suspicion is that this is near impossible at any large organization, even one as new as Airbnb. I can just imagine someone walking into a team of 20+ performance marketers and suggesting they need to experiment to determine if any of it is remotely effective. COVID forced them into this but it&#39;s something that they should have already been doing.I also suspect that the top line focus/obsession of most VC-backed companies make this type of exercise seem almost counterintuitive. Don&#39;t mess with or question the momentum."</p>

The capstone project was implementing from scratch a multi-pipeline RISC CPU (including the ALU and a very basic L1 cache) in Verilog that we flashed to FPGAs that we then programmed to play checkers using hand-compiled C. The FPGA was easier to flash and debug than the Spartan-6 mentioned in TFA but was significantly more expensive as well.It was a brutal class, but it totally demystified computers and the whole industry in a way that made me feel like I really could understand the &#34;whole&#34; stack.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The best cold starts are those which aren&#39;t noticed by the user. For my blog search (which runs on Lambda), I found a nice way of achieving that [1]: as soon as a user puts the focus to the input field for the search text, this will already submit a &#34;ping&#34; request to Lambda. Then, when they submit the actual query itself, they will hit the already running Lambda most of the times.And, as others said, assigning more RAM to your Lambda than it actually may need itself, will also help with cold start times, as this increases the assigned CPU shares, too.[1] https://www.morling.dev/blog/how-i-built-a-serverless-search..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My experience with cold starts in Azure Functions Serverless is pretty awful. Like most other Azure services, their affordable consumer grade offerings are designed from the ground up not to be good enough for &#34;serious&#34; use.Cold start times compared to Lambda are worse, and in addition, we would get random 404s which do not appear in any logs; inspecting these 404s indicated they were emitted by nginx, leading me to believe that the ultimate container endpoint was killed for whatever reason but that fact didn&#39;t make it back to the router, which attempted and failed to reach the function.Of course the cold start and 404 are mitigated if you pay for the premium serverless or just host their middleware on their own App Service plans (basically VMs)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At my last job we built an entire API on top of serverless. One of the things we had to figure out was this cold start time. If a user were to hit an endpoint for the first time, it would take 2x as long as it normally would at first. To combat this we wrote a &#34;runWarm&#34; function that kept the API alive at all times.Sure kind of defeats the purpose of serverless but hey, enterprise software."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Working in IT/tech for school district is the worst. My experience from many years ago - around 2002, I think:1. First day on the job, email to boss: &#34;Hey, the computer lab at Springfield High has a ton of known security flaws that are begging to be exploited.&#34;2. Reply, 1 week later: &#34;Sorry, we don&#39;t have any money for that. Just keep everything up-and-running.&#34;3. 3 weeks later the computer lab at Springfield High got &#34;hacked&#34;. All the computers displayed a popup window that said, &#34;Miss Krabappel is a dyke!&#34; (sorry for the offensive language)4. Next day, email from boss: &#34;The computer lab at Springfield High was hacked! Figure out how to fix this and make sure it doesn&#39;t happen again!&#34;5. A few days later Miss Krabappel filed to sue the school district. The local newspaper picked up the story.6. Email from boss, in full panic mode: &#34;I need you to figure out who hacked the computer lab at Springfield High so we can report him to the police!&#34;7. A week later an independent consulting firm was brought in to help identify the person behind the &#34;hack&#34;. I heard they were paid $50K and found nothing. However, the kid got ratted out when he told all his friends. (It wasn&#39;t Bart Simpson! ;) )8. Several weeks later: meeting to discuss working with a consulting firm that&#39;s gonna fix all the security issues because the current staff (me and my team) lacks the skills.9. About 6 months later, I quit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds of me my school leaving prank. I rewrote the whole internet on my school&#39;s computers. Google&#39;s logo became &#34;Leavers &#39;08&#34;, Facebook became &#34;Hatebook&#34; and was red, YouTube only played videos of cats, amongst other things.These were the days when nothing had SSL, so you could just intercept and rewrite traffic!My only requirement was: do no actual damageIt was implemented as a Debian live CD that you could drop into any school computer. It would boot up, then Ettercap would MITM the whole network by spoofing the router. It routed all HTTP traffic via Squid and a custom ICAP server that did the actual rewriting. If you removed the live CDs, the network just went back to normal within a couple of minutes.Routing the whole school&#39;s network through one old Pentium machine wouldn&#39;t work though, so I figured out a way of doing distributed load balancing: it would do the ARP spoofing slowly and randomly. So, as you added more machines, it would just magically balance between them.It worked great for about an hour then whole network mysteriously stopped working for the rest of the day. I left all the live CDs in the computers as a calling card.Sorry, school network admins."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Three things are remarkable about this, and make it a happy story.First, that the pranksters were so egregiously responsible in the way they went about it. They avoided disrupting any actual educational activities; it was meant to be harmless fun, not vandalism. No harm came to anything here.Second, that they documented their findings to the administration as part of the action, including recommendations for improvements.Third, the administration took this as exactly that: a harmless prank by smart, ethical kids who ALSO did them a favor by pointing out the vulnerabilities. If the admin had a panicked fit about this, they could have made it an ugly situation.My educational experience was populated far more by &#34;freak out and yell&#34; types than this school district, which was a shame."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28835690">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Dropping by to express healthy interest in this project.Rancher have a pretty good track record so far:  - the Rancher platform itself (https://rancher.com/) is a really powerful and user friendly way to manage container clusters of all sorts, giving you a self-hosted dashboard for both your cloud and on prem clusters, for a variety of Kubernetes distributions; you can even manage the available drivers and also create deployments graphically
  - the K3s distribution (https://k3s.io/) is in my eyes one of the best ways to run Kubernetes yourself, both in development environments and production ones. I benchmarked K3s alongside Docker Swarm as a part of my Master&#39;s thesis and it was surprising to see that its overhead was actually very close to that of Docker Swarm (a more lightweight orchestrator that&#39;s included with Docker and uses the Docker Compose format), only exceeding it by a few hundred MB with similar deployments being active, making K3s passable for small nodes

As for this particular project, it&#39;s very positive to see that it supports all of the big OSes, even though the 0.6.0 version tag would still advise caution for a while, even though it can definitely be considered as a replacement for Docker Desktop.Admittedly, it&#39;s also nice to see that Docker and the ecosystem around it is still supported and is alive and kicking, since for many projects out there it&#39;s a perfectly serviceable stack with tools that a lot of people will be familiar with, as opposed to having to migrate to podman, while it&#39;s still becoming more and more stable, yet isn&#39;t quite there yet. Now, that may be a controversial take, and Docker Inc also have their fair share of challenges, about which there was a very nice writeup here: https://www.infoworld.com/article/3632142/how-docker-broke-i..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let me say it; I love to see it. There&#39;s just something that strikes me as harmfully greedy about the idea of &#34;Docker, a gajillion dollar company.&#34;  There&#39;s just no way that THAT kind of service could be tweaked to return that much to stakeholders without seriously screwing up the experience for people who need it to just work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was amazed by the news at first, but seeing it again, it doesn&#39;t seem to be a direct replacement of Docker Desktop. It makes use of K3s under the hood, which is lighter than a full-blown Kubernetes, but still quite heavy. My nearly empty K3s cluster is consistently consuming ~10% CPU time on my local machine. This is not acceptable to me, so a proper replacement of Docker Desktop should be more lightweight."</p>

I spent a few years as CTO of a company providing heat-to-electricity plants. We financed and built them off high-heat plants like natural gas turbines. The &#34;fuel&#34; was heat going up the stack - so it was essentially free. We still couldn&#39;t compete with conventional electricity plants, even with a $30/tonne price on carbon in Canada.Geothermal energy is the same: sustainable, long-life electricity with no &#34;fuel&#34; costs, but it costs 2-3x as much to build a geothermal plant (in most areas, depends on geology) as e.g. a natural gas turbine powered plant, so the overall cost of electricity is much higher and you can&#39;t get financing.How is fusion different? The fuel will be free and unlimited, but the &#34;levelized cost of electricity&#34;, dominated by the capital cost of the plant, will still be much higher than other sources of electricity. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a world -- even one where the onerous regulations go away and a  market price on carbon is available -- where the LCOE of fusion power is less than that from natural gas, or even close."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Fusion ignition is the point at which a nuclear fusion reaction becomes self-sustaining. This occurs when the energy being given off by the fusion reactions heats the fuel mass more rapidly than various loss mechanisms cool it.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_ignition"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article is discussing the media and government being intentionally vague or even misinformative because they don&#39;t trust the public, but it backfires and causes more distrust. The flip side that wasn&#39;t discussed is the belittling and censoring of voices that were skeptical of the narratives, which engendered even more distrust. Their strategy of information control backfired, and they doubled down. Now we&#39;ve got a huge swath of US citizens that will never take the vaccine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How about the biggest dishonesty - lack of admission that not everyone is at the same risk and that lockdowns have significant irreversible costs for low risk individuals and for society? Young children are not getting critical development years back. Healthy 20 somethings only have limited time to date, party and have fun before being saddled with adult responsibilities forever. Most of shattered local businesses are not coming back. While pandemic was not the only reason for BLM and Jan 6 riots, all the young men not being kept busy and receiving stimulus checks to support unproductive activities was certainly a contributing factor - and the fallout permanently damaged trust we have in each other. What of all the deaths of despair - suicides and drug overdoses? Mixed cancer diagnoses because people were scared to go to see doctor? Plummeting birth rates?All of this adds up to the fact that optimum precautions for an obese 70 year old guy is not a same as for a healthy 19 year old woman, and individuals should have a role in deciding what&#39;s right for them. While vast majority should take a vaccine, there may be a small group for whom it&#39;s a reasonable choice to hold off. Say you are a 19 year old healthy make and your risk from serious vaccine side effects is largest while your risk from COVID-19 is smallest. Plus, you already recovered from COVID during the time Delta variant was common. Are you really bonkers for making a decision either way?Above all, society must not sacrifice its young for those of us who had a chance to live for quite a bit already."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author is completely right in that the government at least in the US attempting to downplay, mislead or &#39;avoid panic&#39; absolutely destroyed any credibility and is still suffering from it. Most people are not stupid, if provided with all available information as well as clear statements regarding the reliability of that information and just a clear message saying &#34;hey this is new and we have no idea, we are making our best guess&#34; people will make decent choices. Unfortunately the US decided to torpedo its credibility, and all sides decided to turn it into a political issue which a pandemic should very much not be. All politics all the time and the US is now crippling itself. In the absence of real honest leadership people turned to the loudest voices of the media. Once the people distrust the government and think they are lying its very hard to appeal to their logic again. I am very much not a fan of Bush II but he did it right after 9/11. What he did after though is a topic for another day."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A distinction needs to be made clear here with regards to the data being transmitted to Google by LineageOS in this study.In the cited paper (https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Doug.Leith/Android_privacy_report.pd...), the device used to test LineageOS was a Google Pixel 2 running LineageOS 17.1 which also included an installation of OpenGapps 10.0 nano.It&#39;s not the OS that is transmitting the data over to Google, but rather OpenGapps (ie. Google Play). OpenGapps is software that can be optionally installed after the initial installation of LineageOS (but before first boot). A user can still use LineageOS without OpenGapps, though they just won&#39;t have the benefits (and drawbacks) that come with it (such as being able to use apps that require GSF). The user can instead opt for an app manager like F-droid or possibly Aurora Store.In addition, there exists an alternative to OpenGapps called MicroG. This is like Google Play but allows users the option to anonymize themselves. One can find custom LineageOS builds that include MicroG from the MicroG website (as the members of the LineageOS project do not advocate for its use, instead giving preference to OpenGapps). Keep in mind, however, that there are fewer devices supported by those builds."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use GraphineOS and LineageOS without Google Play Services. They are great and are suitable replacements for Apple and Google.- Osmand(FOSS) for maps (supports being fully offline!)- Signal and Discord for messaging (Discord is sandboxed)- Newpipe(FOSS) for Youtube- F-droid(FOSS) for my FOSS appstore- APKmirror for the few non-free apps I need- Libretorrent(FOSS) and VLC(FOSS) for watching movies- Firefox(FOSS) and Vanadium(FOSS) for browser- K9 Mail(FOSS) for email- Infinity(FOSS) for Reddit- Secur(FOSS) for 2FA- Taskkeeper(FOSS) for remindersAlmost everything you need is in the F-droid FOSS app repository. It all works, and it works well. You can buy a used Pixel 3a for around $80 on Ebay and have a better experience in every category than iOS, hardware and software.The only limitation is push notifications, which isn&#39;t a problem because FOSS apps like Signal bundle their own notification system that does not use Google Play Services. Discord however, does not get push notifications (which I wouldn&#39;t want anyway)"</p>

Edus sure as heck won&#39;t -who does that leave, a couple of hackers?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can understand if a product has limitations, or odd edge cases, but Microsoft MFA is purposefully designed to be user-hostile.Some examples that came up recently in &#34;not corner case&#34; scenarios:1) For tenant-to-tenant guest access, each user must re-register MFA for each tenant they&#39;ve been invited to. So if you already have the Authenticator app installed and configured, it doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;ll prompt you to create a new entry each time. I have dozens already and clocking up.2) When logging in to Azure, Microsoft has purposefully added &#34;dark patterns&#34; to hide options related to other, non-Microsoft-Authenticator technologies. They&#39;re available, but they&#39;re always tiny, tiny links squirrelled away so that you&#39;re inexorably lead towards using the Authenticator app. Someone at Redmond really wanted their KPIs met at Yubikey&#39;s expense.3) If you get a new iPhone, unlike everything else on the phone, the Authenticator app will not transfer your MFA registrations. Apple IOS will securely transfer your accounts, passwords, etc... but Authenticator is special. You need to first configure a consumer account(!) to back up your enterprise MFA settings, and then restore them manually. At which point... none of them will work, and you get partial instructions that you can&#39;t follow. If you&#39;ve wiped your old phone (e.g.: trade-in or repair), you are now locked out.All of the above were designed, architected, and developed on purpose. None of these are oversights, bugs, or missing features."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everything about Microsoft cloud and its ecosystem is broken. I recently signed up for onedrive (microsoft business basic, actually), and I didn&#39;t even know which domain to navigate to. They have a gazillion different URLs, and each of them is different from the other. Here&#39;s a (partial!) list:azure.com onedrive.live.com admin.microsoft.com microsoftonline.com office.com office365.com onedrive.com onmicrosoft.com sharepoint.com windowsazure.comEach one of those portals take you to SOME view of your account with a gazillion settings. Many of them are repeated, and changing it on one portal doesn&#39;t necessarily reflect in others. For example, I enabled 2FA somewhere (and it worked), but going to admin.microsoft.com showed 2FA disabled.Even payments, which every other website seems to have figured out, is broken. There was a recent change in regulations in India for subscriptions on credit cards that allow the customer to control the period of subscription, enabling/disabling, etc. Microsoft of course, hasn&#39;t implemented the changes (despite the regulations being notified in August 2019), and because of that, transactions are being declined.So can I go and make that payment online? Well, no. Your subscription shows up as &#34;expired&#34; because it couldn&#39;t charge your account, and the only option it gives is for you to &#34;reactivate&#34; the account. Great, so I&#39;ll just reactivate. But no, it doesn&#39;t allow you to pay when you reactivate - it&#39;s going to try and charge your credit card again, itself, as a subscription, sometime. And of course, that&#39;s going to fail again. Loop!Addendum:So somehow, with the help of Microsoft support, I manage to sign-up for another subscription with the same licenses for the same cost, and they disable the old one. Great. So this time, it tries to charge my card, fails, but then allows me to &#34;settle&#34; the &#34;overdue&#34; amount manually. I do that, and my account is &#34;active&#34; again!Do they send me a mail saying they&#39;ve received the amount? Nope. Does my Microsoft account billing page show that I&#39;ve made any payment to Microsoft? Nope. The only indication that I&#39;ve made a payment is that my account is active with an expiration date in the future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So this freaked me out! A week ago I went passwordless with my Microsoft account; which required setting up Microsoft Authenticator. While I was there, I re-evaluated my entire MFA setup:* I had already setup Authy OTP codes, which I was actively using. So I left that alone.* I had already setup an external email. So I left that alone.* I setup Microsoft Authenticator for the first time.* I added a pair of FIDO U2F YubiKeys.* I generated and backed up an account recovery code.* I REMOVED my cell phone number because SMS is not secure.* I did NOT look at my aliases because I wasn&#39;t aware that was even a thing. It&#39;s not part of the Security Dashboard.Here&#39;s what worked: I&#39;ve been able to sign in with Microsoft Authenticator on my phone, the YubiKeys on supported browsers, and receive codes at my external email if neither of aforementioned devices are available. I have noticed that, even though the Authy OTP code is still listed on my Security Dashboard, I can&#39;t trigger a prompt for that code. This isn&#39;t a huge deal, since both Authy and Microsoft Authenticator are on my phone.In reaction to your post, I went and checked out my aliases. My phone number was NOT in there. The only alias I have is my primary Microsoft email. I don&#39;t know if my phone number ever was in there. Perhaps it was, and when I deleted my number from the Security Dashboard it also deleted from the aliases? I don&#39;t know. I do know that there is no phone number listed under my Account Info or Security Dashboard.Thanks for this post. It reminds me just how vested we are on certain accounts; accounts that can disappear in an instant. I hope you get your issues resolved!"</p>

After each lesson, you could do these exercises where you were dropped into a fake shell, replete with fake directories and that, and had to get things into a certain expected state. They were typical business-related tasks, nothing cool and dungeon-y, but I learned my basic Unix commands that way.
