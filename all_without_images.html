								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Inequality by itself is not a bad thing. Let&#39;s start from there. If 90% of the population had a (sustainable) lifestyle of current dollar millionaires, and the remaining 10% had a (sustainable) lifestyle of dollar billionaires, there would be lots of inequality, but it wouldn&#39;t be problematic.Inequality is only bad if you&#39;re in a zero-sum game. The rich do have the power to extract rents and &#34;rig the system&#34; to cement their wealth and power. Those are things Graham is clearly against. But an entrepreneur who gets rich by reducing waste and improving productivity by harnessing technology deserves our praise. They&#39;re not causing the &#34;poor to get poorer&#34;.And comparing the wealth distribution of today to that of 1980 is pretty silly. We&#39;re in a global economy now, so if you want to be fair, you need to look at it from a global perspective. Almost all Americans are going to fall in the top 10% of earners globally. And global poverty has collapsed since 1980. Yes, you no longer get a comfy middle class life just by virtue of being born in the US (regardless of skills) anymore. I personally don&#39;t believe that an unskilled worker in the US deserves to be paid 10X what an equivalent worker in Bangladesh makes just because they were lucky enough to be born here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m just gonna quote what I think is a very important part from the Graham piece itself&gt;&#34;People who don&#39;t look any deeper than the Gini coefficient look back on the world of 1982 as the good old days, because those who got rich then didn&#39;t get as rich. But if you dig into how they got rich, the old days don&#39;t look so good. In 1982, 84% of the richest 100 people got rich by inheritance, extracting natural resources, or doing real estate deals. Is that really better than a world in which the richest people get rich by starting tech companies?&#34;And my answer to that question would be, arguably yes. Why? Because at least old money understands the concept of noblesse oblige. The real sinister psychological thing going on behind the Graham argument is that it&#39;s not at all about meritocracy, it&#39;s that this mentality of earned wealth completely rids the owner of any sort of responsibility.The aristocrats and oligarchs of the olden days might have been corrupt, debauched and half-useless, but at least they knew it. This new, self-made entrepreneur class does not only think they have earned their money themselves, which as a sidenote is also kind of a fiction, but that they&#39;re intellectually superior, morally superior and virtuous in ways that anyone else just can&#39;t understand.Old money might have ignored you and thrown a party, but Silicon Valley money wants to remake people in their images, they have a Protestant zealotry associated with their money that makes any oligarch look straight up sympathetic in comparison.C.S Lewis:&#34;“Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron&#39;s cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be &#34;cured&#34; against one&#39;s will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of people who are just as smart and motived as Elon Musk or Steve Jobs will never be able to start their own companies and get rich.Because they have family obligations that take priority.Because they live outside high-income countries.Because they have no access to support network, so when they fail, they fall all the way to bottom.Because they may have made a crippling mistake in their pasts that now prevents them from reaching their full potential.And so on and on. While I would still recommend everyone to pursue the dreams over never trying to do so - being poor is the single most powerful force that prevents people from doing that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I got hit with this a few years back. I signed up for Ps CC for a month (I thought) to create an anniversary gift for my wife. I used it ONCE. Tried to cancel and they told me I had in fact signed up for a year, and that if I didn&#39;t cancel now, they&#39;d give me two months free.I didn&#39;t want it at all! Anyway, I sucked it up, got on with the remainder of the year, because they wouldn&#39;t let me put the cancellation in early, had to do it X months before the end. Then life happened and I missed the deadline to cancel and got suckered for a second year!Fuck Adobe and this practice is all I have to say, I stick strictly to Open Source options now. It may have been my fault for not reading the first time, but robbing me a second time by counting on me missing the cancellation because they wouldn&#39;t let me do it there and then is just scummy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is this really a cancellation fee or is it just honoring your contract? AFAIK it&#39;s very clear on Adobe&#39;s page that your options are (1) Annual plan paid monthly, (2) Annual plan prepaid, and depending on the product (3) Monthly plan at usually 150% higher price.https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/plans.htmlIf you signed up for a yearly plan paid monthly, the cancellation fee is finishing your contract.If you didn&#39;t want to agree to pay by the year maybe you shouldn&#39;t have signed up for a year of service?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had the same, they wanted me to pay the rest of the year (after 2 or 3 years?). Problem is, that is against Dutch law, after an initial year, one is only allowed to prolong a contract by 1 month at a time. I reminded the person on the phone (who only spoke English, so imagine what happens when you are not as fluent in it as I) that they broke Dutch law, I told that to 3 other persons and they finally told me: Ok, we&#39;ll cancel. Finally.Edit: I had to call them, because the website indeed only showed me these options where I had to pay the rest of the year. Email didn&#39;t help, they offered me some discount for the rest of the year. Very strange as a Dutch person, it has become so normal to not worry about this (I really like this law, a nice example of citizens before companies.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Apple has just engineered the worst possible situation for themselves by being the only way to get apps on the store and by simultaneously incessantly marketing the store as &#34;Safe and Secure&#34;. The former encourages them to maximize the number of apps on the store, while the latter encourages them to shoot first and ask questions later.If side-loading or alternative ways of getting apps onto the iPhone existed, then they could implement far stricter controls knowing that, worst case scenario, you can still get an app onto the iPhone. This is how it works on the Mac. Tor isn&#39;t on the Mac App Store, but that of course doesn&#39;t mean Tor can&#39;t be used on the Mac.This is one of the tricky parts about AppStore discussions, it&#39;s not about being for or against the AppStore. In fact, I wish the AppStore was MUCH pickier about the apps it let in, and I also wish there was an alternative to the AppStore to catch cases that didn&#39;t meet that strict bar. Then the AppStore could actually be about curation as opposed to fear-induced isolationism. Then Apple wouldn&#39;t have to inadvertently have political side-effects when it disallowed apps like HKMap.live.Being on the AppStore could still be advantageous beyond just &#34;either that or you don&#39;t get to be on the iPhone at all.” Apple payment processing, iCloud integrations, Family-sharing, etc. could all be tied to being ON the AppStore, so there&#39;d still be a huge incentive to try to ship that way. And side-loading doesn&#39;t have to be easy or even on by default."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got scammed on the App Store a couple of weeks ago.I needed the SmartThings app for some Samsung home automation devices, searched for it, and installed this one:https://apps.apple.com/us/app/smart-things-smart-view-app/id...When it charged me a $20/year subscription (now cancelled) I thought &#34;Wow, Samsung charging me for this feels pretty cheap of them, but I guess that&#39;s how they do things - after all, I found this on the App Store&#34;.The app I should have installed was this one: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/smartthings/id1222822904"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Patrick McGee from Financial Times had a whole twitter thread [1] on it. It got everything from banning apps for competitive reason to Apple&#39;s FEAR ( Fraud Engineering Algorithms and Risk ) team saying the current App Store review process is inadequate.I am starting to think there is a much deeper problem with Apple, it is that without Steve Jobs, no one is being the yard stick of quality, especially in UX.A decade of App Store, you are wondering if they have actually put any effort in its Apps Search Engine. It took them 3 years to admit they have problem with Keyboard and offering an update after 5 years. For things that are easily quantify, like Sales, Hardware Performance ( Apple Silicon ), Logistics and Operation. They are absolutely excelling under Tim Cook. For everything else it seems they are loose, at least from an Apple Standard point of view, although that is still far higher than their competitors.To quote Steve, it seems people are too focused on the process, and forgot about the content.[1] https://twitter.com/PatrickMcGee_/status/1380194940236353536"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;d love to use deno, but I really don&#39;t understand the point deno&#39;s module/package system.The standard practice of deps.ts/dev_deps.ts as described in the docs[1] just seems absolutely asinine to me. Importing everything into one scope and then re-exporting from one file just seems like an awful hack.What do you do if two libraries have functions with the same name? Do you namespace them yourself, or export an object under the name of the library (and therefore give up destructuring?)The URL thing seems similarly cumbersome and unecessary. Is there something wrong with a configuration file that would map &#39;package names&#39; to the urls to get them from?, and then import { foo } from &#34;packagename&#34;?[1]https://deno.land/manual@v1.9.0/examples/manage_dependencies"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The risk of dying from a blood clot after receiving the J&amp;J vaccine is six in 6,800,000 (6.8M). The world population is 7,900,000,000 (7.9B). If everyone on the planet got the J&amp;J vaccine tomorrow, and if it is the cause of the clots, then 6,971 people would die from the vaccine.Yesterday, Covid19 killed 8,803 people (according to worldometers).We don&#39;t want anyone to die from vaccination, and we don&#39;t fully understand what the clotting issue is, so it probably makes sense to pause using J&amp;J as long as the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna) have not been implicated (which they haven&#39;t). OTOH, if this being in the news causes fewer people to get vaccinated, pausing it may be a mistake that will cause more overall deaths.Now, your risk of dying either from vaccination or Covid19 depends on various demographic factors not accounted for in my math above. But, nonetheless, the risk of dying from the J&amp;J vaccine is really, really, really tiny.Like, if I knew there was a 0.00009% chance my car were going to explode every time I got in it and started it, I would not be at all nervous about starting my car everyday for the rest of my life. I&#39;m way more likely, even accounting for my age demographic, to choke to death eating dinner tonight (5,051 deaths from choking in the U.S. in 2015 of which 2,848 were older than 74).Edit: lifetime risk of car exploding assuming I start it every day for 50 years is about 1.6%. Okay, maybe I wouldn&#39;t play that game."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The incidence of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) varies between studies, but it is estimated to be between 2 and 5 per million per year. A recent study in the Netherlands with comprehensive ascertainment suggested a much higher incidence.&#34;
https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/STROKEAHA.116.0...So the six reported cases in 6.8 million vaccinations seems low. Glad I read about all this because I got the J&amp;J vaccine 12 days ago. No noticeable side effects so far. I exercise a lot and did a 5 mile hike four days ago that resulted in a slightly strained a calf muscle.  I have been taking it easy the past few days, meaning sitting and reading a lot more than usual. So after learning about the blood clotting, have started exercising the legs frequently. My optimistic thinking is that even if the vaccine does cause an increased risk of CVST that risk can be eliminated via exercise.It will be most interesting to learn if those six cases involved people at high risk, if they exercise regularly, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"John Campbell suggested on his video the other day that perhaps this is happening because some injectors are not aspirating. What that means is that when an intramuscular injection is given you want to ensure that it goes into the muscle and not into a vein. So the proper way to do this is for the person doing the injection to first pull out the syringe (after it&#39;s been stuck into the arm) a bit to make sure there&#39;s no blood coming out. Then if not, the vaccine is pushed in. If blood is seen then a new site has to be chosen. Apparently Denmark has included aspiration in their directions for usage of the AZ vaccine."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Being a self taught software developer who has been programming since I was 12, I had no idea how to reverse a binary tree.It can be done.  As a self-taught developer, and after years of startups and consulting, I got my first FAANG job at age 40.  I hadn&#39;t done any real kind of interview in 15 years.  I spent 90% of my time preparing for CS questions, and struggled at the first one, but ended up at FB, and Google a few years later.My mindset wasn&#39;t that they really cared that I could do these obscure programming exercises that I hadn&#39;t used once in 20+ years of real-world programming, but rather that I could prove that I could learn and adapt."</p>

I just don&#39;t want to work with difficult, unhappy people.It&#39;s a strange tone to take? The buried lede is: &#34;[I] travel around and work as a digital nomad.

Not only that they will insist the dance correlates with productivity and you have to nod and agree with them. The question is, do you spend the time to learn the dance?That&#39;s pretty much it, it&#39;s just a stupid dance. You can get angry and say &#34;No no no, this dance is stupid!&#34; Or you can learn the dance, do the dance, then be richer than 95% of people in the world."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So what I really want to know is: what happens at Cloudflare--which uses v8 to implement Cloudflare Workers in shared memory space--when this kind of stuff happens? (Their use is in some sense way more &#34;out on a limb&#34; than a web browser, where you would have to wait for someone to come to your likely-niche page rather than just push the attack to get run everywhere.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People in this thread seem very confused about a lot of stuff so I’m going to try and make some clarifications:1) This is an RCE, so what it does is achieving code execution in the browser, i.e. it can run arbitrary code from the attacker, it’s literally like running a compiled program inside the target’s browser. This doesn’t bypass Chrome’s sandbox, so a lot of OS operations are not reachable from within the browser (for example, a lot of syscalls can’t be called).This is the first step in an exploit chain, the second one would be a sandbox escape to expand the attack surface and do nasty stuff, or maybe a kernel exploit to achieve even higher privileges (such as root)2) WASM being RWX is really not a security flaw. W^X protections in modern times (even in JIT-like memory mappings) makes sense only when coupled with a strong CFI (control flow integrity) model, which basically tries to mitigate code reuse attacks (such as JOP or ROP). Without this kind of protection, which needs to be a system-wide effort as iOS has shown, W^X makes literally zero sense, since any attacker can easily bypass it by executing an incredibly small JOP/ROP chain that changes memory protections in the target area to run the shellcode, or can even mmap RWX memory directly."</p>

What if someone does not have smartphone, what if that phone will stop working, who is to blame, who is responsible for fixing it, how quickly - will an employee sign SLA for fixing the phone?Employer should provide a phone for an employee and then whatever employer wants can be installed there.

Only a few people had access to push changes, which they did from home (run deploy script, go through a checklist of what should have changed, run revert script if there&#39;s a problem). They&#39;d get paid for being on-call, and used an authentication app to access our systems.One day my boss asked if I would install this authentication app on my phone, so I would be able to push changes. I refused, stating that my phone is my private property. This resulted in quite a long conversation, with reassurances about security, etc. but I didn&#39;t budge. At one point they stated that my &#34;argument wouldn&#39;t work&#34; if it was on a company-provided phone. I completely agreed and said that would be fine, which seemed to surprise them.I don&#39;t think it had even occurred to them that I was being honest: I didn&#39;t want to install random things on my phone.

While yes, Apple&#39;s walled garden does feel like a Rolls Royce compared to anything, the price tag difference this time was just way too step for me to keep buying a new Mac: It was basically 2x or more for roughly similar hardware, if not slightly worse on the MBP side. Overall, using Pop_OS! with its specialized GNOME3 setup has been a bliss, and I must say I had expected a far more difficult migration. In a few days I was happily up and running with my new machine. And then, there is the support - Apple&#39;s support outside of visiting  a Genius Bar is basically non-existent. System76 has diligently helped me even set up external hardware that wasn&#39;t theirs! Long story short, very much looking forward to COSMIC and continuing this experience. The  only thing I do miss a lot is my iTerm2... :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s some nuggets of truth in here, but I am disappointed that this article sidesteps what I feel is the most important reason for startup success in 2020: easy and abundant access to cheap capital.- Interest rates are at all time lows, borrowing is cheap- The Fed&#39;s balance sheet is at an all-time high. The economy is flush with cash, particularly the investor / VC class- This excess cash creates an (arguably artificial) wealth effect and drives an appetite for risk- Large unicorn startups that are perpetual money losers continue to operate only because they are effectively subsidized by regular capital raises. Look no further than all the Silicon Valley darlings such as Uber, Netflix, AirBnb, Tesla, and so on. All of them would cease to exist without continued capital injection from secondary share offerings or VC raises- These companies achieve growth and put pressure on the competition by offering their services below the real cost that would be needed to achieve profit, hence driving huge share price growth- This share price growth attracts new investment from the momentum-chasing crowd, increasing appetite for subsequent secondaries, and then the cycle repeatsI don&#39;t mean to be cynical, but it&#39;s hard to see this ending well for some of the nouveau riche. Tech has been a great avenue to riches by offering real innovation in some cases, but the article&#39;s error-by-omission really gives the wrong impression."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m rather disappointed PG would think that the Forbes wealth list could support any kind of conclusion whatsoever. One of the biggest reasons that the top of the list is filled with tech billionaires is that their wealth is relatively transparent, being mostly in the form of stock holdings in publicly traded companies and often directly disclosed. This makes it much easier for Forbes to estimate their net worth with some degree of confidence. Older wealth is often more opaque and diffuse, hidden behind various complex financial structures or stored in assets that are difficult to value or rarely change hands. Whether Forbes is aware of how much wealth there is and in what form, depends largely on the desire of the possessor to make it known. Some would want to disclose (or even inflate) their wealth for ego or branding reasons. Others would likely prefer to remain off the Forbes list altogether. So the Forbes list is a poor starting point even for a discussion soley about the wealthiest people. To draw any kind of inference from it to the broader economy is just downright ridiculous."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;So it&#39;s not 2020 that&#39;s the anomaly here, but 1982. The real question is why so few people had gotten rich from starting companies in 1982...a wave of consolidation was sweeping through the American economyMicrosoft, Oracle, Apple, Bloomberg, etc were all started in the late 70&#39;s/ early 80&#39;s. Their founders are the richest people in the world.Seems like the question he&#39;s asking, though, is why weren&#39;t they obscenely wealthy after only 5 years, but that requires a different thesis than PG&#39;s.Every time I read one of PG&#39;s posts, it seems like he&#39;s working from a narrative that he&#39;s trying to conform facts to."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those confused, this acquisition is due in large part by Nuance&#39;s dominance in healthcare related products.  From Nuance&#39;s last earnings release[1]:“We are very pleased with the strong start to the fiscal year, as we delivered revenue and EPS above our guidance range expectations,” said Mark Benjamin, Chief Executive Officer at Nuance. “We continued to advance our strategic initiatives, accelerating our cloud transition across our core platforms in Healthcare and focusing on our AI-first approach in Enterprise. In Healthcare, we saw solid performance in our cloud-based offerings, growing cloud revenue 28% year-over-year. In particular, we benefited from strong performance in Dragon Medical &amp; DAX Cloud revenue, which grew 22% year-over-year driven by the ongoing transition of our installed base to Dragon Medical One, as well as traction in international, ambulatory and community hospital markets. Enterprise delivered another record revenue quarter, up slightly from its previous record in Q1&#39;20, driven by particularly strong demand for our Security &amp; Biometrics solutions.&#34;Nuance has deep relationships built with nearly every health system in the US and beyond.  This fits quite well with Microsoft&#39;s corporate focus.  Yes, Nuance also has a lot of IP, but I wouldn&#39;t expect any consumer facing changes (e.g. Cortana) in the near term.[1] https://investors.nuance.com/download/EX%2099.1%20Press%20Re..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think a lot of big acquisitions make &#34;sense,&#34; given the current market.The most successful companies have lots of cash, high share prices, and amazing cash cows. They could borrow for (almost) free, so resources are practically unlimited.  Their R&amp;D is already well funded. Most of their big, growth oriented endeavours are not cash-constrained. There are usually no factories to build or production to scale up.Google tried &#34;20% time.&#34; They tried &#34;let many flowers grow.&#34; Those things seemed ambitious at 2007-scale. In 2021 terms... new flowers need to be S&amp;P 500 companies to represent growth, instead of just clutter. &#34;Meaningful growth,&#34; for Alphabet, is a big number.How else does a MSFT, Google or (especially) FB put $20bn to work? Acquiring &#34;just works.&#34;Of course, there are in-house alternatives. Waymo is an in-house investment by Alphabet that&#39;s bigger than this Nuance acquisition... especially if you consider the $bns Waymo will continue to need until some unknown future date. Self driving is looking more hopeful (certainly to investors) than it was when waymo started.... but waymo is still a dubious investment.Consider that Google could have bought any car company, for about as much as waymo will cost eventually. Car companies have loans, so you could quibble the math... but details.Acquiring is easy. The path of least resistance wins &gt;50% of the time. We have that dynamic here, both in the human/managers sense and in the arbitrage-like incentives in the market currently."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s hard for me to know whether to feel bad for ES in this case. Did they bring it on themselves? Is Amazon too big and a bully?From my perspective, Amazon has made most of its profit price gouging consumers on bandwidth after vendor locking them into their ecosystem, where they bootstrap new services by wrapping open source software with some provisioning scripts, management dashboards and cookie-cutter API / console templates. Indeed, most of this is templated -- AFAIU, for example, each AWS service autogenerates its Boto bindings and parts of its console frontend via code generators. Amazon has really mastered the factory process of churning out new services, and when they find a popular one, they can invest more resources into developing it than the original team ever could.And therein lies the rub. If Amazon is improving the software in a way that the original team couldn&#39;t, it&#39;s hard to say that the community isn&#39;t benefiting. I think what strikes me the wrong way is that Amazon is not doing it for any altruistic reason. In fact, Amazon contributes very little to open source in general, considering how much they take from it. Compare them to Facebook (React, etc) or Google (tons of dev tools) or Microsoft (VSC, TypeScript). What does Amazon have? Firecracker, kind of? And now a fork of ES because that&#39;s the only way they could continue making money off it without violating the license a small startup put in place to stop them?Well, good for Amazon, I suppose, but I find myself instinctively disliking them for this. I&#39;m not sure what the solution is. Hopefully technologies like Kubernetes and Terraform will encourage big customers to become at least cloud-agnostic, if not cloud-independent. At the very least it would be great if Amazon / Google / Microsoft stopped gouging bandwidth at such absurd margins. Or not. Maybe it will be their downfall as startups differentiate along those lines. That would be ironic, coming from the originators of &#34;your margin is my opportunity.&#34;Personally I&#39;m doing my part by not building anything with vendor lock-in. It&#39;s great to be able to deploy to any cloud, if you value either robustness or flexibility."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there any good that done by Amazon to support OSS? Like ever. They started with cloning MongoDB and now Elastic with actually zero contribution to the community regardless of their insane profits. This is a clear single. Amazon can always clone and redistribute any open source software then lock it in for AWS. If we&#39;ve started to witness declining in OSS, well at least we know now who started the wave."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow there are some cool tricks here!In Firefox any objects you pass to console.log are expandable, so you can say console.log(&#34;my hash&#34;, h). It seems to behave the same when you say console.log(&#34;my hash %o&#34;, h).But there is a tricky thing that has really confused me in some debugging efforts: when expanded, the object display is &#34;live&#34;, so it always shows the current properties of the object, not the properties as they were when you printed them. But the unexpanded view shows them as they were. So for example:    h = {foo: &#34;bar&#34;}
    console.log(h)
    ▶ Object { foo: &#34;bar&#34; }
    h.foo = &#34;BAR&#34;

Then you click the triangle and you see:    ▼ {..}
    |   foo: &#34;BAR&#34;
    | ▶ &lt;prototype&gt;: Object { .. }

I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a bug or desired behavior, but watch out for it! In the past I&#39;ve used console.log(JSON.stringify(h)) to capture the full object as-is. I guess turning it back into an object would be even nicer, so you could have a deep copy to navigate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Now, would the journalists who wrote articles with titles that are a variation of &#34;RMS defended Epstein&#34; [1,2] apologize or at least correct their articles?  Also, now that RMS has explicitly clarified his position on these issues, can the people who leveraged his &#34;silence&#34; and &#34;bad behavior&#34; to oust him from the FSF at least admit that their motive was less about making the free-software movement welcoming and was more about getting rid of RMS?[1]: https://www.thedailybeast.com/famed-mit-computer-scientist-r...
[2]: https://www.vice.com/en/article/9ke3ke/famed-computer-scient..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Minsky defense was not the primary, most important reason RMS can&#39;t serve as an effective, inclusive leader for free software, it was just the one that got the most attention. This does nothing to address the numerous complaints of harassment towards MIT students, the _other_ times he spoke out in implicit support of pedophilia, the public gaffes that are unacceptable as a public representative (e.g. the foot skin eating thing), and the fact that the FSF under Stallman kinda lost to open source anyway and hasn&#39;t really done anything besides virtue signal to others about how pure and ethical they are."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s great, but the problem seems to be RMS&#39;s disruption of development activities. This doesn&#39;t change that. For example:https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2015-01/msg00...Imagine taking the time to publicly explain to an out-of-practice dev why some technical feature is needed, then being accused of a &#34;pressure campaign&#34; that requires the out-of-practice dev to consult privately, &#34;with people I have confidence in.&#34;Gnu devs have an impressive amount of patience and grace to put up with that. But I see a lot of other FOSS devs try to replicate RMS&#39;s unnecessarily aggressive rhetoric. They often shoot themselves in the foot with it, disrespecting and consequently losing valuable contributors who are otherwise aligned philosophically with the project in every way.That kind of disruption is at odds with every value FOSS devs claim to hold-- meritocratic, decentralized, etc. Even Debian put the hammer down when an out-of-practice dev tried to use permissions to disrupt the work of a new dev. Nobody sane and self-respecting should put up with this kind of behavior.Edit: clarification"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Taleb talks about the Lindy effect and some of the surprises in this article can be explained it.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effectThe rough heuristic is: the longer a technology has been around, the longer it will last into the future.That is, it&#39;s NOT the case that every piece of technology lasts roughly the same amount of time, and then is replaced.For example, a chair vs. an iPhone.  Which one will be used further into the future?  Almost certainly a chair.----Land lines have been around a lot longer than fax machines (both in the article), so they will likely outlive fax machines.Will HTML or JavaScript last longer?  Probably HTML, since it came first.What about ASCII or HTML?  Probably ASCII.These have a &#34;dependency stack&#34; issue, but it applies regardless.  And I think that is part of the phenomenon -- low level technologies that are widely adopted take longer to go away.  Plumbing, electrical (AC vs DC), land lines, TCP/IP, BIOS, etc.I can&#39;t find a link now, but there was a recent Kevin Kelly article about finding farming tools from a catalog in the 1800&#39;s still in use.   I think he said that almost EVERY one was still in use, or able to be purchased, which is a nice illustration of the point.  It takes a long time for old tech to die, and arguably it never does."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"His #1 can not and will not ever happen. The radio spectrum is a shared resource. The total information capacity of the usable spectrum, say from 100 KHz to 100 GHz, is massive but most of it has terrible propagation and all of it can only be used once at a time. Massive MIMO helps in dense city cores with lots of independent paths reflecting everywhere but it&#39;s still just one spectrum in practice.Whereas with physical transmission lines, be they cables, fiber optics, or whatever, each run can re-use the entire spectrum."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The 3D TV phase was so odd. It really seemed like an inevitability: there was a technological breakthrough, it was genuinely much better than what came before (the red and blue stuff), it was relatively inexpensive, and on paper it seemed like a strict improvement on the status quo (flat TV).But... somehow, I never actually found myself wanting it that badly at home. And I guess everyone else agreed because one day it just vanished.So few technologies follow a trajectory like that. Usually you either get a success or a failure, where successes only end once they&#39;re replaced by something new and strictly better. But this was truly a fad; it was kind of successful for a minute, and then everybody lost interest."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I noticed as young adult that I didn’t really worry or consciously stress, but my body had somewhat predictable reactions to situations that I would realize, in hindsight, were highly stressful. Those physical reactions sucked, and as they got worse over time, it really concerned me.At some point I was encouraged to go to CBT, which I did, but honestly it made things worse. I became hyper aware of how anxious I was at any moment, and the more I noticed the more it worried me.Years later I tried mindfulness meditation and found that it helped. But also, I finally hit a kind of turning point where I just realized that there was nothing I could really do about anxiety or the physical symptoms that came along with it. I decided to mostly try to quit noticing and thinking about it. And that really helped.I still feel stress and anxiety symptoms sometimes. They still suck. My conscious mind is still the last to recognize what’s going on. But, overall, I feel I can handle a lot more stress now than I could ten years ago without it ruining my quality of life, and more importantly I can recognize the stress, not worry too much about it so I can get through it, and then rest and recuperate (as soon as possible) and recover much quicker than when I was younger.I’ve concluded that the best advice is to learn not to worry about things. Unfortunately that’s easier said than done, and I’m not sure I have any advice on how to learn to do that :/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Eh, a gross oversimplification.Feeling troubled by being anxious in the modern world is a &#34;cerebral&#34; issue. The guy who mistook an innocent animal as a tiger and freaked out because of it didn&#39;t feel bad for feeling anxious for no reason. We do. Because it interferes with our daily functioning / responsibilities in the modern world.Anxiety is also very frequently comorbid with other mental disorders. Especially OCD or OCD like tendencies, depression etc. I am medicated now and feel a lot better but when my anxiety was worse, the chatter of my &#34;conscious&#34; brain murmuring about &#34;what if&#34; scenarios was the worst. My point is, yes, anxiety manifests itself in a physical way, big time, but that is only half the problem. The discomfort with being anxious, constantly thinking about the possibility of having an anxiety attack even if you are not physically anxious &#34;at that time&#34;, evaluating the &#34;what if&#34; scenarios, the constant planning to work around possible issues, all that torture are very cognitive pursuits and they were a lot of a bigger burden on my quality of life than experiencing an anxiety attack now and then."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the advice of focusing on how to turn anxiety symptoms down and moderate physical responses are fine, but it&#39;s kind of missing the point, at least for serious cases of anxiety. I suffered pretty badly from it in my early 20s (apparently typical age for this kind of stuff), and you go very quickly from particular anxiety attacks being the issue, to fear of anxiety itself being the bigger issue.An anxiety/panic attack is physically scary the very first time, but by the tenth time what you&#39;re really afraid of is the loss of control and the anticipation of anxiety. Chronic sleeplessness is often the same way. Dealing with literally sleeping better is one thing, but at some point the real issue becomes the mental concern with sleep itself.Dealing with physical anxiety symptoms is good, but if you&#39;re mentally anxious your first thought after dealing with an anxiety attack by breathing deeply is &#34;okay, but what if it doesn&#39;t work the next time?&#34;. It&#39;s that mental attitude that I think many people have trouble dealing with."</p>

Not a particularly good setup for selling &#34;Chris-Tokens™.&#34;Not a bad thing, in the long run. It hurt like hell, the first few times, but I realized that I don&#39;t have the personal skills to &#34;sell&#34; myself (like being able to spew jargon, sound like I&#39;m TED-talking all the time, or beat LeetCode tests), so I can&#39;t blame folks for not wanting to &#34;invest&#34; in me. It is what it is. I come across as a socially-awkward dork, so people don&#39;t take me seriously. I&#39;m actually fairly good at what I do, but If I mention that, it comes across as &#34;arrogant,&#34; despite the enormous ocean of hubris that pretty much defines today&#39;s tech scene.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Instead of more palatable user tracking, how about we tell advertisers and internet companies: fuck off, we don&#39;t want any tracking? How about we hunt down and eliminate all features that allow cross-site information sharing? How about we treat attacks on user privacy as security problems of the web standards, à la Tor, and build technology that aggressively hides any user signature in any layer, from rotating IP and MAC addresses to user agents, referers and canvas leaks?But wait you say, how would the very useful internet ecosystem survive without advertising revenue? Well, there is nothing wrong with advertising per se, it&#39;s a natural part of a free market economy. It&#39;s ok to target ads to the user&#39;s search terms or social feed. The problem is that, in the pursuit of advertising revenue, a cutthroat economic competition pushed advertisers to mine more and more personal data simply to stay competitive. It&#39;s a low sum game: it doesn&#39;t bring much more money in advertising or make the internet significantly more useful, but it destroys the privacy of everyone. A spectacular market failure ripe for correction."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FLoC stands for Federated Learning of Cohorts which aims to target advertising better without it directly relying on singularly personal information.https://web.dev/floc/  FLoC enables ad selection without sharing the browsing behaviour of individual users.

  FLoC provides a privacy-preserving mechanism for interest-based ad selection.

  As a user moves around the web, their browser uses the FLoC algorithm to work out its &#34;interest cohort&#34;, which will be the same for thousands of browsers with a similar recent browsing history. The browser recalculates its cohort periodically, on the user&#39;s device, without sharing individual browsing data with the browser vendor or anyone else.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s a very interesting move. The patch seems fairly small, but now it&#39;s a patch that Brave needs to maintain and update every time they merge a new upstream version.That&#39;s what makes me wary of the whole Chromium fork concept. Every time Brave/Vivaldi/Edge/etc decide to take a different path from Google&#39;s they effectively add to their maintenance burden forever, even if like in this case they actually disable an unwanted feature.How long until the list of patches to backport for every new version of Chromium becomes so large that they have to pick and choose which one to keep maintaining and which one to give up on? If tomorrow Google decides to push a very deep change to the way, say, extensions are handled that makes them less effective at ad blocking, will Brave accept the burden to suddenly have to maintain a very deep fork of the browser in order to maintain old functionality?I&#39;m effectively FUDing right now, but my concern is genuine. I&#39;m very perplex that you can make an effectively anti-ad, pro-privacy browser based on the source code of one of the biggest ad companies in the world."</p>

That brings me to a question I have. GIMP has been in development for longer time. And supposedly it has a bigger team behind it. So how come GIMP is missing a lot of nice features like non-destructive editing, layer styles etc? I saw some of these features in its roadmap, but why is its development so slow? Is it only because working on GIMP doesn&#39;t generate any money?Edit: rephrase"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I find more amazing is what an incredible equalizer IT is: An individual with nothing more than a computer (and $50 worth of rented production infrastructure) plus the right skills can build a project that makes a (well-deserved) million a year, from anywhere in the world.It also shows the power of smart design and keeping as much as you can client side. Attempting to move any of the actual work to the server side would create an unsustainable amount of a) additional development work, b) infrastructure cost, c) infrastructure operations work. It&#39;s also a great example that you truly can do everything inside a browser nowadays.Regarding the incredulous people who can&#39;t imagine how 12 TB/month cost only $50, the hosting provider may be taking a small loss on it, and make it up with other customers. At Hetzner, extra bandwidth (after you&#39;ve exhausted your included allocation) retails for 1 EUR/TB + VAT. A provider can afford to lose $10-20/month on a single customer, and kicking them out is probably not worth the effort and the risk of even the smallest amount of bad press/word-of-mouth."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"(author here)I thought I would answer to some of the comments here.&gt; It&#39;s their place, their rulesDefinitely true. And I am not going to try to go against those rules. But I believe I am allowed to voice my opinion about them.&gt; Use in-app purchases insteadThis is definitely a valid option, but that requires diving into Google Pay, which from what I understand is not the easiest API to work with. It also means I have to maintain additional code for Google Play. More not-so-fun work to do for a side project.&gt; Make it a paid gameAnother valid option, but given how everybody is used to free games on Android, I doubt it would get much success. It also does not help that Google Play disallows switching a published app from free to paid and vice-versa: it&#39;s a one-way decision.I might end up going that way though, because it has the advantage of not having to write store-specific code. Pixel Wheels is not Android only: it also works on Linux, Windows and macOS, so not having to deal with store-specific requirements gives me more time to work on the game itself. The game would still be available for free on F-Droid and for pay-what-you-want on itch.io.I also happen to run other open-source projects, and my goal with donations is to get people to support this open-source work, not just my work on this particular project. I don&#39;t expect to ever live from this: in my wildest dreams donations would let me spend a work-day per week or every two weeks to work on open-source projects."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently implemented Google Play billing in my app (after doing Stripe and Apple App Store) and Stripe was by far the easiest to implement/test/maintain.  Google and Apple not only take their 15/30% cut, their payment systems add a very non trivial amount of work (cost) to implement and maintain while offering none of the (automated) testing capabilities of Stripe.  Work that I&#39;m forced to do, even though I had already implemented Stripe.  All because they have a monopoly on their platform.For something as critical as payment processing, both Apple and Google make it an arcane journey into API documentation and stack overflow questions. 
Hoping to write a blog post detailing all of this in the near future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many comments here confuse paid apps or in-app purchases with donations. In fact, donations are sort of a blind spot on Google Play: They&#39;re forbidden through the platform&#39;s payment system (because it would be a price charged without service in direct return), but donation buttons are also forbidden. Since both are forbidden, it&#39;s not (just) commercial optimization by Google, but that just makes it weirder IMO.As a rule of thumb, don&#39;t include a direct link to PayPal, Patreon or similar, but create a dedicated page on your website listing those and link that page."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26741829">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From a storage perspective, describing commits as snapshots seems like a bad mental model. Suppose I have a directory that is 100MB in size. If I take a snapshot of it, my snapshot would be 100MB in size. If I take a 2nd snapshot of it tomorrow, my 2nd snapshot would also be 100MB in size. My total storage needs would now be 300MB.Whereas if I had used git, and created 2 additional commits, each making a change to a small text file, my total storage size would be barely larger than 100MB. Describing the commits as a diff, as opposed to a snapshot, leads to a better intuitive understanding of why this would be the case.Not to mention other features the article discussed, such as cherry-picking. What does it even mean to &#34;cherry-pick a snapshot&#34;? In comparison, cherry-picking a diff and applying it to your current state, is far more intuitive.And let&#39;s not forget commit messages. If a commit is a snapshot, I would expect the commit-message to be descriptive of the entire snapshot. Whereas if a commit is a diff, I would expect the commit message to be descriptive of the diff. Which is exactly how most people use commit messages.Obviously both &#34;diffs&#34; and &#34;snapshots&#34; are leaky abstractions. If you insist on using the &#34;snapshot&#34; abstraction, you will need to resolve all of the above points of confusion by adding more complexity to your abstraction. And if you prefer to use the &#34;diff&#34; abstraction, you will eventually need to explain that a commit is actually a combination of diffs, along with some other metadata like a pointer to a parent commit. As a teaching tool, you can make either abstraction work. But I find it far more intuitive and useful to think of commits as &#34;diffs + some metadata&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why have so many people written long thoughtful explanations about how the author is wrong to suggest snapshots are a better mental model, and that you think all abstractions are leaky, but you find diffs a better mental model?The entire article is literally about how commits are literally snapshots. I would say people didn&#39;t read TFA, but a lot of people are quoting lines from TFA and then going on to argue with/expand on them in a way that is directly contradicted by the next few lines.I think it&#39;s because most of the people here have spent years working with git, and are so deeply attached to their understanding that they didn&#39;t hear most of what the article said.(Some commentators have pointed out specific oversimplifications the author makes like glossing over pack files, I&#39;m referring to the people who say a git blob is a diff when the entire point of TFA is that it isn&#39;t)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I believe that Git becomes understandable if we peel back the curtain and look at how Git stores your repository data.I agree, and like many, I have been saying that for years (nay, for more than a decade): and that&#39;s exactly the problem!You don&#39;t need to understand how an internal combustion engine works to drive a car... You don&#39;t need to understand how your graphics card renders stuff to develop a web page...

But I only occasionally need to do something weird that makes me go back to it, so I usually forget the relevant bits.The trouble is that I&#39;ve used a distributed VCS that did not ask me to understand internals and it had a sane UI, and good model (like tree-like commit history, so a top-level commit log would only have merges, but you could dive deeper into individual commits if you so pleased). It wasn&#39;t perfect, but it&#39;s hard for me to accept that we have gone with a subpar solution where every &#34;tutorial&#34; starts with how you need to understand the internals! But you also need to memorise them, dammit!Just like I keep forgetting the Emacs rectangle editing shortcuts since I seldom use them, I&#39;ll keep forgetting the specifics of git internals that I might need once every 12 months.And it&#39;s not me, it&#39;s _you_, git!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sometimes I feel like there are two worlds in IT: the one you encounter on a daily basis, and the one you read about on HN. The only thing consistently &#34;terrible&#34; about both of them is the often expressed lack of humility towards solutions you don&#39;t &#34;like&#34;, or more often, actually, solutions you don&#39;t understand.Gottfried Leibniz suffered no small amount of flak for his conclusion that the reason the world looks the way it does is because it&#39;s already &#34;the best of all possible worlds&#34;: you may think you see an improvement, but you lack divine understanding and therefore you don&#39;t see how it would actually make things worse.While this is in my opinion a silly idea, I think most people who work in tech could use a bit of humility influenced by this line of thought: if a solution exists today, and it has yet to be replaced, it&#39;s at least possible that it&#39;s over all the best solution, and the reason you&#39;re not seeing that is because of a lack of understanding.Of course this is not always true, but if nothing else it would lead to more interesting discussions than those stemming from someone saying &#34;if you&#39;re not using Kubernetes you&#39;re a moron&#34; and another replying &#34;learn how to sysadmin and you&#39;ll realize you don&#39;t need Kubernetes in the first place&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At scale software stops being a technology problem and becomes a people problem. And groups of humans don&#39;t scale.We naturally organize into hierarchies of small subgroups with limited  interaction boundaries. Each subgroup will adopt slightly different methodologies, have different tooling preferences, will have integration and communication overhead with others,  and so on.This can not be preventend, only mitigated. Which is perfectly fine. The important step is recognizing that software development is really not special [1], and that the limiting factor is the human element. Then you can build your organizational structures around these restrictions.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26713139"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The tooling is simply not there, so every software project keeps pushing the boundary of what is possible in its own unique fragile way.People don&#39;t want solutions to yesterday&#39;s problems. These are considered trivial and already solved, such as invoking a shell command (which just hides a lot of complexity under the hood). Noone will pay you for invoking existing solutions. They pay you to push the boundary.By tooling I mean programming languages, frameworks, libraries and operating systems. All of whuch have been designed for a single machine operation with random access memory model.This no longer holds true. In order to scale software today you need multi machine operations and no such OS exists for it yet. Only immature attempts such as Kubernetes, whose ergonomics are far from the simolicity that you&#39;d expect from a unix like system.And random access memory model breaks down completely, because it is just a leaky abstraction. For full performance memory is only accessed linearly. Any random access structured programming language completely breaks down for working with GBs of data, in parallel and on a cluster of machines.I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll push the boundary further if we keep piling crap on top of existing crap. The foundations have to change and for that we&#39;d better go back to the 70s when these ideas were being explored."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; In order to make these checks pass the hooks in vgpu_unlock_hooks.c will look for a ioremap call that maps the physical address range that contain the magic and key values, recalculate the addresses of those values into the virtual address space of the kernel module, monitor memcpy operations reading at those addresses, and if such an operation occurs, keep a copy of the value until both are known, locate the lookup tables in the .rodata section of nv-kernel.o, find the signature and data bocks, validate the signature, decrypt the blocks, edit the PCI device ID in the decrypted data, reencrypt the blocks, regenerate the signature and insert the magic, blocks and signature into the table of vGPU capable magic values.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazing! Simply amazing!This not only enables the use of GPGPU on VMs, but also enables the use of a single GPU to virtualize Windows video games from Linux!This means that one of the major problems with Linux on the desktop for power users goes away, and it also means that we can now deploy Linux only GPU tech such as HIP on any operating system that supports this trick!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dual booting is for chumps. If I could run a base Linux system and arbitrarily run fully hardware accelerated VMs of multiple Linux distros, BSDs and Windows, I&#39;d be all over that. I could pretend here that I really need the ability to quickly switch between OSes, that I&#39;d like VM-based snapshots, or that I have big use cases to multiplex the hardware power in my desktop box like that. I really don&#39;t need it. I just want it.I really hope Intel sees this as an opportunity for their DG2 graphics cards due out later this year.If anyone from Intel is reading this: if you guys want to carve out a niche for yourself, and have power users advocate for your hardware - this is it. Enable SR-IOV for your upcoming Xe DG2 GPU line just as you do for your Xe integrated graphics. Just observe the lengths that people go to for their Nvidia cards, injecting code into their proprietary drivers just to run this. You can make this a champion feature just by not disabling something your hardware can already do. Add some driver support for it in the mix and you&#39;ll have an instant enthusiast fanbase for years to come."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"GUI is better for discoverability of the most common scenarios (I can right-click to see everything that can be done with the file, including some third party programs). But it&#39;s bad for composing programs and interoperability, often it&#39;s impossible or very hard to automate (how many people are doing UI testing? there is a good reason it&#39;s not many -- it completely sucks)TUI/console is very good for interoperability/automation/muscle memory, but doing one-off things is harder.
If I don&#39;t remember the `df` command... what do I do apart from searching on the internet? Maybe searching man pages, but it isn&#39;t as fuzzy (e.g. `man -K &#34;free space&#34;` isn&#39;t very fruitful). 
In comparison, I know that if I start going through GUI, eventually I&#39;ll eventually find the free disk space info.It&#39;s interesting that there is some analogy to object-oriented and functional paradigms -- if I have a rich object in a debugger in Python, I can call dir() on it to immediately see what I can do with it. Whereas if it&#39;s a simple dataclass, I&#39;d need to search through code to find how I can use it. Might be a too far fetched analogy though.I think we need all of it, and also need to make the distinction less apparent. Would be nice to make GUIs more composable, and TUIs more discoverable. Ideally it should be a spectrum of interfaces, so you don&#39;t have to make a hard choice and can gradually move into the direction you want."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not sure if this is satire or not, but certainly the single worst case of using a terminal is file manipulation. Nothing will ever beat the right-clicks or Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V combos. It&#39;s just more natural to &#34;see&#34; things that you move.Now when it comes to more complex applications, I&#39;d stop using the CLI if I had to search the manpages or the internet each time for doing something I already did previously.
Since I discovered the Ctrl+R shortcut (for searching your history), it has been much easier. You read the manpage once, maybe you do an internet search, you enter the command and then you can find it back as long as it&#39;s still in your bash history (be sure to set HISTSIZE and HISTFILESIZE to correct values). I also have a DOCS.txt file where I put all the rare but useful commands I&#39;m afraid of losing. I don&#39;t need to be an expert in ffmpeg&#39;s options (... though I sort of am now), I can just look at my history or my DOCS.txt file!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As much as I like the command line, I couldn&#39;t help noticing from the first 10 or so entries[1] that the &#34;stop&#34; text consists of one of:1. Drag and Drop2. Right clicking3. Ctrl-C and Ctrl-VSo these 3-5 things do everything in the list in a GUI, and instead the author wants us to learn 35 different command/syntax combinations?As an aside, I&#39;d like to write an article saying &#34;You Don&#39;t Need Github To Write an Article&#34;. If you insist on using Github for that purpose, at least do it properly with a static site generator.[1] Did not bother with the rest."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I tried Nix a few days ago. I set it up on an existing Arch install. I installed a couple of packages with &#34;nix-env -i [package] and then tried to update them with &#34;nix-env -u&#34; as instructed in the official documentation: https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/#ch-basic-package-mgmtThis ended up breaking the entire install. After a few hours of troubleshooting I found that the reason it broke was that it updated itself from version &#34;nix-2.3.10&#34; to &#34;nix-2.3.10-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl&#34; because it saw that package&#39;s version string as a version bump. The suggestion in the github issue was to instead use an unofficial third party package for basic package management because this was a known, long-standing issue that is not likely to be fixed.https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/118481The experience came across as a massive red flag and I decided not to pursue it further."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I spend a few hours looking at nix about a year ago and found it impenetrable.I simply do not grok the syntax or what the functions do. I tried searching for the functions shown in the examples on the website to no avail. I searched packages, options, and even resorted to ctrl-f while clicking through the site &#34;documentation&#34;...It sounds awesome, but its in dire need of some better documentation if it wants to be accessible, IMHO. I simply didnt have the patience to delve any deeper."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nix has a heavy learning curve and requires learning the language to feel comfortable. However, overcoming that hump is incredibly rewarding and allows for taming your system in a way that, for me at least, changed the way I look at composing software.At mindbuffer[1] we&#39;ve started using it for our recent art installations. The big benefits for us are reproducibility, ease of deployment, and the ability to collaborate on the composition of the whole system. I.e. rather than sharing a README of how to install things one by one and hoping each of us has followed it correctly, we just work on the same set of config files via a git repo (like we would any other code) and can be sure we&#39;re all on the same page as a result.Very much looking forward to Nix 3.0 landing with all its UI improvements and flake support. It seems like these changes will go a long way to making Nix more accessible, and provide a smoother on-ramp to learning the language itself.https://mindbuffer.net/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m using Starlink right now.  AMA.I&#39;m in East Idaho.  Currently my dish angles itself to the north.  It rarely moves itself north/south, and slightly moves east/west throughout the day.  I&#39;ve read that right now it locks onto a single satellite, although they&#39;re adding multi-satellite support later.My speeds are inconsistent, and interestingly they start slow (around 60 Mbps) but after a couple seconds they&#39;ll get to 150-200 Mbps (which is awesome for downloads).  Latency is consistently in the low 30ms.  I get some downtime every day, so it really is a &#34;beta&#34; like they say.  I have a backup WISP.Setup was literally take dish out of the box, insert into tripod (included), plug in cables, connect to the wireless routers SSID and activate with the starlink app.  After that I put the included router into storage and plugged in my Protectli[1] running CentOS.  Everything works great.  My only complaint is the CGNAT, but given the difficulty associated with procuring IPv4 addresses, it&#39;s understandable.[1]  I love this thing. 
 Highly recommend:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, I&#39;m impressed! I thought it would take more than a decade to implement when it was announced, but it&#39;s here and it works. Just amazing.100/16 Mbps is pretty decent I guess, hopefully it doesn&#39;t go down as the number of users goes up. The latency is great imo, 40ms using satellites? I don&#39;t think anyone has achieved that before.Would a bigger dish work better or not?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The cell grouping is interesting. A colleague likes the outdoors, so he&#39;s preordered one for his Suzuki Jimny, to mount on it. I wonder if Starlink are considering this use case.I haven&#39;t been able to preorder mine, because we&#39;re planning on moving out from the city to a small village next year, but the Starlink website requires a street address.Our villages are quite primitive, no street names (I think it&#39;s cos nobody&#39;s thought of it). So, the nearest town where there&#39;s street names, is quite far.I was feeling uneasy about using it as an address, this article sort of cements that concern.I have 50/50Mbps fiber, but reckon we could still be served by 20 down if needed. Exciting!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Avoid functions in WHERE clausesAvoid them on the column-side of expressions. This is called sargability [1], and refers to the ability of the query engine to limit the search to a specific index entry or data range.
For example, WHERE SUBSTRING(field, 1, 1) = &#34;A&#34; will still cause a full table scan and the SUBSTRING function will be evaluated for every row, while WHERE field LIKE &#34;A%&#34; can use a partial index scan, provided an index on the field column exists.Prefer = to LIKEAnd therefore this advice is wrong. As long as your LIKE expression doesn&#39;t start with a wildcard, LIKE can use an index just fine.Filter with WHERE before HAVINGThis usually isn&#39;t an issue, because the search terms you would use under HAVING can&#39;t be used in the WHERE clause. But yes, the other way around is possible, so the rule of thumb is: if the condition can be evaluated in the WHERE clause, it should be.WITHBe aware that not all database engines perform predicate propagation across CTE boundaries. That is, a query like this:  WITH allRows AS (
    SELECT id,
           result = difficult_calculation(col)
    FROM table)
  SELECT result
  FROM allRows
  WHERE id = 15;

might cause the database engine to perform difficult_calculation() on all rows, not just row 15. All big databases support this nowadays, but it&#39;s not a given.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargable"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an aside, but a colleague years back showed me his preferred method formatting SQL statements, and I&#39;ve always found it to be the best in terms of readability, I just wish there was more automated tool support for this format. The idea is to line up the first value from each clause. Visually it makes it extremely easy to &#34;chunk&#34; the statement by clause, e.g.:  SELECT a.foo, b.bar, g.zed
    FROM alpha a
    JOIN beta b ON a.id = b.alpha_id
    LEFT JOIN gamma g ON b.id = g.beta_id
   WHERE a.val &gt; 1
     AND b.col &lt; 2
   ORDER BY a.foo"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Although it’s possible to join using a WHERE clause (an implicit join), prefer an explicit JOIN instead, as the ON keyword can take advantage of the database’s index.This implies that WHERE style join can&#39;t use indices.I can understand why some would  prefer either syntax for readability/style reasons.  But the idea that one uses indices and the other not, seems highly dubious.Looking at the postgres manual [1], the WHERE syntax is clearly presented as the main way of inner joining tables. The JOIN syntax is described as an &#34;alternative syntax&#34;:&gt; This [INNER JOIN] syntax is not as commonly used as the one above, but we show it here to help you understand the following topics.Maybe some database somewhere cannot optimise queries properly unless JOIN is used? Or is this just FUD?[1] https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/tutorial-join.html"</p>

To make command line even more confusing, multiple tools I have used allow spaces in optional arguments (e.g. &#34;-opt1 arg1 arg2 -opt2&#34;, where arg1 and arg2 set two values for -opt1).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, what an awesome dive into some of the technical aspects behind one of my favorite tools for using the web. And I do think of it that way these days, it&#39;s fairly stunning on some sites to switch off all the block and see how they become genuinely unbrowsable. I remember seeing Gorhill discuss a few times over the years some of the reqs for uBO during certain times (like why it could no longer work with Safari following changes Apple made a while back), but so cool to have it all collected in one place.Having said that I&#39;ve also been fairly stunned recently to see how much difference a simple DNS blacklist system can make too. Not because it&#39;s a big technical achievement but because it isn&#39;t and in principle seems relatively trivial to work around. But as I&#39;ve been switching all my routing from UniFi to OPNsense, I&#39;ve gone ahead and tried out Unbound&#39;s basic built-in blacklisting. While it&#39;s no uBO, it works on every single device and browser including in apps and it seems like it really shouldn&#39;t, that more parties would just be proxying ads through their own infra and DNS. Been kind of an interesting illustration of technical vs economic influences in an ecosystem. I can see how proxying would add complexity and cost to setup so it must just be that few enough people do it the ad industry can&#39;t be bothered.But should that ever catch on (and it could, Raspberry Pi seems fairly well known) I expect uBO to be able to keep up with the cat-and-mouse long after DNS has been left behind. This piece helps underline how incredibly important maintaining a critical level of diversity in the browser ecosystem is. Just shortly ago there were a bunch of complaints again about Apple not allowing Chrome to be on iOS because it &#34;holds back the web&#34;, but what &#34;holding back the web&#34; looks like is certainly a matter of perspective..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;At browser launch, Firefox will wait for uBO to be up and ready before network requests are fired from already opened tab(s).&gt;This is not the case with Chromium-based browsers, i.e. tracker/advertisement payloads may find their way into already opened tabs before uBO is up and ready in Chromium-based browsers, while these are properly filtered in Firefox.&gt;Reliably blocking at browser launch is especially important for whoever uses default-deny mode for 3rd-party resources and/or JavaScript.Oof.  TIL.  That makes blockers kinda crippled in chromes, if you expect them to actually block things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Such a shame uMatrix was discontinued.uBlock Origin comes close, and surpasses in some ways (I used both for that reason) but lacks separate control of cookies, images, scripts, etc. So you can&#39;t accept a particular third party&#39;s images without also accepting its scripts, cookies, etc.I mention it mainly in the hope that we can popularise its maintained fork &#39;nuTensor&#39;.After trying uBlock (as in attempting to also cover what I used to use uMatrix for) for a few weeks I think it&#39;s insufficient and nuTensor is the better option for me, but it quickly won&#39;t be if ~nobody uses it and it falls by the wayside.Alternatively uBO could support the few details it lacks from uM? It seems like the problem basically was difficulty/time constraints in supporting both.. but I don&#39;t know why they were ever separate? There&#39;s plenty of overlap. If uBO had uM&#39;s granularity in &#39;advanced mode&#39;, that&#39;d be perfect."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; For example, I once joined a team maintaining a system that was drowning in bugs. There were something like two thousand open bug reports. Nothing was tagged, categorized, or prioritized. The team couldn’t agree on which issues to tackle
&gt; I spent almost three weeks in that room, and emerged with every bug report reviewed, tagged, categorized, and prioritized.Honestly, this is one of those traps a team can fall into, where nobody feels empowered to ignore the rest of the business for 3 weeks to put the bell on the cat. The only person without deliverables and due dates is the new hire. And it takes a special kind of new hire to have the expertise to parachute in, recognize that work needs to be done, and then do it with little supervision.But he&#39;s right in general, that you can get some surprising things done by just putting in the time and focus. Which is why it&#39;s so utterly toxic that corporate America runs on an interrupt driven system, with meetings sprinkled carelessly across engineer calendars."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I joined a mentoring program targeted at recent college grads, I expected to be teaching things like interview prep, resume writing, negotiation skills, communication skills, and how to deliver results in a workplace.For about half of the mentees, that&#39;s roughly true. However, for the other half much of my mentoring ends up being about time management, following through on commitments, and putting in the effort required to get a job done. A surprising number of young people are graduating college without ever having had to work any job. It&#39;s particularly difficult for talented coders who breezed through easy CS programs until they land in a work environment where tasks are challenging, expectations are high, and the only way to get things done is to sit down and put in the effort.One of the best skills anyone can learn is how to sit down, focus, and get work done. In my experience, it&#39;s increasing challenging to convince young people that this is an acquired skill that they can practice and develop. There&#39;s a growing perception that traits like work ethic, focus, and motivation are fixed attributes that one is born with (or without) rather than abilities that are developed over time. It&#39;s frustrating to watch some mentees map out meticulous diet and exercise programs to improve their physical strength, but then turn around and tell me that they&#39;re only capable of coding for 2 hours per day as a sort of fixed upper limit. Like everything, the ability to work and focus can be developed over time with practice and dedication. It&#39;s worth it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I experienced this when I first started learning the piano. When I played the first song I had learned for my sister, she was amazed. &#34;Wow, I could never play like that&#34;, she said, &#34;my fingers don&#39;t work that way&#34;. But when I broke down for her exactly how I&#39;d learned it -- by breaking the song down into manageable chunks of just a few notes each, practicing each chunk with each hand separately many times until proficiency was reached, stringing the chunks together until I could play the whole song separately on each hand, and then bringing both hands together and repeating the entire process all over again -- her amazement turned to a look of disappointment. It was a mix of both realizing that her brother wasn&#39;t actually a genius, and a sort of mild disgust that I&#39;d dedicated so much time to this activity."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Article aside, EVERYONE with a marketing/technical blog should have an intro like fly.io does: a one paragraph explanation of what the service does.It gives context for the article and immediately creates the possibility of converting people off nothing but the article, right off the gate.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fantastic writeup: technical details, context and framing, all in clear, informal, plain-English prose. It&#39;s profoundly effective, and vanishingly rare. As for Fly&#39;s solution per se: like many great ideas it seems simple bordering on obvious, in retrospect. I&#39;m impressed and more interested than ever in bringing fly.io into my wheelhouse.Final thoughts:CLI-first: flyctl reminds me of `vercel` (fka Zeit `now`), which is a big compliment&gt; &#34;VM build-and-boot process on a second deployment is faster than the logging that we do&#34;  
... ie, well-suited for lambdas / serverless functions at CDN edge -- which is of extreme relevance and interest to me and everyone else working on minimizing latency with modern webapp architecture... exciting times!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pretty clever. It is pretty neat how much a small team can do by intelligently &#34;remixing&#34; the powerful primitives that now exist at the linux and VM/container layers.The cool bit is how many interesting things are here/arriving like bpf, io_uring, and wireguard in linux and with wasm and all of the interesting things it opens up with fast, sandboxed execution. I fully expect from some of these techs will really come innovation that will shake-up infrastructure even more than cloud and kubernetes already have.(Also, hi Kurt and team, cool stuff!)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those who don’t know much about this field, this seems incredible. The reality is that this a tech demo that Neuralink is using to practice the basics. For other research groups in this field, this is tech from 20 years ago.The current state of the art is humans, mostly quadriplegic people, with chips which let them control robot arms with enough accuracy to pick up small delicate objects, play games, and type by thinking words. Current state of the art implants let people get tactile feedback too - they can intuitively know the position of the arm they’re controlling and feel the amount of pressure on each finger tip.I had the pleasure of meeting a man with an implant in 2016 and the technology he was using was incredible. He could pick up a grape with his arm without crushing it and then eat it. If the arm was in another room, he could feel around with it to find objects. He described how the arm just felt like a part of his body when it’s turned on.To use SpaceX as an analogy: this isn’t a first flight. This is more like a static test fire. If Neuralink follows the SpaceX trajectory of driving down cost/increasing innovation, it results will be really out of this world. Stuff that would just sound bonkers right now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems to be very similar to the early 2000s demos at Brown University/Cyberkinetics[1].  In 2008 they demonstrated it in humans[2] after lots of work getting FDA approval. The core difference here (from my non-expert reading) seem to be electrodes are along a thread rather than on a chip.See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJJPbpHoPWo for a video of the pong demo in humans.The motor cortex seems to have a clear, learnable signal though it is rather noisy sampling &lt;1000 locations.Mary Lou Jepsen at Open Water has ideas about how to do this non-invasively [3].[1] https://www.braingate.org/publications/[2] https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/2006-07/06-...[3] https://www.ted.com/talks/mary_lou_jepsen_how_we_can_use_lig..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That was difficult to watch. While the technology is impressive, it is sickening to watch. The part where they can pair the phone via bluetooth made me want to vomit. It is obviously unnatural, but I can&#39;t quite put my finger on it. Something about seeing that animal, oblivious to what&#39;s happening, and that implant with the ability to directly record thoughts and/or remote control.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi HN! I wrote an article about this initial support series and what it took to make things work properly on this machine:https://asahilinux.org/2021/03/progress-report-january-febru...It still applies to what got merged; the past month was spent on clean-ups, fixes, and review feedback, but there are no major changes to the approach. This initial merge was quite complex as it has to touch a number of subsystems and core kernel code in order to support the M1&#39;s quirks, and it was CCed to ~20 people. Now that it&#39;s done we can more efficiently work on individual drivers and subsystems, so I expect the pace to pick up.If you would like to support my work on this project, I do have a Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/marcanI also streamed initial development on YouTube and will be resuming streams next week (patch feedback and git rebasing and munging doesn&#39;t make for very interesting streams, but now I&#39;m back to coding). Coming up I have some driver support other people have been working on, and then I&#39;ll be writing a minimal hypervisor that can run macOS as a guest, to help reverse engineer the hardware - this will be important for reverse engineering more complex drivers cleanly, especially the GPU kernel side.Until now we&#39;ve used a serial cable to debug/load kernels (needs a DIY arduino thing, an proper design I&#39;m working on which is still vapourware, or another M1 box), but Sven added support for the USB device controller and I&#39;ll merge it into our bootloader soon, so from this point on anyone will be able to do quick kernel iteration, debugging, and hardware exploration with just a standard USB cable and any other host machine."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Story about him (from the Guardian, via Reddit):Hargreaves was a yeoman aboard the destroyer HMS Wallace on which Philip, son of Prince Andrew of Greece, had been appointed first lieutenant - second-in-command - at the age of 21. In July 1943, engaged in the Allied landings in Sicily, the ship came under repeated bombardment at dead of night and its crew realised that they would probably lose their lives.It was then Philip conjured up a plan to throw overboard a wooden raft with smoke floats that would create the illusion of debris ablaze on the water. As he hoped, the German plane was fooled into attacking the raft while the Wallace sailed to safety under cover of darkness.Hargreaves recalled the terrifying events of that night on the website: &#39;It was obvious that we were the target for tonight and they would not stop until we had suffered a fatal hit. It was for all the world like being blindfolded and trying to evade an enemy whose only problem was getting his aim right. There was no doubt in anyone&#39;s mind that a direct hit was inevitable.&#39;There was no question but to accept that on the next run or the one after that we had little chance of survival. I had been through so much that the feeling of anger and frustration was as great as the fear I and everyone else felt.&#39;It was less than five minutes after the aircraft had departed and - if the previous space in time was approximately the same - we had about 20 minutes to come up with something. We couldn&#39;t steam far in that time, not even far enough to make the aircraft think we had moved.&#39;He continued: &#39;The first lieutenant [Philip] went into hurried conversation with the captain, and the next thing a wooden raft was being put together on deck. Within five minutes they launched a raft over the side - at each end was fastened a smoke float. When it hit the water the smoke floats were activated and billowing clouds of smoke interspersed with small bursts of flame gave a convincing imitation of flaming debris in the water.&#39;The captain ordered full ahead and we steamed away from the raft for a good five minutes and then he ordered the engines stopped. The tell-tale wake subsided and we lay there quietly in the soft darkness and cursed the stars, or at least I did. Quite some time went by until we heard aircraft engines approaching.&#39;The sound of the aircraft grew louder until I thought it was directly overhead and I screwed up my shoulders in anticipation of the bombs. The next thing was the scream of the bombs, but at some distance. The ruse had worked and the aircraft was bombing the raft. I suppose he was under the impression that he had hit us in his last attack and was now finishing the job.&#39;We lay there waiting for him to leave, which he did, and, in view of the solitary attacks so well spaced apart, we were convinced he would not return. It had been marvellously quick thinking, conveyed to a willing team and put into action as if rehearsed.&#39;"</p>

Lab leaks happen more often than most people realize[1][1]https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/3/20/18260669/deadly..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The virus does have an inexplicable feature: a so-called “furin cleavage site” in the spike protein that helps SARS-CoV-2 pry its way into human cells. While such sites are present in some coronaviruses, they haven’t been found in any of SARS-CoV-2’s closest known relatives.This is false.  First of all it should be stated clearer that there has been parallel evolution across several branches of coronaviruses which have independently evolved a furin cleavage site (so there is evolutionary pressure and advantage for coronaviruses to follow this path):https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187350612...And then the statement is just wrong.  The related sarbecoviruses found in Thailand have similar furin cleavage sites:&gt; The RacCS203 S gene is most similar to that of RmYN02 (Supplementary Fig. 3a). The two viruses shared part of the furin cleavage site unique to SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Fig. 3b) and have an almost identical RBD aa sequence with only two residue differences out of 204 aa residueshttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21240-1"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel that for people paying attention to COVID news, this has always been the case; there&#39;s never been any kind of conclusive evidence on the origin of the virus (that I&#39;ve read of). The article outlines three main possible origins - natural, accidental combination in lab, deliberate construction in lab. (There&#39;s a fourth option I&#39;ve seen floating around - deliberate release of a constructed virus.) It seems that most of the scientists in the article are considering the second option; however, right-wing media has apparently in multiple instances sought to take their work to push the third, or even fourth option.It is thoroughly unsurprising to me that most scientific publications would take a stance against releasing studies or articles considering option two or three, as right-wing media and politicians were/are fishing for anything with a suitable scientific veneer they could throw out as evidence of someone to blame. (And its not hard to see why - telling your constituents they have to deal with job losses, family deaths and lockdowns because someone in China ate a bat leaves people without something to blame, and the politicians tend to be the closest relevant people.) Given the amount of anti-asian racism/crime/murder we&#39;ve seen spiking in the last year, I think the publications&#39; stances  (and the more mainstream media) to lean heavily towards option one is understandable - no one wants to be the used as justification for hate crimes or political action a la the Iraq war buildup.Perhaps in another year or two things will have cooled down enough that stuff like this can be considered without collateral damage."</p>

What do you get out of posting them to another website?This question has always been weird to me, but apparently there are people who don’t experience “this thing is good, i wish to contribute” or “this has brought me joy, i wish to give something back”. I mean, thankfully there are still enough others that we can have Wikipedia, where you also don’t get anything in return. Not even “clout”. Sometimes someone will send you a thank you and that’ll make your day. Open Source is another obvious one, but it extends to the real world, too. Some people will plant flowers in public places or do yarnbombing or pick up trash in the neighborhood or whatever. Why do it? What do you get out of it? I mean, I don’t want to be harsh saying “what a dumb question”, but it just kind of makes me uncomfortable how it challenges something that should be celebrated.The next question about it being invasive is good and valid, but this one on its own just sounds like “why not content yourself with passively consuming”.

Interesting, not my cup of tea, but definitely interesting.Something else that caught my attention was how early he believes his interest for feet developed, as early as six and nine years of age. I wonder how this slightly amusing predilection grows and develops over time, as to even gain sexual connotation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; CPUs have somewhat plateaued in their single core performance in the past decadeIn fact for many cases single core performance has dropped at a given relative price-point. Look at renting inexpensive (not bleeding edge) bare-metal servers: the brand new boxes often have a little less single-core performance than units a few years old, but have two, three, or four times the number of cores at a similar inflation/other adjusted cost.For most server workloads, at least where there is more than near-zero concurrency, adding more cores is far more effective than trying to make a single core go faster (up to a point - there are diminishing returns when shoving more and more cores into one machine, even for embarrassingly parallel workloads, due to other bottlenecks, unless using specialist kit for your task).It can be more power efficient too despite all the extra silicon - one of the reasons for the slight drop (rather than a plateau) in single core oomph is that a small drop in core speed (or a reduction in the complexity via pipeline depth and other features) can create a significant reduction in power consumption. Once you take into account modern CPUs being able to properly idle unused cores (so they aren&#39;t consuming more than a trickle of energy unless actively doing something) it becomes a bit of a no-brainer in many data-centre environments. There are exceptions to every rule of course - the power dynamic flips if you are running every core at full capacity most or all of the time (i.e. crypto mining)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Historically, the Windows Command Prompt and the built-in Terminal.app on macOS were very slow at handling tons of output.A very old trick I remember on Windows, is to minimize command prompts if a lot of output was expected and would otherwise slow down the process. I don&#39;t know if it turned write operations into a no-op, or bypassed some slow GDI functions, but it had an extremely noticeable difference in performance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;&#34;Closing File Handles on WindowsMany years ago I was profiling Mercurial to help improve the working directory checkout speed on Windows, as users were observing that checkout times on Windows were much slower than on Linux, even on the same machine.I thought I could chalk this up to NTFS versus Linux filesystems or general kernel/OS level efficiency differences. What I actually learned was much more surprising.When I started profiling Mercurial on Windows, I observed that most I/O APIs were completing in a few dozen microseconds, maybe a single millisecond or two ever now and then. Windows/NTFS performance seemed great!Except for CloseHandle(). These calls were often taking 1-10+ milliseconds to complete. It seemed odd to me that file writes - even sustained file writes that were sufficient to blow past any write buffering capacity - were fast but closes slow. It was even more perplexing that CloseHandle() was slow even if you were using completion ports (i.e. async I/O). This behavior for completion ports was counter to what the MSDN documentation said should happen (the function should return immediately and its status can be retrieved later).While I didn&#39;t realize it at the time, the cause for this was/is Windows Defender. Windows Defender (and other anti-virus / scanning software) typically work on Windows by installing what&#39;s called a filesystem filter driver. This is a kernel driver that essentially hooks itself into the kernel and receives callbacks on I/O and filesystem events. It turns out the close file callback triggers scanning of written data. And this scanning appears to occur synchronously, blocking CloseHandle() from returning. This adds milliseconds of overhead.&#34;PDS: Observation: In an OS, if I/O (or more generally, API calls) are initially written to run and return quickly -- this doesn&#39;t mean that they won&#39;t degrade (for whatever reason), as the OS expands and/or underlying hardware changes, over time...For any OS writer, present or future, a key aspect of OS development is writing I/O (and API) performance tests, running them regularly, and immediately halting development to understand/fix the root cause -- if and when performance anomalies are detected... in large software systems, in large codebases, it&#39;s usually much harder to gain back performance several versions after performance has been lost (i.e., Browsers), than to be disciplined, constantly test performance, and halt development (and understand/fix the root cause) the instant any performance anomaly is detected..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was a teenager, my music teacher always had a copy of the Real Book around. I went to a local music store and was looking through their music books when one of the employees asked, &#39;is there something I can help you find?&#39; When I said the Real Book, he said, &#39;oh, we don&#39;t keep that out here&#39;... he disappeared for a minute and came back with a copy from the back room. At the time, I felt like I had been admitted into a secret club."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was learning to play the saxophone my instructor had an old copy of the Real Book. The transcriptions of songs by some of the jazz legends  would blow my mind. I thought the people being able to transcribe those were geniuses (still do). They had no sophisticated software to help them. It was all done manually by listening to countless hours of recordings over and over again. All those chord changes, harmonies, the extra fast tempo...That also reminds me of Phil Schapp. He used to run (probably still does) a radio program at Columbia University. Most astonishing encyclopedic knowledge of jazz!! Have a listen sometime. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_SchaapEdit: Added Wikipedia link."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a bassist. I got my Real Book in 1982. I was already playing in the high school jazz band, but as a suburban kid, I had zero exposure to things like jam sessions and live jazz performances. Nobody had taught me how to learn harmonies from recordings, so I was kind of lost. The Real Book gave me a way to follow recorded tunes and grasp what the players were doing. Later on, being able to play from &#34;lead sheets&#34; enabled me to play with musicians who were a lot better than me, and was really how I learned to play.But eventually, I was hauling a ton of fake books to every gig. About 20 years ago, I was running late, and decided to leave my fake books behind. And I survived. I had memorized most of the tunes that were played regularly in my locale, and forced myself to learn the rest by ear, on the bandstand.So I tell people that the two best things I&#39;ve done for my jazz playing were: Getting a Real Book, and getting rid of my Real Book. Today, those tunes are hopelessly overplayed, and I prefer finding bands to play with, who are willing to venture off the beaten path, with less familiar tunes or especially original material."</p>

Reform unions for employees of the people. Create independent civilian oversight boards with the teeth to suspend and terminate. Invest more in mental health and drug rehabilitation services. Invest in educational resources to teach communities how to deal with law enforcement.Edit to add: People are confusing civil liability with criminal liability.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I understand the arguments that &#34;QI has reasonable goals in theory&#34;, but it is time to throw the baby out with the bathwater. If cops didn&#39;t want to lose QI, they should have held themselves to account for the last few decades. Maybe the unions should have spoken up when cops steal tens of thousands of dollars in cash from a suspect, and get away with it due to QI.San Antonio, TX will be voting in May on whether to disband the police union. &#34;Back the Blue&#34; types are saying it&#39;s Defund in disguise, that we won&#39;t be able to find good cops, and so on.Except several large cities in Texas don&#39;t have unionized police, and they do alright. Furthermore, the cops in San Antonio can commit really awful crimes, and still have months- or years-long appeals.Being a cop isn&#39;t a right, it is a privilege and a critical duty. It should be easy to fire bad cops. SAPD, if you didn&#39;t want your union to be busted, maybe you should have  held yourselves to a higher standard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the outside, the US has big issues with race, poverty, mental health and access to firearms. That makes policing very difficult and pushes towards a &#34;shoot first&#34; approach.But since the US refuses to address any of the issues, it&#39;s stuck trying to fix the problem without being able to fix the problem.What concerns me most (and I see it here in the UK too) isn&#39;t these issues themselves, it is the inability of people (media, politicians and everyday citizens) to have an adult conversation about any of it. If the US collectively said &#34;we accept these events as a downside of our way of life&#34; I might not agree but I&#39;d understand. Instead people act like they&#39;re surprised or pretend they can be fixed by tinkering around the edges. It seems quite dishonest..."</p>

Expect more to sign on to this idea; it is the ultimate tool for cancel culture proponents.- Foreword: I am not making a constitutional argument. Private companies now own most of the highways we use for speech, much less widespread speech. Sure, Newspapers and mail can be argued, but there&#39;s plenty of examples where they had to tolerate nasty messages for some self-imposed access to speech principles. Secondarily, nobody used a newspaper to talk to their auntie, while Twitch isn&#39;t Facebook or Twitter self-expression is not limited to certain platforms.

Oftentimes appeals are never even considered, or partnership staff plainly doesn&#39;t respond.The upsetting part is Twitch is such a great platform technology wise, and its competitors can&#39;t seem to recreate the same magic.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who has worked in fields that use lattice calculations (on the experimental side), the new calculation is interesting, but I would not say it’s particularly convincing yet. Lattice calculations are VERY difficult, and are not always stable. I am not questioning whether they did their work well or not, just pointing out that in high energy physics and high energy nuclear physics, many times our experimental results are significantly better constrained and also undergo significantly more testing via reproduction of results by other experiments than our theory counterparts’ work. 
Is it possible that all of our previous experiments have had some sort of correlated systematic error in them? Unlikely, but yes. Is it more likely that this lattice calculation may be underestimating its errors? Much more likely. Another interesting option is that one of the theoretical calculations was actually done slightly wrong. My first guess would be the lattice result, since it’s newer, but both procedures are complicated, so it could be either."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a particle physicist (no longer working in the field, sadly), this is one of the more exciting results in a long time. Muon g-2 has been there, in some form of another for debate and model building, for many years (taken somewhat seriously for 15+?), waiting for better statistics and confirmation. At over 4 sigma this is much more compelling than it has ever been, and the best potential sign of new (non-Standard Model) physics.I&#39;m not current on what models people like to explain this result, but it has been factored in (or ignored if you didn&#39;t trust it) in particle physics model building and phenomenology for years. This result makes it much more serious and something I imagine all new physics models (say for dark matter or other collider predictions or tensions in data) will be using.Whether or not anything interesting is predicted, theoretically, from this remains to be seen. I don&#39;t know off hand if it signals anything in particular, as the big ideas, like supersymmetry, are a bit removed from current collider experiments and aren&#39;t necessarily tied to g-2 if I remember correctly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Switching to electric cars from ICE cars is continuing to do the wrong thing and make the wrong choices, but doing this wrong thing a bit better.It&#39;s still the same status quo, woefully terrible and unsustainable transportation model.Automobile oriented transportation doesn&#39;t scale, is a huge waste of resources, and perpetuates unsustainable, ultra expensive and resource intensive sprawling urban development patterns.In contrast more compact cities with bike lanes take CO2 intensive cars off the road, and less cars means less parking, which enables cheaper buildings with less CO2 intensive concrete parking lots. Wins all around.It&#39;s frustrating to see so called environmentalist politicians that go all in with big electric car mandates but can barely put any money toward active transportation and rebuilding our cities to be more space efficient and accordingly use less carbon.Remarkably former British Columbia Green Leader Andrew Weaver even got on twitter recently to oppose a Victoria area protected bike lane and got into all sorts of arguments with cyclists. Incredible to see an environmental leader do this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cycling is not only good for the environment, but for cities in general.During the last confinement, when car traffic completely stopped, I realised that cars are the single biggest reason why living in the city can be unpleasant. People may not realise it consciously, but when they move out of the city, what they are looking for is a place with not as much cars driving around.Cars destroy cities by making a vicious circle of making it unpleasant to live there, therefore enticing people to move to the suburbs and commute by car, which make the problem worse.Setting up biking infrastructure fixes this, because it reduces the room for cars used by commuters, while creating room for bicycles used by people living in the city.With less cars, you can make the city center where people work liveable. You can have offices mixed with housing and have people live close to their work place, further diminishing the need for cars.If you think that your city can&#39;t possibly be a good place to cycle because weather / hills / etc, you are probably mistaken. Electric bikes and the appropriate clothes make biking pleasant in most places. IF there are not too many cars and infrastructure for the bicycle of course, which is probably the thing you don&#39;t have"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Switching from gas to electric is something I can do all on my own.  Switching from gas car to cycling is something that would require major investments from my city and developers.Both are noble goals, but let&#39;s not let perfect be the enemy of good.  Switch to electric now, and also encourage new roads and new developments to be bike friendly, so that switching to a bike is something that will be viable in 20 or 30 years for most cities in America.Edit: To clarify, the investment I&#39;m referring to is rezoning entire cities and tearing down single family homes and replacing them with mixed use buildings to bring commercial spaces closer to residential spaces.  Most American cities have commercial centers and are then surrounded by residential, with very little mixing of the two.  For example the closest place for me to buy food is .75 mile away, but the closest supermarket is 1.5 miles and I have to cross two major roads and a Freeway to get there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting. First time I&#39;ve head of Wuffs. As someone that still uses C, this in particular sounds neat:(from https://github.com/google/wuffs#goals-and-non-goals)&#34;&#34;&#34; Wuffs&#39; goal is to produce software libraries that are as safe as Go or Rust, roughly speaking, but as fast as C, and that can be used anywhere C libraries are used.[...] Wuffs the Library is available as transpiled C code. Other C/C++ projects can use that library without requiring the Wuffs the Language toolchain. Those projects can use Wuffs the Library like using any other third party C library. &#34;&#34;&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My favorite part of the Wuffs github page has to be the definition it gives for Dependent Types&gt; ...Dependent types are a way to implement compile-time bounds checking, but they&#39;re not the only way, and there&#39;s more to programming languages than their type systems. Wuffs does not use dependent types.Wuffs looks really interesting! I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever even heard of a language that is designed to only be used in an auxiliary role along side another general purpose programming language!Edit: As pointed out below, scripting languages like Lua are used in an auxiliary role, but in a very different way! Wuffs is designed for use in the deepest most crucial parts of an app, where as scripting languages are typically GC&#39;d and used at the very highest levels, often times by animations, game designers, or even end users!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; decompressing the entire image all-at-once (into one large intermediate buffer) instead of one row at a time (into smaller, re-usable buffers). All-at-once requires more intermediate memory but allows substantially more of the image to be decoded in the zlib-decompressor’s fastest code paths.Mozilla&#39;s imagelib has a neat trick to gain performance while working with smaller memory buffers when you want to render the output image at a smaller resolution than it is encoded. They call it downscale-during-decode.So this library pulls zlib decompression into the decode loop. Imagelib on the other hand optimizes at the other end of the pipeline and pulls downscaling into the decode loop.imagelib&#39;s optimization has the advantage that it helps with both small images as long as they&#39;re not displayed pixel-exact and also makes decoding humungous images feasible without causing the browser to explode with OOMs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m probably going to make a few enemies with this opinion, but I think modern C++ is just an utterly broken mess of a language. They should have just stopped extending it after C++11.When I look at C++14 and later I can&#39;t help but throw my hands up, laugh and think who, except for a small circle of language academics, actually believes that all this new template crap syntax actually helps developers?Personally I judge code quality by a) Functionality (does it work, is it safe?), b) Readability c) Conciseness d) Performance and e) Extendibility, in this order, and I don&#39;t see how these new features in reality help move any of these meaningfully in the right direction.I know the intentions are good, and the argument is that &#34;it&#39;s intended for library developers&#34; but how much of a percentage is that vs. just regular app/backend devs? In reality what&#39;s going to happen is that inside every organization a group of developers with good intentions, a lack of experience and too much time will learn it all and then feel the urge to now &#34;put their new knowledge to improve the codebase&#34;, which generally just puts everyone else in pain and accomplishes exactly nothing.Meanwhile it&#39;s 2021 and C++ coders are still- Waiting for Cross-Platform standardized SIMD vector datatypes- Using nonstandard extensions, libraries or home-baked solutions to run computations in parallel on many cores or on different processors than the CPU- Debugging cross-platform code using couts, cerrs and printfs- Forced to use boost for even quite elementary operations on std::strings.Yes, some of these things are hard to fix and require collaboration among real people and real companies. And yes, it&#39;s a lot easier to bury your head in the soft academic sand and come up with some new interesting toy feature. It&#39;s like the committee has given up.Started coding C++ when I was 14 -- 22 years ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The #1 feature I currently want is the ability to do an implicit lambda capture of a structured binding, at least by reference. I appreciate there are interesting corner cases of like, bindings to bitfields: I simply don&#39;t need those corner cases solved... if it just supported a handful of the most obvious cases I would be so so so happy, and then they can spend the next decade arguing about how to solve it 99% (which I say as we know it won&#39;t be 100%... this is C++, where everything is some ridiculous epicycle over a previous failed feature :/).(edit:) OMG, I found this feature in the list!! (It was in the set of structured bindings changes instead of with the changes to lambda expressions, which I had immediately clanged through.) I need to figure out now what version of clang I need to use it (later edit: I don&#39;t think clang has it yet; but maybe soon?)... this is seriously going to change my life.https://oleksandrkvl.github.io/2021/04/02/cpp-20-overview.ht..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hope one day we can get a widely adopted C and C++ package manager. The friction involved in acquiring and using dependencies with odd build systems, etc. is one of the things I dislike about the language. I’m aware on Linux things are a bit easier, but if it were as easy as “npm install skia”, etc. everywhere, I think many people would use the language more.
 Rust has package management, but not the ecosystem yet. On the other hand, C/C++ has the ecosystem, but no standard way to easily draw from it."</p>

I don&#39;t have my head pinched by headphones for hours, and I can work in silence like I prefer. No coworkers interrupting me when I&#39;m in the zone.I&#39;ve saved between 8-10 hours per week in not commuting. Worse, I&#39;ve had bosses who enjoy flexing by having meetings promptly at 8am, where you have to leave extra early because you travel at peak rush hour.I don&#39;t have to keep up appearances when I&#39;m done with my work for the day or moment. If I&#39;m waiting for responses or reviews, I can veg out, watch Netflix or play a video game, while staying on top of my email and work load.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t believe it.I do believe that 34% of polled workers said they would quit rather than return to the office, but I do not believe even a majority of them would actually go follow through on that threat. Especially if you filter out high paid/high job-security developers and similar people who might have the financial security to do so.People, particularly Americans, are shackled to their jobs for many reasons and most people are risk-averse.Despite myself being pro-remote, I think that we will see a sizable return to office-centric work culture over the next few years. The office may (hopefully) end up looking or feeling a bit different as an outcome. All the stories about the &#34;end of the office&#34; are overblown.Once it again becomes beneficial for your career and/or social life to participate in office culture people will come crawling back. Not saying it&#39;s a good thing, but it&#39;s what will happen."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another recent Postgres-complaint post from one of the best engineers I&#39;ve worked with: https://blog.nelhage.com/post/some-opinionated-sql-takes/Quoting his conclusion:&gt; As for Postgres, I have enormous respect for it and its engineering and capabilities, but, for me, it’s just too damn operationally scary. In my experience it’s much worse than MySQL for operational footguns and performance cliffs, where using it slightly wrong can utterly tank your performance or availability. … Postgres is a fine choice, especially if you already have expertise using it on your team, but I’ve personally been burned too many times.He wrote that shortly after chasing down a gnarly bug caused by an obscure Django/Postgres crossover: https://buttondown.email/nelhage/archive/22ab771c-25b4-4cd9-...Personally, I&#39;d still opt for Postgres every time – the featureset is incredible, and while it may have scary footguns, it&#39;s better to have footguns than bugs – at least you can do something about them.Still, I absolutely wish the official Postgres docs did a better job outlining How Things Can Go Wrong, both in general and on the docs page for each given feature."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it’s worth mentioning that most of these problems only occur at a scale that only top 1% of companies will reach. I’ve been using PostgreSQL for over a decade without reaching any of the mentioned scaling-related problems.PostgreSQL is still the best general purpose database in my opinion, and you can then consider using something else for parts of your application if you have special needs. I’ve used Cassandra alongside PostgreSQL for massive write loads with great success."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My single biggest beef about PG is the lack of query planner hints.Unplanned query plan changes as data distribution shifts can and does cause queries to perform orders of magnitude worse. Queries that used to execute in milliseconds can start taking minutes without warning.Even the ability to freeze query plans would be useful, independent of query hints. In practice, I&#39;ve used CTEs to force query evaluation order. I&#39;ve considered implementing a query interceptor which converts comments into before/after per-connection settings tweaks, like turning off sequential scan (a big culprit for performance regressions, when PG decides to do a sequential scan of a big table rather than believe an inner join is actually sparse and will be a more effective filter)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Congratulations to the Django project and contributors on a big LTS release. And a huge thank you for the consistently excellent framework that so many have built their web dev careers on.I&#39;ll post this as a Show HN soon, but I&#39;ll mention it now as a soft-launch introduction. After a decade of using Django I started a project I always wanted to exist: backported security and bug fixes to old versions that the Django project has dropped support for.I&#39;ve seen many Django projects eventually get stuck on an old version as the team I&#39;m on is forced to defer upgrades in favor of commercial pressures and essential product delivery.So you can subscribe to https://www.codestasis.com/ to stay patched on your old version, removing the urgency to upgrade. Then unsubscribe when you&#39;re caught up.It&#39;s free for personal use and a paid subscription for businesses and organizations."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A couple thoughts on django as a long time user.  First, the good:- Django was the first framework i learned when learning to code.  It&#39;s documentation was amazing, and it made conceptualizing an MVC framework really easy.- Django&#39;s ORM is phenomenal for managing migrations of a relational database, especially postgres with stuff like jsonb.   I&#39;ve even included it in non-python projects, just to handle table migrations/rollbacks.- The huge ecosystem is amazing.  Great for rapid prototyping.  Plugins for all kinds of crazy stuff.Now the bad:- In some ways it feels like a relic of an earlier stage of python.  It&#39;s support of asyncio is spotty at best (running the orm in a thread executor not a good work around).- It&#39;s support for type enforcement with mypy is not great.   This is maybe my biggest issue with using it on large collaborative projects.- It doesn&#39;t play nicely with a lot of the rest of the python ecosystem.  Want to swap in SQLAlchemy?  Sorry, no dice.  Want to have nice swagger documentation?  Use django rest framework or you&#39;re out of luck (i know it can be done, but it&#39;s kind of messy).  So in short, it&#39;s a bit of a monolith.These days I tend to only use django for it&#39;s orm in situations where i want a quick ad hoc database for something, or for rapid prototyping.  If I&#39;m going to do a larger project in python, I&#39;d definitely go with FastAPI.  But still, gotta appreciate that it&#39;s there, and has been reliable/well maintained for more than a decade."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an awesome question. I hope someone has good strategies for you. Life should be spent doing the things you find worthwhile, and the fact is, not all of those things are monetizable.Given how esteem- and success driven HN as a platform is... you might not get too many ideas since I suppose people want to maintain their &#34;hireable&#34; status.Success and &#34;loving your job&#34; are more or less empty phrases unless you are actually a professional moving your field forward or learning a highly complex subject matter - or you own a stake in a company.Beyond that you are toiling, and if you like your job, it&#39;s glorious toiling like gardening (pleasing, but not important, but you love it, so it&#39;s great) or terrible toiling for living that eats your soul.I&#39;m basically in a job that is quite important for my org, I get compliments for good job, but I hate most aspects of my daily work since the tech stack is complex and fugly. I probably _appear_ motivated but I&#39;m just a neurotic who hates failing. If I didn&#39;t need to feed and house my family I would have moved to a lower paying position long ago that is intrinsically more motivating.Success and &#34;loving your job&#34; have nothing in common in my experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you want my advice, it is simply this: look for dysfunctional companies. They&#39;re easy to recognize, because they look like pretty much the opposite of those companies everybody really want to work at.Take everything you see from a website like Elastic[1] for example and invert it:- It should NOT be clear what the value proposition is.- The website should NOT adhere to modern design standards, or at least do so very poorly.- Bonus points for lots of unnecessary, buzz-heavy text that does not give any further indication of what the product/service offers.Just look for any remote developer job via linkedin or any other place recruiters frequent and just invert what seems to be a &#34;good&#34; job and look for that instead. Approach it with your current attitude (maybe not in the actual interview) and assume that you probably won&#39;t even want to add it to your resume.I think you won&#39;t have any problem finding a role where you can get away with this: how it will affect your mental health is another question, but that&#39;s for you to find out. If you ever want to bail out, you can just drop it and fill this gap period with something else in your resume, like whatever hobbies you were busy with.For the record, I think the incredulity in some of these responses is pretty hilarious. 99,9 % of companies do not care about your well being as a person, by choosing this attitude you&#39;re really just treating them the way they are already treating you: a disposable business partner that will be removed from the equation as soon as they are no longer beneficial for you.[1]: https://www.elastic.co/"</p>

To be fair though, the other guy was *really bad*. Like, couldn&#39;t even open IIS manager and restart a single website, bad.The pay is not fantastic / FAANG, but it does offer a decent salary in a mid/low cost of living area. Combined with my wife&#39;s salary we make more than enough.Also I get a free master&#39;s degree out of it. So that&#39;s awesome."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"There was a similar, much more terrifying, story was in the New Yorker about six months ago.An Iranian physicist, Sirous Asgari, visited some US universities. On his next entry into the US he was detailed by the FBI as he entered and handed a completely-invented indictment of numerous crimes, and they demanded that he become an informant.He refused, since the indictment was completely phony. The FBI, furious, ensured he was charged with everything under the sun.Even though the government lost its case against him (due to clear lies by the FBI), he was then thrown in an ICE jail, through utter Kafkaesque bureaucratic hand-offs. Had to endure near-prison revolts as the inmates tries to keep themselves free of Covid. A judge almost granted him release due to the dangers of getting ill, but then he caught Covid and nearly died, so his petition was rejected. He was finally swapped as part of a  prisoner-swap deal with Iran. And yet he seems to be persona-no-grata now in Iran, as the assumption is that he must now be working for the FBI.https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/09/21/the-man-who-re..."</p>

This was such a great find and can&#39;t thank you enough for helping ensure Private Pages is as secure as possible.This report helped uncover:- A bug in Openresty where `ngx.redirect` didn&#39;t handle unsafe characters [1]. While the fix is now in the latest version of Openresty, a quick patch was to build the URL safely before using it in the redirect.- You should check for case sensitivity when reading `__Host` prefixed cookies, and verify the values against your expected format. It&#39;s possible for both `__HOST-Foo` and `__Host-Foo` cookies to exist, and only the `__Host` prefix requires the `Secure` and `HttpOnly` attributes [2]. In our case we strip all cookies at the edge using Varnish (VCL) to ensure no user-supplied cookies make it to our origin, and now we also ignore any &#34;Secure&#34; cookies that don&#39;t appear to have been set by our servers.[1]: https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module/pull/1654[2]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Se..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I definitely agree with the article that it felt a bit like a betrayal. I&#39;ve pushed some friends and family to use it over Telegram despite significant usability issue, and now I see that instead of implementing some IMO basic features like proper message sync and easy backup when you get a new phone, they prefer to implement a... micropayment system? Based on some niche altcoin which doesn&#39;t even exist on mainstream exchanges?It goes beyond the usual issue with cryptocurrencies. Let&#39;s assume that they integrated with Bitcoin or Litecoin or some &#34;mainstream&#34; CC, would it still be a good idea? You can already send wallet addresses over signal if you care to do it.I&#39;m willing to give the Signal devs the benefit of the doubt and assume that they meant well and aren&#39;t actively trying to benefit from the move (even though I&#39;m not completely dismissing this possibility) but at the very least it&#39;s just showcases a very strange way to lead the project and prioritize issues. I can think of a dozen things out of the top that would do more to drive Signal adoption than integrating with some &#34;literally what?&#34; cryptocoin.This is going to drive the adoption of this niche cryptocoin, it&#39;s not going to do anything at all for Signal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article mirrors my feelings toward this announcement well. I spent a significant amount of time trying out different messaging apps and convincing my friends and family to move over from Telegram and WhatsApp. I used my reputation and their trust in my expertise.The whole blockchain industry is just too mixed with scams that I feel comfortable to have my non-tech relatives dealing with it. It&#39;s enough that I have to educate them on &#39;investments&#39; in random coins (it&#39;s gambling) and cure their FOMO regarding NFTs. Now the technology will be integrated into the messaging app that I endorsed, well-packed together with the smelly involvement of Moxie with the currency.What now?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Throwaway for obvious reasons.I interviewed at signal a while back, and none of their recent mishaps surprise me. At first, they had me talk to Brian Acton on the phone for about an hour, who seemed to think I was already getting an offer, and he was there to sell me on it. He was cool to talk to, so I didn&#39;t mind, but I was surprised at this level of confusion for a company that small.Next, I was given a lengthy take home project (which I was warned not to do in a language other than Java, because Moxie would reject candidates if they didn&#39;t pick a language he liked). After I finished it, they disappeared for a month.Apparently I passed. They said I was basically the only one out of 200 people they sent it to that did pass. I assumed this meant I would be getting an offer, but they then wanted me to do a full onsite. The &#34;onsite&#34; weirdly consisted of another take home, but shorter, and a live interview. After not hearing back again for a while, I got an email titled: &#34;Hello from Signal!&#34;. Great! I opened it, excited: it was a rejection.I tried to get feedback on why I was rejected but never heard back. The best thing I can come up with: in the system design interview, as a solution to a postgres node being overloaded, I didn&#39;t come up with the solution of having a SPOF redis node with a full key scan every 10 minutes acting as an intermediate data store before transferring to postgres. I was told this is how they actually do things.Take this with a grain of salt, since I&#39;m obviously still irked by the experience, but it&#39;s all true."</p>

Being able to take my laptop and go sit under a canopy in my back yard when the weather is nice, seeing my rabbits hopping around the yard, my cats avoiding the aggressive she-rabbit, hearing the birds, etc., while working, is just about as happy as I can be while also working on stuff that doesn&#39;t really matter much.As I begin to form my own company, one of my priorities is to allow my employees to have at least some of their time completely at their own discretion.  They choose when and where they work as long as they can attend some important anchor meetings (and obviously be productive).  And for the social aspect, weekend or week-long dev retreats are ideal.  4 hours of intense serious work, plus a couple of hours of colleague social interaction, and the rest left to the individual to spend however they like, is the kind of situation I would have not even been able to dream of when I was younger.And from a bean-counter owner perspective, do not underestimate the employee loyalty and overachievement motivation you can get by giving some nice free trips, nice free food, and quality equipment.Big companies lack this freedom to treat their creative talent not because they cannot afford it but because the people in charge tend to not be creative thinkers.  This is why most interesting things happen in smaller companies (and ultimately tend to get bought by the laggard big companies)."</p>

Most of what he describes are not normal office problems. Some of them are even health and safety violations. Working from home will only distance him from those problems, but it can’t fix an inherently broken company that doesn’t care about employees. He should be searching for another remote job ASAP"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been programming for a long, long time. Went to college for it when I was a pre-teen. The more and more I code the more I see it closer to something like music than something like engineering. Getting a little garage band together isn&#39;t hard. A couple years of practice and you and your friends can play at a little bar or at least at a high school shindig.The same is more or less true for programming. A simple stack of JS, HTML, and CSS is pretty easy to get going. And if you&#39;re content to make marketing sites for advertising companies or similar, then go nuts. That&#39;s your simple jam and you rock out on it as much as you like.Other people want to learn violin or weird keys or timings or cross rhythm. They want to woodshed some African drums and mix them into complex arrangements. And you know what? It is harder than playing a simple guitar for a simple song.We have the same thing with software, and once you&#39;ve put in the years you find a sort of series of specializations that make you stand out a bit more and get you a bit more money.So when people say &#34;programming is easy&#34; what they really mean is that it&#39;s easier than most people expect it will be for the financial incentives it provides. Compared to, say, structural engineering which takes four years of focussed study then a long period of practical understudy, software is easy and it pays more. Almost any structural engineer can become a data analyst or junior data scientist and make around double the salary within a year or two.Yes we&#39;ve all had the frustrating semicolon days, but there are highlights too. Fast feedback, ease of learning new technologies, ease of scaling to millions of customers. There are many advantages and I think they make up for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I said that the programming field is a fertile ground for beginners, and it is. But what’s fertile for grain is fertile for weeds too, even moreso. And we need to talk about these people, taking advantage of the fertile ground.Yikes. What a gross, self-congratulatory rant. The author tries to defend against the term &#34;gatekeeping&#34; by getting out ahead of it, but that doesn&#39;t change how deeply exclusionary the result is.It doesn&#39;t even stick to a specific complaint; it jumps around to different things that emotionally feel related in the author&#39;s mind but aren&#39;t actually. First we&#39;re talking about boot camps, then we&#39;re talking about how StackOverflow is &#34;the scariest thing that happened to the programming community in the past 10 years&#34;, then we&#39;re talking about &#34;diversity&#34; speakers at conferences riling up &#34;mobs&#34; in some kind of conspiracy against the author and people like him?Buried under all of this (literally, at the very end) is perhaps a poorly-executed attempt to tell beginners something of value, that it may not be easy now, but you can push through and it will get better. But I don&#39;t see any actual beginner reaching that part before getting discouraged by the rest into doubting whether they should be in this career field at all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why is this always discussed only in relation to programming? Is being a doctor hard? How about an architect? Lawyer? Welder? Car mechanic? Airline pilot? Are they all gatekeepers if they say their job is hard?There are different jobs labeled as programming, some easier, some harder.Where does this narrative come from that programming at all professional levels must be easy for everyone, else you are a gatekeeper? Is it anxiety about future automation and the idea that the only remaining jobs will be programming?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The comment from the article echos my own sentiments:&gt; Speaking solely as a person who is really into encrypted messaging, it terrifies me that they&#39;re going to take this really clean story of an encrypted messenger and mix it up with the nightmare of laws and regulations and vulnerability that is cryptocurrency.Moreover, there are three other points I&#39;d add:1. I don&#39;t like &#34;do everything&#34; apps like WeChat or Line. One of Signals strengths was UX that focused on it&#39;s core competency. Early in Signal&#39;s development they would add privacy features. Lately they have been adding social features. This, however, feels especially out of left field and likely to hurt the UX.2. This smells like dev resources will be spent building and maintaining something not related to messaging.3. I&#39;ve always had a &#34;don&#39;t let perfect be the enemy of good&#34; rationalization that gives Signal autonomy to grow a privacy centric messaging app despite the deficits (e.g lack of federation). In contrast, I personally associate &#34;crypto&#34; with &#34;scam&#34;. There have been so many shady ICOs and pump-dump schemes around crypto. This will taint the product for those of us who don&#39;t think of crypto currency as being anything more than pump-and-dump schemes and a way to buy dab rigs online."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are 250 million units of mobilecoin, and majority of them are owned by the founders. Only 37.5 million have been distributed. With current price ($65), they&#39;re worth $14B already. This makes the project a scam and impossible for it to work as a reliable money that holds value. Bitcoin had no pre-mine and has been fairly distributed from the start."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Long-time Signal user here, with a number of technical and non-technical friends, colleagues and acquaintances who also use it. I don&#39;t know who was asking for this. And I think it really dilutes Signal&#39;s message.I believe that everyone has a fundamental right to secure, private communication. Some people may hold the same belief for the right to transfer funds. I don&#39;t agree and I suspect many others feel the same. That tension alone makes this look like a bad decision to me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The problem I have always had when building elaborate home server setups is the &#34;set it and forget it&#34; nature of the systems I&#39;ve installed bites me in the ass.  Since it&#39;s not my full-time job to manage these systems, I&#39;m really not familiar with them the way I might be with the systems I manage at work.  These systems cruise along for years, and when something finally does go belly-up, I can&#39;t remember how I set it up in the first place.  Now I have a giant chore looming over me, ruining a perfectly good weekend.These days, I design everything for home with extreme simplicity coupled with detailed documentation on how I set things up.Docker has helped tremendously, since you can essentially use an out-of-the-box Linux distro with docker installed, and you don&#39;t really have to install anything else on the hardware.  Then if at all possible, I use standard docker images provided by the software developer with no modifications (maybe some small tweaks in a docker-compose file to map to local resources).Anyway, my advice is to keep the number of customizations to a bare minimum, minimize the number of moving parts in your home solutions, document everything you do (starting with installing the OS all the way through configuring your applications), capture as much of the configuration as you can in declarative formats (like docker compose files), back up all your data, and just as importantly, back up every single configuration file."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The diagram alone is more than enough of an argument to dissuade me from giving this a shot right now - it&#39;s simply too complicated and too much to manage for the amount of time I can dedicate to it.BUT - I&#39;m really thankful for people who keep posting and sharing these sorts of projects; they&#39;re the ones iterating the process for the rest of us who need something a bit more turn-key.I&#39;m excited to see this eventually result in something like the following:- Standard / Easy to update containerized setup.- Out of the box multi-location syncs (e.g. home, VPS, etc.)- Takes 5 minutes to configure/add new locationsI want this to be as easy as adding a new AP to my mesh wifi system at home: plug it in, open the app, name the AP, and click &#34;Done&#34;.(Edit - formatting)"</p>

1) Duck out isn’t a thing, just stop it.
2) Half the articles cited as examples of corporate abuse were later revealed to be mistakes by the user or easily avoidable pitfalls.
3) Self hosting still requires trust (software you’re running, DNS, domains, ISP, etc...) The line of who to trust and how far is a tough one to answer, even for the informed.How I solved it:
1) I use well vetted cloud services for things that are difficult/impossible to self host or have a low impact if lost. (Email, domains, github, etc...)
2) I self host things that are absolutely critical with cloud backups. (Files, Photos, code, notes, etc..)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; What is ThreadSanitizer?  ThreadSanitizer (TSan) is compile-time instrumentation to detect data races according to the C/C++ memory model on Linux. It is important to note that these data races are considered undefined behavior within the C/C++ specification.TSan, ASan, UBSan - if you are writing code and your toolchain supports these, you should use them.  Over the past 6-7+ years I&#39;ve used them, I have never seen a false positive (I&#39;m sure some have occasionally existed but they seem rare in practice).&gt; However, developers claimed on various occasions that a particular report must be a false positive. In all of these cases, it turned out that TSan was indeed right and the problem was just very subtle and hard to understand.Yes, I have seen this phenomenon!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Two pieces of information that I found interesting:* Rust had poor support for sanitizers (&#34;Rust, which has much less mature support for sanitizers)&#34;. Work was done to improve this, but it&#39;s not clear how well it works now - it would be worth a blog post in itself IMO. This was surprising, because at least I assumed that it works flawlessly thanks to clang.* Rust / C++ bridges are predictably problematic and weaken Rust&#39;s guarantees (&#34;races in C++ code being obfuscated by passing through Rust&#34;). 
This is the problem to solve for most companies working in a traditionally C and C++ oriented domain, as the C* code will dwarf the Rust code. Because of the shared memory space any problems in that code will be just as critical as if the entire code was unsafe. It would be quite awesome if Rust were able to isolate unsafe code not just at compile time, but also at runtime, by e.g. offering the option of executing the unsafe code in a separate address space. This would require some manual work for moving the data back and forth, but it could offer the tools to support such a work mode e.g. unsafe blocks could take parameters.I wish Mozilla would be more transparent about the absolutely normal and typical difficulties they must be encountering in a mixed code base. I have the feeling that there&#39;s plenty of them, but they don&#39;t want to emphasise them in order not to discourage Rust adoption."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Overall Rust appears to be fulfilling one of its original design goals: allowing us to write more concurrent code safely. Both WebRender and Stylo are very large and pervasively multi-threaded, but have had minimal threading issues. What issues we did find were mistakes in the implementations of low-level and explicitly unsafe multithreading abstractions — and those mistakes were simple to fix.&gt; This is in contrast to many of our C++ races, which often involved things being randomly accessed on different threads with unclear semantics, necessitating non-trivial refactorings of the code."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"While the result is a big relief, I think it&#39;s not as decisive as I&#39;m noticing some headlines (and commenters) are claiming.One of the big open questions is &#34;are APIs copyrightable?&#34; The court skirted that question, and instead focused on whether it was fair use:&gt; To decide no more than is necessary to resolve this case, the Court assumes for argument’s sake that the copied lines can be copyrighted, and focuses on whether Google’s use of those lines was a “fair use.”That said, this case does establish a precedent that if your copying of an API is primarily for purposes of matching an interface so that developers can reimplement it, you&#39;re in fair use territory:&gt; Google copied these lines not because of their creativity or beauty but because they would allow programmers to bring their skills to a new smartphone computing environment.I&#39;ll count that as a win, on balance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;Google  copied  approximately  11,500 lines of declaring  code from the API,  which amounts to virtually all the declaring  code needed to call up hundreds  of different tasks.   Those 11,500  lines, however, are only  0.4 percent of the entire  API at issue, which consists  of 2.86 million total lines.  In considering “the amount and substantiality of the portion  used” in  this case, the 11,500 lines of code should be viewed as one small part of the  considerably  greater whole.   As  part of an interface, the copied lines of code are inextricably bound to  other lines of code that  are  accessed by  programmers.   Google copied  these lines not because of their creativity or  beauty  but because they would allow programmers  to bring  their  skills to a new smartphone computing  environment.&#34;Sanity prevailed! This judgment could have had devastating consequences and turned software development into a copyright nightmare."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very sad. I found the perfect smartphone for me - the V20. It almost feels like a smartphone that happened by accident and will never return in its glorious form again. Dont know what else to use if it dies. Already have a spare Screen and its 4th Battery ready to be used.The second screen is just the perfect solution for having an allways on display without a real (and stupid) notch. I love this feature. Also knock to power on is super convenient. Battery is replacable. The Screen is super sharp. Its thin despite its very accessible inner parts. The amp and music quality is absolutely awesome. The camera is awesome as is the sound recording quality. The IR Blaster ist just super convenient. Also the FM-Radio is a very nice addition. The camera-app is just awesome and i have yet not managed to find something simmilar. Also i like the gallery app. And the sound recording app. Its also fast, has enough power still to this day. And the SD-Card Slot combined with the internal memory gives me 640GB Storage. Also Dual SIM is nice.Really it is such an awesome phone that im not sure how this phone happened in the first place. As each Smartphone does at least 2 things stupid or hase some dumb features no one asked for.Its allways the same with me - as soon as i find the absolute perfect hardware - its already legacy and nothing like it is buyable in the future ...The V20 is like the perfect tool. No stupid features only used for sales, no shortcuts, just a very nice package. Two things i would change: Cameras should never stick out and the volume buttons should be on the back like on the G4."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve appreciated LG&#39;s adventurous moves. The one I liked the most was LG Optimus 3D, which provided a naked-eye 3D display similar to that of Nintendo 3DS. The most recent LG Wing, I was hopeful.But LG also left a bad taste in my mouth. The last LG phone I used, Nexus 5X, died all of a sudden, but after months of despair, I could revive it using a freaking hair dryer.[1] Yeah, some of you who are well versed to soldering may not be surprised by this, but the fact that such a huge company makes such a minor mistake completely turned me down. My reaction might be irrational, but after the incident I could not get close to newer LG phones anymore.[1] https://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus6P/comments/66wsvq/this_might_..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I find most sad about this is that LG appears to be the only manufacturer who makes phones with both wireless charging and a headphone jack. Somehow these features seem to contradict themselfs for other manufacturers. Wireless charging is seen as a premium feature, while headphone jack is seen as a budget feature. I unfortunately have gotten so used to both that I don&#39;t want to give them up. I love my wired headphones and my phone is pretty much always at 80% (Battery limiter) since it always charges when I&#39;m at my desk. Right now I don&#39;t see a reason to upgrade my V30 but when that time comes I hope someone makes a similar phone (my biggest hope is Sony as they at least appear to be interested in headphones, now they just need to add wireless charging)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The reason why the Economist articles all read the same is that they go through a process called &#34;subbing&#34; or sub-editing by the same small group of editors who own the Economist&#39;s &#34;voice&#34;.I interned at the Economist one summer in college and wrote two articles for it - the published articles bore a small relationship to what I had submitted. The sub-editors seemed to be mostly George Smiley-type Oxford and Cambridge PhD&#39;s of a certain age with an eclectic range of expertises, as far as I recall."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In high school, there were two magazines I’d read regularly: The Atlantic had an absurdly inexpensive subscription price (I think it was $14 for 2 years at the time) and The Economist was...not inexpensive, so I’d just pick up a copy when I was fortunate enough to visit a bookstore that carried it.The Economist was the only magazine in my life I would regularly read cover to cover. Every article revealed something I didn’t know about the world, or about my own country, and the information was dense. Most articles were just a few paragraphs, so I didn’t have time to get bored before I’d move on to the next one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I respect the writing in the Economist. It&#39;s kept to a high standard and they put their cases well with evidence as the article here highlights. Even the times I don&#39;t agree with their position, I still respect it.I wonder how much it helps that their writers are anonymous and therefore less likely to go on personal flights of fancy or building an argumentative approach. It is perhaps puts the individual writer on the backfoot but makes the quality of the publication higher. Personally I think other sources would do well to consider this - frankly I would rather be a fan of an idea than a writer: the former seems reasonable the latter likely to vere into pointless worship. Plus it&#39;s much easier to switch to new ideas if they&#39;re superceded by better ones in due course."</p>

I’d be fine if they stopped at the scenery, but this quote is just outright misleading and makes it look like a paid hype piece:&gt; “All aircraft have been reviewed with professional pilots who have many hours flying these aircraft or test pilots from the manufacturers to make sure they are controlled exactly like they should.” … In other words, when sim-pilots try to yank-and-bank an A320, they will get the exact same response as if they were flying the real thing.For contrast read some takes by professional pilots, here’s one[0]:&gt; I’ll confess that I don’t know that type of modelling FS2020 is using. But given how it feels, and how it’s the child of FSX, I’m inclined to think it’s using a lookup table. This isn’t necessarily a problem — a good lookup table with many data points could be just as good, if not better than, a blade-element model. Unfortunately, FS2020 doesn’t seem to have a good lookup table. The the linear behaviour unrealistic and the non-linear modelling is terrible.&gt; Maneuvering is laughably easy — and not because the aircraft handles nicely. It’s easy because the aircraft feels like it has no inertia. Yes, the real plane is very maneuverable and responsive, but there’s a “weight” to direction changes which is completely missing. In FS2020, you can instantly pull 60 degree or more turns, and exit them just as quickly. In XP11, there’s a residual tendency to turn that you have to arrest when exiting a maneuver.If you care about how the world looks, get MSFS. If you care about the physics of flying, get X-Plane—it’s an excellent project developed by a smaller company and sold for a fraction of the cost of Microsoft’s product. XP strives to provide the actual fine-grained simulation of flight surface behavior based on weight, shape, etc. (Yes, this means your computer will spend most of its resources simulating rather than painting a pretty picture.)If I had to draw a parallel, X-Plane is more or less the iRacing of flight sims, while MSFS2020 is closer to something like F1 2019.[0] https://medium.com/swlh/microsoft-flight-simulator-2020-no-c...Bias statement: I own a copy of XP11, otherwise not affiliated."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Netflix recorded a worldwide income tax accounting expense of about 13.7% last year ($438M on $3.2B of Net Income). It also paid cash taxes of $292M (cash taxes differ from accounting taxes because of timing issues - just like revenue is not the same as cash-in).A lot of growing companies have US taxes that are quite low because they lose money for a long time while they&#39;re investing in growth. When they finally become profitable, they&#39;re allowed to roll forward those losses (within limits) to offset their profits. That&#39;s where a lot of these &#34;Zero taxes paid&#34; headlines come from.On the other hand there is a legitimate gripe about using IP offshoring to shift profits to low-tax countries and out of the US, using accelerated depreciation to decrease current year profits, allowing tax deductibility of interest and lots and lots of tax deferrals and deductions for property transactions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is crazy how economy is tilted in favour of these big corporations. If you are a worker, it is not uncommon to pay over 40% of tax and if you work on your own small business you can pay even more and have very little left to reinvest. Then you have progressive tax that is preventing you from saving much - if you want to save for a deposit to buy a house, spend time on education and getting a better job, you&#39;ll get hit by much higher tax and it will take ages to save anything. Such taxes are often sold to the public as taxes on the rich, but rich people can easily afford ways around it. 
I&#39;ll vote for any party that will reshuffle the tax system, so that big corporations will have to pay tax just as any other business and tax progression will be removed, so that people will have a chance of levelling up.
They should also add a tax on spending money with offshore cards, dividends and so on so that the rich will pay what they are supposed to pay."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Among the mechanisms Netflix is using to achieve its next-to-nothing tax liability are accelerated depreciation (which appears to have cut the company’s tax expense by $148 million); deductions for stock options for Netflix executives and other employees ($339 million); and research and development tax credits ($113 million).These are straightforward deductions."</p>

So, while it&#39;s correct to say that it listens to TCP port 5432, there is a very narrow limit to whom it&#39;s listening for. Namely, the same machine.Postgres is pretty secure by default. It doesn&#39;t allow external connections. It also requires a username and password to connect with permissions on the database you&#39;re connecting to.Compare that to something like redis. They at least used to listen for connections external by default and not even have a password to connect.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I personally secure my postgres instances by putting them in a silod vpc without internet access. I then limit incoming connections to only be allowed from the separate vpc containing the application serverI then use a bastion host when I need to access ssh on the instance. The bastion host remains off and inaccessible except for when I need to perform maintenance.The advantages of this is that there is no &#34;always-open&#34; access to the instance.Not sure why the author does not advocate this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Link with a bit more actual information: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5...As far as I can tell, what&#39;s going on here is that there are multiple stages of antibody development.  People have circulating B cells, and these cells have their genomes modified by the the VD(J) recombination process [0] from the  genome in the human germline (i.e. what your germline cells and most of the non-B cells in your body have).  There are a large number, but nowhere near infinite number, of B cells and corresponding antibodies that can be produced in this process, and I think these are what the authors call &#34;germline&#34; cells.Once a naive B cell decides that it encodes a useful antibody (which is a complicated process), it starts to divide.  Some of the daughter cells further mutate in a process called affinity maturation [1] to produce what are hopefully even better antibodies.I think that the idea behind this research is that there are certain antibodies that can be produced by affinity maturation that are very useful against HIV, but that the &#34;germline&#34; B cells that lead to these antibodies are not particularly likely to be selected by the immune system when exposed to natural HIV antigens.  Instead, the researchers have developed customized antigens intended to target specific germline cells which are known to be able to mature into cells that can produce the desired antibodies.  If this works, the next step would be a series of additional vaccines (which are not the same as dose 1) that will try to encourage maturation into the useful antibodies.The takeaway is that this result is very promising and that there is (so far?) no reason to expect the trial participants to be immune to HIV.For the ML crowd, another way to think about this is that, when your body is exposed to an antigen, it runs a massively parallel search algorithm to find good antibodies in a truly massive space of possible antibodies.  Unfortunately, most people, when exposed to real HIV or to prior vaccine attempts, get stuck in a bunch of not-fantastic local minima.  The idea is to specifically aim the search in the right direction so, after a few rounds, it can find a better solution.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V(D)J_recombination[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_maturation"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interested to hear from people in the know: how good does this look?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From NPR interviews I listened to during the early days of the mRNA vaccines showing incredible promise, I understood that one of the problems with HIV is that the human body does not naturally have strong defense mechanisms (antibodies, etc) for this type of virus.  Hence, the usual vaccine path (or mRNA derived method) of accelerating the learning of the body&#39;s T-cells, etc. to manufacture its own defenses is not very effective -- they are not there to begin with.Is that not correct?  What are they doing differently here?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is something really pleasing about reading PDFs. It’s perhaps how static it is and it won’t change on me. I can zoom in or “operate” on it without some reorganization. It puts the mind to ease. There is no reflowing. There is no columns shifting. It’s just is. Like a piece of paper as an analog - the intent of the author and the designer is retained and frozen in time. Fonts are embedded and chosen by the creator. Haters of PDFs do not understand the human aspects of it - they just see it as a specification (which is convoluted)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love &#34;printing&#34; webpages to PDF files. I&#39;ve been doing this for more than 15 years. I delete most of the images first so that I end up with files of 50-500KB. I then store said file in appropriate labeled directories.Now 15 years later I have a private stash of websites and wikipedia articles that I can consult by simply pressing command+spacebar (the files are indexed in MacOS search).To make a PDF file out of a website I currently use Printfriendly.com, but it wasn&#39;t always this way.Back in the days I loved to use Arc90&#39;s Readability (a firefox extension). I don&#39;t know what happend to that extension though, there are plenty of old HN articles about that Wonderfull plug-in though:Post from 2010, probably I started using it right after finding this post...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What upsets and concerns me the most is when I see poorly developed SPA on really important sites.  For example, government service application websites.  If reddit or nytimes has a bloated, intermittently failing SPA site, that&#39;s an annoyance.  When it&#39;s a form to apply for unemployment, ACA health care, DMV, or other critical services, it&#39;s a critical failure.  Especially since these services are most often used by exactly the population most impacted by bloated SPA (they tend to have slow or unreliable internet and slow computers, maybe even a cheap android phone is all they have).Such sites should be using minimal or no JS.  These aren&#39;t meant to be pretty interactive sites, they need to be solid bulletproof sites so people can get critical services.  And I haven&#39;t even mentioned how SPA sites often lack any accessibility features (which is so much easier to implement if sticking to standard HTML+CSS and no/minimal JS)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d like to add a bit more nuance. Modern frontend development provides many opportunities for failure. These failures often make their way into production. I, personally, get great results with modern FE development. My users are happy. I am happy. It&#39;s all very successful. All the defenders of modern FE development will likely chime in with the same sentiment. I also get great results with C, which arguably provides even more catastrophic opportunities for failure. I wouldn&#39;t say &#34;C is a failure&#34;, but I absolutely hate working in C, and I&#39;m glad we&#39;ve made improvements to systems programming. I think the point I&#39;m moving toward is that we absolutely should strive to make better tools for delivering web content, but the reasons for failure are far more complex than the tooling itself. So, let&#39;s not frame things in black and white and call something that&#39;s been used with large amounts of success a failure. That&#39;s not very productive and is just flame bait. The real question is, &#34;What&#39;s next?&#34;, how are we going to improve the current situation?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regardless of my tweet, that is a personal opinion based on my feelings, background and experiences, the discussions in the replies are interesting from the POV of understanding what different people think in the programming community. Some will say that critiques are only from old people, in the style &#34;when I was young we had only zeroes! You now have ones and zeroes&#34;. Others say that the web is slow because of ADs and trackers and modern frameworks would otherwise be fast. There is who believes that the problem comes from big companies imposing new standards in order to turn the web into the new Java applets (a full fledged application platform), and so forth."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"You get great insight into the character of the leaders of a company watching how breaches are handled.  Companies that put the customer first are transparent, and quickly take action (even if painful to customers) to ensure that customers’ data and systems stay intact and confidential.  Companies that try to gloss over, hide or downplay things indicate that the leadership does not respect their customers and is only interested in maximizing profit/minimizing loss."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"“Sick building syndrome” is a difficult topic to discuss because it’s very difficult to prove a connection between the vague symptoms and the building. In many cases, only a single person seems susceptible to the claimed building issues. In this case, the apartment complex appears to have over 1,800 units, which makes it surprising that only a single person is experiencing such dramatic effects.Unfortunately, doubting these people’s stories is taboo online so I’m going to tread carefully. However, when only 1 unit out of 1800 apartments (presumably 2000-3000 total residents considering multi-bedroom units) is experiencing severe and dramatic symptoms, my first guess would not be the soil under the foundation. I would be looking for building materials or chemical spills in that specific apartment unit.Also, I’m not suggesting that we discount this person’s story. Their symptoms are certainly very real in that they are suffering, but the selfie of the person wearing medical equipment in front of a mirror combined with measurements from consumer devices as evidence should be approached with caution. There is a relatively new phenomenon casually known as Munchausen by Internet where some patients are drawn to the increasing attention they can garner by sharing, and unfortunately exaggerating, their stories on the internet. These patients often post selfies of themselves wearing medical equipment, in doctor’s offices, or in hospital beds. More commonly, typical patients prefer not to be photographed with medical equipment or in medical facilities.  Again, I’m not suggesting we disbelieve this person, but it’s important that we consider the bigger picture (1800 unit apartment complex, apparently only one case of severe symptoms?) before accepting a single person’s analysis of what is causing her issues.Mistaken “sick building syndrome” diagnoses can actually be very detrimental to patients who mistake other illnesses as being caused by their buildings, as they hyperfocus on their presumed explanation to the exclusion of following more typical diagnostic work ups that would help them eliminate more common explanations for those symptoms."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some years back I signed a lease in a luxury apartment hi-rise in downtown Chicago. The complex had been an add-on to an existing shopping center and mall. Long story short, the apartment smelled like old grease and trash often, and I could never trace the exact source as it would come and go.
No matter how many air filtration units I installed, or odor absorbing devices, the odors would still collect and infiltrate my clothing and furniture. Again, it wasn&#39;t constant but regular enough for me not to stay there very often.I ended up caulking the entire apartment with clear caulk and sealing any air gaps. Because the hi-rise was pressurized like most hi-rises, I concluded somehow this was drawing up smells from grease traps etc. Of course I could never prove it.My conclusion is that most of these buildings are so cheaply and poorly made that I will never again rent a unit like this. Too bad I spent 30k on the lease and hardly ever stayed there.  So the woman&#39;s experience seems pretty plausible to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most people here seem concerned about vocs. Plastics, carpets, sofas, paints, air fresheners and a ton of other typical household items produce them.I feel like the author is really jumping the gun here in identifying the source of pollutants by not seeking to consider the fact that new apartments are loaded with freshly off-gassing materials.The other thing that should have been mentioned is more about their vitals prior to moving in. How confident was she in her baseline because it could be a preexisting condition that became very exacerbated.Edit: But that said, my opinion of the Irvine company is extremely low. I’d not be the least bit surprised if they willfully cut every corner they could. Either with remediation or materials in the apartment. And pollutants do pool overnight but near freeways they are typically the worst in the dawn hours. There would be less air exchange in the apartment, leading to a buildup from an external or internal source."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve never been an FB &#34;person&#34;, but maybe 6-7 years ago the local running club moved to scheduling everything on FB.  For a while, the page was &#34;public&#34;, but then you had to have an account (which required a phone number) to see anything other than the club&#39;s &#34;landing page&#34;.  So I ended up making an FB account which I&#39;ve only ever used to be able to see the club pages (I haven&#39;t ever posted anything!) -- dumb of me I know, but FB had almost become a requirement to participate in life.However recently, I&#39;ve noticed that I now get a couple of junk text every day or two whereas up until a few weeks ago, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever had a single junk text.I wonder if this is why."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a good discussion on this by Troy Hunt[1].&gt; But for spam based on using phone number alone, it&#39;s gold. Not just SMS, there are heaps of services that just require a phone number these days and now there&#39;s hundreds of millions of them conveniently categorised by country with nice mail merge fields like name and gender.[2]&gt; Another general observation on this incident: I&#39;m seeing extensive sharing of the data, both the entire corpus of countries and individual country files. Not just in hacking circles, but very broadly on social media too. This data is everywhere already.[3]&gt; New breach: Facebook had 2.5M addresses exposed in an incident that impacted 533M subscribers&#39; phone numbers. Most records contained name and gender, many also included DoB, location, relationship status and employer. 65% were already in @haveibeenpwned[4]&gt; If we look at the data, email is rare, DoB is rare so the greatest impact here is the phone numbers. Even though it’s “only” 20% of FB users, the number is obviously substantial thus so is the impact[5][1]: https://twitter.com/troyhunt[2]: https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1378485999781613569[3]: https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1378513457209696256[4]: https://twitter.com/haveibeenpwned/status/137855490210063565...[5]: https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1378474534760685568"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi, I&#39;m the tech lead of Cloudflare Workers.This article contains several misunderstandings.If a Cloudflare customer has configured their origin server to respond only to Cloudflare IPs, then they MUST also verify that the &#34;Host&#34; header on any request actually matches their domain name. If they do not verify the Host header, then anyone can sign up for Cloudflare and simply configure their DNS to point to the victim&#39;s origin IP address, and requests will be routed there -- but will have the attacker&#39;s domain in the Host header. Workers is not needed for such an attack. This attack has always been possible and is common to basically all CDNs. Fundamentally, the CDN has no way of knowing if the origin server that a user has configured really belongs to them -- the CDN can only tell the origin (via the Host header) what customer it thinks it is serving, and expect the origin not to accept requests that were on behalf of a different customer.Instead of IP-based authentication, we strongly recommend using mTLS-based authenticated origin pulls (with a zone-specific key pair) or Argo Tunnel, as these methods are much more secure.As long as the origin server is verifying via one of the above means (IP+host header, AOP, or Argo Tunnel) that the request was processed by Cloudflare on behalf of the customer&#39;s zone, then the attack described in the article doesn&#39;t accomplish anything. If a Worker makes a request to a hostname that is on Cloudflare, then all of the target host&#39;s Cloudflare security settings will apply to that request the same as if the request came from an external client.Additionally, as mentioned in the article, any requests coming from a Worker will have the CF-Worker header identifying the zone which sent the request. If a customer suspects abusive requests coming from Workers, they should report it to us.~~The article claims that the X-Forwarded-For header can be forged, but this is not true if the target host is itself a Cloudflare customer.~~EDIT: What I said about X-Forwarded-For seems to be incorrect. CF-Connecting-IP has always been the header we use to identify the client IP, and it cannot be forged. X-Forwarded-For seems to have more complicated and subtle behavior that I&#39;m not familiar with. I&#39;m investigating."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s a nice trick, with some automation you should be able to register new domain names and Cloudflare accounts to get past the 100k limit as well.Cloudflare&#39;s anti bot tooling is terribly annoying while using Tor. I understand why they do it, though. Using Tor is a good way to show how terrifyingly much control Cloudflare has over the internet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; As you can see, X-FORWARDED-FOR can be set to an arbitrary value, so you can bypass IP limitation requests during scrapping or more dangerous IP verification during a login procedure … The origin IP is not forwarded to the website, so the only way to block this kind of request on your server is to filter on CF-WORKER header.X-Forwarded-For should always be treated as forged at least for security purposes (except the hops set by reverse proxies under your control). If you do IP whitelisting based on untrusted X-Forwarded-For you’re doing it terribly wrong."</p>
