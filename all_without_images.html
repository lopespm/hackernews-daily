								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I believe this has been Microsoft&#39;s guidance as far back as 2016, with the caveat of using Azure AD risk analysis /MFA.[1]&gt;Password expiration policies do more harm than good, because these policies drive users to very
predictable passwords composed of sequential words and numbers which are closely related to each
other (that is, the next password can be predicted based on the previous password). Password change
offers no containment benefits cyber criminals almost always use credentials as soon as they
compromise them.&gt;Mandated password changes are a long-standing security practice, but current research strongly
indicates that password expiration has a negative effect. Experiments have shown that users do not
choose a new independent password; rather, they choose an update of the old one. There is evidence to
suggest that users who are required to change their passwords frequently select weaker passwords to
begin with and then change them in predictable ways that attackers can guess easily.&gt;One study at the University of North Carolina found that 17% of new passwords could be guessed given
the old one in at most 5 tries, and almost 50% in a few seconds of un-throttled guessing. Furthermore,
cyber criminals generally exploit stolen passwords immediately.[1]https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Agreed - there&#39;s so much I find frustrating about how companies manage passwords in addition to mandatory changing.- Maximum length requirements (often secret until you try to put a password in)- Requiring some symbols, but not others- Silent truncation of the the password without telling you- Failure because the password is too long, but the error says something else (like missing symbol)This isn&#39;t just small unknown companies either. If you use a password longer than 32chars in Zoom when creating your account it just truncates the remaining without telling you. Login works on the websites, but if you try to login via the client it fails. If I manually backspace to 32chars it works. I tried to tell it to their US Twitter support and they just kept sending me a password reset link so I gave up (they&#39;re a bad company anyway [0]). Tmobile&#39;s website used to do the same thing, except worse because it would truncate on creation but not on validation.How is this not standardized in some sane way?An old credit union I was part of in NY (SEFCU) mandated passwords with exactly 6 characters. When I complained about this I was told it was secure because they forced one of the characters to be a symbol.[0]: https://zalberico.com/essay/2020/06/13/zoom-in-china.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article kinda misses the reason why mandatory password changes existed in the first place -- unknown breaches. The idea was that if there was an undetected breach, the attacker would have a maximum of the mandatory password change to use credentials. You would still have mandatory password changes upon discovering a breach, which would reset the counter.  And the article wasn&#39;t very clear as to why this is no longer recommended, but when mandatory password changes are enforced, users tend to make new passwords which are trivial to crack if you have a known old password. So if there&#39;s an unknown (or even known) breach, users will tend to make a new password which an attacker can easily guess given the older known passwords, losing any benefit gained from mandatory password changes. And this is worse than not having mandatory password changes, because rare password changes (when a breach is discovered) don&#39;t put people into the habit of just iterating off of an old password."</p>

They’re so wrong, so fun and attention-grabbing, and somehow it makes sense.I’d really like to understand better how it is that we can decipher language so well. At least, it seems like we’re good at it. Why can I read that font or that calligraphy? It’s almost an abomination, haha. Yet my brain troops on, parsing and processing, turning those squiggles back into what it knows.Truly fascinating stuff. I also enjoy the back story here. Exploring written language as a kid was a lot of fun. I settled on a strange way of writing, not much unlike the runes on the inside of the ring in the LOTR movies, and it was entirely arbitrary and almost an artistic decision. Totally impractical. I still write like that to this day."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"That&#39;s very exciting!A nit:&gt;  For example, I have not encountered hardware for reading vertex attributes or uniform buffer objects. The OpenGL and Vulkan specifications assume dedicated hardware for each, so what’s the catch?That is not my understanding of those specs (as someone that&#39;s written graphics drivers). Uniform Buffer Objects are not a &#34;hardware&#34; thing. They&#39;re just a way to communicate uniforms faster than one uniform per API call. What happens on the backend is undefined by those specs and is not remotely tied to some hardware implementation. Vertex Attributes might have been a hardware thing long ago but. I&#39;m pretty sure there are older references but this 9yr old 2012 book already talks about GPUs that don&#39;t have hardware based vertex attributes.https://xeolabs.com/pdfs/OpenGLInsights.pdf chapter 21"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great work—I&#39;m glad to see this being tackled with such speed.From the Phoronix comments on this post[0]:&gt; I have an idea. Why not support exclusively Vulkan, and then do the rest using Zink (that keeps getting faster and faster)?&gt; This way you could finish the driver in one year or two.(For context: Zink is an OpenGL to Vulkan translator integrated into Mesa)I had the same thought in my mind—Zink is 95% the speed of Intel&#39;s OpenGL driver[1], so why not completely ignore anything but Vulkan? On the Windows side, dxvk (DirectX to Vulkan) already is much faster (in most cases) than Microsoft&#39;s DX9-11 implementation, so it&#39;s completely feasible that Zink could become faster than most vendors&#39; OpenGL implementation.I have no knowledge of low-level graphics, so I don&#39;t know the ease of implementing the two APIs. I could envision, however, that because this GPU was never designed for OpenGL, there may be some small optimizations that could be made if Vulkan was skipped.[0]: https://www.phoronix.com/forums/forum/phoronix/latest-phoron...[1]: https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Zink-95-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So there are two issues with this:1. If I were looking to hire someone and read this, I would immediately be turned off. Why? Because part of being an engineer (or any employee really) is doing a bunch of stuff people don&#39;t enjoy doing. This includes:- Writing documentation- Writing tests- Fixing bugs- Talking to partners about a change/launch- Talking to lawyers- etcSo I would be wondering: if you&#39;re signaling you don&#39;t want to do those things, that means someone else will need to do all that for your code, which is not great for them and tends to be much worse.Like you&#39;re basically saying you want to cherrypick the parts you enjoy and not give a damn about anything else. You might say you&#39;re only costing $1/hour but the risk of a bad engineer can mean you&#39;re still expensive or a loss.2. You don&#39;t factor in the time cost of me or my team in onboarding you, dealing with you, dealing with your code and so on. That&#39;s a big part of the filtering in hiring. People are deciding if they can justify that time investment and the opportunity cost involved."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you expect the interesting work to land in your lap you are either one of those people that redefine (maybe invent) entire fields of research or you&#39;re incredibly lucky. In other words, your work speaks for itself and people want to give you more of it. For most people we need a job in order to keep up with the rising costs of living.If, however, you&#39;re like 99.99% of people and are good at what you do then you&#39;ll have to find what is interesting about the job. I&#39;ve worked at a company that replaced clipboards with iPads in a factory. If all it was to me was a form-builder application and the technology under it I would have been turned off ages ago. But I was incredibly curious as to why the product as successful and growing, what our customers liked about it, and I pushed for developers to visit the factories and see how people used the app. The results were quite surprising and it fed out team with dozens of ideas.Technology for technology&#39;s sake is fun for a while but will eventually bore you. It helps to have a reason to work on what you do. Which I think is part of what OP is saying but I think  you can find the reason in a &#34;boring&#34; job as well. You just have to be curious and look for it.Although avoiding working at feature factories where the developers are just cogs in a Kafka-esque Agile Machine is a whole other can of worms. The OP&#39;s strategy seems like an interesting way to avoid it. Best of luck!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been on the receiving end of similar requests before.“I’ll work for free or nothing if you let me do what I love under the umbrella of your organization because I love it so much.”I did one or two agreements like this and then stopped altogether. The individual would start their work, others would start to depend on its existence and the individual would leave in a matter or weeks or months because something else better came along for them. There was no incentive to keep the relationship going over a longer term. My organization just wasn’t setup to see any upside to short lived but high quality team members.Is there anyone out there who does work agreements like this currently and benefits from them? Would love to hear more details. Perhaps that feedback could help Franceso with his pitch.Franceso please come back in a week and let us know what kinds of offers you received. Will be very interested to see where this goes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As others have mentioned, Ian&#39;s knots has great reccommendations, but overlooked is the &#34;surgeon&#39;s knot&#34;.This one has two twists instead of the normal one, and comes out like a square knot if done right.  It won&#39;t come untied by itself, ever.  But you can untie it by tugging on the tails of the laces.  You can do this one with a thumb on the initial bend, unlike the &#34;bunny ears&#34; style knots.It&#39;s a hell of a lot better than the &#34;double knot&#34; your kids&#39; teachers will do if they go to school with any kind of single knot, square or not.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Apropos, some years ago I had written this blog post and Python program:Play the piano on your computer with Python:https://jugad2.blogspot.com/2013/04/play-piano-on-your-compu...The post got some interesting  comments with info about Western music theory, which I knew nothing about. And suggestions on how to improve the program to make calculation of note frequencies more accurate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a primer for music theory, this post doesn&#39;t teach much. It&#39;s using Python to derive various sets of notes in scales and modes, which is already easily available via google search, and in a more learnable format than Python code.The most basic aspect of Western music theory overlooked here is the relationship between tonic and dominant. If you know the &#34;home&#34; chord aka &#34;the I&#34; aka &#34;tonic&#34; is C major, the dominant will be G major, aka the V chord. Add just the F major chord, and you&#39;ll know 1-4-5 in a &#34;basic&#34; key: C major. 1-4-5 is the simplest chord progression, you can play amazing grace, you are my sunshine, even The Beatles, you&#39;ll be rocking with 1-4-5.Next level, if you add in the minor 6 (a minor) and minor 2 (d minor), you realistically know 95% of the chords you&#39;ll ever hear in C major pieces. And on the piano, this is ALL white notes, so even someone with zero musical knowledge can &#34;solo&#34; over your chords by just plunking any white notes while you play these chords (kids LOVE LOVE this btw, highly recommend trying with a kiddo).I wouldn&#39;t consider double-sharps and double-flats &#34;basic&#34; music theory. They really aren&#39;t needed for beginners, since they&#39;re relegated to keys like C# major where you&#39;ll occasionally sharpen a note like E# (aka F) into E## (aka F#). I didn&#39;t run into these until around 5 years into my piano training, playing Chopin&#39;s F# major nocturne Op 15 No 2, there&#39;s a bunch of double sharps in that piece.In any case, don&#39;t worry about double-flats and double-sharps or the precise notes of various modes and scales. Just learn pieces you enjoy, preferably with a mentor or teacher who can suggest improvements based on their trained ear."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It can be tricky to deal with the intersection of music and programming. For example:&gt; The chromatic scale is the easiest scale possibleSo far so good-- in both programming and music we&#39;re just stepping through the smallest values (half step for music, the integer &#34;1&#34; in programming). So &#34;easy&#34; definitely applies to both domains.&gt; We can generate a chromatic scale for any given key very easilyFor programming, sure-- you just find your offset and go to town.For music, however, this is a wrong warp. The chromatic scale is a special case of a symmetric scale which cannot be transposed. There&#39;s literally only one such scale-- each transposition brings you back to the same exact set of pitch classes.Figuring out what it means to have a chromatic scale &#34;for a given key&#34; is advanced music theory. In fact, I can only think of a few places where that makes sense:* studying the complex harmony of late-19th century Romantic music* studying the choice of accidentals in chromatic passages of Bach, Beethoven, etc. to infer the implied harmonyThose are important things, but they are definitely advanced concepts.Long story short for programming, the author moves logically from an array to stepping through an array. But in terms of music, they start with the simplest possible scale and then jump to a third year undergrad theory concept."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You&#39;ve discovered what many other people have: The cloud is the new time-share mainframe.Programming in the 1960s to 80s was like this too. You&#39;d develop some program in isolation, unable to properly run it. You &#34;submit&#34; it to the system, and it would be scheduled to run along with other workloads. You&#39;d get a printout of the results back hours later, or even tomorrow. Rinse and repeat.This work loop is incredibly inefficient, and was replaced by development that happened entirely locally on a workstation. This dramatically tightened the edit-compile-debug loop, down to seconds or at most minutes. Productivity skyrocketed, and most enterprises shifted the majority of their workload away from mainframes.Now, in the 2020s, mainframes are back! They&#39;re just called &#34;the cloud&#34; now, but not much of their essential nature has changed other than the vendor name.The cloud, just like mainframes:- Does not provide all-local workstations. The only full-fidelity platform is the shared server.- Is closed source. Only Amazon provides AWS. Only Microsoft provides Azure. Only Google provides GCP. You can&#39;t peer into their source code, it is all proprietary and even secret.- Has a poor debugging experience. Shared platforms can&#39;t generally allow &#34;invasive&#34; debugging for security reasons. Their sheer size and complexity will mean that your visibility will always be limited. You&#39;ll never been able to get a stack trace that crosses into the internal calls of the platform services like S3 or Lambda. Contrast this with typical debugging where you can even trace into the OS kernel if you so choose.- Are generally based on the &#34;print the logs out&#34; feedback mechanism, with all the usual issues of mainframes such as hours-long delays."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been in the AWS world for 4+ years now and my immediate feedback is don&#39;t run any local emulators. None!
Write unit tests for the internals and test your system end-to-end. I say that both because AWS services can have unpredictable behavior that you need to account for but also because local emulators are at best functional, but in reality far from emulating the AWS world on a 1:1 scale (especially the unpredictable behaviors i mentioned). So instead optimize for many local unit tests and many live end-to-end tests (implies many deployments and parallel environments prod, staging, dev, etc)When it comes to Lambdas, given the reasons above, there&#39;s only one thing that can improve the experience: PROXY. Before i went on parental leave i had the idea is creating a proxy lambda which can be configured with an IP and port number. That IP and port is for your local dev environment. This way, when developing you can instruct a live system to short-circuit and to proxy calls to a local lambda available om the respective port. Trigger end-to-end tests by invoking AWS services that will eventually call the proxy lambda, and then your local lambda with the same environment/context/input, reply with output which will reach the proxy lambda, which will output the same content forward."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Think of the history of data access strategies to come out of Microsoft. ODBC, RDO, DAO, ADO, OLEDB, now ADO.NET – All New! Are these technological imperatives? The result of an incompetent design group that needs to reinvent data access every goddamn year? (That’s probably it, actually.) But the end result is just cover fire. The competition has no choice but to spend all their time porting and keeping up, time that they can’t spend writing new features. Look closely at the software landscape. The companies that do well are the ones who rely least on big companies and don’t have to spend all their cycles catching up and reimplementing and fixing bugs that crop up only on Windows XP.&#34; - Fire And Motion, Joel on SoftwareIn my own work with serverless I think about this a lot. In my day job, we built a new service and we pay AWS a few dollars per month to run. It would have cost us around $100 a month in AWS costs. However, the operational complexity is extremely high and we are also coupled to another service via Kinesis. For a billion dollar business, the trade off doesn&#39;t seem worth it.I wonder how much of serverless is just AWS firing at Google (and Heroku, DO, etc) and other competitors. It certainly hasn&#39;t made my life as a developer easier. It&#39;s certainly much cheaper for some use cases but the complexity of the system goes up very quickly, and you&#39;re end up having to manage a lot of that complexity using an inferior tool like Cloud Formation (or Terraform)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;connect to an existing node&#34; is going to be amazing.I imagine two interesting uses for this.1. producing reports.  Connect a livebook session to your system in prod, run a livebook (which pulls data from DB eg), then get back a report.  User engagement, cloud resources consumed, p90s, or an incident report...2. manual database intervention.  Suppose you need to manually make a batch of changes to the DB.  It would be very cool if you could run a livebook inside of a sandboxed checkout (a temporary transaction) and write your db changes, then write your code that verifies that the db is in a state that you want it to be in.  If you mess up your code, then you just terminate the transaction without committing.  Then when you&#39;re happy with your notebook, you run it once with a commit at the end, and then save your notebook immutably in your records so that you can keep track of what you&#39;ve done.I think for intervening in prod, it would be very cool if someone could figure out how to extend erlang distribution over websockets so you don&#39;t have to figure out complicated mechanisms (open up ssh port, forward encrypted epmd, e.g.) to get into your system in prod"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, this is great.The fact is can connect to existing nodes also makes it can also be great for operation and administration - instead of building an awkward admin panel, you can just having a collection of scripts.The Elixir community is insanely productive. Also, the Elixir system is impressively pretty balanced - productivity-wise like Rails, concurrent-wise like Erlang, and continuously brings novel yet practical ideas to life in a robust manner!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Why is this bad? As the Electronic Frontier Foundation explains in their post “Google’s FLoC is a terrible idea“, placing people in groups based on their browsing habits is likely to facilitate employment, housing and other types of discrimination, as well as predatory targeting of unsophisticated consumers.All of this has been happening with tracking cookies, fingerprint tracking, pixel tracking and so on. And will continue to happen.I find it so bizarre it took Google to talk about phasing out 3rd party cookies and replacing it with a much lesser technology in the face of FLoC, for people to suddenly be all up in arms about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am hopeful that this will help get rid of FLoC but I worry about two things. One, this will end up being treated like the &#34;no track&#34; headers. That&#39;s just totally ignored after IE (was it IE?) enabled it be default. That gave all the trackers a reason to just ignore it and track everyone. I don&#39;t know if that exact same thing can happen here, but something similar maybe? The other thing I worry about is that FLoC 2.0 or whatever might replace it, will be worse.&#34;Kill it before it lays eggs.&#34; but do we worry about what evolves from this if it dies?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A comment in the WP post brings up the malicious nature of FLOC opt-out - it requires base layer changes to your site. Google knows from Samesite that it requires &#34;your app is going to break&#34; levels of urgency to get old sites to update, and can likely follow the dots to how an opt-out is much less likely to be used than an opt in.This feels like something that should get more attention/discussion. It flew for Samesite because &#34;better security defaults&#34; is a good argument. Not sure it works that way for FLOC.Despite being involved in the Samesite rollout I hadn&#39;t quite made the same connection as that commenter, as I am not as connected to the FLOC work."</p>

Now you have a &#34;sparse array&#34;.Now, you want to use this sparse array to represent a note in a song. So you need every note to consistently map to a distinct* sparse array.However, you also want to be able distinguish a note as being in one song or another. The representation should tell you not only that this is note A but note A in song X.How might you do that? Well some portion of the ON bits could be held consistent for every A note and some could be used to represent specific contexts.Stable and variable bits of you will.Now if you look at two representations of the note A from two songs you&#39;ll see they&#39;re different. How different are they? Well you could just count the bits they have in common or not, or you can treat them as vectors. (Lines in high dimensional space) Then you can calculate the angle between those two lines. As that angle increases its easier to distinguish the two lines. They won&#39;t ever get to full &#34;right angles&#34; between them because of the shared stable bits, but they can be more or less orthogonal.That&#39;s what&#39;s happening here. The brain is encoding notes in a way that it can both recognize A, but also recall it in different contexts.*But not perfectly consistent, we use sparse representations because the brain is noisy and it&#39;s more energy efficient. Pretty close is good enough in the brain and you can encode a lot of values in 1000 choose 20 options."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This really would have been harder for me to understand had I not taken linear and abstract algebra courses a few years ago. That area of maths reused common words like &#34;rotation&#34; but with more generalized definitions, which made it was jarring and confusing to hear and take in at the time. When someone said the word &#34;rotate&#34; my mind as if by reflex was already trying visualize a 3d or 2d rotation even when it made no sense for the problem at hand. Being an English speaker my whole life I thought I understood what a rotation was or could be but I didn&#39;t.Same goes for what&#39;s being alleged here: Is there even a way to visualize this that makes mathematical sense?
What will be the corollaries to this discovery simply as a result of what the mathematics of rotations will dictate?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel like I&#39;ve seen this cycle a few times now. Around the 2010-2013 time Firefox was pretty popular and the browser wars had cooled down a bit, various standards had progressed to the point where the web was mostly the same for Firefox users and Chrome users.Then Google Docs, Drive, Voice and a few other apps with the addition of Chromebooks started to appear and all of the sudden a few key features stopped working for Firefox. Probably the most important teachable moment was just how few features it takes to flip users.Maybe we&#39;ll see Firefox regain browser share are users dump Chrome. Edge even has a shot at this point - a strange irony bringing us full circle.I guess the real question is how long until we iterate on this loop again? What will compel users to jump back into the embrace of &lt;insert not yet but eventually evil company&gt; versus the relatively consistent arms of Mozilla.Also, FWIW, Mozilla isn&#39;t innocent either. Despite being very much _less scummy_ they have still upped their scum factor a bit over the years. Let&#39;s not forget they are quite happy to trade millions of dollars to make Google the homepage for their users. While nowhere near as egregious they have some tracking happening (&#34;experiments&#34;), they aggressively push their Firefox Accounts stuff, appear to be selling spots on the homepage tabs, etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For anyone actively managing investment portfolios, a deep understanding of the Kelley criterion is very important. For example, it is common practice to use &#34;Half Kelly&#34; to size positions, but most sources only provide a hand-wavey intuitive explanation. Thorp&#39;s paper[2] quantifies the benefits for any fraction of the &#34;full Kelly&#34; bet and its implications.  In addition to Poundstone&#39;s book [1] I strongly recommend Ed Thorp&#39;s highly readable paper[2].[1] Poundstone, William (2005), Fortune&#39;s Formula: The Untold Story of the Scientific Betting System That Beat the Casinos and Wall Street,

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many here are correct that the Kelly criterion is relatively useless compared to standard portfolio management techniques for a basket of assets.However... I will say that it&#39;s incredible useful when deciding on more high risk bets based on binary outcomes which is not something portfolio managers would dream of doing for their clients. Consider a long dated call spread on the SPY that goes out to 12/2023.Say you think the SPY will be over $600. Today, for $140 of risk, you stand to make $1,860 if you&#39;re right if you buy a $570 call and sell a $590.This is exactly what Kelly was made for.The proper strategy, IMO, is to find a comfortable allocation for trades of this sort as a portion of an overall portfolio (Say 1-2%), then of that percentage use Kelly to allocate capital to different bets of this nature to lower the variance.So sure, Kelly isn&#39;t useful for portfolio management writ large, but for managing a portfolio of binary trades, it&#39;s a useful metric."</p>

To the point where most everyone who worked there had always gotten one.And the one quarter, we didn&#39;t get the max bonus.  In fact, I don&#39;t think we got it all.

The product team can happily say &#34;they&#39;re handling that&#34;, and cut whatever corners are necessary to get their $25,000 bonus, not caring at all about the tickets the Customer Service Team will have to handle as a result of poor signal integrity, the weird bugs the Software Engineering Team will have to work around, and the terrible reviews caused by a computer that randomly flips bits in memory.Engineering is a discipline about balance, and I think the balance has to be done inside the team.  You need to make a conscious decision to trade off a lower BOM cost for more customer service tickets, and the team needs to own that decision and plan for the future under the constraints of that decision.  (Instead of sending out an order for capacitors, send out a req for more customer service.)  If there is someone in the &#34;out group&#34; that you can pass your concerns off to (i.e. that makes the cost of your balance decision cost 0 for you), then you&#39;ll never make the right balance for the product and company as a whole.  You&#39;ll just maximize for your own gain.  From there, you ship your org chart, the company becomes entirely about politics, and you&#39;re out of business... just like DEC apparently.(I guess I also want to comment on the article as a whole -- being bitter about too small a bonus.  Something similar happened to me and I sure was bitter about it.  I actually quit over it.  It all sounds very rational to me, knowing how humans work, and I can&#39;t believe management would do something so stupid.  It&#39;s the kind of thing that kills your company, and yup! it killed them!  If there is one constant in the field of engineering, it&#39;s that we forget the mistakes of the past much too quickly.  Except Therac-25, everyone remembers that one, but integer overflows are still killing people to this day.  Sigh!)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my last job I worked at a company that paid slightly below the market rate, not including the bonus. At the time I got the job, I didn&#39;t realise that I was already being significantly underpaid. I thought it was a bit low but didn&#39;t realise the extent of it. So when I got the new job, I was blown over by the huge jump in salary and couldn&#39;t be happier. What was better? I was entitled to receive each year up to a 10% bonus for just doing my job, 15% if I went above and beyond, or 20% if I was a &#34;role model&#34;.At the time, both the recruiter and my new manager explained to me that I should think of the 10% bonus as a baseline expected part of my salary &#34;you will always get this unless you are doing something egregiously wrong&#34;. This was indeed what everyone was told, and what management was told to tell people. Of course, this made me recalculate what I thought I was worth and it did in actual fact bring my salary up to roughly market rate.What the recruiter and my manager said was right. Come bonus time, I and almost everyone else in the company got their bonuses (apart from the people that did egregiously bad, and they saw it coming). In the second year I even qualified for 15% and when I got paid out I really felt that I had actually gotten a bonus. I was banking on 10%, but not 15%! I treated myself to something I&#39;d wanted for ages but could never justify.Then Covid hit, and suddenly upper upper upper management started signaling that bonuses might not be paid that year. Needless to say, absolutely everyone apart from the CFO was up in arms. Morale, which already wasn&#39;t amazing because of Covid, plunged even further and the number of &#34;hallway conversations&#34; increased significantly. People started to leave in larger numbers because the bonus was an expected part of their salary. Each year they waited expectantly to receive it, and if they weren&#39;t going to get it this year they would need to go and find a job that paid market rate as base salary. The thing that made this worse was that we were working at one of those few companies that actually did better during Covid. For better or worse, we sold a service that had an increased demand for Covid.By this time I was a manager, and we were told in a leadership meeting by our head of department where we were all vocally pissed, and were told that we had to pass the message on to the people we managed. Clearly, this is what had happened to him, and to his manager.The company didn&#39;t want to come out and say &#34;you aren&#39;t getting bonuses even though we&#39;re projected to do better&#34; presumably because it would provide a platform for people to ask why. Instead, they thought it would be better if it came from the direct line manager. Great idea except that we received the message from someone who at the same time said to us &#34;I can&#39;t imagine how they&#39;ll get away without giving bonuses&#34;. It just served to add to the feeling of being cheated.Anyway, they ended up actually paying the bonuses because the annual revenue figures had increased so much that it was basically impossible for them not to pay them. When we got them, we didn&#39;t feel happy that we had received a bonus, we just felt bitter that the company put us through hell for seemingly no reason.I no longer work at that company."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For background context around telecoms for anyone reading this, there is an underlying difference in how telecoms networks are designed and architected - in the Telco world, links between networks were predicated on trust. Originally, telecoms networks were run by national level quasi-government operators, one per country. You interconnected with other &#34;known entities&#34;.Even now, you likely have 3, 4 or 5 national mobile operators in any one country. They negotiate their own roaming agreements in order for you to get roaming access. It&#39;s all driven by these kinds of relationships predicated on trusting other networks.In IT, we are rapidly moving towards zero trust (due to the internet), but circuit switched (legacy) voice is still all designed to be sent over private circuits between operators who trust each other.The legacy protocols (see SS7), used to route calls between operators are functional, but also lack access control and authentication, as it&#39;s assumed only trusted parties are on the network and able to use them. Those assumptions are no longer valid, and there&#39;s a huge challenge in dealing with this - hence SMS and call interception and rerouting attacks to steal 2FA tokens etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My assumption is that all intelligence services in all countries would love to have access to fully compromised networks. They spend all their time thinking about how to access information, so they would be fairly incompetent not to consider this.Does that mean that all systems are compromised? No, because there are risks associated with tapping in to these systems. Partly it depends on if they have access to the systems, but mostly on the possible blow-back if they get caught.Example: Swedens FRA (NSA equivalent) could in theory ask Ericsson (a Swedish company), to install a backdoor. But, Sweden has a fairly free press, and there are good chances that someone would leak this information. If it got leaked it would be a major scandal that could go as far as toppling the government and destroy one of Swedens most important export companies. Its very risky, and its a risk no one wants to take, so the parts made in sweden are probably not compromised.China, on the other hand has almost no risks associated with adding backdoor. No free press, hard suppression of whistle blowers, and since most foreign intelligence services already assume the equipment is compromised, there is no real reputational damage either. I assume they are all compromised, why wouldn&#39;t they be?The US is somewhere in between.Sometimes companies are compromised by intelligence services, but much more often I think its employees. Why try to change Tim Cooks stance on privacy, when all you need to do is find one Apple employee, willing to take a sack of money to &#34;do their country a great service&#34;?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Since the early 2000s at least, most billing has been outsourced. This works by sending all Call Detail Records (CDRs) to a third party, often from Israel or China.This is quite misleadingly written: telcos are not shipping reams of CDRs to some cubicle farm in Haifa or Chongqing.Yes, almost every telco outsources its billing software to other companies, notably Amdocs (founded in Israel, now HQ&#39;s in the US).  However, billing info is some of the most sensitive data a telco has for both privacy and commercial reasons, so that software always runs in a closed environment from where it cannot dial home.  Historically that&#39;s been on-prem, it&#39;s slowly moving to the Cloud but even there it&#39;s going to be firewalled off very carefully."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some of these are probably fingerprinting but the Twitch one isn&#39;t (I worked on the video system at Twitch for a number of years).&#34;player-core-variant-....js&#34; is the Javascript video player and it uses WebGL as a way to guess what video format the browser can handle. A lot of the times mobile android devices will say &#34;I can play video X, Y, Z&#34; but when sent a bitstream of Y it fails to decode it. WebGL allows you to get a good indication of the supported hardware features which you can use to guess what the actual underlying hardware decoder is.This is sadly the state of a lot of &#34;lower end&#34; mobile SoCs. They will pretend to do anything but in reality it just... doesn&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sorry, but this is nonsense, as presented.There is zero evidence any of these are being used for fingerprinting, which is defined as building up an entire set of capabilities to uniquely identify a user.Essentially all of these seem to be attempting to identify the graphics card, and all of these could be related to feature detection for an embedded video player, for example. Feature detection is not fingerprinting.Fingerprinting is pretty easy to confirm, because it collects a large combination of data points (fonts installed, canvas rendering quirks, etc.) and either reports or hashes them all together. (That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s easy to find the code that does the fingerprinting, but once you&#39;ve found it it&#39;s quite obvious what it&#39;s doing.)It is deeply irresponsible and misleading of the author to claim fingerprinting without looking for that type of combination. And slapping &#34;No claims made about accuracy&#34; at the top of the page isn&#39;t an excuse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Author doesn&#39;t actually know what this information is being used for. Sure there can be a discussion about whether this information should be recorded at all (say, to determine if your site doesn&#39;t work on certain hardware), but claiming it _is_ fingerprinting is baseless."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love Squarespace. I find it to be as close to the perfect mix of flexibility, usability and beautiful defaults that I&#39;ve ever seen in a website builder. I can hand off management of the site to someone with almost zero technical skill (my 70 y/o father with almost no technical knowledge manages a Squarespace site I built him!) and when I look back in 2 years the site will still look pretty good and will still work on mobile. Chances of the site being hacked are much much lower than on Wordpress. Prices are reasonable. The layout engine is exactly what I want, it looks nice on all devices and can handle most layouts, which is a totally worthwhile tradeoff for the few times that something just doesn&#39;t quite look the way I want it to without custom css.I know people say this stuff:&#34;You can&#39;t transfer your site away&#34; - I know, but I can build a reasonable site in ~2 days, so the tradeoff is worth it and the sunk cost is lower&#34;But I want a fully custom design&#34; - Yeah, fair enough, there is a cap on the high end of design with it but I think that cap is pretty high, especially in 7.1&#34;But it is making the whole internet look the same!&#34; - Not really, between colors, photos and sections in 7.1 I just don&#39;t think this is true. If you use unsplash for all of your photos then maybe, but if you are doing that you are probably too small to care, worry about that when you hit 2MM in revenue&#34;But Wordpress is user friendly too&#34; - No it isn&#39;tAs I write these I think that maybe it is just the perfect thing for my subset of clients (SMB), so read this from that perspective.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For my use cases, Java has all the wrong compromises:- not high level enough to compete with Python/Ruby/JS/PHP, etc- not low level enough to compete with Rust/D/Nim/Zig- not specialized enough to compete with Erlang/R/Go/Julia- not opinionated enough to compete with Lisp/HaskellSo why use Java ? It&#39;s good, it&#39;s fast, it&#39;s productive, it&#39;s well supported, battle tested and documented for decades with a huge pool of devs. And many companies already use it and the tooling is excellent.But those are not sufficient reasons for me.Python is older than Java, well supported, battle tested, documented with a huge pool of devs. But it&#39;s way better for high level stuff, data mangling, scripting, gluing, and for most web dev stuff.If I want a distributed system or something with a lot of I/O, Erlang and Go will always be better than Java. Sure, they are less widespread, with all the stuff it implies, but for such a nice need, I will pay the price hapily: my goal is optimization for the use case. Same for stuff that needs to go fast or have a small footprint, I&#39;m not going Java if I can go Rust.If I want to have fun, Java is out of the loop. Better sharpen my inner weirdness by fighting with some exotic lisp. Why try productive ? I wanna enjoy myself, not run a business.So Java is not a bad choice. It&#39;s an excellent tech.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This post from &#34;an ignorant computer science undergrad&#34; is pretty silly, so allow me to get a little silly in response.I think if Java&#39;s new features are an attempt to woo new developers, Java comes off pretty tragically, like the old guy in the club, trying stay relevant by showing off how it just got up to date with ideas that hit the mainstream ten years ago.  Whoa, check out these record classes!  Fresh stuff over here!  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any significant audience for this (a few &#34;ignorant computer science undergrads&#34; aside,) and I doubt that&#39;s what Oracle is shooting for.I think what Java is really doing is reassuring people who committed to it long ago that it will take care of them.  Java is not the old guy in the club; it is the middle-aged guy dressing up and taking his wife out for a night (or half an hour, depending on her arthritis) of dancing at a jazz bar.  It&#39;s doing its honorable best to show the people who committed their lives to it that it understands they still need a little bit of excitement now and then, and they don&#39;t have to sacrifice their dignity to some cad at the bar at the country club to get it.They don&#39;t really want to leave Java.  Java understands things about them that nobody else ever will.  All Java needs to do to keep them is love them enough to keep doing its best."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The amount of vitriol Java receives in the game development space is rather strong. However, whenever people dismiss Java as being a bad language, I can&#39;t help but think of Minecraft.Yes, it&#39;s one of the few mainstream titles where Java has been successfully applied, but I believe Minecraft&#39;s success was specifically because it was written in Java.With no JVM, there would have been no Minecraft mods at the level of flexibility that Forge provides, and the game would probably have stagnated in comparison with the sheer amount of community content from the past ten years that&#39;s available. Being able to use libraries like ASM that allow you to transform the compiled bytecode in radical ways were possible only because Minecraft targeted a virtual machine. The incredible thing was that this was in spite of the obfuscation Mojang applied to the compiled source. If it was possible to create a flexible mod system at all thanks to the JVM, people were just too motivated for any deterrence to stop them.For the people who say that Minecraft should have been written in C++ or something from the start, because Java is a mediocre programming language, there&#39;s Bedrock Edition. Nobody I know cares about it enough to play it. For all its bloat and performance issues, the benefits of the JVM were simply too convincing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The title is slightly misleading, and so is Linus&#39; response here. This RFC never claimed to be in shape to be immediately mergeable into the mainline kernel as-is. Miguel (the author of the patch) has replied to this mail (and in other places in the thread) that the Rust alloc() is currently called only as a temporary measure to speed up development, and all panic() calls from allocation failures are just as temporary. This is all because the Rust code that hooks into the kernel memory allocation functions is not yet usable.The main point of this RFC is that &#34;the [in-kernel Rust] support is good enough that prototyping modules can start today.&#34; There&#39;s no point in making long arguments about alpha-quality design shortcuts on an alpha-quality prototype that are also explicitly mentioned by the patch authors to be of alpha quality.See e.g. https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/14/1130 and https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/14/1023EDIT: Thanks for the child comments; it seems that Linus is simply not aware of all the specifics and is asking for more information and/or decided to look at the code before reading the full mail thread."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I would love to see is Rust in the kernel, with a caveat. That caveat is something akin to Erlang&#39;s OTP supervision trees. Erlang has a similar philosophy to Rust in that if something erroneous happens the process fails. The difference is that Erlang OTP is designed to have supervisor processes of the worker processes. The only thing the supervisors do is monitor the processes under them and control when, if, and how those processes are restarted on failure or other conditions. The supervisors themselves have supervisors, right up to the root supervisor for each Erlang application.Rust got the language and the tooling perfect, but Erlang got the services and service infrastructure perfect.  The more I think about it the more I think I should shut up and put up. In other words, apply my knowledge of Erlang and OTP to create a gen_server in Rust as a jumping off point for a OTP like Rust framework, perhaps called OARS (Open Advanced Rust Services).  This is definitely bigger than one person. If you&#39;d like to join me on this journey then reply to this comment and I&#39;ll send you project details by the end of the weekend."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Aside from Linus&#39; reaction, there are some really interesting pearls in that thread, for example:Regarding code style[1]:&gt; The more you make it look like (Kernel) C, the easier it is for us C people to actually read. My eyes have been reading C for almost 30 years by now, they have a lexer built in the optical nerve; reading something that looks vaguely like C but is definitely not C is an utterly painful experience.&gt; You&#39;re asking to join us, not the other way around. I&#39;m fine in a world without Rust.CoC was already brought into battle[2]:&gt;&gt; I could be mistaken but you seem angry. Perhaps it wouldn&#39;t be a bad idea to read your own code of conduct, I don&#39;t think you need a browser for that either.&gt; Welcome to LKML. CoC does not forbid human emotions just yet. Deal with
it.These ([3] [4]) messages have an interesting perspective about maintenance.&gt; I&#39;m sure about one thing, the C bugs we have today will be
fixable in 20 years. I&#39;m not even sure the Rust code we&#39;ll merge today
will still be compilable in 10 years nor will support the relevant
architectures available by then, and probably this code will have to
be rewritten in C to become maintained again.Linus wants to see a real, working kernel driver instead of Android Binder[5]:&gt;Would there be some kind of real driver or something that people could
use as a example of a real piece of code that actually does something
meaningful?[1] https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/16/118[2] https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/16/143[3] https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/16/181[4] https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/16/283[5] https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/14/1091"</p>

You come along, with Google Chrome, and visit my site.
Google adds the fact that you visited my site to their massive dataset (as well as who-knows-what-else)
And to opt out of something I have never been asked to be involved with in any way, I need to contact Google and ask them to please leave my site alone?Am I understanding this shit correctly?Whether I like it or not, my site, by proxy, is participating in Google&#39;s data mining?If my guess is correct, how the actual fuck is this not illegal?Edit: Ok, I guess I&#39;m off the mark here with my assumptions so I&#39;ll put my pitchfork down.Google are just using your Chrome browsing data, matching it with site id&#39;s (or hashes?) and then analysing the shit out of it for their gain.As a website owner, nothing has changed other than I can tell them not to use my site as part of their analysis... that sound about right?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Has nobody bothered to read anything about FLoC?The purpose of this permission is to prevent embedded third-party content from using FLoC. Besides that it’s a no-op.FLoC does not track arbitrary websites, it tracks sites which retrieve the FLoC cohort via JS. So instead of dropping a unique third party cookie, and associating it with the data on the page, sites can now retrieve a k-anonymous cohort id and associate it with the data on the page. If you’re not doing that (or serving ads) there’s nothing you need to do.That’s not to say that FLoC doesn’t deserve criticism just that most criticism I’ve encountered is not grounded in reality."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is really huge news. Starship has in about 18 months gone from a Elon standing next to a steel grain silo duct-taped into the shape of a rocket, to all the eggs in NASA&#39;s moon basket. The thing I kept thinking - and I have to believe was considered within NASA - is given the rapid progress SpaceX has been making along with the delays in Congressional funding, SLS, BlueOrigin&#39;s other projects etc ... if NASA hadn&#39;t selected SpaceX there was at least some chance they&#39;d go ahead and do their own private Moon landing mission before NASA&#39;s, a massive egg-on-face moment.There are still major risks with the Starship program so I don&#39;t think anyone should be 100% confident they can pull this off, but the massive side benefit is if they do NASA will have proven out a generic system, fully reusable and with orbital refueling, that can with minimal modification cost-effectively send humans to Mars and much of the rest of the solar system as well. A Model T or 737 in space. The original Artemis plan never made much sense as a Mars &#34;proof-of-concept&#34;, but it actually does now.If at some point say 2025, NASA says to the President &#34;we can get the first human on Mars in 4 years for $15 billion&#34; I have to imagine any American president being eager to sign their name on that accomplishment and give the JFK speech, &#34;We choose to go to Mars in this decade, not because it is easy, but because it is hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win&#34;To me that&#39;s the real takeaway here: this is implicitly a huge NASA bet not just on the Moon, but Mars and the rest of the solar system. Finally."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The biggest news IMO is that there&#39;s only a single winner.   There was a lot of pressure to make Commercial Crew a sole contact to Boeing, and it now appears that Boeing is going to deliver Starliner two years later than SpaceX delivered Crew Dragon.  So going with two winners saved NASA&#39;s bacon.    It&#39;s surprising to see them only choose a single winner here.  Yes SpaceX may be considered a safe bet, but ten years ago it was Boeing who was considered the safe bet.   Things change over years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have to say, I am completely skeptical of Blue Origin&#39;s ability to do anything in a reasonable amount of time and that they will amount of anything but Bezo&#39;s hobby. At least until they change their approaches.That said, it&#39;s a very secretive firm with an unknown amount of progress.I&#39;ll believe in Blue Origin when I see it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The important parts:&gt; The Court ruled that when consumers created a new Google Account during the initial set-up process of their Android device, Google misrepresented that the ‘Location History’ setting was the only Google Account setting that affected whether Google collected, kept or used personally identifiable data about their location. In fact, another Google Account setting titled ‘Web &amp; App Activity’ also enabled Google to collect, store and use personally identifiable location data when it was turned on, and that setting was turned on by default.&gt; 
The Court also found that when consumers later accessed the ‘Location History’ setting on their Android device during the same time period to turn that setting off, they were also misled because Google did not inform them that by leaving the ‘Web &amp; App Activity’ setting switched on, Google would continue to collect, store and use their personally identifiable location data."</p>

And what&#39;s worse is that the federal governments don&#39;t even have any direct control over the app itself, they just bought access to the contact tracing data for 12 months from the company operating the app. Meanwhile the company controls the app and all connected user accounts and can repurpose it in whichever way they see fit (and they already announced they have plans for the app beyond the pandemic).It&#39;s absolutely mind-boggling to me how our government(s) can get the idea to &#34;rent&#34; contact tracing data from a private company like this, it just reeks of corruption. I wasn&#39;t a big fan of the Covid tracing app in the beginning, but in retrospect the concept of that app seems miles ahead of the current situation with the Luca app."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a hiring manager, the things that stand out to me in your post:- You said you quit a job at EA, quit a job at IBM, dropped out of college your freshman year. You may have valid reasons for leaving each of these, but you have to see this from the manager&#39;s perspective: You had 3 different great opportunities that all came to a dead end at the beginning of your career. You need an alternate narrative.- You talk about applying to Google, Facebook, Airbnb, Palantir, and other companies known to be very competitive, yet the only real job experience you list in your post is low level customer support. Nothing wrong with aiming high, but you need to also be applying to jobs that are a logical next step in your career. It&#39;s extraordinarily difficult to jump from customer support to FAANG engineer, so have a backup plan.- You spoofed e-mails to manipulate executives into meetings. This kind of thing sounds clever in movies or from anecdotes in the 90s or 2000s, but in this era everyone is on high alert for phishing attacks and security breaches. Read the room, and don&#39;t commit computer fraud during your application process. Big companies have systems in place to catch these things and you&#39;ll get blocked in short order.- No mention of your network. Do you have any contacts or friends or acquaintances anywhere in the industry? Even people you knew briefly from school? People who you worked with in the past who moved up? Reach out and ask if they have any advice for your job search. Going forward, make a point to stay on good terms with the people around you. You can help each other as your careers progress."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Have you tried asking any of the jobs that rejected you&#39;re getting rejected?Honestly, just a guess, you&#39;re probably giving off bad interpersonal vibes/people don&#39;t really like talking to you. Half of interviewing is just being very personable/being able to talk comfortably with other people. Generally in this space (this space meaning those interested in tech/startups/etc) sometimes people struggle in this area but really shine in tech. I would encourage you to spend some time reflecting on your interpersonal skills.Some other red-ish flags from your post - you kinda seem like you might struggle just doing exactly what you&#39;re asked to do. Bringing up how frequently you quit things for various reasons or finding issues and bringing them up with your superiors&#39; superiors, spoofing numbers to get in touch with very very senior people. Lots of lower-tiered jobs literally just need people to show up and do what they&#39;re asked. A part of getting a &#34;first&#34; or &#34;entry level&#34; job is accepting you&#39;re there mostly to learn, not to teach/move outside of your lane. The fact that you would even bring up Bill Landreth seems like you might not necessarily see yourself how the rest of the world sees you.I&#39;m not trying to offend you - I really hope you can line something up soon. I apologize if this feedback seems cold - I think reflecting on things like this can be hard because you have to face things about yourself you may disagree with or not realize. Unfortunately interviewing is such a biased game, you kind of have to play your opponent (meaning, be the person they want, not the person you are).Happy to chat through any of this stuff if you have questions. Wish you all the best."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Your writing is not strong, i can tell you did not attend college. Written communication is important in tech.Your applying to those companies with 0 experience or college degree is unrealistic. The entry level is extremely competitive and you have nothing to make you interesting to hire. They get thousands of applications for those jobs.You are still young, plenty of time to learn, but I recommend taking a step back and rethink your strategy. There are plenty of companies that do not get thousands of applications for jobs.Let me put it bluntly: you are not qualified to be a software engineer. There is no reason anyone would currently hire you, unless you are personable and fun to talk to.You show immaturity in the way you handled the flaw in the system you described. Calling your boss&#39;s boss because you think you are right is childish.Additionally, you do not understand how to get a software job, you do not have realistic expectations for what kind of jobs you are qualified to acquire.A few years ago my brother, who is in his thirties, was stuck in a dead end job he hated. So he took some classes in 3D modeling. He worked hard, built out his portfolio, networked, and eventually landed a job at a world famous video game studio making AAA games at an interesting role that builds his skills.What he did not do was blindly apply to jobs he was not qualified to do with zero training"</p>

So long as there is more money in mining BTC than there is cost in energy to mine it, mining will proceed.No entity in the world can control the price of crypto. But, we can and already do regulate energy production.I think we need a carbon tax, that is specifically a financial disincentive towards any means of energy production that directly pollutes the atmosphere.Seriously, what are the current best arguments against levying such a disincentive?Moreover, if energy were priced correctly (its toll on the climate priced in) would BTC become higher in value? That is, we have a supply, increasing at a rate fixed between the arbitrage of energy and mining efficiency. If energy were to become more expensive, the growth in supply would slow. Assuming demand remains constant or continues to grow as well, the only way for price to go is up."</p>

How can Google own the entire ads market and still be allowed to compete in it? Obviously for-profit companies will abuse their positions if it&#39;ll earn them more money, and fines ends up being the cost of doing business instead of deterrents.How is Apple allowed to disallow any other web browsers on their mobile devices? We already went through this with Microsoft in the past but suddenly it&#39;s different?How can Amazon be allowed to sell competing products in their own marketplace, when they own the actual marketplace? They should have been forced to divide their business long time ago. Of course they are gonna use metrics from competitors that only they have access to, in order to make their own product line get better.Why is Google allowed to rank their own products in front of more general results? Try searching for &#34;Earth&#34; on Google and see what the top hit is. Is that really a fair ranking? We don&#39;t even know, because no one knows how their algorithm is working, but one thing is clear, Google products consistently rank higher than anything else in the search engine.The list goes on.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;A year after initiating the investigation, we received testimony from the Chief Executive
Officers of the investigated companies: Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg, and Sundar Pichai.
For nearly six hours, we pressed for answers about their business practices, including about evidence
concerning the extent to which they have exploited, entrenched, and expanded their power over digital
markets in anticompetitive and abusive ways. Their answers were often evasive and non-responsive,
raising fresh questions about whether they believe they are beyond the reach of democratic oversight.Although these four corporations differ in important ways, studying their business practices has
revealed common problems. First, each platform now serves as a gatekeeper over a key channel of
distribution. By controlling access to markets, these giants can pick winners and losers throughout our
economy. They not only wield tremendous power, but they also abuse it by charging exorbitant fees,
imposing oppressive contract terms, and extracting valuable data from the people and businesses that
rely on them. Second, each platform uses its gatekeeper position to maintain its market power.By controlling the infrastructure of the digital age, they have surveilled other businesses to identify
potential rivals, and have ultimately bought out, copied, or cut off their competitive threats. And,
finally, these firms have abused their role as intermediaries to further entrench and expand their
dominance. Whether through self-preferencing, predatory pricing, or exclusionary conduct, the
dominant platforms have exploited their power in order to become even more dominant.&#34;Well they&#39;re not wrong..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Amazing.I never thought I would say this, but I actually implemented an FTP server in 2020. This was needed to support firmware updates to specific hardware (Electric Vehicle charging stations). Apparently embedded software developers choose FTP whenever a spec doesn&#39;t specify how binary file transfers should work.It was kind of amusing getting FTP to work in a modern cloud environment. I run a single Kubernetes pod with a Node.js based FTP server optimized for one thing: Transferring files between FTP and Google Cloud Storage. A series of ports are specified in the Docker file to enable passive FTP transfers.Even more amusing was the number of varieties in which FTP was implemented by different hardware manufacturers. I regularly had to dive into the FTP libraries to add support for crazy edge cases (tcpflow in kubectl exec -it is your friend!). Example: one device added a newline in the middle of a command (USER\n myusername)..The latest curve ball I received this week is that a certain firmware version of a Qualcomm modem chip cannot deal with the size of the IP packets coming from our FTP server... Fun stuff!"</p>

&#34;FTP: This is specified in RFC 765.  It is very similar to the FTP used with the NCP.

I literally don&#39;t care about UX or fancy algorithms. I&#39;d rather use an old algorithm called &#39;talking to someone I know&#39; for book recommendations. Right now it feels like a clunky old site made for books reviews and I like that feel. I don&#39;t want some Amazon product manager who only cares about monetising (where can I smack ads?!) to touch it thank you very much. And god forbid some UX person gets hold of it and redesigns it in the boring/minimal feel (so it loads fast and we can smack lots of ads on it)."</p>

For those who haven&#39;t tried it yet Google Earth is the first thing I show friends who&#39;ve never tried VR before by giving them a Godzilla&#39;s eye view of Tokyo.

December 23rd, she is suddenly for stimulus again, with those same companies ralling 5%, giving her an instant +30 return.&gt; Congressman Gottheimer is absolutely an incredible options trader. He’s been selling calls at peaks on $MSFT all 2021, &amp; seemingly buying back the contracts on dips. This in blocks of $250,000 - $5,000,000, which is incredible size given the amount of $MSFT shares he owns. For ex, on 02-12 he sold 500k $MSFT $160 strike expiring 06/18/2021. On that same day, he bought deep ITM calls of $1M-5M at $145 expiring 03/19/2021. The whale caught both of his movements as well.This is fucking unreal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Of course if you actually work in financial services industry, your personal trading is extremely restricted.
This is regardless of being in no position to see positions/flow/etc that would give you any insider edge.The industry generally sees it as easier to show compliance by having locked down personal trading by employees.Usually this takes the form of - ETFs only, pre-clearance required, 30 day holding periods, limited to using only a list of 5 approved brokers.. and sometimes all of the above.The restrictions apply not just to spouses but to anyone in household, and you have to attest you are reporting any holdings of say.. your parents, if you still live at home.So the mother of a live-at-home college grad tech support analyst who plugs in phones at a bank has more trading restrictions than senior politicians :-)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s also really easy to have high quality audio! The author recommends a &#34;podcasting&#34; microphone, but a $35 standalone headset mic[1] is almost as good and much easier to use. If you want to hear a comparison, I got kind of obsessed with this problem at one point and took some comparison recordings here[2].(You need a standalone mic since most headsets, even really nice ones, have really bad mics because most headset buyers don&#39;t care about or even know how good their mic sounds. The one I linked is wired because wireless is evil[3] and in particular, Bluetooth will silently degrade your audio quality. If you want a pair of wired headphones, I like these[4] which are &#34;open back&#34; and therefore sound more natural + cool your ears better, although the open back also means they &#34;leak&#34; sound and are only suitable for working without people next to you. But you shouldn&#39;t be having calls with people next to you anyway!)[1]: https://www.amazon.com/V-MODA-BoomPro-Microphone-Gaming-Comm...[2]: https://www.benkuhn.net/vc/#get-a-better-microphone[3]: https://www.benkuhn.net/wireless/[4]: https://www.amazon.com/Philips-SHP9500S-Precision-Over-ear-H..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People vastly undervalue good audio quality. It also often makes the difference (given equal visuals) between great amateur and pro in e.g. the YouTube scene.I didn&#39;t have data to back this up before, but I bought a good microphone specifically for this purpose. People will simply like the audio, and by extension what I am saying and also me as a person, better.Meanwhile, my ears will continue to bleed from the awful audio people broadcast into this world. I wonder, most people must notice how terrible everyone in e.g. video conferences sounds; why don&#39;t they make the connection that they themselves have it in their hand to improve the situation? Maybe it&#39;s like wearing masks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A cheap and usable condenser mic costs 30 bucks (e.g. Fifine), a lavalier mic costs between 2 bucks on aliexpress and 50 for e.g. from Rode. (I found that the ultra cheap aliexpress are the exact same like the no-brand 10 bucks on amazon, like so many things)I got both but mostly use the condenser mic and it is an absolute game changer. If you want to explain something it is so noticeable in the eyes of your conference participants how good they can hear you. And it makes a huge difference if you finally feel like what you are saying is not painful for others to endure.Check out this very lovely video series on how to pimp up your conferencing setup.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I use Firefox. So does my family. Everything I make for personal use works in Firefox and I don&#39;t bother testing with anything else.However, almost every web site or web app I make in my professional capacity gets tested with, and is expected to work with, ~95% of browsers. That means testing against Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, UC Browser, Samsung Internet, and Internet Explorer.
Edit: I forgot to add Safari, which I also test with.Anything less is not my brand of professionalism, because I am convinced my clients expect me to leave my personal thoughts and convictions at the door. If you want to only create sites that work in Firefox and maybe not elsewhere, then you can do that - but doing it ethically means telling the client upfront that you won&#39;t accept work that requires the site work for the widest audience reasonably possible.That said, there are two caveats.  The first is ethics. I do not leave my ethics at the door and if I am being asked to do something unethical I will refund the money and walk. If it is illegal it will be reported, as otherwise I am an accessory. Clients agree to this upfront. The second is client requests. If the client wants it to work in Firefox and they tell me not to bother with the other websites, despite my advice against it, then that&#39;s what I do."</p>

It&#39;s unbelievably powerful, lightweight and there&#39;s not much it can&#39;t do.Why not use sqlite?  Here&#39;s one example - I like to access my database from my IDE remotely - my understanding is that remote access is not possible with sqlite.Another example - multitenancy is dead easy in postgres, makes things more secure and makes coding easier.Another is that Postgres had an extremely rich set of data types, including arrays and json.Also Postgres is designed for symmetric multiprocessing which matters in today&#39;s multicore world."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We&#39;ve been using SQLite as our principal data store for 6 years. Our application services potentially hundreds of simultaneous users at once, each pushing 1-15 megabytes of business state to/from disk 1-2 times per second.We have not had a single incident involving performance or data integrity issues throughout this time. The trick to this success is as follows:- Use a single SqliteConnection instance per physical database file and share it responsibly within your application. I have seen some incorrect comments in this thread already regarding the best way to extract performance from SQLite using multiple connections. SQLite (by default for most distributions) is built with serialized mode enabled, so it would be very counterproductive to throw a Parallel.ForEach against one of these.- Use WAL. Make sure you copy all 3 files if you are grabbing a snapshot of a running system, or moving databases around after an unclean shutdown.- Batch operations if feasible. Leverage application-level primitives for this. Investigate techniques like LMAX Disruptor and other fancy ring-buffer-like abstractions if you are worried about millions of things per second on a single machine. You can insert many orders of magnitude faster if you have an array of contiguous items you want to put to disk.- Just snapshot the whole VM if you need a backup. This is dead simple. We&#39;ve never had a snapshot that wouldn&#39;t restore to a perfectly-functional application, and we test it all the time. This is a huge advantage of going all-in with SQLite. One app, one machine, one snapshot, etc..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cool article. I definitely agree that SQLite is the way to go in 99% of the cases you&#39;re making some kind of app.I have often seen Postgres, MySQL and MongoDB in places where they were really overkill and added unnecessary network and deployment complexity. And upon asking the designers it turns out they simply didn&#39;t know about SQLite...Small gripe in case the poster reads this: There&#39;s a malopropism in the opening bit:&gt; SQLite is properly the only database you will ever need in most cases.Should be:&gt; SQLite is probably"</p>

The display hardware is incredible in every way. 3:2 is the correct aspect ratio for laptops if you care about running visual studio or other apps which gobble up vertical real estate.I have reloaded this thing from official image 3x and it will still randomly fuck up important things like hardware accelerated video playback and WiFi, both of which require a hard reset to resolve. There is also some really annoying bullshit with the ambient brightness adjustment feature where I have to manually disable it in the registry every time a driver or windows update hits.The most painful problem with the machine is that WiFi is entirely unusable if you are simultaneously using bluetooth. I have had to get external dongles to resolve this.All of that said, I have had few-to-no issues with the Surface Pro product line at work, and my sample size is 1.

If you don’t do that, you may very well end up measuring a mixture of the performance characteristics of interpreted JS and optimized machine code.Since unwarmed first execution is a very common use case on the web, and a very intentional improvement for WASM, it seems foolish to discard that when comparing. I understand for benchmark determinism warming is important in long-running systems, but when parsing/warming is a common part of every run, it deserves to be factored in. I can make WASM look better by removing intentional benefits from JS before comparing too."</p>

I (morally) support this effort.Myself, I would like to see data query/manipulation language as a total functional language, possibly based on the idea of categorical data transformations: https://www.categoricaldata.net/Also - bit of a rant - if you&#39;re creating a new programming language, consider making syntax and semantics separate in the specification. Lots of people get hung up on arguing about language syntax but it&#39;s really semantics differences that are important for compatibility. Lot of new languages comes up only to fix syntactic problems with existing languages but create small semantic differences in the process, making automated translation from and to existing languages difficult. I wish we could move to a world where syntax and semantics in programming languages are discussed separately from each other."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice to see Datalog being validated by a big name, though I don&#39;t see what&#39;s modern about Logica in particular, or why one should use it over plain Datalog (as syntactical Prolog subset) when the available backends are restricted to SQL rewriters or locked-in to BigQuery. Will have to look into the model for aggregate queries which I guess is a selling point for Logica (as is modularization/composition with optimization), and a weak point since typically neither in Datalog (the decidable logic fragment) nor portable.Edit: also I find the title a bit grandiose since this isn&#39;t about Logic Programming in general, but only database querying"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not a great introduction to the language, IMHO. There is not a clear use of logic to automatically reason about anything, just query composition. It seems the language is much more powerful than what this introduction makes it to be!&gt; English words (...) often capitalized to keep the old-fashioned COBOL spirit of the 70s alive!I like logic programming a lot but a convention not technologically enforced is a poor reason to argue for a language change. When arguing about SQL limited abstraction capabilities that space would have been better spent talking about CTE limitations, for example.Also:&gt; To make things worse, SQL code is rarely tested, because “testing SQL queries” sounds rather esoteric to most engineers, at bestSo nonexisting best practices require a language change, apparently. It was also not showcased how this can be done in Logica, beyond the table mocking that could be done with a &#34;with xxx as (values a, b, c) select (query to be tested)&#34; approach in sql."</p>

I can’t blame them as I also don’t want this on my messaging app.I feel like I will just give up and use WhatsApp and assume that I only had privacy pre-internet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are three pre-requisites to escaping the messenger silo treadmill:  1. multi-vendor, open standard protocol for E2EE group messaging
  2. reference open-source clients for web, desktop &amp; mobile
  3. reference open-source server

Wire is contributing to #1 and they have a high-quality iOS (OSS) client and OSS server. Their Android and web clients are less stellar, but exist and can be improved.  The iOS Arm client will likely be enabled on M1 Macs. Wire is free for individual consumers and has a paid offering for enterprise teams (i.e. their business model is neither data nor charity), and they do not mandate sharing your phone number or address book -- only an email address is required.The IETF standard is MLS and it will live alongside TLS, https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mls/about/.  The team behind Wire founded Skype and contributed to the first patent-free high-def audio codec (OPUS), which in turn enabled WebRTC, the protocol behind most modern video conferencing services.  
Matrix.org provides #2 and #3 and has stated that they will migrate to the IETF MLS standard protocol.Since both Wire and Matrix offer both OSS clients &amp; servers, and there is active multi-vendor development on an open standard protocol for E2EE group messaging, web &amp; mobile developers have multiple options for open-source contribution. Matrix already supports federated servers that can be self-hosted, and they recently supported the FOSDEM online conference with ~30,000 attendees, https://matrix.org/blog/2021/02/15/how-we-hosted-fosdem-2021...&gt; The most unique thing about Matrix is that conversations get replicated across all servers whose users are present in the conversation, so there&#39;s never a single point of control or failure for a conversation (much as git repositories get replicated between all contributors). And so hosting FOSDEM in Matrix meant that everyone already on Matrix (including users bridged to Matrix from IRC, XMPP, Slack, Discord etc) could attend directly - in addition to users signing up for the first time on the FOSDEM server."</p>

I have about 25% of the conversations in signal, but especially for groups, whatsapp is so sticky, that they seem to have broadly failed in signal, and are back to whatsapp.I continue to have individual conversations on signal with most friends, but the idea of being able to leave whatsapp seems to be much tougher than I thought."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been using pass for several years now and I recommend it to my friends, but I usually get weird looks when I say I store my passwords in a git repo (it&#39;s not as bad as it sounds!). Here&#39;s why:- I host my git repo on my desktop computer (through SSH), so it&#39;s not exposed anywhere except if you have SSH access to my computer. (A lot of people seem to think git = GitHub which is not true). So if your git repo is not exposed to the public, you don&#39;t leak any of the site names/usernames you use.- The passwords are GPG encrypted so even if it were leaked that would be okay as long as my secret key remains secure.As far as usability goes, I usually use the -c option to copy/paste my passwords. I used a browser extension for awhile, but I haven&#39;t gotten around to reinstalling since the copy/paste works fine for me. Syncing with my phone and Linux devices works perfectly (since it&#39;s just git).The Windows client seems to be no longer maintained [1], so I would like better support here for my Surface. But this is still okay since I can SSH to my desktop computer from Windows and copy/paste the passwords from there.[1] https://github.com/mbos/Pass4Win#readme"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here are some of the pros of the Pass:* It leaks meta-data. That might sound a con, but in exchange you get the ability to extract a password without decrypting and thus exposing other passwords. There is isolation.* It’s more convenient than a single file password manager. You type ‘’pass -c goo’’ for your Google account, instead of clicking on your password manager, typing password, searching in data base, finding the right entry, copying password or pressing auto complete and closing the database. The combination of mouse and keyboard can make alternative password managers slower.* You don’t need your master password to add a new password (it uses asymmetric encryption).* You can easily program it, eg, write a backup script that grab a password from store.* It uses GPG which means your secret key can be stored on Yubikey, handled by a dedicated agent. Your password is basically a short PIN with max 3 tries. This is unparalleled convenience and security!* It’s secure, because it’s a short bash script that you can check, and delegates encryption to a dedicated well-audited cryptographic tool.* You can encrypt to multiple keys, thus use it similar to LUKS that supports multiple passwords.* GPG is usually widely available, so you can decrypt a password on another system on which you may not admin rights to install your password manager.There might be few cons though. For example, if you store your database on a cloud, say, Dropbox, Dropbox could switch  your Dropbox.com file with google.com file, and you copy and hand over your Google password to Dropbox. But this is hypothetical for most of us! Also, some people don’t like metadata (filenames) leakage, though apparently there are solutions for that.Overall it’s very convenient and functional. I highly recommend it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use pass for exporting secrets to environment variables. I have a multi-line password called &#34;envvars&#34; that contains a script like this:  #!/usr/bin/fish

  set -x PASSWORD hunter2
  set -x PASSWORD_STG hunter3

  set -x LUGGAGE_KEY 12345

  set -x TOKEN (curl &#34;https://api.example.com/oauth/token&#34; \
    --data-urlencode &#34;username=$USERNAME&#34; \
    --data-urlencode &#34;password=$PASSWORD&#34; | jq --raw-output .access_token)

  set -x TOKEN_STG (curl &#34;https://api-stg.example.com/oauth/token&#34; \
    --data-urlencode &#34;username=$USERNAME_STG&#34; \
    --data-urlencode &#34;password=$PASSWORD_STG&#34; | jq --raw-output .access_token)

When I want to set the environment variables I run `pass show envvars | source` and it sets the environment variables for the current shell. It&#39;s an easy way to keep the secrets out of my shell history and plaintext files."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think the issue most developers have with CORS is how late in the dev cycle you encounter it. When everything in localhost/http you don&#39;t see any issues. It only crops up once you deploy to staging/production environments that are actually on the web. Worst case is when it works fine in staging, and only has issues in production and someone else controls the allow list.It usually bites you once, and then you look out for it. But about every web developer I know hits it at some point. There used to be footguns of being able to disable CORS, and devs would provide this as a work around. Thankfully browsers have pretty much disabled these settings without intensive investment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve always setup HTTPS to an alias domain as the first step in any of my projects. I do it because at an early internship I witnessed a bunch of bugs that only appeared after pushing to “prod.”Nowadays with tools like mkcert it’s trivial to install and maintain a trusted root cert for whatever .test (RFC approved TLD) domain you want to add to /etc/hosts.  (Just be careful which colleagues you allow to install a custom root cert on your device. ;))As a fULlStAck DeVeLoPEr, what annoys me the most are the preflight CORS OPTIONS requests, and the fact they came out of nowhere in the past ~5 years. Most frameworks don’t have a good solution for dealing with those requests out of the box. It’s annoying how web standards change so much so frequently.  I could put my code in a vault and take it out in 2023 and it would probably break due to some obscure update in whatever JS runtime is popular then."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great and clear guide to this thorny topic. However, even this article gets a little confused in its wording at one point:&gt; In such cases, we want our API to set the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to our website’s URL. That will make sure browsers never send requests to our API from other pages.&gt; If users or other websites try to cram data in our analytics API, the Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers set on the resources of our API won’t let the request to go through.The ACAO header only performs a controlled relaxation of cross-origin restrictions. It is the browser that is ensuring that by default other pages can&#39;t send requests to the API.
Just a nitpick as I feel the rest of the article illustrates this well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While this looks interesting, I&#39;ll admit I feel like there&#39;s been a bit of drift from their bread and butter over the years since they launched their cloud thing and started pushing hard towards a subscription model. I chose them long ago specifically over options like LastPass because I liked having a rich application without internet dependency and their attention to detail and features there, but it&#39;s been a while since it feels like it got major new improvements vs the site. For example, while macOS and Windows have supported smart cards and security tokens like YubiKeys forever now, and I use them to login, unlock, authorize sudo/SSH, etc every day, 1Password still has no support. There are things that can now only be done through the web interface, like finer grained control over permissions for shared vaults, and some of those are also nastily locked away behind more expensive subscriptions. I think everything should be manageable through the application, without ever visiting the site. Duplicate items across vaults remain completely manually managed, when automating stuff like that is kind of the purpose of a password manager. Etc. Heck, even within their own subscription service I think they&#39;re missing a trick by not having more powerful/flexible organization(including families) and inter-organizational capabilities.I still think 1Password is the best option for most people. I specifically want my non-technical family and friends to use password managers too as long as its necessary, and having some multiperson capability is also key to that. I can&#39;t say though that I feel like the move to subs has been a huge win in terms of development.Granted, I&#39;m a little down on the whole field which colors things a bit. Ultimately underlying my feelings is a touch of bitterness that their entire industry even exists. Passwords and password managers are mostly recreating public key auth really, really badly and it stinks. Passwords and other symmetric tokens by definition should never be shared. A website being hacked should never affect me in the slightest, in the same way that me getting hacked doesn&#39;t somehow suddenly mean attackers now own Debian/Apple/FreeBSD/Microsoft. Everywhere should just have public keys. We&#39;ve had the tech for decades and sufficient crypto speed on client systems since at least AES-NI. What&#39;s been missing has been glue and effort. It&#39;s frustrating every time a hack happens. We shouldn&#39;t have to care! Sigh."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I purchased my first 1Password license when it was version 3, and have faithfully upgraded to every standalone version ever since. These days I’m not so sure I will be upgrading again (and I’m not sure there will be more stand alone versions).The latest version is a mess on Big Sur, with unlock fields obscuring input fields, conflicting with Apples iCloud Keychain, and just not working like I expect it to.Furthermore, stand-alone versions are buried deeper and deeper behind a cloud service subscription that brings me absolutely no value over what i already have, and adds the uncertainty of having to synchronize my most secret secrets to a cloud service.While I can certainly forgive software errors, this has been going on for so long that I’m beginning to suspect it’s either a strangler pattern to get people to switch to the cloud solution, or it’s death by a thousand cuts.In any case, I’ve begun evaluating alternatives. Bitwarden looks promising (though nowhere as polished), is open source, and allows me to synchronize to a service on my LAN.Password-store uses gpg and git that also allows me to synchronize locally (though it leaks website names without the vault extension which is not supported on iOS).Finally I’m evaluating Yubico authenticator for 2FA codes and just using iCloud Keychain for the rest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks interesting. We use 1Password, and I always thought it would be useful to programmatically pull values out and use in our cloud infrastructure.Currently we end up using the secret managers available in AWS or GCP, which seems pretty half baked. In GCP, for example, secrets are stored at a project level. It&#39;s not unusual to have certain secrets that are needed by more than one project, which means they get duplicated. The granularity also prevents me from controlling which secrets are visible to a given user.I&#39;d love to have one centralized source of truth for all infrastructure secrets."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Inequality by itself is not a bad thing. Let&#39;s start from there. If 90% of the population had a (sustainable) lifestyle of current dollar millionaires, and the remaining 10% had a (sustainable) lifestyle of dollar billionaires, there would be lots of inequality, but it wouldn&#39;t be problematic.Inequality is only bad if you&#39;re in a zero-sum game. The rich do have the power to extract rents and &#34;rig the system&#34; to cement their wealth and power. Those are things Graham is clearly against. But an entrepreneur who gets rich by reducing waste and improving productivity by harnessing technology deserves our praise. They&#39;re not causing the &#34;poor to get poorer&#34;.And comparing the wealth distribution of today to that of 1980 is pretty silly. We&#39;re in a global economy now, so if you want to be fair, you need to look at it from a global perspective. Almost all Americans are going to fall in the top 10% of earners globally. And global poverty has collapsed since 1980. Yes, you no longer get a comfy middle class life just by virtue of being born in the US (regardless of skills) anymore. I personally don&#39;t believe that an unskilled worker in the US deserves to be paid 10X what an equivalent worker in Bangladesh makes just because they were lucky enough to be born here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m just gonna quote what I think is a very important part from the Graham piece itself&gt;&#34;People who don&#39;t look any deeper than the Gini coefficient look back on the world of 1982 as the good old days, because those who got rich then didn&#39;t get as rich. But if you dig into how they got rich, the old days don&#39;t look so good. In 1982, 84% of the richest 100 people got rich by inheritance, extracting natural resources, or doing real estate deals. Is that really better than a world in which the richest people get rich by starting tech companies?&#34;And my answer to that question would be, arguably yes. Why? Because at least old money understands the concept of noblesse oblige. The real sinister psychological thing going on behind the Graham argument is that it&#39;s not at all about meritocracy, it&#39;s that this mentality of earned wealth completely rids the owner of any sort of responsibility.The aristocrats and oligarchs of the olden days might have been corrupt, debauched and half-useless, but at least they knew it. This new, self-made entrepreneur class does not only think they have earned their money themselves, which as a sidenote is also kind of a fiction, but that they&#39;re intellectually superior, morally superior and virtuous in ways that anyone else just can&#39;t understand.Old money might have ignored you and thrown a party, but Silicon Valley money wants to remake people in their images, they have a Protestant zealotry associated with their money that makes any oligarch look straight up sympathetic in comparison.C.S Lewis:&#34;“Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron&#39;s cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be &#34;cured&#34; against one&#39;s will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals.”"</p>

While I would still recommend everyone to pursue the dreams over never trying to do so - being poor is the single most powerful force that prevents people from doing that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I got hit with this a few years back. I signed up for Ps CC for a month (I thought) to create an anniversary gift for my wife. I used it ONCE. Tried to cancel and they told me I had in fact signed up for a year, and that if I didn&#39;t cancel now, they&#39;d give me two months free.I didn&#39;t want it at all! Anyway, I sucked it up, got on with the remainder of the year, because they wouldn&#39;t let me put the cancellation in early, had to do it X months before the end. Then life happened and I missed the deadline to cancel and got suckered for a second year!Fuck Adobe and this practice is all I have to say, I stick strictly to Open Source options now. It may have been my fault for not reading the first time, but robbing me a second time by counting on me missing the cancellation because they wouldn&#39;t let me do it there and then is just scummy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is this really a cancellation fee or is it just honoring your contract? AFAIK it&#39;s very clear on Adobe&#39;s page that your options are (1) Annual plan paid monthly, (2) Annual plan prepaid, and depending on the product (3) Monthly plan at usually 150% higher price.https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/plans.htmlIf you signed up for a yearly plan paid monthly, the cancellation fee is finishing your contract.If you didn&#39;t want to agree to pay by the year maybe you shouldn&#39;t have signed up for a year of service?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had the same, they wanted me to pay the rest of the year (after 2 or 3 years?). Problem is, that is against Dutch law, after an initial year, one is only allowed to prolong a contract by 1 month at a time. I reminded the person on the phone (who only spoke English, so imagine what happens when you are not as fluent in it as I) that they broke Dutch law, I told that to 3 other persons and they finally told me: Ok, we&#39;ll cancel. Finally.Edit: I had to call them, because the website indeed only showed me these options where I had to pay the rest of the year. Email didn&#39;t help, they offered me some discount for the rest of the year. Very strange as a Dutch person, it has become so normal to not worry about this (I really like this law, a nice example of citizens before companies.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Apple has just engineered the worst possible situation for themselves by being the only way to get apps on the store and by simultaneously incessantly marketing the store as &#34;Safe and Secure&#34;. The former encourages them to maximize the number of apps on the store, while the latter encourages them to shoot first and ask questions later.If side-loading or alternative ways of getting apps onto the iPhone existed, then they could implement far stricter controls knowing that, worst case scenario, you can still get an app onto the iPhone. This is how it works on the Mac. Tor isn&#39;t on the Mac App Store, but that of course doesn&#39;t mean Tor can&#39;t be used on the Mac.This is one of the tricky parts about AppStore discussions, it&#39;s not about being for or against the AppStore. In fact, I wish the AppStore was MUCH pickier about the apps it let in, and I also wish there was an alternative to the AppStore to catch cases that didn&#39;t meet that strict bar. Then the AppStore could actually be about curation as opposed to fear-induced isolationism. Then Apple wouldn&#39;t have to inadvertently have political side-effects when it disallowed apps like HKMap.live.Being on the AppStore could still be advantageous beyond just &#34;either that or you don&#39;t get to be on the iPhone at all.” Apple payment processing, iCloud integrations, Family-sharing, etc. could all be tied to being ON the AppStore, so there&#39;d still be a huge incentive to try to ship that way. And side-loading doesn&#39;t have to be easy or even on by default."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got scammed on the App Store a couple of weeks ago.I needed the SmartThings app for some Samsung home automation devices, searched for it, and installed this one:https://apps.apple.com/us/app/smart-things-smart-view-app/id...When it charged me a $20/year subscription (now cancelled) I thought &#34;Wow, Samsung charging me for this feels pretty cheap of them, but I guess that&#39;s how they do things - after all, I found this on the App Store&#34;.The app I should have installed was this one: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/smartthings/id1222822904"</p>

It got everything from banning apps for competitive reason to Apple&#39;s FEAR ( Fraud Engineering Algorithms and Risk ) team saying the current App Store review process is inadequate.I am starting to think there is a much deeper problem with Apple, it is that without Steve Jobs, no one is being the yard stick of quality, especially in UX.A decade of App Store, you are wondering if they have actually put any effort in its Apps Search Engine. It took them 3 years to admit they have problem with Keyboard and offering an update after 5 years. For things that are easily quantify, like Sales, Hardware Performance ( Apple Silicon ), Logistics and Operation. They are absolutely excelling under Tim Cook. For everything else it seems they are loose, at least from an Apple Standard point of view, although that is still far higher than their competitors.To quote Steve, it seems people are too focused on the process, and forgot about the content.[1] https://twitter.com/PatrickMcGee_/status/1380194940236353536"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The risk of dying from a blood clot after receiving the J&amp;J vaccine is six in 6,800,000 (6.8M). The world population is 7,900,000,000 (7.9B). If everyone on the planet got the J&amp;J vaccine tomorrow, and if it is the cause of the clots, then 6,971 people would die from the vaccine.Yesterday, Covid19 killed 8,803 people (according to worldometers).We don&#39;t want anyone to die from vaccination, and we don&#39;t fully understand what the clotting issue is, so it probably makes sense to pause using J&amp;J as long as the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna) have not been implicated (which they haven&#39;t). OTOH, if this being in the news causes fewer people to get vaccinated, pausing it may be a mistake that will cause more overall deaths.Now, your risk of dying either from vaccination or Covid19 depends on various demographic factors not accounted for in my math above. But, nonetheless, the risk of dying from the J&amp;J vaccine is really, really, really tiny.Like, if I knew there was a 0.00009% chance my car were going to explode every time I got in it and started it, I would not be at all nervous about starting my car everyday for the rest of my life. I&#39;m way more likely, even accounting for my age demographic, to choke to death eating dinner tonight (5,051 deaths from choking in the U.S. in 2015 of which 2,848 were older than 74).Edit: lifetime risk of car exploding assuming I start it every day for 50 years is about 1.6%. Okay, maybe I wouldn&#39;t play that game."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The incidence of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) varies between studies, but it is estimated to be between 2 and 5 per million per year. A recent study in the Netherlands with comprehensive ascertainment suggested a much higher incidence.&#34;
https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/STROKEAHA.116.0...So the six reported cases in 6.8 million vaccinations seems low. Glad I read about all this because I got the J&amp;J vaccine 12 days ago. No noticeable side effects so far. I exercise a lot and did a 5 mile hike four days ago that resulted in a slightly strained a calf muscle.  I have been taking it easy the past few days, meaning sitting and reading a lot more than usual. So after learning about the blood clotting, have started exercising the legs frequently. My optimistic thinking is that even if the vaccine does cause an increased risk of CVST that risk can be eliminated via exercise.It will be most interesting to learn if those six cases involved people at high risk, if they exercise regularly, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"John Campbell suggested on his video the other day that perhaps this is happening because some injectors are not aspirating. What that means is that when an intramuscular injection is given you want to ensure that it goes into the muscle and not into a vein. So the proper way to do this is for the person doing the injection to first pull out the syringe (after it&#39;s been stuck into the arm) a bit to make sure there&#39;s no blood coming out. Then if not, the vaccine is pushed in. If blood is seen then a new site has to be chosen. Apparently Denmark has included aspiration in their directions for usage of the AZ vaccine."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"People in this thread seem very confused about a lot of stuff so I’m going to try and make some clarifications:1) This is an RCE, so what it does is achieving code execution in the browser, i.e. it can run arbitrary code from the attacker, it’s literally like running a compiled program inside the target’s browser. This doesn’t bypass Chrome’s sandbox, so a lot of OS operations are not reachable from within the browser (for example, a lot of syscalls can’t be called).This is the first step in an exploit chain, the second one would be a sandbox escape to expand the attack surface and do nasty stuff, or maybe a kernel exploit to achieve even higher privileges (such as root)2) WASM being RWX is really not a security flaw. W^X protections in modern times (even in JIT-like memory mappings) makes sense only when coupled with a strong CFI (control flow integrity) model, which basically tries to mitigate code reuse attacks (such as JOP or ROP). Without this kind of protection, which needs to be a system-wide effort as iOS has shown, W^X makes literally zero sense, since any attacker can easily bypass it by executing an incredibly small JOP/ROP chain that changes memory protections in the target area to run the shellcode, or can even mmap RWX memory directly."</p>

They&#39;d get paid for being on-call, and used an authentication app to access our systems.One day my boss asked if I would install this authentication app on my phone, so I would be able to push changes. I refused, stating that my phone is my private property. This resulted in quite a long conversation, with reassurances about security, etc. but I didn&#39;t budge. At one point they stated that my &#34;argument wouldn&#39;t work&#34; if it was on a company-provided phone.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s some nuggets of truth in here, but I am disappointed that this article sidesteps what I feel is the most important reason for startup success in 2020: easy and abundant access to cheap capital.- Interest rates are at all time lows, borrowing is cheap- The Fed&#39;s balance sheet is at an all-time high. The economy is flush with cash, particularly the investor / VC class- This excess cash creates an (arguably artificial) wealth effect and drives an appetite for risk- Large unicorn startups that are perpetual money losers continue to operate only because they are effectively subsidized by regular capital raises. Look no further than all the Silicon Valley darlings such as Uber, Netflix, AirBnb, Tesla, and so on. All of them would cease to exist without continued capital injection from secondary share offerings or VC raises- These companies achieve growth and put pressure on the competition by offering their services below the real cost that would be needed to achieve profit, hence driving huge share price growth- This share price growth attracts new investment from the momentum-chasing crowd, increasing appetite for subsequent secondaries, and then the cycle repeatsI don&#39;t mean to be cynical, but it&#39;s hard to see this ending well for some of the nouveau riche. Tech has been a great avenue to riches by offering real innovation in some cases, but the article&#39;s error-by-omission really gives the wrong impression."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m rather disappointed PG would think that the Forbes wealth list could support any kind of conclusion whatsoever. One of the biggest reasons that the top of the list is filled with tech billionaires is that their wealth is relatively transparent, being mostly in the form of stock holdings in publicly traded companies and often directly disclosed. This makes it much easier for Forbes to estimate their net worth with some degree of confidence. Older wealth is often more opaque and diffuse, hidden behind various complex financial structures or stored in assets that are difficult to value or rarely change hands. Whether Forbes is aware of how much wealth there is and in what form, depends largely on the desire of the possessor to make it known. Some would want to disclose (or even inflate) their wealth for ego or branding reasons. Others would likely prefer to remain off the Forbes list altogether. So the Forbes list is a poor starting point even for a discussion soley about the wealthiest people.

The real question is why so few people had gotten rich from starting companies in 1982...a wave of consolidation was sweeping through the American economyMicrosoft, Oracle, Apple, Bloomberg, etc were all started in the late 70&#39;s/ early 80&#39;s. Their founders are the richest people in the world.Seems like the question he&#39;s asking, though, is why weren&#39;t they obscenely wealthy after only 5 years, but that requires a different thesis than PG&#39;s.Every time I read one of PG&#39;s posts, it seems like he&#39;s working from a narrative that he&#39;s trying to conform facts to."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those confused, this acquisition is due in large part by Nuance&#39;s dominance in healthcare related products.  From Nuance&#39;s last earnings release[1]:“We are very pleased with the strong start to the fiscal year, as we delivered revenue and EPS above our guidance range expectations,” said Mark Benjamin, Chief Executive Officer at Nuance. “We continued to advance our strategic initiatives, accelerating our cloud transition across our core platforms in Healthcare and focusing on our AI-first approach in Enterprise. In Healthcare, we saw solid performance in our cloud-based offerings, growing cloud revenue 28% year-over-year. In particular, we benefited from strong performance in Dragon Medical &amp; DAX Cloud revenue, which grew 22% year-over-year driven by the ongoing transition of our installed base to Dragon Medical One, as well as traction in international, ambulatory and community hospital markets. Enterprise delivered another record revenue quarter, up slightly from its previous record in Q1&#39;20, driven by particularly strong demand for our Security &amp; Biometrics solutions.&#34;Nuance has deep relationships built with nearly every health system in the US and beyond.  This fits quite well with Microsoft&#39;s corporate focus.  Yes, Nuance also has a lot of IP, but I wouldn&#39;t expect any consumer facing changes (e.g. Cortana) in the near term.[1] https://investors.nuance.com/download/EX%2099.1%20Press%20Re..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think a lot of big acquisitions make &#34;sense,&#34; given the current market.The most successful companies have lots of cash, high share prices, and amazing cash cows. They could borrow for (almost) free, so resources are practically unlimited.  Their R&amp;D is already well funded. Most of their big, growth oriented endeavours are not cash-constrained. There are usually no factories to build or production to scale up.Google tried &#34;20% time.&#34; They tried &#34;let many flowers grow.&#34; Those things seemed ambitious at 2007-scale. In 2021 terms... new flowers need to be S&amp;P 500 companies to represent growth, instead of just clutter. &#34;Meaningful growth,&#34; for Alphabet, is a big number.How else does a MSFT, Google or (especially) FB put $20bn to work? Acquiring &#34;just works.&#34;Of course, there are in-house alternatives. Waymo is an in-house investment by Alphabet that&#39;s bigger than this Nuance acquisition... especially if you consider the $bns Waymo will continue to need until some unknown future date. Self driving is looking more hopeful (certainly to investors) than it was when waymo started.... but waymo is still a dubious investment.Consider that Google could have bought any car company, for about as much as waymo will cost eventually. Car companies have loans, so you could quibble the math... but details.Acquiring is easy. The path of least resistance wins &gt;50% of the time. We have that dynamic here, both in the human/managers sense and in the arbitrage-like incentives in the market currently."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s hard for me to know whether to feel bad for ES in this case. Did they bring it on themselves? Is Amazon too big and a bully?From my perspective, Amazon has made most of its profit price gouging consumers on bandwidth after vendor locking them into their ecosystem, where they bootstrap new services by wrapping open source software with some provisioning scripts, management dashboards and cookie-cutter API / console templates. Indeed, most of this is templated -- AFAIU, for example, each AWS service autogenerates its Boto bindings and parts of its console frontend via code generators. Amazon has really mastered the factory process of churning out new services, and when they find a popular one, they can invest more resources into developing it than the original team ever could.And therein lies the rub. If Amazon is improving the software in a way that the original team couldn&#39;t, it&#39;s hard to say that the community isn&#39;t benefiting. I think what strikes me the wrong way is that Amazon is not doing it for any altruistic reason. In fact, Amazon contributes very little to open source in general, considering how much they take from it. Compare them to Facebook (React, etc) or Google (tons of dev tools) or Microsoft (VSC, TypeScript). What does Amazon have? Firecracker, kind of? And now a fork of ES because that&#39;s the only way they could continue making money off it without violating the license a small startup put in place to stop them?Well, good for Amazon, I suppose, but I find myself instinctively disliking them for this. I&#39;m not sure what the solution is. Hopefully technologies like Kubernetes and Terraform will encourage big customers to become at least cloud-agnostic, if not cloud-independent. At the very least it would be great if Amazon / Google / Microsoft stopped gouging bandwidth at such absurd margins. Or not. Maybe it will be their downfall as startups differentiate along those lines. That would be ironic, coming from the originators of &#34;your margin is my opportunity.&#34;Personally I&#39;m doing my part by not building anything with vendor lock-in. It&#39;s great to be able to deploy to any cloud, if you value either robustness or flexibility."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there any good that done by Amazon to support OSS? Like ever. They started with cloning MongoDB and now Elastic with actually zero contribution to the community regardless of their insane profits. This is a clear single. Amazon can always clone and redistribute any open source software then lock it in for AWS. If we&#39;ve started to witness declining in OSS, well at least we know now who started the wave."</p>

...which will print out like an object, including the key names."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow there are some cool tricks here!In Firefox any objects you pass to console.log are expandable, so you can say console.log(&#34;my hash&#34;, h). It seems to behave the same when you say console.log(&#34;my hash %o&#34;, h).But there is a tricky thing that has really confused me in some debugging efforts: when expanded, the object display is &#34;live&#34;, so it always shows the current properties of the object, not the properties as they were when you printed them. But the unexpanded view shows them as they were. So for example:    h = {foo: &#34;bar&#34;}
    console.log(h)
    ▶ Object { foo: &#34;bar&#34; }
    h.foo = &#34;BAR&#34;

Then you click the triangle and you see:    ▼ {..}
    |   foo: &#34;BAR&#34;
    | ▶ &lt;prototype&gt;: Object { .. }

I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a bug or desired behavior, but watch out for it! In the past I&#39;ve used console.log(JSON.stringify(h)) to capture the full object as-is. I guess turning it back into an object would be even nicer, so you could have a deep copy to navigate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Now, would the journalists who wrote articles with titles that are a variation of &#34;RMS defended Epstein&#34; [1,2] apologize or at least correct their articles?  Also, now that RMS has explicitly clarified his position on these issues, can the people who leveraged his &#34;silence&#34; and &#34;bad behavior&#34; to oust him from the FSF at least admit that their motive was less about making the free-software movement welcoming and was more about getting rid of RMS?[1]: https://www.thedailybeast.com/famed-mit-computer-scientist-r...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Minsky defense was not the primary, most important reason RMS can&#39;t serve as an effective, inclusive leader for free software, it was just the one that got the most attention. This does nothing to address the numerous complaints of harassment towards MIT students, the _other_ times he spoke out in implicit support of pedophilia, the public gaffes that are unacceptable as a public representative (e.g. the foot skin eating thing), and the fact that the FSF under Stallman kinda lost to open source anyway and hasn&#39;t really done anything besides virtue signal to others about how pure and ethical they are."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s great, but the problem seems to be RMS&#39;s disruption of development activities. This doesn&#39;t change that. For example:https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2015-01/msg00...Imagine taking the time to publicly explain to an out-of-practice dev why some technical feature is needed, then being accused of a &#34;pressure campaign&#34; that requires the out-of-practice dev to consult privately, &#34;with people I have confidence in.&#34;Gnu devs have an impressive amount of patience and grace to put up with that. But I see a lot of other FOSS devs try to replicate RMS&#39;s unnecessarily aggressive rhetoric. They often shoot themselves in the foot with it, disrespecting and consequently losing valuable contributors who are otherwise aligned philosophically with the project in every way.That kind of disruption is at odds with every value FOSS devs claim to hold-- meritocratic, decentralized, etc. Even Debian put the hammer down when an out-of-practice dev tried to use permissions to disrupt the work of a new dev. Nobody sane and self-respecting should put up with this kind of behavior.Edit: clarification"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Taleb talks about the Lindy effect and some of the surprises in this article can be explained it.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effectThe rough heuristic is: the longer a technology has been around, the longer it will last into the future.That is, it&#39;s NOT the case that every piece of technology lasts roughly the same amount of time, and then is replaced.For example, a chair vs. an iPhone.  Which one will be used further into the future?  Almost certainly a chair.----Land lines have been around a lot longer than fax machines (both in the article), so they will likely outlive fax machines.Will HTML or JavaScript last longer?  Probably HTML, since it came first.What about ASCII or HTML?  Probably ASCII.These have a &#34;dependency stack&#34; issue, but it applies regardless.  And I think that is part of the phenomenon -- low level technologies that are widely adopted take longer to go away.  Plumbing, electrical (AC vs DC), land lines, TCP/IP, BIOS, etc.I can&#39;t find a link now, but there was a recent Kevin Kelly article about finding farming tools from a catalog in the 1800&#39;s still in use.   I think he said that almost EVERY one was still in use, or able to be purchased, which is a nice illustration of the point.  It takes a long time for old tech to die, and arguably it never does."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"His #1 can not and will not ever happen. The radio spectrum is a shared resource. The total information capacity of the usable spectrum, say from 100 KHz to 100 GHz, is massive but most of it has terrible propagation and all of it can only be used once at a time. Massive MIMO helps in dense city cores with lots of independent paths reflecting everywhere but it&#39;s still just one spectrum in practice.Whereas with physical transmission lines, be they cables, fiber optics, or whatever, each run can re-use the entire spectrum."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The 3D TV phase was so odd. It really seemed like an inevitability: there was a technological breakthrough, it was genuinely much better than what came before (the red and blue stuff), it was relatively inexpensive, and on paper it seemed like a strict improvement on the status quo (flat TV).But... somehow, I never actually found myself wanting it that badly at home. And I guess everyone else agreed because one day it just vanished.So few technologies follow a trajectory like that. Usually you either get a success or a failure, where successes only end once they&#39;re replaced by something new and strictly better. But this was truly a fad; it was kind of successful for a minute, and then everybody lost interest."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I noticed as young adult that I didn’t really worry or consciously stress, but my body had somewhat predictable reactions to situations that I would realize, in hindsight, were highly stressful. Those physical reactions sucked, and as they got worse over time, it really concerned me.At some point I was encouraged to go to CBT, which I did, but honestly it made things worse. I became hyper aware of how anxious I was at any moment, and the more I noticed the more it worried me.Years later I tried mindfulness meditation and found that it helped. But also, I finally hit a kind of turning point where I just realized that there was nothing I could really do about anxiety or the physical symptoms that came along with it. I decided to mostly try to quit noticing and thinking about it. And that really helped.I still feel stress and anxiety symptoms sometimes. They still suck. My conscious mind is still the last to recognize what’s going on. But, overall, I feel I can handle a lot more stress now than I could ten years ago without it ruining my quality of life, and more importantly I can recognize the stress, not worry too much about it so I can get through it, and then rest and recuperate (as soon as possible) and recover much quicker than when I was younger.I’ve concluded that the best advice is to learn not to worry about things. Unfortunately that’s easier said than done, and I’m not sure I have any advice on how to learn to do that :/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Eh, a gross oversimplification.Feeling troubled by being anxious in the modern world is a &#34;cerebral&#34; issue. The guy who mistook an innocent animal as a tiger and freaked out because of it didn&#39;t feel bad for feeling anxious for no reason. We do. Because it interferes with our daily functioning / responsibilities in the modern world.Anxiety is also very frequently comorbid with other mental disorders. Especially OCD or OCD like tendencies, depression etc. I am medicated now and feel a lot better but when my anxiety was worse, the chatter of my &#34;conscious&#34; brain murmuring about &#34;what if&#34; scenarios was the worst. My point is, yes, anxiety manifests itself in a physical way, big time, but that is only half the problem. The discomfort with being anxious, constantly thinking about the possibility of having an anxiety attack even if you are not physically anxious &#34;at that time&#34;, evaluating the &#34;what if&#34; scenarios, the constant planning to work around possible issues, all that torture are very cognitive pursuits and they were a lot of a bigger burden on my quality of life than experiencing an anxiety attack now and then."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the advice of focusing on how to turn anxiety symptoms down and moderate physical responses are fine, but it&#39;s kind of missing the point, at least for serious cases of anxiety. I suffered pretty badly from it in my early 20s (apparently typical age for this kind of stuff), and you go very quickly from particular anxiety attacks being the issue, to fear of anxiety itself being the bigger issue.An anxiety/panic attack is physically scary the very first time, but by the tenth time what you&#39;re really afraid of is the loss of control and the anticipation of anxiety. Chronic sleeplessness is often the same way. Dealing with literally sleeping better is one thing, but at some point the real issue becomes the mental concern with sleep itself.Dealing with physical anxiety symptoms is good, but if you&#39;re mentally anxious your first thought after dealing with an anxiety attack by breathing deeply is &#34;okay, but what if it doesn&#39;t work the next time?&#34;. It&#39;s that mental attitude that I think many people have trouble dealing with."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I enjoyed the piece.Personally, I want no part of it, but I think it might work well for people who are not me.I&#39;ve always been &#34;on my own.&#34; My life really is a series of watersheds, where I&#39;ve been the only person to believe in me, before the event, and a whole bunch of folks seemed to believe in me, after the fact. Not a particularly good setup for selling &#34;Chris-Tokens™.&#34;Not a bad thing, in the long run. It hurt like hell, the first few times, but I realized that I don&#39;t have the personal skills to &#34;sell&#34; myself (like being able to spew jargon, sound like I&#39;m TED-talking all the time, or beat LeetCode tests), so I can&#39;t blame folks for not wanting to &#34;invest&#34; in me. It is what it is. I come across as a socially-awkward dork, so people don&#39;t take me seriously. I&#39;m actually fairly good at what I do, but If I mention that, it comes across as &#34;arrogant,&#34; despite the enormous ocean of hubris that pretty much defines today&#39;s tech scene. I don&#39;t really have the skill to &#34;humble-brag.&#34;It taught me to live a conservative lifestyle, be Honest and Honorable, do top-shelf work, bust my ass, and not expect much from others.I couldn&#39;t rely on anyone else to clean up my messes, or get me out of jackpots. It has taught me to learn what I have needed to learn, despite active roadblocks being tossed out by &#34;gatekeepers,&#34; and it also prevented me from getting mixed up with some truly awful disasters; both personal, and business."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey, Alex Masmej here. Just wanted to say that I had no choice because I had no money in the bank. During the start of COVID, I lost my only (and very first) source income at the time, and I lost all my savings in crypto (DeFi is dangerous even to crypto people like me).Financially, this ISA freed me instantly, and gave me a newfound legitimacy as a crypto innovator. This was by far the best way I could find to break out as an entrepreneur."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Instead of more palatable user tracking, how about we tell advertisers and internet companies: fuck off, we don&#39;t want any tracking? How about we hunt down and eliminate all features that allow cross-site information sharing? How about we treat attacks on user privacy as security problems of the web standards, à la Tor, and build technology that aggressively hides any user signature in any layer, from rotating IP and MAC addresses to user agents, referers and canvas leaks?But wait you say, how would the very useful internet ecosystem survive without advertising revenue? Well, there is nothing wrong with advertising per se, it&#39;s a natural part of a free market economy. It&#39;s ok to target ads to the user&#39;s search terms or social feed. The problem is that, in the pursuit of advertising revenue, a cutthroat economic competition pushed advertisers to mine more and more personal data simply to stay competitive. It&#39;s a low sum game: it doesn&#39;t bring much more money in advertising or make the internet significantly more useful, but it destroys the privacy of everyone. A spectacular market failure ripe for correction."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FLoC stands for Federated Learning of Cohorts which aims to target advertising better without it directly relying on singularly personal information.https://web.dev/floc/  FLoC enables ad selection without sharing the browsing behaviour of individual users.

  FLoC provides a privacy-preserving mechanism for interest-based ad selection.

  As a user moves around the web, their browser uses the FLoC algorithm to work out its &#34;interest cohort&#34;, which will be the same for thousands of browsers with a similar recent browsing history. The browser recalculates its cohort periodically, on the user&#39;s device, without sharing individual browsing data with the browser vendor or anyone else.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s a very interesting move. The patch seems fairly small, but now it&#39;s a patch that Brave needs to maintain and update every time they merge a new upstream version.That&#39;s what makes me wary of the whole Chromium fork concept. Every time Brave/Vivaldi/Edge/etc decide to take a different path from Google&#39;s they effectively add to their maintenance burden forever, even if like in this case they actually disable an unwanted feature.How long until the list of patches to backport for every new version of Chromium becomes so large that they have to pick and choose which one to keep maintaining and which one to give up on? If tomorrow Google decides to push a very deep change to the way, say, extensions are handled that makes them less effective at ad blocking, will Brave accept the burden to suddenly have to maintain a very deep fork of the browser in order to maintain old functionality?I&#39;m effectively FUDing right now, but my concern is genuine. I&#39;m very perplex that you can make an effectively anti-ad, pro-privacy browser based on the source code of one of the biggest ad companies in the world."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use Photopea a lot and the amount of Photoshop features it has is astounding. Like adjustment layers, smart objects etc. The PSDs it exports work nicely with the Photoshop I have in my Windows PC. This is just mind-blowing.
That brings me to a question I have. GIMP has been in development for longer time. And supposedly it has a bigger team behind it. So how come GIMP is missing a lot of nice features like non-destructive editing, layer styles etc? I saw some of these features in its roadmap, but why is its development so slow? Is it only because working on GIMP doesn&#39;t generate any money?Edit: rephrase"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I find more amazing is what an incredible equalizer IT is: An individual with nothing more than a computer (and $50 worth of rented production infrastructure) plus the right skills can build a project that makes a (well-deserved) million a year, from anywhere in the world.It also shows the power of smart design and keeping as much as you can client side. Attempting to move any of the actual work to the server side would create an unsustainable amount of a) additional development work, b) infrastructure cost, c) infrastructure operations work. It&#39;s also a great example that you truly can do everything inside a browser nowadays.Regarding the incredulous people who can&#39;t imagine how 12 TB/month cost only $50, the hosting provider may be taking a small loss on it, and make it up with other customers. At Hetzner, extra bandwidth (after you&#39;ve exhausted your included allocation) retails for 1 EUR/TB + VAT. A provider can afford to lose $10-20/month on a single customer, and kicking them out is probably not worth the effort and the risk of even the smallest amount of bad press/word-of-mouth."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"(author here)I thought I would answer to some of the comments here.&gt; It&#39;s their place, their rulesDefinitely true. And I am not going to try to go against those rules. But I believe I am allowed to voice my opinion about them.&gt; Use in-app purchases insteadThis is definitely a valid option, but that requires diving into Google Pay, which from what I understand is not the easiest API to work with. It also means I have to maintain additional code for Google Play. More not-so-fun work to do for a side project.&gt; Make it a paid gameAnother valid option, but given how everybody is used to free games on Android, I doubt it would get much success. It also does not help that Google Play disallows switching a published app from free to paid and vice-versa: it&#39;s a one-way decision.I might end up going that way though, because it has the advantage of not having to write store-specific code. Pixel Wheels is not Android only: it also works on Linux, Windows and macOS, so not having to deal with store-specific requirements gives me more time to work on the game itself. The game would still be available for free on F-Droid and for pay-what-you-want on itch.io.I also happen to run other open-source projects, and my goal with donations is to get people to support this open-source work, not just my work on this particular project. I don&#39;t expect to ever live from this: in my wildest dreams donations would let me spend a work-day per week or every two weeks to work on open-source projects."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently implemented Google Play billing in my app (after doing Stripe and Apple App Store) and Stripe was by far the easiest to implement/test/maintain.  Google and Apple not only take their 15/30% cut, their payment systems add a very non trivial amount of work (cost) to implement and maintain while offering none of the (automated) testing capabilities of Stripe.  Work that I&#39;m forced to do, even though I had already implemented Stripe.  All because they have a monopoly on their platform.For something as critical as payment processing, both Apple and Google make it an arcane journey into API documentation and stack overflow questions. 
Hoping to write a blog post detailing all of this in the near future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many comments here confuse paid apps or in-app purchases with donations. In fact, donations are sort of a blind spot on Google Play: They&#39;re forbidden through the platform&#39;s payment system (because it would be a price charged without service in direct return), but donation buttons are also forbidden. Since both are forbidden, it&#39;s not (just) commercial optimization by Google, but that just makes it weirder IMO.As a rule of thumb, don&#39;t include a direct link to PayPal, Patreon or similar, but create a dedicated page on your website listing those and link that page."</p>

					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26741829">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From a storage perspective, describing commits as snapshots seems like a bad mental model. Suppose I have a directory that is 100MB in size. If I take a snapshot of it, my snapshot would be 100MB in size. If I take a 2nd snapshot of it tomorrow, my 2nd snapshot would also be 100MB in size. My total storage needs would now be 300MB.Whereas if I had used git, and created 2 additional commits, each making a change to a small text file, my total storage size would be barely larger than 100MB. Describing the commits as a diff, as opposed to a snapshot, leads to a better intuitive understanding of why this would be the case.Not to mention other features the article discussed, such as cherry-picking. What does it even mean to &#34;cherry-pick a snapshot&#34;? In comparison, cherry-picking a diff and applying it to your current state, is far more intuitive.And let&#39;s not forget commit messages. If a commit is a snapshot, I would expect the commit-message to be descriptive of the entire snapshot. Whereas if a commit is a diff, I would expect the commit message to be descriptive of the diff. Which is exactly how most people use commit messages.Obviously both &#34;diffs&#34; and &#34;snapshots&#34; are leaky abstractions. If you insist on using the &#34;snapshot&#34; abstraction, you will need to resolve all of the above points of confusion by adding more complexity to your abstraction. And if you prefer to use the &#34;diff&#34; abstraction, you will eventually need to explain that a commit is actually a combination of diffs, along with some other metadata like a pointer to a parent commit. As a teaching tool, you can make either abstraction work. But I find it far more intuitive and useful to think of commits as &#34;diffs + some metadata&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why have so many people written long thoughtful explanations about how the author is wrong to suggest snapshots are a better mental model, and that you think all abstractions are leaky, but you find diffs a better mental model?The entire article is literally about how commits are literally snapshots. I would say people didn&#39;t read TFA, but a lot of people are quoting lines from TFA and then going on to argue with/expand on them in a way that is directly contradicted by the next few lines.I think it&#39;s because most of the people here have spent years working with git, and are so deeply attached to their understanding that they didn&#39;t hear most of what the article said.(Some commentators have pointed out specific oversimplifications the author makes like glossing over pack files, I&#39;m referring to the people who say a git blob is a diff when the entire point of TFA is that it isn&#39;t)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I believe that Git becomes understandable if we peel back the curtain and look at how Git stores your repository data.I agree, and like many, I have been saying that for years (nay, for more than a decade): and that&#39;s exactly the problem!You don&#39;t need to understand how an internal combustion engine works to drive a car... You don&#39;t need to understand how your graphics card renders stuff to develop a web page... You don&#39;t need to know how a brushless motor works to use a drill...There is a pattern there, and it&#39;s the one that makes sense.I&#39;ve read up on the internals of git a dozen times by now. But I only occasionally need to do something weird that makes me go back to it, so I usually forget the relevant bits.The trouble is that I&#39;ve used a distributed VCS that did not ask me to understand internals and it had a sane UI, and good model (like tree-like commit history, so a top-level commit log would only have merges, but you could dive deeper into individual commits if you so pleased). It wasn&#39;t perfect, but it&#39;s hard for me to accept that we have gone with a subpar solution where every &#34;tutorial&#34; starts with how you need to understand the internals! But you also need to memorise them, dammit!Just like I keep forgetting the Emacs rectangle editing shortcuts since I seldom use them, I&#39;ll keep forgetting the specifics of git internals that I might need once every 12 months.And it&#39;s not me, it&#39;s _you_, git!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sometimes I feel like there are two worlds in IT: the one you encounter on a daily basis, and the one you read about on HN. The only thing consistently &#34;terrible&#34; about both of them is the often expressed lack of humility towards solutions you don&#39;t &#34;like&#34;, or more often, actually, solutions you don&#39;t understand.Gottfried Leibniz suffered no small amount of flak for his conclusion that the reason the world looks the way it does is because it&#39;s already &#34;the best of all possible worlds&#34;: you may think you see an improvement, but you lack divine understanding and therefore you don&#39;t see how it would actually make things worse.While this is in my opinion a silly idea, I think most people who work in tech could use a bit of humility influenced by this line of thought: if a solution exists today, and it has yet to be replaced, it&#39;s at least possible that it&#39;s over all the best solution, and the reason you&#39;re not seeing that is because of a lack of understanding.Of course this is not always true, but if nothing else it would lead to more interesting discussions than those stemming from someone saying &#34;if you&#39;re not using Kubernetes you&#39;re a moron&#34; and another replying &#34;learn how to sysadmin and you&#39;ll realize you don&#39;t need Kubernetes in the first place&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At scale software stops being a technology problem and becomes a people problem. And groups of humans don&#39;t scale.We naturally organize into hierarchies of small subgroups with limited  interaction boundaries. Each subgroup will adopt slightly different methodologies, have different tooling preferences, will have integration and communication overhead with others,  and so on.This can not be preventend, only mitigated. Which is perfectly fine. The important step is recognizing that software development is really not special [1], and that the limiting factor is the human element. Then you can build your organizational structures around these restrictions.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26713139"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The tooling is simply not there, so every software project keeps pushing the boundary of what is possible in its own unique fragile way.People don&#39;t want solutions to yesterday&#39;s problems. These are considered trivial and already solved, such as invoking a shell command (which just hides a lot of complexity under the hood). Noone will pay you for invoking existing solutions. They pay you to push the boundary.By tooling I mean programming languages, frameworks, libraries and operating systems. All of whuch have been designed for a single machine operation with random access memory model.This no longer holds true. In order to scale software today you need multi machine operations and no such OS exists for it yet. Only immature attempts such as Kubernetes, whose ergonomics are far from the simolicity that you&#39;d expect from a unix like system.And random access memory model breaks down completely, because it is just a leaky abstraction. For full performance memory is only accessed linearly. Any random access structured programming language completely breaks down for working with GBs of data, in parallel and on a cluster of machines.I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll push the boundary further if we keep piling crap on top of existing crap. The foundations have to change and for that we&#39;d better go back to the 70s when these ideas were being explored."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; In order to make these checks pass the hooks in vgpu_unlock_hooks.c will look for a ioremap call that maps the physical address range that contain the magic and key values, recalculate the addresses of those values into the virtual address space of the kernel module, monitor memcpy operations reading at those addresses, and if such an operation occurs, keep a copy of the value until both are known, locate the lookup tables in the .rodata section of nv-kernel.o, find the signature and data bocks, validate the signature, decrypt the blocks, edit the PCI device ID in the decrypted data, reencrypt the blocks, regenerate the signature and insert the magic, blocks and signature into the table of vGPU capable magic values. And that&#39;s what they do.I&#39;m very grateful I wasn&#39;t required to figure that out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazing! Simply amazing!This not only enables the use of GPGPU on VMs, but also enables the use of a single GPU to virtualize Windows video games from Linux!This means that one of the major problems with Linux on the desktop for power users goes away, and it also means that we can now deploy Linux only GPU tech such as HIP on any operating system that supports this trick!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dual booting is for chumps. If I could run a base Linux system and arbitrarily run fully hardware accelerated VMs of multiple Linux distros, BSDs and Windows, I&#39;d be all over that. I could pretend here that I really need the ability to quickly switch between OSes, that I&#39;d like VM-based snapshots, or that I have big use cases to multiplex the hardware power in my desktop box like that. I really don&#39;t need it. I just want it.I really hope Intel sees this as an opportunity for their DG2 graphics cards due out later this year.If anyone from Intel is reading this: if you guys want to carve out a niche for yourself, and have power users advocate for your hardware - this is it. Enable SR-IOV for your upcoming Xe DG2 GPU line just as you do for your Xe integrated graphics. Just observe the lengths that people go to for their Nvidia cards, injecting code into their proprietary drivers just to run this. You can make this a champion feature just by not disabling something your hardware can already do. Add some driver support for it in the mix and you&#39;ll have an instant enthusiast fanbase for years to come."</p>

I thought, “surely you could gradually rotate yourself the right way up” before I saw the photo."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; At one point, Robson says he was left upside down on a tarmac, literally sitting on his head for 24 hours because there wasn&#39;t enough room in the crate to turn around.I&#39;m surprised he survived this. I remember when David Blaine hung upside down in Central Park for 3 days – but every few hours he had to take a break: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1060038/Cheati..."</p>

Robson ended up being inside that crate for five days. &#34;It was terrifying,&#34; he said. &#34;I was passing in and out of consciousness. I had a lack of oxygen. Oh, it was bad.&#34; There seemed to be an endless number of stopovers, and the airport crews didn&#39;t pay much attention to the crate&#39;s labels. At one point, Robson says he was left upside down on a tarmac, literally sitting on his head for 24 hours because there wasn&#39;t enough room in the crate to turn around.The rest of the article is great (in particular the way it ends), but reading the above excerpt made me shudder.The will power of this man is unbelievable.I hope he finds his friends."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"GUI is better for discoverability of the most common scenarios (I can right-click to see everything that can be done with the file, including some third party programs). But it&#39;s bad for composing programs and interoperability, often it&#39;s impossible or very hard to automate (how many people are doing UI testing? there is a good reason it&#39;s not many -- it completely sucks)TUI/console is very good for interoperability/automation/muscle memory, but doing one-off things is harder.
If I don&#39;t remember the `df` command... what do I do apart from searching on the internet? Maybe searching man pages, but it isn&#39;t as fuzzy (e.g. `man -K &#34;free space&#34;` isn&#39;t very fruitful). 
In comparison, I know that if I start going through GUI, eventually I&#39;ll eventually find the free disk space info.It&#39;s interesting that there is some analogy to object-oriented and functional paradigms -- if I have a rich object in a debugger in Python, I can call dir() on it to immediately see what I can do with it. Whereas if it&#39;s a simple dataclass, I&#39;d need to search through code to find how I can use it. Might be a too far fetched analogy though.I think we need all of it, and also need to make the distinction less apparent. Would be nice to make GUIs more composable, and TUIs more discoverable. Ideally it should be a spectrum of interfaces, so you don&#39;t have to make a hard choice and can gradually move into the direction you want."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not sure if this is satire or not, but certainly the single worst case of using a terminal is file manipulation. Nothing will ever beat the right-clicks or Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V combos. It&#39;s just more natural to &#34;see&#34; things that you move.Now when it comes to more complex applications, I&#39;d stop using the CLI if I had to search the manpages or the internet each time for doing something I already did previously.
Since I discovered the Ctrl+R shortcut (for searching your history), it has been much easier. You read the manpage once, maybe you do an internet search, you enter the command and then you can find it back as long as it&#39;s still in your bash history (be sure to set HISTSIZE and HISTFILESIZE to correct values). I also have a DOCS.txt file where I put all the rare but useful commands I&#39;m afraid of losing. I don&#39;t need to be an expert in ffmpeg&#39;s options (... though I sort of am now), I can just look at my history or my DOCS.txt file!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As much as I like the command line, I couldn&#39;t help noticing from the first 10 or so entries[1] that the &#34;stop&#34; text consists of one of:1. Drag and Drop2. Right clicking3. Ctrl-C and Ctrl-VSo these 3-5 things do everything in the list in a GUI, and instead the author wants us to learn 35 different command/syntax combinations?As an aside, I&#39;d like to write an article saying &#34;You Don&#39;t Need Github To Write an Article&#34;. If you insist on using Github for that purpose, at least do it properly with a static site generator.[1] Did not bother with the rest."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I tried Nix a few days ago. I set it up on an existing Arch install. I installed a couple of packages with &#34;nix-env -i [package] and then tried to update them with &#34;nix-env -u&#34; as instructed in the official documentation: https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/#ch-basic-package-mgmtThis ended up breaking the entire install. After a few hours of troubleshooting I found that the reason it broke was that it updated itself from version &#34;nix-2.3.10&#34; to &#34;nix-2.3.10-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl&#34; because it saw that package&#39;s version string as a version bump. The suggestion in the github issue was to instead use an unofficial third party package for basic package management because this was a known, long-standing issue that is not likely to be fixed.https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/118481The experience came across as a massive red flag and I decided not to pursue it further."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I spend a few hours looking at nix about a year ago and found it impenetrable.I simply do not grok the syntax or what the functions do. I tried searching for the functions shown in the examples on the website to no avail. I searched packages, options, and even resorted to ctrl-f while clicking through the site &#34;documentation&#34;...It sounds awesome, but its in dire need of some better documentation if it wants to be accessible, IMHO. I simply didnt have the patience to delve any deeper."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nix has a heavy learning curve and requires learning the language to feel comfortable. However, overcoming that hump is incredibly rewarding and allows for taming your system in a way that, for me at least, changed the way I look at composing software.At mindbuffer[1] we&#39;ve started using it for our recent art installations. The big benefits for us are reproducibility, ease of deployment, and the ability to collaborate on the composition of the whole system. I.e. rather than sharing a README of how to install things one by one and hoping each of us has followed it correctly, we just work on the same set of config files via a git repo (like we would any other code) and can be sure we&#39;re all on the same page as a result.Very much looking forward to Nix 3.0 landing with all its UI improvements and flake support. It seems like these changes will go a long way to making Nix more accessible, and provide a smoother on-ramp to learning the language itself.https://mindbuffer.net/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m using Starlink right now.  AMA.I&#39;m in East Idaho.  Currently my dish angles itself to the north.  It rarely moves itself north/south, and slightly moves east/west throughout the day.  I&#39;ve read that right now it locks onto a single satellite, although they&#39;re adding multi-satellite support later.My speeds are inconsistent, and interestingly they start slow (around 60 Mbps) but after a couple seconds they&#39;ll get to 150-200 Mbps (which is awesome for downloads).  Latency is consistently in the low 30ms.  I get some downtime every day, so it really is a &#34;beta&#34; like they say.  I have a backup WISP.Setup was literally take dish out of the box, insert into tripod (included), plug in cables, connect to the wireless routers SSID and activate with the starlink app.  After that I put the included router into storage and plugged in my Protectli[1] running CentOS.  Everything works great.  My only complaint is the CGNAT, but given the difficulty associated with procuring IPv4 addresses, it&#39;s understandable.[1]  I love this thing. 
 Highly recommend:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, I&#39;m impressed! I thought it would take more than a decade to implement when it was announced, but it&#39;s here and it works. Just amazing.100/16 Mbps is pretty decent I guess, hopefully it doesn&#39;t go down as the number of users goes up. The latency is great imo, 40ms using satellites? I don&#39;t think anyone has achieved that before.Would a bigger dish work better or not?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The cell grouping is interesting. A colleague likes the outdoors, so he&#39;s preordered one for his Suzuki Jimny, to mount on it. I wonder if Starlink are considering this use case.I haven&#39;t been able to preorder mine, because we&#39;re planning on moving out from the city to a small village next year, but the Starlink website requires a street address.Our villages are quite primitive, no street names (I think it&#39;s cos nobody&#39;s thought of it). So, the nearest town where there&#39;s street names, is quite far.I was feeling uneasy about using it as an address, this article sort of cements that concern.I have 50/50Mbps fiber, but reckon we could still be served by 20 down if needed. Exciting!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Avoid functions in WHERE clausesAvoid them on the column-side of expressions. This is called sargability [1], and refers to the ability of the query engine to limit the search to a specific index entry or data range.
For example, WHERE SUBSTRING(field, 1, 1) = &#34;A&#34; will still cause a full table scan and the SUBSTRING function will be evaluated for every row, while WHERE field LIKE &#34;A%&#34; can use a partial index scan, provided an index on the field column exists.Prefer = to LIKEAnd therefore this advice is wrong. As long as your LIKE expression doesn&#39;t start with a wildcard, LIKE can use an index just fine.Filter with WHERE before HAVINGThis usually isn&#39;t an issue, because the search terms you would use under HAVING can&#39;t be used in the WHERE clause. But yes, the other way around is possible, so the rule of thumb is: if the condition can be evaluated in the WHERE clause, it should be.WITHBe aware that not all database engines perform predicate propagation across CTE boundaries. That is, a query like this:  WITH allRows AS (
    SELECT id,
           result = difficult_calculation(col)
    FROM table)
  SELECT result
  FROM allRows
  WHERE id = 15;

might cause the database engine to perform difficult_calculation() on all rows, not just row 15. All big databases support this nowadays, but it&#39;s not a given.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargable"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an aside, but a colleague years back showed me his preferred method formatting SQL statements, and I&#39;ve always found it to be the best in terms of readability, I just wish there was more automated tool support for this format. The idea is to line up the first value from each clause. Visually it makes it extremely easy to &#34;chunk&#34; the statement by clause, e.g.:  SELECT a.foo, b.bar, g.zed
    FROM alpha a
    JOIN beta b ON a.id = b.alpha_id
    LEFT JOIN gamma g ON b.id = g.beta_id
   WHERE a.val &gt; 1
     AND b.col &lt; 2
   ORDER BY a.foo"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Although it’s possible to join using a WHERE clause (an implicit join), prefer an explicit JOIN instead, as the ON keyword can take advantage of the database’s index.This implies that WHERE style join can&#39;t use indices.I can understand why some would  prefer either syntax for readability/style reasons.  But the idea that one uses indices and the other not, seems highly dubious.Looking at the postgres manual [1], the WHERE syntax is clearly presented as the main way of inner joining tables. The JOIN syntax is described as an &#34;alternative syntax&#34;:&gt; This [INNER JOIN] syntax is not as commonly used as the one above, but we show it here to help you understand the following topics.Maybe some database somewhere cannot optimise queries properly unless JOIN is used? Or is this just FUD?[1] https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/tutorial-join.html"</p>

Then users have to figure out whether this means &#34;--long&#34; or &#34;-l -o -n -g&#34;. To make command line even more confusing, multiple tools I have used allow spaces in optional arguments (e.g. &#34;-opt1 arg1 arg2 -opt2&#34;, where arg1 and arg2 set two values for -opt1).
