								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some really good thoughts here. I&#39;ll summarize the ones that hit me:- &#34;Why are people searching Reddit specifically? The short answer is that Google search results are clearly dying. The long answer is that most of the web has become too inauthentic to trust.&#34;This is it for me exactly. I search for the following kinds of things on Reddit exactly because results on other sites aren&#39;t trustworthy: Reviews are secretly paid ads. The &#34;best&#34; recipe for pancakes is only what&#39;s trending on instagram right now. The latest conditions on mountain bike and hiking trails are being shared inside communities like Reddit but not on the web. The same for trending programmer tools.- &#34;It is obvious that serving ads creates misaligned incentives for search engines...&#34;What I&#39;m shocked by is that Google somehow maintained a balance on this for so long. Well, at least a good enough balance that people still use it primarily.- &#34;Google increasingly does not give you the results for what you typed in. It tries to be “smart” and figure out what you “really meant&#34; ...&#34;This is the most annoying behavior because I really mean what I write.- &#34;There’s a fun conspiracy theory that popped up recently called the Dead Internet Theory...&#34;I hadn&#39;t heard of this. Now that&#39;s some sci-fi level of conspiracy but in today&#39;s world it seems totally plausible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An important thing to realize, too, is that this is a problem that keeps getting worse. The article talks about product reviews and recipes, but it&#39;s been spreading a lot further than that. Recently I was trying to look up a technical error, and found a lot of web pages that seemed to be auto-generated with &#34;How to solve [error_scraped_from_the_web]&#34;, complete with a list of generic things unrelated to the error (IE, &#34;Step one: try turning your computer off and turning it back on again. This is usually a good first step, and you&#39;ll be surprised at how often...&#34;).Likewise, I wonder how long appending &#34;Reddit&#34; will work. As others have pointed out, Reddit shills are already relatively common, and it&#39;s becoming increasingly common for bot accounts to create lots of random comments to appear to be human (such as finding a thread with thousands of comments, then copying and pasting the comment to another place in the thread or to another thread, or auto-generating a simple sentence based on other comments in the thread).Sometimes the advertising hordes move so fast they kill something before it even takes off, like what happened with Clubhouse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google used to be really, really good at finding exactly what I told it to find. Nowadays, it&#39;s turned into the yellow pages; sponsored content from businesses trying to sell me goods and services.Can people suggest good alternatives or search patterns for certain categories of information or search types?Some of the search patterns I currently I use:* Youtube for product reviews and demos, entertainment, music and educational material.* Google with site:reddit.com at the start for questions best answered by other humans; crowd-sourced answers, authentic replies from mostly real people.* Google with site:news.ycombinator.com if I want to find &#34;forum-like&#34; discussion on topics I&#39;m interested in.* Google Image search with site:amazon.co.uk when looking for niche products I need to buy, because Amazon&#39;s search is so incredibly broken and game-ified.What I&#39;m having a heck of a time finding is technical content; long-form programming tutorials, deep dives into academic concepts (I do a lot of signal/audio processing and search for blog posts related to these topics), circuit schematics, electronic engineering content. These used to exist on enthusiast forums 10-15 years ago, but Google often no longer surfaces hits from these forums, both because the content is old and the forum model is dying. Reddit is the &#34;replacement&#34; but it plagued with low-effort &#34;look at my thing&#34; posts that help nobody."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Marketing.The one thing I pushed off for as long as possible. Because it was always easier to build more, than it was to go into marketing / sales.No clever tricks, or growth hacks. Me and my cofounders just connected with everyone we could on LinkedIn, twitter, discord, etc. and talked to people about the product: https://rysolv.com/.In fact, part of the reason we delayed marketing was looking for some clever way to 10x, or make it go viral. A big motivator was Paul Graham&#39;s &#34;do things that don&#39;t scale&#34; post [1]. So we just sat down and talked to people.[1] http://paulgraham.com/ds.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It might sound dumb, but monetizing my site was the stepping stone to make it take off. I run a solitaire website called https://online-solitaire.com/ that ran for a few years without me earning any money from it. I kind of thought that no-one earned money from banner ads anymore, so I didn&#39;t even bother with them.One day I decided to try it out and earned around $1000 the first month. That gave me the boost to spent time improving the site, optimizing speed and improving SEO. A couple of years later, the site is now earning $10k+ a month ."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Commoditize your complement&#34;I had hosting issues in many of my companies and consulting projects, running from &#34;WTF is this AWS bill $10k???&#34; to &#34;WTF did our 10gbit/s download just kick Heroku offline?&#34;But people can only appreciate the things I build for them if they are hosted well. So I took the obvious next step and purchased a small struggling hosting company. We then introduced nicer tooling that imitates the AWS and Heroku APIs if possible, to make using their servers as easy as possible for me. And now I can offer managed hosting to all of my consulting clients. For them, it&#39;s slightly cheaper prices and (in contrast with AWS and Heroku) they can just call me when things don&#39;t work. And for me, it&#39;s reliable high-margin revenue."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was really close to becoming a Linode customer last week for several large boxes, but ended up buying hardware and self-hosting.The cost to cut in an enterprise fiber link (1000/400) to our office was surprisingly low.My experience trialling linode as a paying customer was really positive (VERY competitive price, great performance), only complaint being their NodeBalancer can’t automatically handle certificates like CF and AWS can.Also, it needs to be mentioned because there’s a lot of negative in this thread: HUGE shout out to Linode for being massive community supporters and donating HEAPS of free compute to uni clubs and such, pretty much anyone with a charity certificate who asks for it. Fantastic company that’s easy to ‘just talk to people’ rather than trying to find the right support silo."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Happy linode user since 2004 when I was 13 years old. Has always been my go-to for just having a linux vps running somewhere in the cloud.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve done this a few times, some things to think about if you decide to take the plunge.1. New backs aren&#39;t always made well, often with the mounting posts not lining up as well as they should.2. New batteries are a crap shoot. Most don&#39;t last as long nor are rated as high as advertised. On the 5g and later, you can put in a much larger battery in them, but you need the thicker case.3. If you mod an iPod mini, use a higher quality sd to compact flash adapter. The cheaper ones, end up having weird issues when transferring files.4. If Rockbox seems temperamental it&#39;s not just you. It can take a bit to work out the issues it has with your iPod, from buggy themes to random crashes.5. If your music doesn&#39;t play right through Rockbox (clipped music) or playing music on rockbox seems to crash device, the issue was the file transfer. To fix, reboot the iPod to the stock Apple Firmware, delete the old files, and then transfer them again. Apple firmware handles file transfers much better than Rockbox.6. If your iPod hasn&#39;t been charged in a long time, it might not come up when first connected to power. Sometimes, leaving the iPod attached to power for a day or two will allow it to get enough charge to get into actual recharge mode. Older models re"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The big thing here is the concept of a device doing ONE thing and doing it well. Is there a name for that?I&#39;ve been rocking an iPod Video for like 15 years and it is still my go-to music device. All the stereos in my office, house and shop have a 3.5mm cable hanging from them.I&#39;ve also been using rockbox so I can play FLAC files. The ipod is on it&#39;s 4th battery at this point and I&#39;ve also upgraded to SD cards from the internal HD about 6 years ago. The screen is not working in a few places now, but the thing keeps working and I&#39;d be very sad if it ever stopped because I&#39;m not sure what would replace it.Whenever I&#39;m programming and I feel like I&#39;ve been very productive, it&#39;s often the times I&#39;m using this ipod with headphones - instead of a music playing piece of software. Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m less inclined to open up the software and spend time choosing an album/podcast/etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve debated buying another standalone portable music player for some time (about ten years after I got my first smartphone and stupidly gave my Sansa Fuze+ to a friend, who promptly lost it), but none of them really tick all the boxes for me.I want:- A high-quality DAC- A headphone jack- Expandable memory or a ridiculously large HDD (I have about a terabyte of music)- A modern connector/charging port (like USB-C)- 20+ hours of battery lifeThe problem I have is that resurrecting old devices like an iPod or a Sansa falls back onto era of proprietary chargers, which I worry about losing and not being able to find replacements.On the other hand, I periodically search for &#34;newer&#34; audiophile player devices, and a bunch of them feel like Android phones without the phone part. I don&#39;t want a smartphone OS, because then the battery life is inevitably going to be many times worse than the standalone mp3 player batteries of old. I don&#39;t need an app store, or a battery-sucking high quality display screen for watching videos. I just want it to play my music."</p>

					<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30335455">Ask HN: Why is Firefox losing marketshare and how would you save it?</a></h3>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30335455">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"They should focus on saving Firefox.- Cut out all (or at the very least, most) initiatives that don&#39;t serve the goal of promoting Firefox&#39;s market share or sustainability going forward- Donate the major money drains that aren&#39;t Firefox to the Apache Foundation or another worthy custodian- Fire all inessential staff that don&#39;t want to work on Firefox.- Get a CEO/upper management that are in it for the passion, not the money, and cut their salaries (bonuses tied directly to increase in Firefox market share).- Make sure that all donations from now on are redirected to things that support Firefox development and nothing else, period.- Make whatever partnerships are needed to have a steady stream of income, be that donation or selling out to Google or Bing.Firefox is in trouble. Firefox is also Mozilla&#39;s raison d&#39;être, and they should embrace that. We as a community, cannot afford to let Firefox languish until the only browsers in the world are Chromium derivatives. The diversity of truly independent browser engines is far too important to give up without a fight."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My thoughts on this are that every time I see a news piece about Firefox it&#39;s about &#34;social justice&#34;, some code of conduct controversy, or something else utterly unimportant to web browser selection.Being &#34;Open Source&#34; does nothing for me when Firefox engages in the same crap as other closed source browsers, like Pocket. Mozilla also allowed social issues to take precedence over retaining good engineers. Whether you like it or not, even assholes have a basic right to exist and the more recent culture of shun and cancel has had negative consequences for society as a whole. Maybe they were assholes, but I don&#39;t give a shit how nice the developers who made my web browser are.I suppose the problem with Mozilla is the CEO/people who make decisions about Firefox, replace them and maybe Firefox could be revived. But I have extraordinary doubts that Firefox is salvageable at this point. Mozilla&#39;s priorities have strayed so far from mine that I cannot see them becoming something I care about any time soon. I suspect it is similar for others.There is not one issue with Firefox, the people in charge are not competent. It&#39;s mistake after mistake after mistake. These mistakes are a direct result of prioritizing diversity over talent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would:- Prioritise getting the new extension framework fully functional. And continue innovating on the capabilities that are exposed. Especially on mobile where the new fenix engine is still limited to a small whitelist of extensions- Sort out the multi-profile story. Container tabs are great, but the chrome model is also a great fit for many workflow (e.g. different people in a house or home vs. work profiles).- Try and work on making Gecko easily embeddable again. Webkit/Blink gets all the attention because it&#39;s easy to embed into things. I suspect Gecko needs to compete in this market if it hopes to survive. It needs to have more than one company invested in it.This ship has probably sailed now as they&#39;ve fired most of their Rust and Servo teams. But IMO they ought to have created a rust-based cross-platform UI framework. They tried to do it web-based with Firefox OS but that was too slow. But with a Rust solution I think they could have owned both the mobile and desktop application spaces, which could potentially have made them a bootload of money and been a huge win for linux."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We never hear about broken and worn-out products. Pretty much all gear nowadays is baseline ok, it’s the negatives that really set things apart.For once, let&#39;s turn it all upside down:We should build a collection about how things break - review broken and worn-out products to teach how to identify cheap products. That&#39;s why I built failscout.coIt&#39;s simple: You upload your broken products and quickly describe how long you owned them, how often you used them, and where they failed.Everything breaks eventually, but when it does, can you easily repair/fix it? That&#39;s why users can suggest a fix to a broken/inconvenienced product.What could we do with all this data?- Identifying the common failure modes of product- Collect fixes for common product failures- See if a product&#39;s quality has changed or gone down at some point- Add a simple JSON API so other sites and projects can leverage our data."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a fan of the exit review.  Something that is no longer being used (for any reason) and there is now perspective.  I first saw bunnie do it at https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=242 quoting the first two paragraphs:&gt; I think it’s time to start a new kind of gadget review: the exit review.&gt; Gadgets always seem to arrive on the scene with a lot of splash and hype, but rarely do you find an article telling you how the gadget fared in Real Life. The Exit Review is something I’m going to try doing every time I retire a major gadget of mine; the idea of it is to reflect upon how the gadget performed over its duration of service. Of course, reviews like this are all hindsight, so they don’t drive sales — which probably explains why nobody does them, because there’s no money to be made doing them. However, as a design engineer I think there are lessons to be learned through reflection, and as a consumer I believe that apples don’t fall to far from the tree — a good gadget maker will get my business again, and a bad one will never see another dime from me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"i love the idea of the site but i would like to see one change.  Instead of adding a product when it breaks, let someone add it when they buy it then send a yearly reminder of the products they have added and if they want to update their status.  this would have the benefit of:
-tracking % of product failures
-finding out if they function longer then they are needed.
-finding out which products outlast others before they get to the point failure
-potentially notify/warn users of potential issues that come up to before theirs breaksI think a lot of people dont care enough to upload info just to help product designers, some will do it to help out other consumers, but if you can provide more value to the person with the product you want info on that should get you the most engagement."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You can read and write binary, including null, in pure bash, without even subshells, let alone external processes like dd and xxd.This is a driver/client for a vintage portable disk drive that has an rs232 interface. Any disk drive obviously has to handle arbitrary data including binary including 0x00.It&#39;s entirely in native bash with no external tools and not even any subshells. It does have to call stty and mkfifo once at startup, but that&#39;s just startup like to open the serial port, not part of the work.https://github.com/bkw777/pdd.shThe gimmick for reading nulls is not exactly efficient. Basically you read one character at a time and look at the errorlevel from read to detect the difference between &#34;got nothing&#34; and &#34;got 0x00&#34;It&#39;s fine for this case because the drive is so slow and small that even the entire disk is only  200k max. Making bash read one byte at a time for 200k is still nothing today but only because hardware is insane today.But it&#39;s possible. And the beginning of the post does say &#34;as a thought experiment&#34;.Similarly, you don&#39;t need xxd to convert back &amp; forth between raw binary and text encoding.My own similar thought experiment included the idea that, if I&#39;m not going to use any external process I can possibly avoid and only use internal bash features, on the flip side of that, I will squeez bash for all it&#39;s worth, allow every bashism possible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Long ago I worked tech support for a company that supported some mainframe equipment.Eventually after some incidents they introduced “special instructions” for customers who we had to gather extra troubleshooting data for because of some complex issues they had.Then a few more customers had special instructions… and a few more.Eventually these involved things like “Send the account manager an email for each call, this customer is very sensitive.”After just a year EVERY account had special instructions.Many people oriented instructions were impossible to follow “Page Jim.”  Jim didn’t carry a pager anymore and when he did he would never respond so you couldn’t do step 2.Some involved gathering loads of memory dumps for issues long solved.  Others would have you follow program pointers to memory that didn’t exist so you would start over and over until you gave up and decided failing to do your job was preferable to losing your mind at 4am….Some instructions were multi page word documents expected to be read every time the customer called.  After reading it a dozen times a week it almost became impossible to notice if it had a slight change or not.One clever account manager trying to make sure tech support “noticed” his special instructions tried using a &lt;blink&gt; tag… entirely ignoring the issue that upon noticing the instructions they would be hard to read.   Thankfully the tag failed to work.As you can imagine eventually there were exasperated executive meetings about how nobody follows the special instructions.This is the world of protecting against corner cases."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; designing a human process around pathological cases leads to processes that are themselves pathological.Very true.I remember, back when I was still interested in helping companies succeed, one “interview” I had.I mentioned that I had this ginormous portfolio, packed with dozens of highly relevant, finished, tested, well-documented, well-designed open-source projects, a decade of checkin history, of tens of thousands of lines of code, hundreds of pages of documentation, dozens of articles on various sites, where I walk through my design philosophies and processes, in detail, teaching modules, etc.The “interviewer” told me that they were not going to look at it, because “I could have faked it.”My jaw dropped.If I could fake that, then you should hire me immediately, at three times your offered salary.I’m pretty sure that the decision had already been made, not to consider me (because eld), and this was their way of chasing me off. They weren’t going to waste the half hour or so, that it would take to do a quick review of my work.It worked a treat. I couldn’t hang up, fast enough. I won’t go where I’m not wanted.The other explanation, is that they actually believed what they said, which would mean they were completely insane."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"When protests were happening in India this is what Trudeau had to say:&#34;Let me remind you, Canada will always be there to defend the rights of peaceful protesters. We believe in the process of dialogue. We’ve reached out through multiple means to the Indian authorities to highlight our concerns. This is a moment for all of us to pull together,&#34;Justin Trudeau said.https://indianexpress.com/article/india/situation-is-concern..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The Emergencies Act is the modern-day replacement to the War Measures Act. It allows the federal government to force companies to provide services, it can require public protests to end, and limit mobility rights by preventing people from moving to designating areas.&gt;&gt; The act also allows for the military to be used as police, but several sources said that is not under active consideration.Not a good look for Trudeau. This definitely looks like an authoritarian response to a loss of mandate. The protestors will dig in more, the response will become harsher, and the government will be in deeper trouble."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting way to approach it, my approach might be less technical, when someone comes to mind randomly, I just txt them with:  Hey, you just popped into my mind, I hope all is well with you and yours!

It&#39;s simple, lightweight, and you&#39;d be shocked how often the other person pings back.My completely un-scientific view is that most people think of others once in a while. Perhaps we&#39;re too busy to reach out, or the guilt of getting out of touch makes it hard to push through that resistance. I just push through it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some comments here claim that he is treating people not as friends. IMO these comments are not charitable a interpretation. While it is a plausible interpretation, I have strongly learned from HN to be charitable and optimistic when reading someone else&#39;s point of view. I know with topics like this that perspectives vary more wildly among people, so let me show you why I can be more optimistic in my interpretation.I think it&#39;s perfectly fine to separate emotions and reason like this. The reason: I am on the other side when it comes to managing my friends: I am not separating reason and emotion. Because of that, I am failing hard at staying in touch with people that I would like to stay in touch with (I am noticing it with certain friends of my as well). I am succeeding to stay in touch with a few people, but if I&#39;d have a system like this I might be able to stay in touch with many more people that I&#39;d like to stay in touch with anyway but for some unknown reason have some sort of blockade or friction.Other than that I think the interpretation is not charitable enough, I also have personal experience that it might be wrong. For example, I view the dating markets strictly from a market perspective that is heavily inspired by micro-economics and &#34;common sense&#34;. Initially, such a perspective is detached from emotion, but there are certain points where it is attached (e.g. with supply/demand questions like: &#34;what do I want/need from a partner&#34; or &#34;What can I offer? What do I want to offer? What do I need to offer?&#34;). Moreover, upon meeting people there is empathy, sympathy  and human intuition involved. Sometimes the emotions will be so strong that I have a compulsion towards meeting a person again (e.g. falling in love). Those emotions are not helping! Sometimes I feel the right amount that is also in line with my other needs and in other cases I don&#39;t feel enough about a certain person when I don&#39;t see them (but when I do see them, I am delighted to catch up).Management of personal life != how people are on a moment by moment basis in personal lifeI think by having a system like this, you can put Dunbar&#39;s number to shame."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think so-called ASCII-art is more in the spirit of Markdown.The nice thing about the original Markdown (modulo bugs) is that things are written the way one would write plaintext documents which are supposed to be easily read in a text editor.  So you don’t write bullet lists like this:- Bullet 1 - Bullet 2 - Bullet 3And hope that some post-processing will add linebreaks for you.  You write it like this:- Bullet 1- Bullet 2- Bullet 3Similarily there have been many tools that let you add so-called ASCII-art diagrams to Markdown documents.The spirit behind the kind of thing in the OP, on the other hand, is that one should get nicely formatted HTML from Markdown for the purpose of online consumption.  Which is a very different goal.So if I were to judge the syntax itself (since that is what matters most to the original spirit of Markdown.pl) I would say that it seems pretty decent.  Not as “declarative” (!) as ASCII-art, but most probably much easier to edit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m super excited for this!One thought though, on the syntax. Wouldn’t it be a bit odd if suddenly this line in a README.md:   ```js
   const foo = 1 + 1
   ```

Rendered as:   `2`

? Isn’t that kind of what we’re doing here with the mermaid source tag? That tag is for showing source code, no? Feels like there should be another tag for rendering it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Joplin, the Open source note-taking app¹, has Mermaid built-in.I use those a lot when keeping my notes on arcitectures, design patterns and software design. I prefer this, vastly, over Google Docs + draw.io.The only thing I dislike about Mermaid-in-Joplin is that the live-pre-render of the actual chart fails and shows an error whenever there is an error in the source of the diagram. Which makes sense. But is annoying because *when you are typing out the syntax, there always is an error untill you finish the class, object, some bracket or relation.¹https://joplinapp.org/ EDIT: I&#39;m not affiliated to joplin in any way. Just love it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had an XPS, top of the line with full warranty/premium support. Horrible experience. They swapped many models to a shitty wifi card that caused bsod. I had to spend over 15+ hrs with support to finally convince them the fix was to swap the card to the original Intel and not doing another system restore or reformat.Then the battery. Oh the battery. The computer would randomly wake up from hibernate and drain the battery till it was dead. This also caused premature drain. Guess what? Dells batteries are rated for less cycles (half compared to apple) and this seemed to coincide with the end of my warranty period (time to buy a new one) but it doesn&#39;t even matter because their premium support only covers battery replacements for the first year!And get this! They only sell refurbished batteries. Just everything about this company is trash.The XPS is a nice line. It is very premium, but only skin deep"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The conflict between the market wanting systems that are (a) as small and light as possible and (b) as fast as possible means that modern systems are designed to have close integration between the platform and the OS to perform appropriate thermal management. If the OS doesn&#39;t indicate that it supports doing this, the hardware will run in a much more constrained mode. Apple can do this without too much trouble since they implement the whole stack, but it&#39;s more complicated in the PC space. Intel have a spec called Dynamic Power and Thermal Framework (DPTF), but the useful part of it is the adaptive thermal policy, and Intel refuse to publicly document it.I reverse engineered a chunk of this (https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/54923.html) and it got merged into Intel&#39;s Thermal Daemon (https://github.com/intel/thermal_daemon) which /should/ improve things, but it&#39;s complicated by this mechanism allowing for vendor-specific controls that are usually implemented by having a background service running under Windows that triggers them.There&#39;s multiple things that can be criticised here:
1) Intel pushing OEMs to adopt a technology that they (a) don&#39;t document and (b) don&#39;t write proper Linux support for
2) Canonical not making it clear that OEM certification only requires that the system work, not that it work as well as it does under Windows
3) Dell not figuring out a decent solution for this, even for systems that they nominally support Linux onDell could build hardware that doesn&#39;t rely on adaptive thermal management, but that hardware would either be bigger or slower than competitors&#39; hardware. Fixing this unilaterally is hard - we need an open spec that&#39;s implemented by both hardware vendors and integrated into mainstream Linux distributions. Given where we are, the easiest way to get there would be for Intel to publicly document DPTF."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a reminder: don&#39;t buy Dell, they have a history of ignoring issues and refusing to fix.The US needs to adopt EU-style consumer laws."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This last summer/fall really put things in perspective for me.  We did a major outdoor renovation at our house, which involved landscapers, plumbers, electricians, and carpenters.Every day these guys would show up at 8am and long sleeves and jeans and hard hats, work super hard, pee in a port-a-potty, and be exhausted by the end of the day.  They worked out in the 100 degree heat as well as the rain as the job got near the end.  Luckily the bosses were pretty cool and provided them with decent food for lunch and plenty of drinks (but I still offered them food and drinks too).I on the other hand was working at my desk in my air conditioned house in comfortable clothes.  A few times a day I&#39;d put on my flip-flops and wander around outside to check on their work, ask a few questions, and then head back in when it got too hot.And a couple of times the plumbing sprung a leak just as they were getting ready to leave, despite their best efforts to get all the risky work done early, and they they had to stay super late.  Once the plumber was here till midnight after arriving at 8am.I used to have thoughts about how it would be nice to have a job with totally spelled out requirements that end at 5pm and then you have the rest of the day off.  But no more.  I&#39;d much rather work at my comfy desk inside and deal with the occasional call at 9pm on a Saturday than deal with what they all went through."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A professor of mathematics noticed that his kitchen sink at his home leaked. He called a plumber. The plumber came the next day and sealed a few screws, and everything was working as before.The professor was delighted. However, when the plumber gave him the bill a minute later, he was shocked.&#34;This is one-third of my monthly salary!&#34; he yelled.Well, all the same he paid it and then the plumber said to him, &#34;I understand your position as a professor. Why don&#39;t you come to our company and apply for a plumber position? You will earn three times as much as a professor. But remember, when you apply, tell them that you completed only seven elementary classes. They don&#39;t like educated people.&#34;So it happened. The professor got a job as a plumber and his life significantly improved. He just had to seal a screw or two occasionally, and his salary went up significantly.One day, the board of the plumbing company decided that every plumber had to go to evening classes to complete the eighth grade. So, our professor had to go there too. It just happened that the first class was math. The evening teacher, to check students&#39; knowledge, asked for a formula for the area of a circle. The person asked was the professor. He jumped to the board, and then he realized that he had forgotten the formula. He started to reason it, and he filled the white board with integrals, differentials, and other advanced formulas to conclude the result he forgot. As a result, he got &#34;minus pi times r square.&#34;He didn&#39;t like the minus, so he started all over again. He got the minus again. No matter how many times he tried, he always got a minus. He was frustrated. He gave the class a frightened look and saw all the plumbers whisper: &#34;Switch the limits of the integral!!&#34;"</p>

Someone may legitimately prefer the stresses of a trade to the stresses of working in software, and that&#39;s great for them. But it&#39;s not an objectively easier path: if it were, plumbers would be much less expensive."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30322715">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was a multi-week long social engineering scam targeted at Thomas. Thomas has a Discord for a drone transportation startup, and the scammers proceeded to embed themselves in the community and provide valuable labor such as web design and graphics design in order to earn his trust.Thomas&#39;s wallet is public and advertised on Twitter via his ENS domain. He had $100M+ in aETH, a derivative token provided by Aave when you lend out your assets for interest. The aETH is redeemable for the underlying asset.The scammers created a fake NFT project associated with space and drones, and proceeded to give Thomas a free one, but asked that he stake it (or deposit it into a smart contract), to earn yield in the form of Armstrong ETH, a token they made up that had the same acronym as Aave&#39;s (aETH).The catch was that when he went to stake his NFT, they asked for an approval for spending aETH from his wallet. Approvals such as this are normal when interacting with smart contracts, since the contract has to be &#34;delegated&#34; responsibility over the tokens in order to move them. However, what wasn&#39;t normal is that the approval was actually for Aave ETH.If he had only looked at the front end of the scam site, it wasn&#39;t obvious what was going on. However, a quick glance at Etherscan revealed that he had signed off on an unlimited spend approval for Aave ETH.Luckily, he had done so on a fresh wallet and not his main wallet that has $100M in aETH. When the scammers tried to get him to stake a second NFT from his main account, he got suspicious and discovered the truth.This scam was specifically targeted at Thomas, and orchestrated over multiple weeks, for the specific assets in his primary wallet.Couple takeaways:- divide your assets across multiple wallets. New wallets are free. Don&#39;t put all your eggs in one basket.- use a hardware wallet or an audited battle tested smart contract such as Gnosis Safe for storing significant sums of money.- always verify your transactions- avoid associating your public identity with your main wallet / vault address- be careful, scammers are getting more creative and advanced in technique including standing up professional front end websites to give the appearance of legitimacy"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can get behind cryptocurrency and stuff, but the idea that anyone can write a contract that says &#34;I get to do what I want with your money&#34; and then build their own custom, one of a kind UI with no way to limit what the user thinks the button does for you to sign such a transaction, it&#39;s got to be the biggest, most massive security hole I&#39;ve ever seen brushed off. You want me to put the title to my house on it? You want code to be law?This shit isn&#39;t ready for the mainstream, and some of these architectural decisions are indicative of engineers who are in over their heads (but that&#39;s almost all code nowadays, even mine).They build a mechanism that enables me, at the click of a button, to give away control of my fortune, and they designed the system so that anyone can design whatever interface they like to get you to sign any transaction they like. It&#39;s laughable. I&#39;m in disbelief. And this is web3? No thanks, I think I&#39;ll stick with bitcoin or whatever, keep it simple. At least I can tell what a bitcoin transaction does without having to learn a programming language."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was an absolutely fascinating and chilling story.The thing that struck me about it is the scam didn&#39;t work for a few reasons:1. He typically had a practice of not using his main wallet for things like this.2. He got wary and actually read the smart contracts.This is a level of technical competence required that&#39;s going to mean most people have to offload this to a trusted intermediary. And then what&#39;s the point of all the decentralization ideology? Because we just re-invented banks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Blind person here, happy to answer any questions. I&#39;m speaking from the perspective of someone born blind, so whatever ends up working well for me might not work as well for someone just losing their sight, though I tried to take that fact into account.The most immediate suggestions that come to mind are:1. Learn to use a screen reader. You don&#39;t need an expensive one. NVDA on Windows, Voice Over on the Mac and Orca on Linux are the way to go. NVDA is probably the least quirky and easiest to find resources for. I&#39;d recommend against Orca, while it can be used, we all know how tricky Linux on the desktop can get, and throwing a screen reader into the mix doesn&#39;t help.2. Forget about the mouse. Screen reader users use the keyboard exclusively. Try disabling the screen too, many sighted users who practice with a screen reader end up relying on what they can see, which makes things more difficult.3. Accept that inaccessibility is a fact of life, and it has to be worked around. Not all tools are accessible, and some are more accessible than others. If you&#39;re looking for an accessible IDE, Vs Code is great and constantly improving. Emacspeak exists, but I don&#39;t actually know anyone who uses it, and I know quite a few blind people in tech. Some things that you&#39;re now doing through a GUI are best done via the command line, Git is a good example. Programming tools usually aren&#39;t the problem, it&#39;s everything else that causes issues. Slack and Zoom work great, for example, but many smaller collaboration tools don&#39;t.4. Not all areas of programming are equally accessible. I can&#39;t imagine a blind dev working exclusively on the front end, where there&#39;s a lot of CSS involved, and where you have to look at Figma designs and debug issues solely based on screenshots. Backend stuff is much more accessible, same with lower-level systems programming. Dev Ops is very much a mixed bag.I&#39;m happy to answer any further questions either here or via email, my HN username at gmail dot com."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Outside of the dev needs take a look at bemyeyes.com, it allows a person with vision problems to video call a volunteer to help answer questions. I&#39;ve helped people read labels, sort boxes of chocolate for Christmas presents and help a person find the login dialog after they lost track ofwhere it was. Each call only took a minute or two. Highly recommended to volunteer, only takes a minute to help and you don&#39;t have to answer the call if you are unavailable, it just hops to another volunteer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I guess this is the end of &#34;sending customer data to the us&#34;.
Quite impressive how fast the US-politics can burn billions in $, endanger the technological lead and build a massive opportunity for Europe!I, as a European could not be happier about this, from a economic standpoint.Hope you guys over there are not drifting to a surveillance dystopian."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"US folks who are interested in writing their Senators can find information at https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm?OrderBy...FWIW, I sent the email below (largely cribbed from the EFF).Dear :I am a constituent.  I urge you to oppose the EARN IT act, S.3538.  It does not strike a reasonable balance between fighting crimes and the rights of users to privacy and encryption.The bill empowers every state or territory to create sweeping new Internet regulations, by stripping away the legal protections for websites and apps in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. The states will be allowed to pass whatever law they want to hold private companies liable, as long as they somehow relate their new rules to online child abuse.The bill’s sponsors have stated that EARN IT will pressure Internet companies to do widespread scanning of user messages and photos. This scanning is incompatible with strong encryption.  Consequently, the act allows states to pass laws that will punish companies when they deploy end-to-end encryption, or offer other encrypted services. This includes messaging services like WhatsApp, Signal, and iMessage, as well as web hosts like Amazon Web Services.The sponsors have falsely claimed that the act would protect children. But abusive images are already highly illegal under federal law. Any Internet platforms that knows about child sexual abuse material being distributed or received are required to take action on it, and can be severely prosecuted if they do not.EARN IT would lead to penalties for people and companies that use encryption.  The harm done by this will fall on vulnerable people. Once we allow encryption to be compromised in order to scan for one thing, authoritarian regimes will demand the same capabilities to track information shared by activists and journalists. Another example is that people subject to domestic abuse, including children, won’t have secure channels of communication to report and reach out for trusted help.Once again, I urge you to oppose the EARN IT act.Thank you,"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For me SO_REUSEPORT was only a solution to be able to immediately reuse a port when a process crashed in some odd way and the OS was not releasing the port immediately.When I read that multiple processes can use the port it finally made sense to me how nginx is able to spawn so many workers. If they are listening to port 80 or 443 with SO_REUSEPORT, each worker would get a new client in a round robin fashion, effectively spreading the workload without depending on the main parent process to pipe the data to them (and back to the client), which is how I thought that it was working.The funny thing about this submission was that when I read the title I somehow thought I was reading it on Stack Overflow and was expecting a noob asking this question and didn&#39;t know what kind of answers I was about to be confronted with and if I should get excited to see a really good one.Then, while in the article, I liked how it started to raise so many issues, fanning out into these special cases which really made it a valid question to ask what it does mean to listen to a port, how complicated it can become.Sadly the article does not go into any detail, like showing snippets of C code from the networking stack and explaining how it is really working, how each requirement (or kluge, for that matter) is being satisfied, but it&#39;s OK, it&#39;s an article which touches the subject in an enticing enough way while having an excuse to not deep-dive into the details by keeping it in the form of a dialog between two students.I liked it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What is strange about Discord is this great discrepancy between the ones that love it and the ones that hate it. If I were to guess on the reason of why that might be it would be that Discord is probably really good for the people that are constantly on it, and don&#39;t really miss any communication going in. These people have probably been there for some time so they don&#39;t feel the problem of not knowing where the past information is, because they were there when that information was communicated and therefore never need to look back at it. These people will (obviously) recommend using Discord, since it works so well for them!The problem arises when you have people that just now-and-then hop into the Discord. These people are not in the &#34;clique&#34; so they don&#39;t feel comfortable talking/discussing too much in the channels, and they also really have no clue where to go for any of the lost information these super users don&#39;t even think about. This is probably why I never really use Discord except for voice, since I just don&#39;t get anything at all from reading an endless chat log. It&#39;s like being someone stepping in to a tight knit friend group with a long history and no way of looking into it.Discord will most likely have to figure out how they can keep it so that it works for these super users, but somehow make the information organized for people that aren&#39;t hard core community members.Edit: Wrote &#34;clique&#34; wrong"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Endless scrolling is a black hole for information. And the hawking radiation that comes out is keyboard diarrhea.If I were trying to subtly encourage pounding out content free crap, I would probably want people to use difficult to search, non paginated scroll feeds as much as possible.Discord might be a black hole, but Discourse has some of the same properties. Facebook is the same way.Anything that funnels people into multi-thousand post individual pages is going to lose information.Old proboards forums, github issues, and wikis don&#39;t have this problem.  Content is in smaller blocks that can be linked to easily, and there is a strong culture of keeping topics focused.  You don&#39;t have multiple unrelated conversations in one place.You can jump to the end or beginning of a thread when quickly skimming to see if it&#39;s relevant.And you can see all threads in a given time period pretty easily with pagination, when you want to understand the larger picture at a point and time.These are all things that are useful both for a sense of community and for technical work itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a strong believer in Zulip with respect to a perfect mix between instant messaging and actually retaining information- functionality for a public export (can also restrict to specific channels), .e.g. https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/- in addition to the above, they are working on a guest mode, so you can read the discussions without logging in -- hopefully that would make it possible to index without setting up a separate archive hosting https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/13172- messages/threads have proper meaningful URLs (unlike random obfuscated UUIDs like in Discord)- you can easily open things in new tabs -- unlike Discord, where search pane takes like 10% of the screen, or Slack where once you clicked on search result, you lose the context about the remaining results- you can login with Github (so no need to register for many people, at least for programming-related projects)"</p>

Back in the day you didn&#39;t run into that very often where we lived so it was pretty cool to see.  That boosted my conviction for my choice of IDE and I started bringing my laptop out to the bars in the evenings as well.  Years later my friend and I built a business and pretty much all the code was written in the evenings at one of those bars.  You can be social and code at the same time it turns out, and coding prevented me from drinking too much while I was out.  No real morale to the story, just an anecdote I wanted to share.  That said, congrats on the bounty saurik!"</p>

We would wait the whole year for mango season (August/September). As kids, our clothes would all get mango stains. Our parents would make us take our shirts off before we eat them to avoid that.I moved to the US, and I haven&#39;t had a good mango here. When friends visit Egypt, I tell them to get mangoes (in season, around September), especially a variety known as Eweis. They get obsessed. I&#39;ve never figured out why the US just doesn&#39;t have good mangoes, I&#39;m guessing they&#39;re hard to grow locally or ship."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For growing mango from seed, or really anything from seed, you cannot beat a small plastic container (like what cottage cheese, sour cream, or green yogurt might come in) filled halfway with coconut coir. It&#39;s absolutely the best medium for germinating seed. Fill halfway with coir and water once a week. Coconut coir keeps water evenly distributed and I&#39;ve never had a seed or seedling mold over using it.I personally use 2 lb greek yogurt (or soup, as in from Costco) containers because the extra height also lets me keep the seed in there longer and develop initial root structure. That&#39;s incredibly helpful for transferring to pots, and a little coconut coir in the soul doesn&#39;t hurt."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my mind, state is the real enemy impacting: comprehension, 
brittleness towards making changes, and the surface area exposed to potential bugs. OOP as frequently implemented, while claiming to encapsulate state, ends up creating so much more.In accordance with this view, I think project architecture should be approached with an emphasis around how much state is necessary for it to run. This is why simulations like say someone making a game or simcity with like relatively independent entities that map to something in real life use OOP. If you&#39;re writing a service doing requests, you want as minimal state as possible. Singletons are state. Initialized/non-static objects are state. The smaller amount you have the easier it is to reason about the system.As I write this however, I worry a little that my view is overly simplistic, or maybe applicable only to domains that I have worked in. If anyone wouldn&#39;t mind poking holes in this argument or offering examples I would appreciate it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have not read the article but I&#39;ve seen other blog posts on the subject.
The issue with &#34;OOP is bad&#34; is that OOP means different things to different people.Abstract Data Types are sort of a subset of OOP and are massively useful, I certainly don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to expose the internal implementation of a data structure most of the time. Any sort of plugin system works in an OO matter. It is a useful tool, no question.Even things like Actors like in Erlang (which are much closer to the Alan Kay style OO) are massively useful in a distributed setting where state is naturally distributed.Where you get into trouble is when you go the whole &#34;lets model a taxonomy of the world&#34; style with inheritance hierarchies or go ham on design patterns, layers upon layers of abstraction and other nonsense like that.The saddest thing about the &#34;object–relational impedance mismatch&#34; is that the focus went totally to the wrong side. The relational model is a much nicer way to model relations than a graph of objects (that&#39;s the whole point after all). SQL sucks but that&#39;s a separate issue, Entity Component Systems are a form of relational modeling for example and work really well, or even better Datalog."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My issue with OOP is: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software.I don&#39;t take issue with the authors, with their insights, or anything related to the content of the book. It&#39;s that the book exists at all: it&#39;s a book filled with solutions to imaginary problems.When using a procedural language the first thing you do is start implementing a solution. When using OOP, you first have to solve the imaginary problems created by OOP, only then can you start down the path of typing out a solution.It&#39;s significantly more difficult to refactor OOP (even with great tools) than it is procedural.If you could spend 20% less brain power, possibly 40% fewer keystrokes to describe the exact same solution, why wouldn&#39;t you?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve developed quite a few SNES-related things for fun, mostly using Go and C++, with some 65816 ASM sprinkled in.https://github.com/alttpo/alttpo - A Link To The Past Online. Lets multiple players see and interact with one another in the same game world and synchronize their progress through the game. Exclusive to a customized fork of the bsnes emulator which provides a scripting language and PPU-integrated drawing routines to render remote player sprites. In retrospect, I consider this a dead-end architecture; redesigned in o2 project (see below).https://github.com/alttpo/o2 - Second version of alttpo (see above) but this time targeted at SNES hardware console support (via SD2SNES flash cart USB feature) and does not require a customized emulator nor a scripting language. Trade-off here is a loss of the visual aspect (cannot see remote player sprites) due to tight hardware limitations in the amount of VRAM and limited SNES CPU cycles available. Work is in progress to gain back the remote sprite rendering as an optional add-on via the bsnes-plus WASM module support (see below). This project includes a 65816 machine code emitter library (pure Go) with support for named labels of branch targets. There is also a bare-bones headless SNES emulator library (pure Go) included for unit tests to verify the generated 65816 ASM and ROM patching mechanism.https://github.com/alttpo/bsnes-plus - A fork of bsnes-plus in development that invokes WebAssembly modules when certain general SNES events occur, e.g. `on_nmi`, `on_power`, `on_reset`, `on_frame_present`. WASM code has access to a draw-list API for drawing into the various PPU layers, e.g. extra sprites, text (with PCF font support), basic shapes. WASM code can also receive arbitrary binary messages from external applications, e.g. to update remote player positions or exchange custom sprite graphics."</p>

Mesen-SX has a SPC debugger separate from the main debugger, but I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s more or less useful than bsnes-plus (I know the Mesen emulators have a far worse Linux UI when running under Mono, and I haven&#39;t tried running the Windows Mesen under Mono or real .NET yet). I don&#39;t know enough to judge if the disassembler is better or worse than bsnes-plus though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I never expected this to be on the front page of HN, it brings back so many memories. I was big into this game when I was a teenager back in 2010, 2011 until 2015, also being very active in the community that made this page in that period. Sadly, even all those years back, the online scene was still what most would consider dead. I have a bit of a thing for &#34;dead&#34; games, I wouldn&#39;t really consider 1-2 full servers at night to be dead, which is what we had. In the following years, however, server population declined even more, to the point where I would really consider it to be dead. I&#39;d love to be proven wrong though, but that was what I percieved.If you really wanted to ride the wave, I&#39;d tell you to get yourself a time machine and go all the way back to 2005, 2006 or 2007. Servers were ablaze with squadrons (~groups of people having their own paint schemes on certain aircraft, playing air-to-ground missions and air-to-air missions against other squadrons...) fighting and calling each other names. It wasn&#39;t pretty, but according to what I was told, passion wasn&#39;t exactly in short supply.Fun fact: the game looks like that because it has no textures. Instead, every polygon is colored individually. Through a recent update did give the terrain textures. Aircraft still don&#39;t have them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting; I was not aware of their existence. They seem to be free as in beer; not as in speech. They seem to make money with shareware provided by the same company.Nothing against closed source though. For example, I enjoy x-plane a lot which while not free (in either sense) of course has a large community providing both free and non free add-ons. This seems more of a game with a focus on combat and less on realism or looks.An actual free, open source flight simulator that deserves mentioning is Flightgear. I&#39;ve played with that a couple of times but always end up reverting to x-plane. But flightgear has some nice features and also a nice community. It just doesn&#39;t look and feel anywhere near as good as x-plane (which is a tall order because it is very good).Anyway, I checked out some footage on Youtube. Visually, it has nothing on even Flightgear; which I&#39;m pretty sure probably has some combat mods. Or even any version of that the last few decades or so, actually. It actually reminded me of some dos games I used to play in the early nineties. E.g. Jetfighter II (released 1990) was pretty awesome back in the day. It looks like that but with higher resolution. But e.g. the ground is a featureless green blob; just like in Jetfighter II, and clouds are white polygons hanging in the sky, etc. And Jetfighter II had a HUD that was about as feature rich as the one in this game. Of course it was way more pixelated than this. But they even managed a cockpit panel :-). I wouldn&#39;t call it photo realistic but it didn&#39;t look half bad for the time. There are probably better/later game that this thing is shooting for. But I just never really got into combat flight simulation.I guess they are trying to recreate some of that experience. Not that it matters; but I guess the gameplay is more important than the looks for this. Actually looks like it could be a lot of fun.BTW. I have nothing against MS Flightsimulator. The latest version looks great. But I just don&#39;t have any windows computers anymore at this point. Combat is not really something either of the other flightsims I mentioned are made for or even good at."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What is strange about Discord is this great discrepancy between the ones that love it and the ones that hate it. If I were to guess on the reason of why that might be it would be that Discord is probably really good for the people that are constantly on it, and don&#39;t really miss any communication going in. These people have probably been there for some time so they don&#39;t feel the problem of not knowing where the past information is, because they were there when that information was communicated and therefore never need to look back at it. These people will (obviously) recommend using Discord, since it works so well for them!The problem arises when you have people that just now-and-then hop into the Discord. These people are not in the &#34;clique&#34; so they don&#39;t feel comfortable talking/discussing too much in the channels, and they also really have no clue where to go for any of the lost information these super users don&#39;t even think about. This is probably why I never really use Discord except for voice, since I just don&#39;t get anything at all from reading an endless chat log. It&#39;s like being someone stepping in to a tight knit friend group with a long history and no way of looking into it.Discord will most likely have to figure out how they can keep it so that it works for these super users, but somehow make the information organized for people that aren&#39;t hard core community members.Edit: Wrote &#34;clique&#34; wrong"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Endless scrolling is a black hole for information. And the hawking radiation that comes out is keyboard diarrhea.If I were trying to subtly encourage pounding out content free crap, I would probably want people to use difficult to search, non paginated scroll feeds as much as possible.Discord might be a black hole, but Discourse has some of the same properties. Facebook is the same way.Anything that funnels people into multi-thousand post individual pages is going to lose information.Old proboards forums, github issues, and wikis don&#39;t have this problem.  Content is in smaller blocks that can be linked to easily, and there is a strong culture of keeping topics focused.  You don&#39;t have multiple unrelated conversations in one place.You can jump to the end or beginning of a thread when quickly skimming to see if it&#39;s relevant.And you can see all threads in a given time period pretty easily with pagination, when you want to understand the larger picture at a point and time.These are all things that are useful both for a sense of community and for technical work itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a strong believer in Zulip with respect to a perfect mix between instant messaging and actually retaining information- functionality for a public export (can also restrict to specific channels), .e.g. https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/- in addition to the above, they are working on a guest mode, so you can read the discussions without logging in -- hopefully that would make it possible to index without setting up a separate archive hosting https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/13172- messages/threads have proper meaningful URLs (unlike random obfuscated UUIDs like in Discord)- you can easily open things in new tabs -- unlike Discord, where search pane takes like 10% of the screen, or Slack where once you clicked on search result, you lose the context about the remaining results- you can login with Github (so no need to register for many people, at least for programming-related projects)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I grew up in Egypt, my dad is from a town on the Suez Canal called Ismailia, famous for its mangoes. We would wait the whole year for mango season (August/September). As kids, our clothes would all get mango stains. Our parents would make us take our shirts off before we eat them to avoid that.I moved to the US, and I haven&#39;t had a good mango here. When friends visit Egypt, I tell them to get mangoes (in season, around September), especially a variety known as Eweis. They get obsessed. I&#39;ve never figured out why the US just doesn&#39;t have good mangoes, I&#39;m guessing they&#39;re hard to grow locally or ship."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For growing mango from seed, or really anything from seed, you cannot beat a small plastic container (like what cottage cheese, sour cream, or green yogurt might come in) filled halfway with coconut coir. It&#39;s absolutely the best medium for germinating seed. Fill halfway with coir and water once a week. Coconut coir keeps water evenly distributed and I&#39;ve never had a seed or seedling mold over using it.I personally use 2 lb greek yogurt (or soup, as in from Costco) containers because the extra height also lets me keep the seed in there longer and develop initial root structure. That&#39;s incredibly helpful for transferring to pots, and a little coconut coir in the soul doesn&#39;t hurt."</p>

I&#39;d like to front a Louis Prima style jazz band.I&#39;ve been playing trumpet and trombone every day for the last 2 months.I don&#39;t care if I have any professional success.  But hard to say all that is a hobby.  Maybe I&#39;ll eventually be able to retire and just work as a musician, teaching and doing my little gigs and producing the records I engineer for other folks and running sound for the little parties we play out in the desert in Utah.Don&#39;t care.  My kids are raised, I&#39;ve got a reasonable remote day job.We&#39;ll see how it goes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been working on a project that aggregates data for every public transport provider in the country (Slovenia) and presents it as a simple API, along with an application to find rides with as few clicks as possible (without having to check every provider&#39;s website). This has involved tiring meetings with city officials convincing them to give us access to the data and writing scraping bots where they weren&#39;t convinced, so I&#39;ve sunk countless hours into the project.I currently know of only 3 people using it, but I&#39;m one of them and I believe this is something that should exist, so I don&#39;t care that I&#39;ll likely never evem break even on it. I&#39;ve started a nonprofit to fund the project, but it&#39;s been mostly my own money so far. Working on it has been really fun and I learned a ton about how stuff gets done in the intersection of public and private sector - both positive and negative.// For anyone in Slovenia interested in using it, there&#39;s an email in my profile. It&#39;s currently a closed beta, but everyone is welcome"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Android users are still vulnerable, and these announcements do nothing to reduce that. All a stalker needs to do, is remove the speaker. To detect a rogue AirTag, an Android owner needs to:1) know AirTags exist (many obviously don&#39;t)2) go out of their way to install Apple&#39;s Android AirTag scanner app (only 100k-500k worldwide have done so according to Google Play stats)3) manually open the scanner app and scan, since it doesn&#39;t scan passively in the background; and even then, it won&#39;t help you find the speaker-less AirTag, since it doesn&#39;t tell you proximity &amp; direction.I continue to think Apple should have never released AirTags to the public, and should discontinue it. It&#39;s a very limited income stream, with limited use cases, and significantly increases the average person&#39;s risk of stalking.Practically all positive social media coverage of AirTags involves someone tracking a stolen stolen items (car, bike). Those use cases are dead, since thieves with iPhones will get alerts, and most thieves with Android will know to scan for AirTags. And since most lost items turn into stolen items after a few hours, that removes most use cases involving losing objects in public.That leaves &#34;finding your keys within your home&#34; as the only truly &#34;officially supported&#34; use case. Is that worth all the problems, and brand damage?People will argue that stalkers could always buy trackers, but Apple increased their availability, ease-of-acquisition and ease-of-use by orders of magnitude. AirTags are cheaper than competing GPS trackers, most of which require subscriptions.I remember seeing a chills-down-your-spine Apple Watch Series 7 TV ad, that featured beautiful remote nature landscapes, with the audio of 911 calls made from people&#39;s Apple Watches whose lives were saved by their Watch. Probably one of Apple&#39;s best and most impactful ad in the past decade. Compare that to AirTag&#39;s impact on Apple&#39;s brand. Why did Apple even bother?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great response - very happy to hear Apple&#39;s involvement with various groups to make things better.Some noteworthy bits:&gt; we innovated with the first-ever proactive system to alert you of unwanted trackingIf that&#39;s true, then Apple just raised the privacy bar and now Tile and other small players need to up their game to stay relevant.There is also lesson to learn here: whoever makes a tech/product popular is the one who gets the heat for all its shortcomings/problems. It doesn&#39;t matter how many existing small players were doing a horrible job for years.&gt; As an iPhone user moves, Precision Finding fuses input from the camera, ARKit, accelerometer, and gyroscope to guide them to the AirTagThis is something that&#39;s not appreciated. The UWB chip on the Airtag can only help iPhone know how far away it is from the tag. It&#39;s 3D modelling of the world through camera vision that helps triangulate and guide the user via live on-screen direction.Next time you think why we need tech X, just remember that you can&#39;t foresee what it&#39;ll enable in the future - (and before you comment &#34;all AR stuff to find my keys faster?&#34;, re-read the previous sentence again)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the functionality of the AirTags so I don&#39;t want them nerfed, but I can think of no way to fix their fundamental problem of being such easy to use stalking devices.Chefs knives are great for cooking and are inexpensive and easy to purchase; they can be very dangerous weapons in the wrong hands so we make it against the law to use them in that manner. Maybe that&#39;s the best we can do with AirTags."</p>

Environmentalists are blocking  construction of more wind power, and crisis with Russia makes gas less accessible. France has a relatively good track record on nuclear power.

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30293622">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my mind, state is the real enemy impacting: comprehension, 
brittleness towards making changes, and the surface area exposed to potential bugs. OOP as frequently implemented, while claiming to encapsulate state, ends up creating so much more.In accordance with this view, I think project architecture should be approached with an emphasis around how much state is necessary for it to run. This is why simulations like say someone making a game or simcity with like relatively independent entities that map to something in real life use OOP. If you&#39;re writing a service doing requests, you want as minimal state as possible. Singletons are state. Initialized/non-static objects are state. The smaller amount you have the easier it is to reason about the system.As I write this however, I worry a little that my view is overly simplistic, or maybe applicable only to domains that I have worked in. If anyone wouldn&#39;t mind poking holes in this argument or offering examples I would appreciate it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have not read the article but I&#39;ve seen other blog posts on the subject.
The issue with &#34;OOP is bad&#34; is that OOP means different things to different people.Abstract Data Types are sort of a subset of OOP and are massively useful, I certainly don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to expose the internal implementation of a data structure most of the time. Any sort of plugin system works in an OO matter. It is a useful tool, no question.Even things like Actors like in Erlang (which are much closer to the Alan Kay style OO) are massively useful in a distributed setting where state is naturally distributed.Where you get into trouble is when you go the whole &#34;lets model a taxonomy of the world&#34; style with inheritance hierarchies or go ham on design patterns, layers upon layers of abstraction and other nonsense like that.The saddest thing about the &#34;object–relational impedance mismatch&#34; is that the focus went totally to the wrong side. The relational model is a much nicer way to model relations than a graph of objects (that&#39;s the whole point after all). SQL sucks but that&#39;s a separate issue, Entity Component Systems are a form of relational modeling for example and work really well, or even better Datalog."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My issue with OOP is: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software.I don&#39;t take issue with the authors, with their insights, or anything related to the content of the book. It&#39;s that the book exists at all: it&#39;s a book filled with solutions to imaginary problems.When using a procedural language the first thing you do is start implementing a solution. When using OOP, you first have to solve the imaginary problems created by OOP, only then can you start down the path of typing out a solution.It&#39;s significantly more difficult to refactor OOP (even with great tools) than it is procedural.If you could spend 20% less brain power, possibly 40% fewer keystrokes to describe the exact same solution, why wouldn&#39;t you?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"US folks who are interested in writing their Senators can find information at https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm?OrderBy...FWIW, I sent the email below (largely cribbed from the EFF).Dear :I am a constituent.  I urge you to oppose the EARN IT act, S.3538.  It does not strike a reasonable balance between fighting crimes and the rights of users to privacy and encryption.The bill empowers every state or territory to create sweeping new Internet regulations, by stripping away the legal protections for websites and apps in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. The states will be allowed to pass whatever law they want to hold private companies liable, as long as they somehow relate their new rules to online child abuse.The bill’s sponsors have stated that EARN IT will pressure Internet companies to do widespread scanning of user messages and photos. This scanning is incompatible with strong encryption.  Consequently, the act allows states to pass laws that will punish companies when they deploy end-to-end encryption, or offer other encrypted services. This includes messaging services like WhatsApp, Signal, and iMessage, as well as web hosts like Amazon Web Services.The sponsors have falsely claimed that the act would protect children. But abusive images are already highly illegal under federal law. Any Internet platforms that knows about child sexual abuse material being distributed or received are required to take action on it, and can be severely prosecuted if they do not.EARN IT would lead to penalties for people and companies that use encryption.  The harm done by this will fall on vulnerable people. Once we allow encryption to be compromised in order to scan for one thing, authoritarian regimes will demand the same capabilities to track information shared by activists and journalists. Another example is that people subject to domestic abuse, including children, won’t have secure channels of communication to report and reach out for trusted help.Once again, I urge you to oppose the EARN IT act.Thank you,"</p>

Is it comparable or is the risk magnitudes larger than with other virus infections? This is an important benchmark, I understand scientific journals don&#39;t cater to laypeople but popular media does.From CDC website: &#34;Studies have shown that flu illness is associated with an increase in heart attacks and stroke.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What strikes me is not a bunch of people keeping their ego in check -- that helps because it ensures that all points will be heard, but it doesn&#39;t ensure coherent decision-making. What strikes me is that everybody was able to keep track of what were the major points and minor points, so they could talk through the whole range of possible objections and decide that they were all less valid or less important than the points in favor. This is how engineers talk, searching for flaws and weighing the ones they find.I think it&#39;s important for engineering decision-makers to be comfortable with this culture. It&#39;s disheartening when you have a great conversation like the one Feynman describes, the engineers are in agreement, and then the person in charge stands up and says, &#34;Look, if everybody hates this idea, we can&#39;t be lazy and go forward with it just because we don&#39;t have a better one,&#34; or, &#34;I guess we can&#39;t make a decision on this, because there&#39;s too much negativity and people are just going to nit-pick every idea to death!&#34; No, no, talking through every possible objection to an idea is how you can tell that people are starting to zero in on it as the most likely best solution. The closer an idea gets to acceptance, the more thoroughly you vet it. The more it becomes clear that an idea is the best way forward, the more you start to prepare for dealing with the reality of it.This makes practical sense, but not political sense, so it seems weird and unnatural to a lot of outside observers, who expect respect to be communicated by agreement, and emerging consensus around an idea to be expressed by a shared avoidance of mentioning the downsides."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my experience (and coming just out of a meeting alike) these types of respectful and forward-moving meetings are typically in a case where each attendant has roughly the same level expertise in a given domain and knows the basics of scientific principles. Hence, everybody in the meeting brings in his or her unique view of the topic at hand and knows intrinsically when it makes sense to contribute something to the discussion. Usually things get out of hands, if somebody is talking just for the noise or, and this is worse, a clearly bad idea wins the discussion because politics or the messenger has shouted the loudest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been in such environments and I while I hadn&#39;t considered that the reason they worked so well was that they were great people: they were, in fact, great people.An interesting thing happens when there&#39;s a high level of respect.People stop being so anxious about not &#34;winning&#34;, or &#34;being heard&#34;, people just remove themselves from their ideas and feel comfortable and confident.I left that company because the company around that team was a bit shit, but I wish I could foster an environment of high trust and mutual respect like that again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My 2 cents: The author presumably goes to Princeton - the ivy league is in general a tough place to &#34;start learning&#34; things, especially STEM. Few of the staff would teach you the basics of anything, mostly because you are attending a research college, where teaching is the professors&#39; side gig.I went to an ivy league school, and a large portion of the people in the CS program did competitive programming/knew number theory and discrete math from high school etc. All the problems we got as homework were really intense - I&#39;d consistently do more than 60-70 hours of studying outside of classes to keep up. Mind you, for me CS was/is like crack - I feel like I&#39;d have put in even more time if I didn&#39;t need to sleep or want to hang out with my friends.There are some intro classes, of course, but the quality of those varies a lot.Edit: I don&#39;t mean to discourage people with this post. I was actually one of the few people who didn&#39;t have much of a CS/quanty background in my CS classes. My advisor told me to have a backup major in case I fail the tougher required classes, but I made it through."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder if some universities should pay more attention to the impact of discouragement on some students.I remember attempting a grad class called &#34;Hard problems in combinatorial optimization&#34;. I was struggling so I asked the professor for advice on getting my footing in the class.His answer was that I may just not have the &#34;mathematical maturity&#34; for the material. I was so discouraged that I dropped out of the program.What I didn&#39;t realize at the time was the particular meaning of that term. His advice was well intended and accurate.But what I heard was that I was hopeless in this topic area because I wasn&#39;t smart enough.So much pain could have been avoided if we just extended the conversation by a few minutes, or he invited me for a discussion over coffee."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s the class description for MAT 202, &#34;Linear Algebra with Applications&#34;  at Princeton.[1] Here&#39;s a problem set with answers.[2]It&#39;s painful to read. Problem 2: &#34;Find the matrix A describing the following linear transformation from R2 to R&#39;2 : First rotate clockwise by π/6, then scale by a factor of 2, then reflect about the x2 axis.&#34; Anyone who programs video games recognizes that as a stack of transformations. You set up the matrix for the rotate, the scale, and the reflection (which is a scale of -1 on one axis). You multiply the matrices to get the result. This is a pain to do with pencil and paper. GPUs have hardware for it.Books on graphics programming cover this problem. But they usually do it much better, with graphical examples.
The presentation here is done very abstractly, without any motivation.
Most of linear algebra has graphical representations. It takes a useful and relatively easy area of math and makes it harder.This is apparently on purpose.  The class description says:The calculations are relatively simple once you understand what you need to compute, but it can take time to master the abstract concepts well enough to understand what that might be. The challenge in 201 (a calculus class) is usually how to finish a problem as the technical complications mount, whereas in 202 the challenge is often in seeing how to start the problem.Right. In calculus, problems usually involve trying to integrate something, where you get stuck and need to transform the problem in some non-obvious way to make forward progress. It&#39;s puzzle-solving. In linear algebra, the actual operations are mostly matrix adds and multiplies. It&#39;s setting up the problem that&#39;s hard.It&#39;s annoying to see this for a useful area of applied math. If you&#39;re headed for abstract algebra, where intuition breaks down, this approach might be useful. But if you want to use ordinary linear systems to get work done, which is common in engineering, it&#39;s not.[1] https://www.math.princeton.edu/undergraduate/placement/MAT20...[2] https://www.math.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/2018-04/M..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m literally playing Factorio right now, with my kid. Got into it over Christmas based on HN talking about it all the time. Good game to multi because I don&#39;t have to pay attention all the time.It really reminds me of software in many ways. You fiddle with tiny little things like balancing a belt, and then move on to building belt balancers. You then move up the abstractions to where you&#39;re not really placing inserters all the time. Maybe you make some blueprints and you&#39;re placing a whole set of nuke power plants in one go, or looking at trains.The kid loves it, but you can (luckily) tell the difference between what he makes and what I make. That engineer keep-stuff-organized thing takes a bit of time to hone, but he&#39;s getting there. He also understands how to find root causes now, based on looking at where there&#39;s a blockage in production and tracking back along the chain.One thing that&#39;s interesting is that the game is a bit, you know, dark. I mean we&#39;ve built hell and the kid doesn&#39;t mind. Literally paved paradise with concrete. The air is black with robots, 100k of them at the moment. There&#39;s furnaces all over the place. We got rid of the steam power generation but there are huge areas of nukes all over. The natives are getting atomic bombs thrown at them constantly, it takes a while to even get to the nearest spawner. Or water that isn&#39;t green.And yet he doesn&#39;t ask about how we destroyed all the cliffs and filled in the lakes, and chopped the trees.&#34;How should we make it bigger, dad?&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My problem with games like Factorio (and more recently Oxygen no Included), is that after I get addicted and get up past 100 hours of gameplay I start to question what the hell I&#39;m doing with my life. Up until that point it&#39;s great fun designing, building, and optimizing, but then a switch in my head flips. I start to become anxious about the fact that I was excited about getting better at skills in a virtual world. Usually around this time I start watching videos of more advanced builds, and then become increasingly depressed about the idea of sinking 1000+ hours into a game, when I could just be building something in the real world, or out riding my bike. This is usually the time I put the game down and never play it again.I think the problem for me is that these games give me the illusion of learning, building, and accomplishing things, which my little engineer brain loves.

The platform holders are (and always have been) jerking us around.I want to see a LiveView that can deliver both HTML and equivalent native UI markup.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s incredibly frustrating about the knocks on JavaScript is that it&#39;s not a shortcoming of the language that creates the problems hinted here, but the poorly-considered engineering choices of the popular frameworks.After building my own framework [1] last year, I realized just how disconnected JavaScript developers—yes, the &#34;big boys&#34; are especially off in CS la-la land—were from web development fundamentals. HTTP distilled down to its absolute essence is brilliant, but for some reason gets absolutely ignored in the JS world. When you couple that with websockets for incremental updates (similar to what Chris McCord is doing in Phoenix), it&#39;s insanely powerful. It can be reasonably lightweight, too, if you&#39;re only shipping the JS you need to render the page.That rendering some HTML, CSS, and interactive JS in a browser has been turned into what it has is staggering. Though, not surprising, when you realize a lot of the momentum in JavaScript the last decade or so was perpetuated by venture capital (and the inevitable fast and cheap nature of that world) being pumped into inexperienced teams.[1] https://github.com/cheatcode/joystick"</p>

Dare I say it even reinforces what I know from painful firsthand experience as a man, at the lowest points in my life. I was lucky though, with a supportive family who helped me through the confusing years of early adulthood.You can point to the decline of organized religion and with it traditional gender roles, but then what explains the relative stability in post-Christian Europe? The China Shock combined with America&#39;s threadbare social safety net starts looking more salient. We have inherited a much less trusting, much more alienated society than you are likely to find overseas.Whatever the cause I fully reject the lazy conclusion this is somehow women&#39;s fault.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"My observation is that we are going to have a radical rebalancing of who reproduces and who doesn’t.Lot of men and women who are generally not too motivated to seek out a companion, lose weight, put in the work to make it happen just…won’t pass on genetics.Children are a lot of work and energy.I’m highly introverted and high earning. My wife was the aggressor in my case. She pretty much made it all happen.I think the ball is firmly in the woman’s court now. Women have most of the advantages (education, societal promotion, fit in better with our institutions) yet i see so many women who are generally apathetic about getting into a relationship at all.There is also a massive obesity problem. If people have trouble getting attracted to each other versus the alternatives, makes it really challenging to find the motivation.I wonder what all these effects will have over the next 200 years? If you play out the changing “relationship market conditions,” it seems like men and women with different personalities and dispositions towards seeking out relationships in order to reproduce will have a significant effect on the species.Will people who were genetically predisposed towards being thin, hard working, open minded to approaching members of opposite sex and forming deep attachments resulting in children become more frequent?On a genetic and evolutionary perspective I’m super interested - we know that IQ has been rising, but what else will change?In some societies such as Korea I am told, women are sometimes or more frequently the aggressor. I wonder if this becomes more common."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think a big part of the despair is the obvious difference between what children are taught is the american dream vs what the american reality is.We are told america is the best place on earth with all the doors open to you to be rich. That all other forms of government are flawed and we have excellence here everywhere you look.And then you look at reality and see something else. Sure there are pockets of excellence and the dream still lives in fits and starts, but for the general person, they are likely shut out from any real hope of this grand vision.You add in COVID and the lockdowns, and economic turmoil, and then people start realizing that the whole race is kind of pointless. I can be poor busting my butt at a crappy job i hate, or i can be poor moving in with family and being &#39;unproductive&#39; (for some definition of societal unproductivity).Women, on the other hand, haven&#39;t been given the same advertising on the American dream that men have, which obviously is a terrible thing, but in this one sense probably helped them survive and prosper even when life sucks in a modern world.I&#39;m supposing the sell-job of an equivalence of the &#39;american&#39; dream in other countries is not nearly so commercial, and blaring. And so kids are likely not so shocked at the difference between expectations and reality. Throw in that many other countries are flat out better in many social structural ways, and i think that explains why, it&#39;s especially troubling in America."</p>

I maintain a list[0] of tunneling solutions, and one of the only limitations of systems built on WireGuard is the requirement for admin privileges. Even with the performance hit from running outside the kernel, UDP-based tunnels have a lot of advantages for multiplexing channels. Pretty much your only mainstream options today are QUIC and WireGuard, and only QUIC is intended to run in userspace.I&#39;d have to dig into the details more, but something like this might allow you to implement a simple tunneling system based on WireGuard that runs in the kernel if you have the privileges, otherwise falls back to usermode and is no worse than QUIC in terms of performance. That would be awesome.[0]: https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; If the page size is too small, rows won’t fit inside the page and if it’s too large there is risk of write failure because hardware generally can only guarantee atomicity for a fixed size blocks which can vary disk to disk (usually ranges from 512 bytes to 4096 bytes).Pretty sure the 8KB page size is not about atomicity. It&#39;s true old storage mostly promised 512B atomicity (AFAIK it depends on operation, but that&#39;s irrelevant here) and we rely on that in some places. But even if it was 4KB, it&#39;s still be just half of 8kB pages. So an 8KB page might still get torn, and we can&#39;t rely on that.The simple truth is that this is a compromise - smaller pages benefit OLTP, larger pages benefit OLAP. And 8kB is somewhere in the middle. That&#39;s all.You can get better performance from e.g. 4KB pages, especially if that aligns with filesystem / SSD pages, etc."</p>

Why would you have different default behaviours if you have one of the dimensions set but not the other? Why would you not have this specified in another property, the overflow property perhaps?

That was an impressively brutal attack on him, with probably the worst damage inflicted by the CEO&#39;s own statements.Blackwells is obviously not a neutral party here, there&#39;s a reason they created this thing. But on first glance it looks like a pretty solid argument that the management at Peleton is seriously flawed. I don&#39;t really buy the arguments on why Peleton is a good business and comparable to Streaming somehow.I do find the arguments around bad governance structures and oversight weird though, as those should have been known before they invested. Doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re wrong, but obviously this didn&#39;t stop Blackwells from investing in the first place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The fact is. Not every company can be a $12B company. Peloton might be a super successful $1B company, who slowly tries to creep into new areas for growth.And it sounds like Blackwell understand this, and instead of pushing for Peloton to focus internally on its product and get rid of the extra fat, they want a fast sale to a not-really-smart company. So they can at least get some ROIPeople talk about monthly fees being high or fair, thats not it at all, Pelotons prices for hardware and membership or completely fine. What they did do is* Pouring money into building their own factories (even Apple doesn&#39;t do this at their scale, they pay Foxconn)* Building a full fledged apparel brand* Hiring way too many engineers, FAANG level org size* Having their own warehouses and delivery full time employeesNo other company does this. I&#39;m not sure what the long term plan was, maybe they become a white label manufacturer for other start ups? It failed, badlyYou do not need 14,000, or 11,000, or 3,000 employees to do what Peloton currently does (again, maybe they had grandiose plans in the pipeline). If we want to compare proprietary hardware + Android + online streaming service. When MIRROR was bought out by Lululemon for $500M, they had 200 employeesI have a feeling no one has offered Foley more than $3B for the company, and i&#39;m being generous"</p>

Why not start by making a general exception for temporary storage of less sensitive data like IP-addresses for  efficiently and cost effectively delivering a web service.If there is one thing they could start looking in to it would be handling of personal information by governmental organisations.

It’s designed to be usable with minimal fuss. It does really a good job of portraying itself as magic (it will be awesome to use) without portraying itself as magic (it explains itself in terms of already knowable tools and how it leverages their strength).I do have a couple minor quibbles:- Serializable transactions are expensive, and that deserves to be an explicit caveat. Not everyone knows this, and it’s an important thing to put up front.- Some of the language in this post are in CAP theorem territory but neglect to directly address that. I’d like to see how client usage compares with direct Postgres usage (idiomatic for each insofar as such a beast exists) in a Call Me Maybe. I know that’s a lot to ask in a 1.0 announcement four years in the making, but I hope it’s a priority to get this in front of Aphyr.Edit: oh and I definitely look forward to this being further distinguished from an ORM, because even though I can see the blue and black dress my mind keeps switching it back to gold and white."</p>

Since the first first version of uvloop I&#39;ve been excited about MagicStack and I couldn&#39;t be more excited about EdgeDB since it has the same magical minds behind.Here&#39;s what I think makes EdgeDB special: it&#39;s a DB that replaces the tediousness of ORMs with a better core that can be cross-language / cross-platform.
I&#39;ve implemented tons of APIs, first REST, then GraphQL all of them on top of ORMs (Django, Peewee, SQLAlchemy, Mongoose and more). When prototyping was great, but scaling them became quite challenging, specially if you want to have a performant outcome when retrieving data.EdgeQL is an incredible useful abstraction that will prove itself in a few years.

The real problem is that we’re compelled to run a bunch of software from organizations we, to put it charitably, have no reason to trust.This situation may exist because it’s inevitable but it still sucks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It must be noted that the satellites were not directly damaged by the geomagnetic storm. The storm warmed the atmosphere which caused it to expand, leading to additional drag that prohibited the satellites from leaving their low &#34;safe mode&#34; orbit.Shortened excerpt:
&#34;These storms cause the atmosphere to warm and atmospheric density at our low deployment altitudes to increase.... speed and severity of the storm caused atmospheric drag to increase up to 50 percent.... The Starlink team commanded the satellites into a safe-mode where they would fly edge-on (like a sheet of paper) to minimize drag...Preliminary analysis show the increased drag at the low altitudes prevented the satellites from leaving safe-mode to begin orbit raising maneuvers, and up to 40 of the satellites will reenter or already have reentered the Earth’s atmosphere. The deorbiting satellites pose zero collision risk with other satellites and by design demise upon atmospheric reentry—meaning no orbital debris is created and no satellite parts hit the ground.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; SpaceX deploys its satellites into these lower obitsUnintentional pun on &#34;orbits&#34;, perhaps?It&#39;s incredible to me that launching satellites is so easy now that a failure of 40 satellites can be tolerated. On the bright side, I guess this gave SpaceX a chance to talk about their debris-limiting strategy!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"40 sats makes up about 2% of the current fleet - so a rounding error in cost and time.The important part of this news is how those 40 sats deorbit and leave no junk either in orbit or on earth."</p>

Just be aware there are lots of different reasons why someone might be in a wheelchair and what can and can&#39;t be done for a given illness. It can be really taxing to get suggestions or shares of articles like this from well-meaning friends and family that don&#39;t actually understand the realities of living with an injury or medical issue that puts someone in a wheelchair.Obviously people should know work is being done. And obviously people might be excited to hear about breakthrough research. If you&#39;re inspired by articles like this, consider donating to the institutions funding the research. But, be aware that articles like this come out every year and for the vast majority of spinal cord injury patients it won&#39;t be available to them soon or ever.If you really want to support those in the accessibility needs community, support local building code changes and adaptive sports and outdoors programs.

I got to attend one, and have good memories of it.I&#39;m still sad that the store has shut down.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m just a lowly adjunct, but I sense that one barrier to open textbook adoption is the accreditation process. I don&#39;t know exactly the connection, but I get the feeling that the department can check some box if they say that all their lower division calculus courses are taught with Pearson&#39;s book, for instance. Sort of a &#34;no one ever got fired for choosing IBM&#34; type situation.Anyone have any insight to this? I only have a sample size of two... which leads me to believe not all departments worry about this so much.Edit: see these MAA guidelines: https://www.maa.org/programs-and-communities/professional-de...One suggestion is &#34;there should be established procedures for periodic review of the curriculum... should include careful scrutiny of course syllabi, prerequisites, and textbooks.&#34;As much as I hate to say it, there are legitimate reasons for carefully controlling the curricula in lower division courses. A big one is: transfer credit. People get pissed when it&#39;s difficult to transfer their cheaper CC credits to a larger university.The easiest way to solve these problems is by dictating curricula. But, unfortunately, the Pearson&#39;s of the world feast on the resulting homogenized market.This is similar to my problem with Common Core. Everything in Common Core is perfectly reasonable. But now we have one giant textbook market where Pearson dominates with their products which now bear a &#34;Common Core approved&#34; label on the cover."</p>

If you don&#39;t know about it already, I would highly recommend checking it out (e.g. by searching YouTube for &#34;MIT Sparc Fusion Reactor&#34; for some fairly accessible videos on the theory behind why they should achieve fusion way faster than the current roadmap with ITER and DEMO).In the press conference just ended, they repeated how exactly the JET reactor worked as predicted by theory. In my layman&#39;s understanding, for the exact same reason (seemingly very sound theoretical groundwork), the SPARC reactor should exceed breakeven within the next few years.From Wiki on CFS:* Back in September 2021, they built the strongest high-room-temperature superconducting magnet (20 Tesla) suitable for a fusion reactor* Theory dictates that with stronger magnets, the reactor can be scaled down (with the square/cube, can&#39;t remember exactly), and thus cost and time to develop* Back in November 2021, they raised $1.8 billion from the likes of Bill Gateshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Fusion_SystemsBoy, do I think it would be crazy cool if they succeed, even taking twice as long as they&#39;ve planned! :)"</p>

You reduce quantity of labor supplied and end up with higher equilibrium wages for those who manage to get their foot in the door. Of course, this will only heighten the favoring of those who can get their foot in the $3200/mo Brooklyn rent door while dressing fashionably and using “semiotics” correctly in a sentence, but that’s neither here nor there.&#34;This is a cute theory, and tickles some people&#39;s ideological fancy. But if the author had done more research, they would know where the CWA-NewsGuild is actually doing most of its new organizing (hint: not New York), what sorts of contract articles they bargain around hiring, and what the status quo in non-union newsrooms is.In brief, the Guild has been organizing tons of local newspapers in small cities and rural areas, particularly those bought up by private equity firms who want to cut the newsroom to the bone. They bargain contract articles that curb the nepotistic in-group hiring practices common at non-union papers.Source: I&#39;m a former NewsGuild member, but at a software company, not a newspaper.Take a gander at the NewsGuild president&#39;s twitter account and you&#39;ll see many examples of these campaigns: https://twitter.com/gaufre"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not just journalists, but politicians, priests, etc. The filtered bubble of their society becomes the pole star of their existence, and the rest of the world gets devalued.Used to be, near any event that generates news coverage, there would be a bar where the journalists hung out. Listening to the conversations there would tell you what the story was going to be, as well as how it differed from the facts. The audience that mattered was the rest of the media clique; the actual paying &#34;audience&#34; was the chum that everyone took for granted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What is the source for the claim that so many American journalists under 40 live in the area  encircled in the map in the tweet? The source for wages in journalism having gone to hell? The source for unions restricting the supply of labor? If so, why hasn&#39;t all the journalist unions he see forming already restricted the number of journalists and increased their wages?I also think the author&#39;s characterization job status is wrong. Journalists mostly hang out with journalists so whether journalist is a high-status job or not is irrelevant since they are all journalists. Working for Google has high status in some circles but probably not among Google&#39;s own employees. Furthermore, only a tiny fraction of all journalists write for the Washington Post or other recognizable papers. Not a lot of status in writing for marketing agencies or obscure trade press magazines."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It sort of make sense for Nvidia&#39;s shareholders. The initial offering for ARM was only worth $38.5bn, which was already expensive due to SoftBank initial purchase price and not wanting for a loss. But at Nvidia&#39;s peak this deal was worth &#34;$87bn&#34;. For a company that makes less than $2B in revenue and at best ~$300M in Operating Income. Remember this isn&#39;t something you can buy and milk the crap out of other market players. &#34;Not a very British way of doing business&#34; is A Direct Quote from ARM. ( Edit: Because of perceptual licensing agreement, for those unaware of how ARM business model works )It didn&#39;t make sense how ARM was worth $22bn in 2016 on LSE, that has a PE100+ when I cant see how it could double its Net profit in the next 10 years, with a saner valuation of P/E 50. It make even less sense to me when Softbank bought it for $32bn. Didn&#39;t make any sense when Nvidia want it for $38.5bn, and later at $50bn+.Now we are back to square one, how many investors, in the open market are willing to buy ARM&#39;s stock at a valuation of, let say the same $32bn as Softbank initially paid? Roughly P/E 100, assuming they managed to grow ARM business from 2018 at ~$220M operating income to $300M in 2021. I much rather bet on Intel if I had the money.And of course many on HN will think ARM is worthless because the future is going to be the Riscy Silver Bullet.Disclosures: I do not currently hold any stocks or Mutual Funds, Indexes and other financial instrument."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Soooo back on the LSE or?It was such a hot stock in 2014-15. Softbank kinda bought it at the peak. Still, Apple has proven ARM on the desktop is phenomenal, and Ampere has done the same in the datacenter. Both have swiftly made compiler support accelerate dramatically. I would love for my next desktop to be arm-based, and it would be great if it didn’t NEED to be a mac. Broad adoption of ARM would be a huge win for sustainability. I’m bullish on their business, even if their business model isn’t vertically scalable.I think that RISC V also has a bright future, but its still a bit far out before its a viable competitor. Still there have been some things that look really promising such as what is coming out of SiFive:https://www.sifive.com/press/sifive-raises-risc-v-performanc...And Intel just announced a $1B fund for companies building on their Open Foundry RISC-V alliance. https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-1b-fund-risc-vBig things are happening for small instruction sets… watch this space."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good. Never a good outcome for the industry for Arm to be owned by Nvidia - and regulators have learned by now that undertakings in these circumstances have little value.Sorry for Simon Segars who must have had a tough job essentially implementing Son&#39;s ideas. And those ideas seem to have been pretty poor - Arm China debacle, focus on IoT and selling to Nvidia have all clearly harmed Arm&#39;s prospects.It&#39;s clear by now that selling CPUs is a mature market but that Arm has room to grow and there is still lots of money to be made in hardware if you innovate - eg in accelerated computing. It&#39;s also true both that Arm&#39;s model works and that it has more competition than ever from RISC-V.A lot still to play for in my view and I think that the IPO price will reflect that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The interesting thing this brings up is whether programming hiring is too specific. Why do we hire reactjs programmers with e-commerce experience instead of react programmers, e-commerce programmers, or programmers?To me this guy sounds like he could do anything, just see if he&#39;s easy to work with and see if he likes your domain. He&#39;s certainly said enough about programming over the years that he shouldn&#39;t need a leetcode grilling.Anyway my point was it can get quite narrow what we look for in a coder when in fact some broad experience might be just what is necessary. For instance I&#39;ve coded apps for iPhone and Android despite being ostensibly a back end financial trader. I&#39;d think a lot of coders wouldn&#39;t want to be siloed into the first thing they get a job in."</p>

I’ll take a well maintained and well documented Java codebase over a write-only Haskell codebase with more lines of language extension imports than lines of comments.Software developers who only look for jobs always in That One Language freak me out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was once in the position of Mark Dominus. I had spent years of using Haskell for recreational programming and wrote a book using the subset of Haskell that I personally use (you can get a free copy at https://leanpub.com/u/markwatson by setting the price to free).About six years ago I decided to apply for Haskell jobs at Standard Charter and Facebook on Haskell teams with well known people in the field. Both groups said that I was an interesting candidate and suggested getting another Haskell job for a while, and then reapplying. I did end up consulting remotely for a startup in India writing Haskell but that job was short (about 6 weeks) because I was in the process of getting hired at Capital One to manage a deep learning team."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is the official response from SE:https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/376060/update-on-th...For the past month Stack Overflow has been hit by weekly DDoS attacks that progressively grew in size and scope. In each incident, the attacker(s) have been changing their methodology and responding to our countermeasures. Initially we were able to detect and mitigate the attacks before any performance degradation could be noticed but the latest attacks ramped up very quickly and the site was brought down before we could react.While we cannot go into specifics on each attack in order to maintain opsec and not tip off the attackers, we can say that each individual attack has been using different IP addresses and targeted different aspects of the site. During an outage, our top priority is always getting the site back up and running. After traffic has been stabilized, we perform a post mortem for the incident where we assess and improve upon the actions we have taken.During the outage last Sunday, we noticed that a large amount of the DDoS traffic originated from Tor exit nodes. The decision to block Tor exit nodes did not come lightly, in fact Teresa, our CTO was on the call when we discussed remediation methods. Due to the persistent nature of the attack and our desire to bring the site back up as fast as possible we made the decision to block all DDoS traffic endpoints, including these Tor exit nodes.We did not target, nor set out to block all traffic from Tor, that’s not something Stack has ever done. However, due to the shared nature of Tor exit nodes, some of them were also routing DDoS attacks to our sites and were blocked. We have tried removing these blocks between attacks but this action has resulted in further site outages as DDoS efforts continue to originate from these exit nodes. Unfortunately blocking the Tor exit nodes also blocks legitimate users from using them. An immediate solution for users who find themselves blocked is to access our site from other IP addresses, via home internet, work internet, or other VPN services.We are continuing to evaluate the situation and will keep our community updated. Thank you for your patience and understanding."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There was no intentional blocking of Tor there in the past as far as I understand. But there are some mechanisms that block users from IP addresses that posted spam or abusive content. Those are automated and based on flags and not directed towards Tor specifically, but of course TOR addresses are more likely to have been misused that way so your chances of encountering these blocks is dramatically higher when using Tor. But these blocks only apply to low reputation users, I think once you&#39;re above 100 they don&#39;t matter anymore. And they also don&#39;t block reading the sites.There have been DDoS attacks recently on Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange, I think it&#39;s quite plausible those have something to do with this. They still seem to be under active attack intermittently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe Stackoverflow finally started to aggressively block everything that might &#34;crawl&#34; their data. I&#39;m super tired of all the paraphrased/translated copies in Google results."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So basically, we are a hosting association that wanted to put their servers at home _and_ sleep at night.
This demanded inter-home redundancy of our data. But none of the existing solutions (MinIO, Ceph...) are designed for high inter-node latency.
Hence Garage! Your cheap and proficient object store: designed to run on a toaster, through carrier-pigeon-grade networks, while still supporting a tons of workloads (static websites, backups, Nextcloud... you name it)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Y&#39;all might want to get to the point a bit quicker in your pitch. A lot of fluff to wade through before the lede..&#34;Garage is a distributed storage solution, that automatically replicates your data on several servers. Garage takes into account the geographical location of servers, and ensures that copies of your data are located at different locations when possible for maximal redundancy, a unique feature in the landscape of distributed storage systems.Garage implements the Amazon S3 protocol, a de-facto standard that makes it compatible with a large variety of existing software. For instance it can be used as a storage back-end for many self-hosted web applications such as NextCloud, Matrix, Mastodon, Peertube, and many others, replacing the local file system of a server by a distributed storage layer. Garage can also be used to synchronize your files or store your backups with utilities such as Rclone or Restic. Last but not least, Garage can be used to host static websites, such as the one you are currently reading, which is served directly by the Garage cluster we host at Deuxfleurs.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I maintain a list[0] of solutions to this problem. Cloudflare Tunnel is what I currently recommend to most people. IMO it&#39;s the easiest way to expose services publicly on the internet. For example a website or shared Plex server.Main downsides to Cloudflare Tunnel are no e2ee (Cloudflare decrypts all your traffic) and technically anything other than basic HTML websites (ie media streaming) is against their free ToS, though I haven&#39;t heard of that being enforced in practice.If you&#39;re the only one ever using your services then I&#39;d recommend Tailscale instead, which sets up a VPN using WireGuard along with slick auto p2p setup (NAT traversal, relays, etc).[0]: https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; But what if you could host a web service with no ports exposed? Well, you can! Cloudflare Tunnel makes a persistent outbound connection (a tunnel!) between your server and Cloudflare&#39;s nearest datacenter. All the traffic to your domain flows through this outgoing tunnel and connects to your server through the protection of Cloudflare. This also has the benefit of being seamlessly encrypted, so you don&#39;t have to worry about a thing when it comes to the security of your web service.Well, a port is exposed, it&#39;s just exposed on Cloudflare&#39;s reverse proxies. And I think this is probably a dramatic overstatement of the security that Cloudflare provides..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you have $3-5/month to spare on a VPS, a similar but self hosted solution can be achieved- Tunnel/VPN and reverse proxy- using Wireguard and Caddy.Caddy in particular is extremely easy to configure, with the bonus that HTTPS/Lets Encrypt has never been free&#39;er. Wireguard configuration is also gloriously minimal but admittedly, potentially tricky to get right the first time.It&#39;s just good to consider alternatives to Cloudfare&#39;s network dominance, if you can afford it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This story reminded me of a story written by a Czech biologist who studied animals in Papua-New Guinea and went to a hunt with a group of local tribesmen.The dusk was approaching, they were still in the forest and he proposed that they could sleep under a tree. The hunters were adamant in their refusal: no, this is dangerous, a tree might fall on you in your sleep and kill you. He relented, but silently considered them irrational, given that his assessment of a chance of a tree falling on you overnight was less then 1:5000.Only later did he realize that for a lifelong hunter, 1:5000 are pretty bad odds that translate to a very significant probability of getting killed over a 30-40 year long hunting career."</p>

He could be losslessly replaced by a rock with the words “THERE ARE NO ROBBERS” on it.&#34;That is blatantly not true, the guard provide value since the wanna-be robbers don&#39;t know whether the guard will be of any value, and a rock could not provide any deterrent. Losslessly?The doctor (if there is someone skeptical of doctors it is me, if I were less lazy I would have greatly enjoyed fighting to make some useless US dermatologists lose their license): &#34;Her heuristic is right 99.9% of the time, but she provides literally no value. There is no point to her existence. She could be profitably replaced with a rock saying “IT’S NOTHING, TAKE TWO ASPIRIN AND WAIT FOR IT TO GO AWAY”.This is an unhelpful caricature, too, because if we add &#34;and call back if it does not&#34;, it looks like a very reasonable approach.Un-nuanced and quite sloppy presentation of heuristics."</p>

I never want to return to the office. I will change careers before I return to a software development office."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The pandemic really helped me confirm that I prefer the office.I always sought to establish a clear distinction between my work life and home life and the enforced work from home due to COVID has made the two blur to a point now where I feel like I&#39;ve lost all rhythm. Now living through a pandemic itself has a way of disrupting the rhythm of life but I feel that the collapsing of space into a singular living and work area doesn&#39;t help matters.Another unexpected thing I&#39;ve found that I missed while working from home is a commute. Now I imagine a person&#39;s opinion of their commute is highly conditioned on the mode of transportation but in my case it&#39;s a mostly relaxing public transit ride where I had 20-30 minutes of unstructured time to read, listen to a podcast, or just zone out. It similarly helped create additional space to separate the work life from the home life.This second point on a commute would probably completely change if I had a 90 minute drive in bumper to bumper traffic. If that was my life, there&#39;s a good chance I&#39;d find work from home preferable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; My X13 AMD, for example, has a powerful 32-core AMD APU, 32GiB of RAM, and a superfast 1TiB NVMe SSD.The X13 does not have a 32-core APU. The highest spec available is the 4750U with 8C/16T.&gt; By the way, the latest MacBook Pro comes with an Ethernet port. We loved the jokes about iDongle; how about ThinkDongle?The latest MacBook Pro does not come with an Ethernet port. It is however very annoying that Lenovo requires a proprietary dongle to use the built-in Ethernet controller.&gt; The removal of the SD cards slot and Ethernet port has made recent ThinkPads a suboptimal choice for traveling photographers and some IT professionals.The removal of the SD card reader on the X13 AMD Gen 2 is bizarre, but they can and do still offer Ethernet via a dongle.&gt; would you read about the update procedure after you’ve done multiple BIOS updates for the same machine already? Even if you would, would you pay much attention to the Notes section?Yes, but I&#39;m probably weird because I like to know what the vendor fixed and whether the firmware update might remove features that I use (shakes fist at Dell).I own an X13 AMD Gen 2 (20XH), and I think it&#39;s a great laptop with some small caveats.Pro:- 1600p matte display looks amazing- proper support for S3, very low S3 power consumption- super quiet, I never hear the fan and the laptop is never uncomfortably hot (even doing heavy things like compiling buildroot)- amazing performance for a laptop (5850U)Con:- no SD card reader (seriously, why?)- proprietary dongle for Ethernet- Ethernet is only GigE- Came with MediaTek 7961 WiFi, which while supported by mainline Linux, the performance is trash (~30MBit on 802.11ac). Luckily it&#39;s only M.2 so you can replace it with something like the AX201"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A T420 was my daily driver through undergrad, and then collected dust during grad school when I was issued a Macbook. When I returned my Macbook I dusted it off and was surprised by how usable it was (and how usable and well-supported it was running Arch compared to debian in the early 2010s). I finally gave in and upgraded the memory (DDR3!) to 16 GiB recently, and am considering getting a third-party 9-cell battery, as my 9+ year old one has gotten long in the tooth (i3&#39;s battery &#34;widget&#34; reports ~70% fully charged).I dare say it&#39;s my most usable travel laptop outside of my work-issued Yoga, which it still trounces in terms of keyboard ergonomics. It absolutely dunks on the bargin-bin laptops I&#39;ve tried out over the past few years, I think in part because of ergonomics but also because Arch on old (but well-supported) hardware feels snappier than Windows 10 on new (but low-cost) hardware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is it just me, or did old laptops have better keyboards that the new ones have today?My first laptop was Acer Aspire One (this one [0]). I still have it and I still use it, it&#39;s currently running Debian with Xfce. And the keyboard is still the best I&#39;ve ever used, I genuinely prefer this keyboard over any desktop keyboards that I&#39;ve tried and I&#39;ve tried many mechanical including Cherry Brown switches. I get that the very low profile keyboards on modern laptops look nice, but I personally don&#39;t use the keyboard for its looks. Not to mention that my cat stepped on the &#34;Enter&#34; key of one of the newer laptops (Acer CB3-431) and she broke the butterfly shaped keycap stabilisation thingy making the button feel very inconsistent. I can&#39;t the replacement for just the bit that broke, I have to buy an entire new keyboard for it (~55€). The cat wasn&#39;t fat and she has walked over pretty much every keyboard that I&#39;ve used, but that was the first one that broke...It is this line of thinking that I personally think is the reason why a good number of people like and still use ThinkPads today.[0] https://www.globalmediapro.com/dp/A25LT9/Acer-Aspire-One-AOA..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Indeed. Valve established DRM to a degree many previously hoped it would get rejected. But they offered a decent service and proved that piracy is a service problem. What they did for Linux as a gaming platform is spectacular. Not many people use it yet, but Windows does look less and less like a dependable long term solution, especially with Microsofts other ambitions in that industry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To add on this: Valve works with upstream developers on upstream code, so their work benefits the whole FOSS ecosystem. They are funding a lot of kernel, Mesa, Wayland, Wine and KDE developers.(Disclaimer: I&#39;m a Valve contractor.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like I am in a &#34;late-game&#34; stage of gaming. I have sort of an overview of what is going on, but a major percentage of games simply look not interesting (anymore) to me.The collection of games I end up playing is somewhere between special and weird, I&#39;d say.And, to get back to the topic, for people in a comparable situation like me, Linux is a great alternative. So if hear or read other people comparing pros and cons of Win vs. Linux (or Apple vs. Linux), and gaming was the major drawback, think carefully if that applies to you as well.Having a pile of shame on Linux is as easy to do as on Windows, just it&#39;s smaller (which is good, right?). But having one at all means that you don&#39;t have a lack of games, but quite the opposite.Of course, when you deeply into AAA and big franchises, and need to play a game when it&#39;s published and everyone talks about it - then probably not."</p>

Next time we do it, we&#39;ll probably link to both. Having several different ways to visualize the same thing is very helpful, and I like that this one moves quickly.A couple of details missing from this visualization are how you pad a message to be a multiple of the block size, and how you chain blocks together to form a longer message. In the pseudocode at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2#Pseudocode, that&#39;s the &#34;Pre-processing (Padding)&#34; part and the &#34;for each chunk&#34; loop just below it. I get why you&#39;d want to leave those things out, since they&#39;re not really the interesting part, and the screen is already pretty packed as it is.If anyone&#39;s feeling curious about implementing this yourself, take a look at these project notes: https://github.com/oconnor663/applied_crypto_2021_fall/tree/....

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Taking equations from physics out of context to bolster social science claims isn&#39;t unique to psychology, other social sciences like economics have done the same thing with little more justification.  The rationale behind this approach is simple marketing, in that &#39;using more mathy stuff&#39; will sell better to the general public than non-mathy hand-waving claims will.However, the practioners of this approach don&#39;t seem to understand that physical equations are constructed by analysis of empirical experimental and observational data on one hand, and theoretical mathematical development on the other, within limited scopes of applicability.  Copying equations from one area of science to another willy-nilly like the article describes is just ridiculous - would cosmologists studying general relatively just plug in quantum mechanical equations in the hope of getting a &#39;mathy explanation&#39;?Here&#39;s another example from &#39;mathematically sound neoclassical economics&#39;, which does the same with 19th century physical science equations:&gt; &#34;The strategy the economists used was as simple as it was absurd—they substituted economic variables for physical ones. Utility (a measure of economic well-being) took the place of energy; the sum of utility and expenditure replaced potential and kinetic energy. A number of well-known mathematicians and physicists told the economists that there was absolutely no basis for making these substitutions. But the economists ignored such criticisms and proceeded to claim that they had transformed their field of study into a rigorously mathematical scientific discipline.&#34;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-economist-has..."</p>

A16Z certainly do lead follow-on rounds, but it isn&#39;t the norm. (It would be interesting to know if they exercised pro-rata or not, but even that isn&#39;t necessarily indicative of anything.)I don&#39;t know if there is or isn&#39;t fraud here, but the only evidence seems to be that Kagan was good at fundraising, raise a lot in a frothy market on little traction, and did not succeed at building the product or a successful business.One of the best things about the tech ecosystem is the lack of stigma around failure.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here.HVM is the ultimate conclusion to years of optimal evaluation research. I&#39;ve been a great enthusiast of optimal runtimes. Until now, though, my most efficient implementation had barely passed 50 million rewrites per second. It did beat GHC in cases where optimality helped, like λ-encoded arithmetic, but in more real-world scenarios, it was still far behind. Thanks to a recent memory layout breakthrough, though, we managed to reach a peak performance of 2.5 billion rewrites per second, on the same machine. That&#39;s a ridiculous 50x improvement.That is enough for it to enjoy roughly the same performance of GHC in normal programs, and even outperform it when automatic parallelism kicks in, if that counts! Of course, there are still cases where it will perform worse (by 2x at most usually, and some weird quadratic cases that should be fixed [see issues]), but remember it is a 1-month prototype versus the largest lazy functional compiler in the market. I&#39;m confident HVM&#39;s current design is able to scale and become the fastest functional runtime in the world, because I believe the optimal algorithm is inherently superior.I&#39;m looking for partners! Check the notes at the end of the repository&#39;s README if you want to get involved."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks pretty awesome, and holds much promise for the future.
Optimal beta reduction has always seemed like something of theoretical interest only, but Victor has been working many years on making it more practical, which deserves a lot of respect.&gt; HVM files look like untyped Haskell.Why not make it look exactly like Haskell?
So that every valid Haskell program is automatically a valid Hvm program,
while the reverse need not hold due to hvm being untyped.Instead the syntax looks like a mix of Haskell and Lisp, with parentheses around application, and prefix operators. I prefer the cleaner Haskell syntax.Some of the speedup examples look somewhat artificial:The exponential speedup is on 2^n compositions of the identity function,
which has no practical use. It would be nice to show such a speedup on a nontrivial function.The arithmetical example uses a binary representation, but strangely uses unary implementation of operators, with addition implemented as repeated increment, and multiplication as repeated addition. Why not use binary implementation of operators? Does that not show a good speedup?"</p>

As a layman I guess there’s a particular cerebrospinal fluid pressure you want, and that being too high or too low causes issues? Apparently the shunt just drains into her belly so I also found that interesting. Too high and she’ll have terrible headaches and an “alien” head (sorry, don’t mean offense by that but it’s what I’m trying to avoid for my child) and I don’t know what would happen with too little, maybe someone could tell me.

During my research into neutral networks we depended on a neuroscience result that found waves of trophic factor (i.e. the stuff used to build up neurons [i.e. learn]) travel in cascading waves from the core of the brain to the periphery.  By adding a sense of location and a learning term contingent on the factor we saw learning 
(xor) prohibited by Minsky&#39;s result (not really prohibited because we changed the model).The take away was that our models of ANNs benefit from considering more that just neural signaling (i.e. solution contents and fluid dynamics).

AT&amp;T email servers would constantly blacklist me and not respond to requests to remove me, gmail/yahoo/outlook would silently put emails in the spam folder, and companies using email firewall products would blacklist me, with an IT Dept too inept to fix it.The solution was to pay a small fee and proxy all outbound email through a transactional SMTP sender, like Postmark or Mailgun. It&#39;s easy to do, with one line of code in Postfix. You can be selective, and only proxy emails sent to certain troublesome domains. If you try an email provider and it&#39;s not working out, it&#39;s one line of code to change to another provider.This allows me to still manage nearly all aspects of hosting my email server and control my email data, while not dealing with deliverability issues.

So if you&#39;re not wasting an entire /24 (we only need ~10 IPs at this location) you&#39;re in danger of this misclassification.We were also informed that our normal, business communications with paying customers should have unsubscribe notices appended to them.

In Python you would write it like this:    json.dumps({&#34;name&#34;: &#34;JP&#34;, &#34;object&#34;: {&#34;fruit&#34;: &#34;Orange&#34;, &#34;point&#34;: {&#34;x&#34;: 10, &#34;y&#34;: 20}, &#34;number&#34;: 17}, &#34;sunday&#34;: False})

Only a bit more code, but at least it won&#39;t suffer from the Norway problem. Even though Python isn&#39;t the fastest language out there, it&#39;s likely still faster than the shell command above. There is no need to construct a fork bomb just to generate some JSON."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some time ago I wrote zsh helper [1] that uses jo to quickly construct complex JSON requests, mainly for testing and quering services from console.Paired with httpie [2] aliases [3] it produces concise APL-like syntax:  POST https://httpbin.org/post test:=j`a=b c=`e=3` l=`*1 2 3``

Which translates to:  http POST https://httpbin.org/post test:=&#34;$(jo a=b c=&#34;$(jo e=3)&#34; l=&#34;$(jo -a 1 2 3)&#34;)&#34;

Or, in other words, sending POST with the following body:  {&#34;a&#34;:&#34;b&#34;,&#34;c&#34;:{&#34;e&#34;:3},&#34;l&#34;:[1,2,3]}

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like it, very concise but retains all the features you need.`jq` can construct JSON &#34;safely&#34; from shell constructs, but is rather more verbose - e.g. with the same examples:        $ jq -n --arg name Jane &#39;{&#34;name&#34;:$name}&#39;

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lat/Lon is really the standard. The fact that some software internally represents it as Lon/Lat doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not a settled issue. If you look up the coordinate of a location - it&#39;s always in Lat/Long. You can&#39;t rewrite all the books and change all the maps to make it nicer for programmersAs the linked post says, Lon/Lat is generally easier to deal with b/c it matches to X/Y (and the North/Up way we look at maps). But you still have annoyances. For instance Lon goes 0-360 but Lat goes -90 to 90. This is also mathematically inconvenientAdd on top of that the X-Y coordinate on images generally have the X flipped and starting at the top left corner. So changing to Lon/Lat doesn&#39;t fix everything.What I personally lean towards now is converting everything on read-in to a South/East coordinate system so it matches the flipped X-Y of images (like GeoTIFFs) and just always working in that system. Image manipulation, drawing to screen, output etc. - those systems/libraries I can&#39;t really modify myself. Everything else I can manipulate in whatever coordinate system I want. So it makes sense to choose the most convenient. Plus only dealing with positive coordinates is a big plus.That all said, I&#39;m a total noob and I have no &#34;geospatial&#34; background (just writing some software to deal with rain data right now) So this isn&#39;t pro advice.  I&#39;d just be curious what others think"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds me of two days of bug fixing, after our Python mapping tool suddenly returned bogus data, without any change in the code base.Turns out, we did not pin the pyproj library [1] and they introduced a switch from lon-lat to lat-lon order, per default.It was possible to retain the old behavior with `always_xy: bool = False`. I saw hundrets of similar reports, who knows how many users were effected. Conclusions, a) Always pin your dependencies, b) explicit is better than implicit.Besides, I have a personal, subjective preference for lon-lat, but I understood the lat-lng order to be the officially accepted norm.[1]: https://pyproj4.github.io/pyproj/stable/api/proj.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think Latitude historically comes first when spoken or written because of the rule of ablaut reduplication, which makes it more natural for the &#39;a&#39; sound to come before the &#39;o&#39; sound when using phrases like this.  For instance, &#39;bish, bash, bosh&#39; sound natural/correct, but &#39;bosh, bash, bish&#39; sounds wrong.I get the order wrong when working with geojson with embarrassing frequency...http://www.macmillandictionaryblog.com/a-hotchpotch-of-redup..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is almost exactly my life, shifted by a decade.The problem is that by 35 you can&#39;t get by on novelty anymore because you&#39;ve seen some version of everything there is to see.The worst thing you can do is pine for the good old days. They aren&#39;t coming back. And they weren&#39;t that good anyway. Your best times are ahead if you can successfully adjust.What worked for me was putting down roots. I resisted it mightily at first because I wanted to stay mentally 25 forever. Now I see that getting married and having a couple of kids was the right thing to do. It forced me to become more flexible, more deliberate, more focused and have more stamina to do hard thingsI&#39;m a loner by nature, so I can&#39;t imagine where I&#39;d be if I hadn&#39;t settled down. I just know it wouldn&#39;t be as good.Once you&#39;ve got those roots down, life will lead you to what you should do next. Maybe being a full time parent, maybe learning to sail, maybe more successful entrepreneurship. Who knows...EDIT: I don&#39;t mean to imply that everyone needs a family. What&#39;s important is to start living for others to some degree. Hedonism has famously bad diminishing returns.Some people choose to do lots of volunteering or switch careers to social work. There&#39;s lots of options."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m 58. Everything IS an different iteration of the same thing. Generally, if intelligent adults are involved, there are likely to be some useful new things in the new iteration, small improvements.  On rare occasion, there are massive changes that only become apparent later. (Like when transistors first appeared, they wore out, like tubes, but slower... germanium was replaced by silicon, and lifetimes tended towards infinity, and then integrated circuit appeared)You&#39;re not too old to have a social life... that happens once you&#39;re in a nursing home, and have worn out the good will of the staff. Up until that point, there are always new friendships and relationships to be had.Going out to parties and drinking until morning is a lot harder on you than it was, that&#39;s a normal part of growing up. There are plenty of other things to do that are far more rewarding if you give yourself time to grow into them (and Covid rules don&#39;t prohibit them)If you need a hobby, I suggest machining.  Challenge yourself to make 1000 of some everyday hardware store item, like a 1/4&#34; 10-24 x 2&#34; screw, Flat head.  You&#39;ll learn a lot of interesting history, and grow to appreciate the supply chain, along the way.Note: Outside of the US, maybe some M8 Torx screws instead? You&#39;ll learn about Rotary Broaching, or cold heading, along the way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Mourning the loss of one’s youth is pretty typical. You lose a step. You didn’t do what you hoped you would do. You wasted your time. So forth and so on.Don’t worry. It gets better. This is all part of the process of life.My recommendation is that you read Man’s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl.“He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.”I’m 52 here. I was a prolific programmer in my 20s. A go-go marketer in my 30s. For the last 10 years, I’ve run a business that I love with two partners who have taken advantage of me at every turn. The last two years neither has worked and yet they get paid.Do I feel lost or depressed? Absolutely not.I love life. I have an amazing family to whom I am utterly devoted. I volunteer for stuff. I do cool things every day. If I feel bored, I make things with my hands or engage in other creative pursuits. I focus on the moment and others more than anything else and all the rest just goes away.How is this possible? I’ve filled my life with reasons to live.In fact, I have so many now that there is no room for worry about what I have and haven’t done. And in doing so, I realize that none of that matters anyway.My mom died at 52 after taking a header down a flight of stairs. My grandfather died at 56 after getting stabbed in the belly by my grandmother (she was psychotic).Our naked existence is laughable. Everything can be lost in an instant.Dive into the why and you can deal with any how."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The output is very polished and fast, I like it a lot.
Unfortunately it&#39;s not technically a single file as it depends on code downloaded from their server, therefore it can&#39;t be deployed locally without Internet connection.From the forum:&#34;In terms of license, you don&#39;t need an internet connection. However, Files app loads it&#39;s own Javascript, CSS and several plugins from CDN (jsdelivr.com), and this requires internet. We already have a request to allow serving all assets locally (as an option), although in your case that might not be practical as this means Files app is essentially no longer a&#34;single file&#34;, but multiple files that you need to be included with each installation (although you could assign a global path perhaps). In any case, for now it&#39;s not possible to load Files app without internet.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi, Files app DEVELOPER here. Someone notified me that the app had been posted here. A lot of negative comments, which I don&#39;t have a problem with, but I can perhaps clarify a few things.About Files app not being &#34;single file&#34; because it loads JS/CSS resources from the CDN (internet). That is of course a correct observation, and this is already noted on the website. From an operational perspective, there is only one file to download/move/install, and from a functional perspective for the vast majority, it will be viewed in browser with an active internet connection. Furthermore, it was INTENDED BY DESIGN to load all JS/CSS from CDN, because ultimately it improves the user-experience, and makes it plausible to make an app like this wrapped into a single index.php file.It&#39;s not reasonable to add ALL Javascript/CSS directly into the index.php file. PHP is only 10% of the codebase, and it would bloat the file to insane dimensions and make it difficult to maintain. JS/CSS is loaded from CDN service jsdelivr.com, with multi-level redundancy (Amazon, Cloudfront, Cloudflare), and will load faster and cache more effectively than anything served from within the index.php app on your own server. Furthermore, some plugins are served on-demand, for example when browser needs a &#34;polyfill&#34; or for specific features. For functional reasons, benefiting the vast majority who do not care how/where the JS/CSS is loaded from, JS and CSS files are therefore served from CDN. If this does not suit you, nobody has any problem with that.Does anyone have any examples of any other single-file app with a comprehensive interface like Files app that is entirely self-contained?There will be a future release where you can assign all scripts/css to be loaded from local path, but then of course all these files will need to be installed alongside Files app index.php. We will NOT be adding all JS/CSS directly into the index.php file.About license, as stated on the website, you can use it as a file viewer for free (with the nag). If you want to remove the nag and use it as a file manager, license is required. Those who expect apps like this to be entirely free with updates and support, are living in dream land. It&#39;s hardly worthwhile in the first place. There are loads of other free apps, and if you can&#39;t see any difference, then your choice is easy.I have noted comments about license info being unclear, thanks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There was a lot of work on microbiome and cancer immunotherapy... the latest study in the field published in the most prestigious journal there is [1] seemed to show that fibre intake was more important than any specific microbe. In fact they found that eating more fibre and taking probiotics resulted in worse outcomes than just eating more fibre alone. This was recapitulated in a mouse model:&gt; Together, these data have important implications. We show that dietary fiber and probiotic use, factors known to affect the gut microbiome, are associated with differential outcomes to ICB. Although causality cannot be addressed from the observational human cohort, where unmeasured confounders may exist, our preclinical models support the hypothesis that dietary fiber and probiotics modulate the microbiome and that antitumor immunity is impaired in mice receiving a low-fiber diet and in those receiving probiotics—with suppression of intratumoral IFN-γ T cell responses in both cases.It would be a bit disappointing if the final conclusion from all this microbiome work was &#39;Eat more vegetables&#39;...[1] https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaz7015"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just another data point, but my journey through digestive issues and recovery was kicked off by the worst depression and burnout I ever experienced, which started in 2019 and lasted 3 years.My best guess for what happened is that work stress, excessive celebration and coping with the cognitive dissonance of the pre-COVID era and subsequent pandemic, combined with overtraining and the misuse of protein shakes in place of food, left me in a chronically dehydrated state. The body tries to collect moisture from the gut, which opens an opportunity for bacteria to get into the body cavity and blood, which is colloquially called leaky gut. This sets off food sensitivities and eventually an autoimmune condition/response to lectins, gluten, etc, which have proteins similar to linings in the body, joints and thyroid. Then a cascade happens where everything goes out of whack quickly. In my case, I went from being in the best shape of my life, the strongest I had ever been in the gym, to barely able to get out of bed in the morning. In other people, it might present as chronic fatigue, arthritis, etc.I didn&#39;t really believe any of this in 2018, and my meal plan then consisted entirely of everything that I can&#39;t eat today. So I consider what people say politely, but for the most part, they have absolutely no idea what they&#39;re talking about. This experience has made stuff like GMO foods sound absolutely insane to me. Like, why would we ever taint our food supply to make food 5 cents cheaper or &#34;feed the world&#34; when we&#39;ve been operating under artificial scarcity since the end of the second world war? It&#39;s all a crock.Every time you eat inflammatory food, the risk is similar to smoking a cigarette. Probably nothing will happen, but if it sets off your immune system, you may wake up one morning chronically depressed and/or unable to eat something that you rely upon. It got me after I turned 40, YMMV."</p>
