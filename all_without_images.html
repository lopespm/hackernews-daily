								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So the way I&#39;m reading the post is Tesla swapped out a battery pack for a 60 with a 90 and enabled the 90. Tesla, years later, discovers that even though the hardware for a 90 was installed it should have been software limited to be a 60. (I&#39;m assuming that Tesla only made the owner pay the cost of the 60 battery swap even though they replaced it with a 90). They go and &#34;fix the glitch&#34; and set it back to the 60. Since the new owner bought it thinking it was a 90, because it was enabled to be a 90, presumably paid for it assuming this was the case and is now upset because they don&#39;t have what they thought they bought.Sounds like all around bad decisions. The previous owner shouldn&#39;t have sold it as a 90 or at least disclosed that, &#34;It&#39;s a 60 but Tesla swapped out the batter with a 90 and left it configured as a 90&#34;. Tesla, being notified, should have just enabled the 90 and made the customer happy. How exactly are people supposed to abuse this? Tesla put the 90 in there and they&#39;re the only ones who are going to be doing that. Presumably this cost them a fortune to do it in the first place. Why not get some good will out of it? &#34;Hey sorry about your battery. We only had a 90 so we threw that in there. Enjoy. Tell everyone you know about how awesome Tesla was about fixing the problem and remember that next time you go to buy your next car&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll spare the moral judgements against Tesla for this:The real moral of the story here is that if your business plan and practices is creating occasional weird issues and huge cognitive dissonance in your customers, it&#39;s the wrong business plan.  Also... the number of people this applies to is likely so low that Tesla really screwed up by not erring on the side of the customer.  (They didn&#39;t buy from Tesla, but they&#39;re still a customer buying servicing from them.)  If the bad publicity alone causes even a tiny fraction of the population to choose another manufacturer, the&#39;ve lost their $4,500 and then some.Harmony is a really underrated concept.  When things are harmonious, you don&#39;t have problems like this, and you can still make money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;I feel like this is more mundane on Tesla&#39;s part than many are making it out to be.
A mistake was made years ago. An employee recently discovered and &#34;fixed&#34; it. 
Terrible communication and customer service, but nefarious? Nah.&#34;At this point I feel like terrible communication and service is an intentional business strategy for some companies who found that by making support so baroque as to be inaccessible or just eliminating it entirely that they can slash costs accordingly. I do consider it to be nefarious in such cases."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is not a good article. At a technical level it&#39;s confused about a whole bunch of things:* SMM has been part of x86 for decades. The Secured Core requirements around SMM actually reduce its power.* The claimed requirement to remove the third party UEFI CA certificate from 2022 Secured Core PCs is entirely unrelated to Pluton (it&#39;s required regardless of whether Pluton is enabled or not, and even whether the CPU has Pluton or not)* Most of the description of Pluton is actually a description of a TPM. You don&#39;t need DICE for remote attestation. TPMs are already a hardware keystore.* System firmware is already being updated via Windows Update. The discussion about Pluton and Windows Update is around Pluton getting firmware updates that way (the existing story around firmware updates for TPMs is largely not good)* Existing TPM-based remote attestation already includes the secure boot stateThe short version: everything that the article is worried about being enabled by Pluton is already possible, and has been for years.But there&#39;s a meaningful point here. Remote attestation can certainly be used to restrict access to resources in ways that are incompatible with general purpose computing, or which reduce user choice. Remote attestation can also be used to give end users confidence that their machine is in a good state without constraining what they do with it. As a technology, remote attestation can be used in both good and bad ways. We do need to keep track of whether anyone is threatening to use it in bad ways and react appropriately.(But tbh remote attestation as an attack on general purpose computing isn&#39;t the really scary thing about widespread remote attestation. Remote attestation ties back to the TPM&#39;s endorsement key, an immutable cryptographic key certified by the TPM vendor at manufacturing time. The straightforward implementation of allowing arbitrary remote sites to trigger remote attestation would tie all of these accesses back to a single piece of hardware, and would be a privacy nightmare.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m completely missing how his example of a Word document that can only be opened by approved users on approved hardware within the corporation is supposed to be a bad thing.Honestly, that sounds pretty fantastic. I&#39;ve been using 3rd party tools/extensions to do this sort of thing in corporate and government environments for years, but having the attestation go all the way down to the hardware level is a big value-add, especially with so much ransomware/spyware/extortion/espionage going on these days.Can someone please explain to me how the author might see this level of security as a bad thing?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing I fear the most with this is &#34;proof that secure boot has never been disabled&#34;. This is just a way to brick your device from accessing services.What if you government&#39;s tax service requires such proof? Or bank? I cannot count how many machines I booted on Linux to rescue a hard drive, or image it, or wipe it, or just to install linux on them. All those devices, boom, paperweight for regular personal use.I hate it so much that Microsoft is alone in this. It&#39;s not because it&#39;s M$, it&#39;s because they&#39;re alone on it."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32237445">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have background here and can take a pretty good guess at what happened. You used a Brex card, which Google sees as a “privacy card.” These are often used by scammers trying to circumvent Google blocking their credit card account numbers.The solution here is to never use a hidden or “privacy” card number with Google, although of course Google will never tell you that or confirm or deny this. I only know this due to working with clients in this area.You can try removing that card and adding a regular hard card number and asking for a reinstatement again, but it may be too late for this account.Hopefully this helps folks reading this to not make the same mistake (although it’s incredibly frustrating that stuff like this has to be learned by trial and error or knowledge from those of us who have dealt with this previously.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have had nearly this exact experience, marketing a small SaaS.A sudden ads suspension arrived, with no explanation beyond &#34;suspicious payments&#34;. This from the same billing account used with GSuite, Domains, GCP; and from a business that was having no trouble running ads on FB, Twitter, and Reddit. &#34;How silly, but I&#39;m sure we can get it fixed&#34;.. I thought.Like OP I&#39;m also a Xoogler, so after two rounds of unsuccessful appeals through the front door (including updating my payment account to a hard card, providing articles of incorporation, and so on, to no avail), I figured it was time to call in my first ever favor. Surely one of my old-timer engineer buddies could thunk a ticket somewhere and maybe we&#39;d help them fix a bug in some automated system in the process.But the Google of 2022 is far different than the earlier days. It seems individual employees, even well-placed engineers, have incredibly and increasingly limited agency to fix things outside their immediate purview; a wiki about internal escalations for ads suspension stated they were no longer accepted, vaguely for reasons of &#34;compliance&#34;.On the bright side, the whole episode made me rethink and ultimately diversify our technology dependency on Google. I was naive not to do so more seriously and earlier."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It feels like every month or so there is another story like this about Google&#39;s customer support. For me it is one of the reasons I will *never* build on Google Cloud.Combine this with their propensity to randomly shut down services and also jack up the prices of things by some wild amount overnight with no warning or justification. (Google Maps API and Kubernetes control plane.)I would never consider risking all of my work on Google&#39;s reputation which is a shame because I&#39;m sure the services themselves work relatively well. It feels like everyone outside of google is widely aware of these issues but everyone inside is completely blind to them.Side Note: has anyone ever &#34;won&#34; an appeal with Google or does the system deny 100% of appeals?"</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32238167">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seems extremely clever.I know Mullvad already allows you to e.g. send cash in an envelope for total privacy, but that&#39;s kind of a pain, it&#39;ll take a long time to arrive, if the envelope is lost there&#39;s nothing you can do, etc.But by physically printing covered-up codes on cards, this actually uses Amazon to create the privacy/anonymity, which kind of feels ironic given how Amazon generally tries to hoover up all the data. You can get your code with fast Prime delivery, a tracking number, pay for it with your credit card, get a free replacement if it&#39;s lost in the mail...I love this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kind of surprised this hasn&#39;t been mentioned yet, but it&#39;s pretty commonplace to buy gift cards with cryptocurrencies. So there&#39;s yet another layer of anonymity if you buy an Amazon gift card from a stranger/service then use it for a physical Mullvad activation code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I generally believe it to be possible, I am very curious about how Mullvad is storing its payment records to avoid time-based correlations.For gift cards it&#39;s more async, but given that payment processors keep records that can be correlated, if Mullvad isn&#39;t careful about timestamping, how it records crediting to accounts, or the like, it would be extremely easy to de-anonymize account relations IMO."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Look into SoRare’s volume. They raised over $500m. Volume is now lower than it was way back in 2020.The crypto down rounds are going to be hilarious.Note to investors: if you’re investing in crypto projects, carefully consider the ponzinomics and the vesting schedule. You want your unlocks to happen in the middle of the bullrun when exit liquidity is ample.And also remember that whatever you might think of as “normal”
volume will crash 90%. And when you think it has stabilized, it will crash 90% more.The number of investors who bought the top is hilarious. But then, this is also a field where risk management is treated like a sin."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Helium isn&#39;t your typical crypto company.  Their vision is actually very lofty - build a distributed low data wireless network completely independent of phone providers and cable companies.And pay the people who own nodes a percentage of the $ earned thru the traffic flow of their node.The payment just uses crypto because the ecosystem is a nice fit.  Everybody knows what miners are and that they make money.The problem is that you need the entire network in place before people can build on it.  So they have been subsidizing the miners.  And it&#39;s a race of how much money can you raise and payout vs how much is a network like that is worth.And right now everybody has cellular and cable and fiber and no one really needs another system.  Most of the use cases (LOTS of sensor data) aren&#39;t really worth that much money.Personally, I think the government should subsidize something like this to allow it to get off the ground.  Earthquake data, climate data, traffic data, etc.  Essentially public use."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I looked into getting a Helium hotspot, but when I looked at my ISP‘s terms of service, the Helium use case is explicitly forbidden (I use Frontier Internet in Florida.)If you’re not familiar with it, what a Helium hotspot does is allow compatible IOT devices to share your Internet connection.I suspect that allowing random third parties to use your Internet connection it’s explicitly forbidden by the terms of service of most ISPs, especially when you are being monetarily compensated/rewarded for such sharing.Excerpt from ToS:
“Customers may not retransmit the Service or make the Service available to anyone outside the
premises (i.e. Wi-Fi or other methods of networking).”"</p>

					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32225532">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What really helped me understand and troubleshoot network communications at the socket level was the book by W. Richard Stevens[0]. I think this is because he starts with an introduction to TCP, and builds from there. Knowing TCP states and transitions is important to reading packet dumps, and in general debugging networking.Also, no matter what platform you&#39;re using, there is probably a socket implementation somewhere at the core. You&#39;re best off understanding how sockets work, then understanding how the platform you&#39;re working with uses sockets[1].Once I read the W. Richard Stevens book, I was able to read and understand RFCs for protocols like HTTP to know how things should work. Then you&#39;re better prepared to figure out if a behavior is due to your code, or an implementation of the protocol in your device, or the device on the other end of the network connection, or some intermediary device.[0] - http://www.kohala.com/start/unpv12e.html[1] - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winsock/porti..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; How you handle a file no longer existing vs. a socket disconnection are not likely to be very similar. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get counter arguments to this,That&#39;s my cue! I think the &#34;everything is a file&#34; is somewhat misunderstood. I might even rephrase it as &#34;everything is a file descriptor&#34; first, but then if you need to give a name to it, or ACL that thing, that&#39;s what the file-system is for: that all the objects share a common hierarchy, and different things that need names can be put in say, the same directory. I.e., that there is one hierarchy, for pipes, devices, normal files, etc.I&#39;d argue that the stuff that &#34;is&#34; a file (named or anonymous) or a file descriptor is actually rather small, and most operations are going to require knowing what kind of file you have.E.g., in Linux, read()/write() behave differently when operating on, e.g., an eventfd, read() requires a buffer of at least 8 B.Heck, &#34;close&#34; might really be the only thing that makes sense, generically. (I&#39;d also argue that a (fallible¹) &#34;link&#34; call should be in that category, but alas, it isn&#39;t on Linux, and potentially unlink for similar reasons — i.e., give and remove names from a file. I think this is a design mistake personally, but Linux is what it is. What I think is a bigger mistake is having separate/isolated namespaces for separate types of objects. POSIX, and hence Linux, makes this error in a few spots.)But if you&#39;re just writing a TCP server, yeah, that probably doesn&#39;t matter.&gt; and that you should write your applications to treat these the same.But I wouldn&#39;t argue that. A socket likely is a socket for some very specific purpose (whatever the app is, most likely), and that specific purpose is going mean it will be treated as that.In OOP terms, just b/c something might have a base class doesn&#39;t mean we always treat it as only an instance of the base class. Sometimes the stuff on the derived class is very important to the function of the program, and that&#39;s fine.¹e.g., in the case of an anonymous normal file (an unlinked temp file, e.g., O_TMPFILE), attempting to link it on a different file-system would have to fail."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the big issues with TCP is a lot of communication isn&#39;t well-suited to the stream model and is message-oriented, so yes, like the author says, you have to go implement ACKs. And then you want multiplexing, which streams also fail at. Before you know it, you built a worse version of HTTP2."</p>

I had been at the firm for a while, and they were nice enough, but didn&#39;t really have me down as someone who was going to contribute as anything other than a very junior engineer.We had a severe problem with a program&#39;s performance, and no one really had any idea why. And as it was clearly not a sophisticated project, I got assigned to figure something out.I used the then very new callgrind and the accompanying flamegraph, and discovered that we were passing very large bit arrays for register allocation by value. Very, very large. They had started small enough to fit in registers, but over time had grown so large that a function call to manipulate them effectively flushed the cache, and the rest of the code assumed these operations were cheap.Profiling tools at the time were quite primitive, and the application was a morass of shared libraries, weird dynamic allocations and JIT, and a bunch of other crap.Valgrind was able to get the profiles after failing with everything else I could try.The presentation I made on that discovery, and my proposed fixes (which eventually sped everything up greatly), finally earned the respect of my colleagues, and no phd wasn&#39;t a big deal after that. Later on, those colleagues who had left the company invited me to my next gig. And the one after that.So thanks!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been a user of the Language Tool API as we&#39;re building (experimenting with?) a language learning app [1] and grammar correction is a key component. I really want to love it, and I&#39;m so appreciative of the open source version that has allowed us to get going, but it&#39;s just so... limited. I haven&#39;t really dug into the code, but I gather that it is very rules based and that seems destined to fail because so much of language is context sensitive.For example, it really can&#39;t determine in German if you&#39;re using the correct case or not for a particular verb. Or it can&#39;t really tell if you&#39;re using the right prepositions.Ultimately, we ended up building a grammar engine just for language learners using transformers [2] + a version of errant [3] we ported to be multilingual. It&#39;s not perfect, but after a couple weeks of development was more helpful than LT.1. https://squidgies.app2. e.g. this paper from Grammarly https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12592, but there are a bazillion others3. https://github.com/chrisjbryant/errant"</p>

A rule editor is provided here:https://community.languagetool.org/ruleEditor2/Basically, whenever you catch an error in your writing you add a rule to ensure that it is caught the next time. After a few years your rule set will catch a large portion of your writing errors. It&#39;s fun too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"    This periodic adjustment mainly benefits scientists and astronomers as it allows them to observe celestial bodies using UTC for most purposes

This is incorrect, dealing with leap seconds is a major problem in astronomy, requiring a data file or even recompile any time there is a new one announced.  Since they are only ever announced 6 months in advance, it creates a lot of logistical problems.Astronomy algorithms usually work in Barycentric Dynamic Time, or Terrestrial Time, or UT1.  In reality the whole invention of UTC is so that people don&#39;t have to deal with those systems on a daily basis.The process most astronomy programs go through is to get the UTC from the user, convert the Gregorian date to a Julian day number to get rid of the Gregorian Calendar altogether.  Then look up the number of leap seconds, add those to the JD to get International Atomic Time, then add 32.184 seconds to get Terrestrial Time.  If Barycentric Dynamic Time is needed, you must first compute the velocity of the Earth relative to the solar system barycenter (which itself requires TDB), then compute the relativistic effects of that motion on Terrestrial Time.  If you need UT1, these can only be obtained by observation from the International Earth Rotation Service, and required daily updates, and interpolation of values in between observations.So, as you can see, leap seconds do nothing to make an astronomer&#39;s life easier.  In fact, we jump through a lot of hoops to make the average person&#39;s life easier.  It sounds like Meta wants to change the definition of time for everyone just to make their programming a little easier.  I find the very premise just out right ridiculous.It&#39;s true that your average person will not be affected by the Sun setting a few seconds earlier.  But eventually it will build up enough error that it eventually has to be addressed, and Meta is just trying to make their problem someone else&#39;s problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everyone is treating this as some idiosyncratic proposal of Facebook&#39;s, but removing leap seconds is a mainstream position.  Representatives of the US, China, France, and a majority of other countries were in favor of this when it was discussed at the 2015 ITU meeting [1] though the UK and Russia&#39;s were not.  This has been under discussion since at least the 2003 ITU meeting in Turin.[1] https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.18855"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can&#39;t help but agree with 80% of this post but strongly disagree with the solution. This feels like a hack that punts the problems to the future.UTC has the leap second cause it&#39;s not &#34;real time&#34; and so now we&#39;re just gonna never sync up UTC to real time at all? How is that the solution? Either we deal with leap seconds or we need to implement something that can&#39;t go backwards and properly models time. Leap seconds seem much simpler...In the end we didn&#39;t get rid of SQL cause of SQL Injection. We fixed the frameworks and promoted the solutions. We may simply need to make a push for languages and etc to just properly support time and promote how to do things correctly. It honestly seems easier."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my experience on small teams that I&#39;ve been on - a key motivator for people is shipping products and features. The sooner and more frequently you can do this the more positive reinforcement there is for the entire team - not to mention reduced risk of something never making it to the target users.Teams that have figured out the optimal way to get product and features into the hands of users as quickly as possible are the happiest teams because it&#39;s evidence that they&#39;re working together efficiently to meet their shared goals."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is why when leading an engineering org I narrowed down to one metric:Committed to Completed RatioIt encourages completing things and only committing to what you can complete.It&#39;s legible, easy to understand by engineering, product, and management, pointless to game, and positively reinforces completion. It&#39;s quite difficult to accurately predict when a complete feature will ship, let alone a whole product. But, if one breaks down a feature into its legible constituent components and then commits to completing just what is within that (which also necessitates any required communication to arrive at understanding the requirements) then over time you can get quite good at predicting what you will be able to get done in a sprint and better at only committing to what you believe you can actually complete."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is very thorough, but makes one fairly big mistake: it assumes there is low variability in task size.This could be a reasonable assumption if you&#39;re very good at adjusting scope, but I would be skeptical unless you have measured it and have the numbers to prove that in practise, tasks indeed turn out to be roughly the same size (±20 % or whatever -- I don&#39;t know the exact threshold.)Why this matters is that under cheap context switches and even modest task size variability, it&#39;s -- surprisingly -- a performant queuing policy to pre-empt the currently processing task to handle every incoming task. The intuition behind this is that if a task is still processing when a new one comes in, it&#39;s likely to be a &#34;big&#34; task, and it&#39;s worth letting small tasks ahead in line. Reduces mean response time.Of course, this could all be moot anyway because context switches are certainly not cheap for software engineers. I just thought I should mention it for nuance. Rules of thumb only get you so far, at some point you have to more accurately model the situation and simulate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Re: the Rust optimized implementation, I was able to get ~20-25% better performance by rewriting the for loops as iterators, using Rust&#39;s byte range pattern matching, and a buffered writer, which seems crazy, but it&#39;s true.  I chalked it up to some crazy ILP/SIMD tricks the compiler is doing.I even submitted a PR[0], but Ben decided he was tired of maintaining and decided to archive the project (which fair enough!).[0]: https://github.com/benhoyt/countwords/pull/115"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those curious about Rust optimization, the “optimized” version makes three changes compared to the “idiomatic” version:* It uses byte strings instead of UTF-8 strings. In my opinion, that’s not an optimization, that’s changing the problem. Depending on the question you’re asking, only one of the two can be correct.* It uses a faster hash algorithm. It’s not the first time this came up in a benchmark article. Rust’s decision to use a DOS-safe hash by default (and not provide a fast algorithm in the std, like other languages do) really seems to hurt it in that kind of microbenchmark.* It uses get_mut+insert instead of the more convenient HashMap::entry method, because the latter would require redundantly allocating the key even in the repeat case. I’ve hit this problem in the past as well. Maybe the upcoming HashMap::raw_entry_mut will make this kind of optimization cleaner."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love using the UNIX shell (pipes and programs that do &#34;one thing well&#34;) to the point where it hurts my ability to improve at other other languages. But sometimes all you need is a throwaway command to do something once, not a beautifully optimized function that will be written, improved, compiled, profiled, reoptimized and then executed a billion times. The utter tersity of a bash one-liner just tickles me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I looked into GNS a little while ago and what I understood about how it works is:1. I runs on top of GNUnet, which is a huge DHT that can be used for any purpose you like.2. So GNS aims to replace DNS with a newer &#34;modern&#34; protocol, it is not a alternative root zone (like Handshake or such), nor does it decentralize the root zone, it just decentralizes &#34;DNS&#34;.3. How it is supposed to work is, instead of OS bootstrapping using root servers, they are preloaded with a root zone public key (possibly belonging to ICANN) or a list of TLDs (with corresponding owner public keys). Then the key owner can publish zones signed with the corresponding keys on the DHT, which recursively contains keys for child subdomains. It&#39;s like if torrent and DNSSEC had a baby.4. To lookup a domain, you do a request with (tld, pubkey) and verify the response, do this recursively for each label until you have the record you want.5. The problems with DNS it solves is: censorship (DNS is very easy to intercept and censor), query privacy (I don&#39;t know how this works, they don&#39;t seem to use onion routing or something), and secure resolution.One thing to note here is development on GNS started in the 2001s, this was before DNSSEC and DoT/DoH were a thing, and most of the DNS was unsecured (which albeit even is today), and this could have been a completely viable approach."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This might be an unpopular opinion, but I think that decentralized DNS, and decentralized naming in general, is one of the few use cases that can be neatly solved by a blockchain, but is extremely hard to solve any other way.A major problem when designing a decentralized naming system, or any naming system at all really, is preventing malicious users from grabbing all the cool names for themselves. The only way to do this is to make acquiring domains costly, and blockchains are a perfect way to enforce that in a decentralized manner. Other problems include accurately tracking domain ownership and letting the owners transfer domains to others, which cryptocurrencies have solved long ago. As an added benefit, because all domains in such a system are owned by a public key, we suddenly no longer need a root of trust for TLS, instead, we accept any TLS certificate signed by that public key."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; How can a legitimate domain owner tell other people to not use his name in GNS?&gt; A: Names have no owners in GNS, so there cannot be a &#34;legitimate&#34; domain owner. Any user can claim any name (as his preferred name or &#34;pseudonym&#34;) in his NICK record. Similarly, all other users can choose to ignore this preference and use a name of their choice (or even assign no name) for this user.This is confusing me. How is it not a problem that randoms can just claim other people&#39;s domains?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I also think that C# and .NET are awesome. Especially latest releases dotnet 6 and upcoming 7 have a ton of new things to be even more productive.I like the fact, that you can develop command line apps, Web APIs, Desktop Apps and smartphone apps all with the same toolset, including the fact that deployment is possible on nearly every major platform for every major platform (except iOS and macOS Apps, as always only on macOS). Even systems programming and AOT is doable or full featured static deployment is possible integrating a small runtime into a single binary.And boy is .NET fast...This facts made Golang pretty interesting to me, but what I did not like here is the lack of a usable cross platform Plugin-Loader technology, most of the stuff has to be monolithic, then the module management and some of the missing concepts (like generics, which is also now available in go).The sheer amount of concepts in C# is overwhelming (from basics like Generics to less common ones like Extension-Methods, operator overloading, etc.).I don&#39;t like Visual Studio as IDE, but VS Code is an acceptable alternative tool, although I personally prefer the non-free JetBrains Rider.Nuget package manager also has it&#39;s caveats, e.g. that the official repo can only &#34;unlist&#34; packages, not delete them or that the publish times sometimes have horrible delays, but that&#39;s also still acceptable, since you can use the github package registry or bring your own to overcome these issues.Technologies on my todo list include getting into MAUI (a cross platform UI stack) combined with Blazor[1], which can use Web Components in native UI apps and develop TRULY cross platform (Web, Desktop AND Mobile with the same codebase). Like electron, but without the browser dependency due to native integration.Although everything is tied pretty tight to Microsoft, there is a huge open source community developing cross platform libraries, that are easy to use. Even though i find that microsoft has often made strange decisions in the past, the current state is clearly a recommendation to have a look.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eIsQ3Pm2bE"</p>

With Rust, I can install the rust-doc package and have the full API and language reference (at /usr/share/doc/rust/html/index.html). But so far, I haven&#39;t found an equivalent for dotnet, unless you&#39;re running Visual Studio on Windows. When you want to learn by leisurely browsing the API documentation and language reference, the speed difference is massive: the online documentation takes a bit of time to switch from one page to another, while with offline documentation it&#39;s nearly instant."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me, this is a leading indicator that Amazon&#39;s ecommerce side will falter. When I look at the reviews for an item, some reviews are high and people are happy, and other people have terrible experiences that doesn&#39;t even seem to be for the same item. I think it&#39;s because of this issue, where Amazon lets 3rd seller to claim that they have inventory for something.I really don&#39;t trust Amazon for a lot of things now, and would rather go directly to the seller on their site. Especially now that I&#39;ve gotten older, I just want less stuff but with higher quality."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Silk Road was not directly selling drugs, it was only a marketplace where other sellers did it, and for this reason it was taken down. AFAIK selling a counterfeit item is a crime too, so shouldn’t Amazon be treated the same ? One could argue that the Silk Road was created with the purpose of enabling the crime, unlike Amazon, but with the problem becoming bigger every day I think that Amazon knows about it very well but doesn’t act because it is against their economic interest, making it complicit of the crime"</p>

It was fascinating and fun - from how to make a row of equilateral triangles with nothing more than a ruler, pen and paper. Many, many hours were spent on the various flexagon derivatives.Years later, I made a JS page to combine images and print hexaflexagons for my son&#39;s classmates. Had some fun with that as well; it was much more confounding than I expected.Nowadays, microfiche is gone, the public library is unfortunately not in most kids vernacular, and the attention span that would be required to enjoy doing the math I did has been hijacked.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few years back I was going through some old floppy disks I found in a box and, on one of them, I found a screenshot I took of my desktop circa winter of 2000. In it was a window open with a MUD I was logged into at the time. Another window had Winamp open with a playlist of songs and another window had ICQ open. The only reason I took it was because there was an unofficial competition between our pub and another pub elsewhere on the MUD about which was more popular, and we had finally surpassed them.It&#39;s amazing how many emotions seeing that one image gave me. But the biggest was just this overwhelming sense of nostalgia. As I looked at that, I could remember what I was thinking, what I was feeling, everything that was happening in my super confusing teenage life at that time. Occasionally I will look at that image now, even 22 years later, I can still feel all those feeling again.Of course, my ex&#39;s character is in the screenshot too. So, a bit bittersweet as well. :/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve gotten mixed reactions whenever I share this, but when I program I like to record my screen with OBS.* It&#39;s a mental hack to keep me accountable, especially now working from home. If I&#39;m in an office anyone can look over and see whether or not I&#39;m working. It started as an attempt to mimic this feeling at home, even though I&#39;ll be the only one to ever see the recordings.* It allows me to go back and see how I worked in the past. I have a few videos of myself working from 2015 which I think is pretty neat just because of how different my workflow was back then compared to now. I&#39;m not using the same tools or even on the same operating system.* I&#39;m working on video games which is what makes this very useful for me. If something visually interesting happens, or if there&#39;s graphical bug of some kind, I can go back and breakdown exactly what happened. I&#39;ve stepped through videos frame by frame in the past to debug, it&#39;s been surprisingly helpful.* It allows me to go back and see my progress. I can know what I was working on a given day, see how far I&#39;ve progressed, it&#39;s just generally a good motivator. You can of course do this with git, but if you&#39;re working on something visual it can be nice to see it in motion rather than a textual diff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I totally understand the desire to keep a record of the past, and space is cheap so why not. I used to be a big &#34;digital hoarder&#34;, virtually never deleting anything that might be a bit interesting. But a couple years back I deleted most, though not all of the &#34;archive&#34; of past me. It was a great decision that I don&#39;t regret. The important things you did will still surface from time to time. It&#39;s also always cool to accidentally find a photobucket or google docs account you forget you had and look through it for 10 minutes. But I just don&#39;t find value in intentionally preserving a digital record of myself, and instead allow serendipity to poke my nostalgia centers on occasion. Sorry for the violating the spirit of the thread with a contrarian opinion. My point is just that I&#39;ve done the digital hoarding thing for years and it turned out to not have value, for me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This fractal is non-holomorphic which makes it kind of a dumpster fire..or a burning ship I guess... The easiest layman&#39;s definition of holomorphic is any function or operations on complex numbers that doesn&#39;t peek at the real and imaginary parts of the complex number. In algebra, there is no combination of algebraic operations [1] that can do so. But on computers, we have Re(z) and Im(z), which are easy to calculate since the complex number is simply stored as two parts, and it just pulls one of them out.When you violate this sacred notion, of treating a complex number as a singular entity, indivisible, the operations or functions you get, no longer have nice properties, like being analytic [2]. You are no longer doing algebra, you have gone into the realm of chaotics over R^2 with an equivalence relation through rotations, which is a far different beast.That&#39;s why other fractals that treat complex numbers as first class citizens, singular entities, and don&#39;t use hacks like Re or Im, are much prettier and have less branch cuts.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_operation[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_function"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Pushy pop-ups, &#34;do it now&#34;, flashy colors, and all that stuff.
Things that work like a charm in e-commerce or fashion will most likely not work on devs.Not just &#39;not work&#39;, but &#39;actively repel&#39;. A popup chat bot or a survey form request (during or after using a website or software product) or anything not germane to the task that has a shadow or notification highlight has slowly but surely become a form of wart that elicits a deep, instinctual disgust from me. I&#39;d even say an unhealthy and unreasonable level of disgust.It&#39;s enough to get me to instantly despise a product almost nomatter how well it does its original job.But 100 folks who actually click ads or interact with these distraction baubles (mistakenly or otherwise) are worth thousands of people like me, so I understand why it won&#39;t ever change for the better out of a company&#39;s own volition.---When it comes to advertising, say, developer tooling, I think a large part of the problem is that there&#39;s just not going to be a lot of relevant tools out there, for my job or hobbies, that I either don&#39;t already know about (and aren&#39;t using because I have already evaluated its prospects) or... I am already using it. Conversely, seeing ads for something I am already using has potential for negative effects (see above). Tasteful advertising is thus useful for the rare case of something I don&#39;t know about, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth it when 999/1000 of these ads are detrimental and irrelevant."</p>

When ever I google a sys admin type question, there is a digital ocean article as the top result."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work on EthicalAds, one of the ad networks mentioned in the post. We focus on targeting relevant developer-focused ads to content rather than to individuals.The post is great. My only nitpick is that the author mentions that they think retargeting will go away. The scope of retargeting might be reduced especially as third-party cookies stop working but I don&#39;t think retargeting will completely go away. Big ad companies with whom visitors have a direct relationship with (Google, FB) will always be able to do it. They know the pages on their sites and those linked from their site that visitors visit and they will use it to target ads. They don&#39;t need third-party cookies since they have first-party cookies.Networks that just do ads and don&#39;t have relationships with visitors except for advertising will find it harder and harder. At EthicalAds, we don&#39;t do retargeting at all because of our privacy focus, but many ad networks will find retargeting more challenging (less precise, they can always fingerprint users) to do. Doing away with it is a good thing from a privacy perspective but it probably will further entrench the big players."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not included in this list but definitely worth mentioning;- Lowering your hiring bar. When you hire people the burden to get them up to speed and productive is on the existing team. If these people are smart and motivated, great! But no-one benefits from having 200k+ engineers now have to spent their days explaining how GIT (yes, really...) works to a small army of juniors.- Not involving your current team in decisions that affect them. Re-shuffle the teams around, re-architect the product, change the existing workflow, etc. If you hire professionals with 10-20+ years of experience just to ignore their advice, they&#39;re going to be looking for an employer that does appreciate their input very quickly. Nothing is more frustrating than telling a manager not to put his hand in a pan of boiling water, just to see him do it and then blame the cooks for having a pot of boiling water around :)My current manager decided to add 50 outsourced engineers to a team of 5 to deliver the product in a year (instead of the 1.5 - 2 originally guesstimated).In addition to this he decided to give the responsibility for the architecture of the application to outsourced &#34;solution architects&#34; with no domain knowledge and reorganized the teams to split them by job title (e.g testers, developers, operations, &#34;management&#34;, etc).Current productivity is lower with 55 than it was with 5, 3 out of 5 have already handed in their resignation. We&#39;re burning through an additional 3 million this year with 2 crappy React pages to show for it.Next year the damage will probably be worse given the rapid outflow of talent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most of these, I think, relate to a single kinda-meta-problem.Managing software orgs is hard, and most orgs can&#39;t do it well. Using additional management methods, more managers, and more engineers can make the software org less efficient. Software production is weird. Efficiency of software orgs is extremely plastic. An effective 15 person team can outperform a 150 person team and this is normal. Very extreme compared to most fields employing such numbers. Software can be really important &amp; high value. Value can be utterly disconnected from the cost of producing it.I say &#34;less efficient&#34; purposely rather than &#34;worse.&#34; It might actually make sense to go from an efficient 25 person team to an inefficient 500 person team. The additional cost of might be dwarfed by the benefits of marginally more higher output. That might be better economically (even socially), but less efficient.If you&#39;re in one of these orgs, you will not be more happy though. Efficiency feels good. Inefficiency feels bad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Like many engineers, the author of this article assumes all engineers are ethical, and perfectly suited to the assigned task. The author also assumes unlimited budgets, perfect control over a company&#39;s hiring and resource management, and a perfect understanding of the software&#39;s requirements.These are the same complaints I hear from inexperienced engineers over and over and over again – and not just engineers, but anyone primarily responsible for &#39;labor&#39; vs. &#39;management&#39;.The &#39;best engineers&#39; empathize with the perspective of &#39;management,&#39; that running a company is probabilistic, and that managers, co-workers, and other departments – like finance, recruiting, product, and marketing – are also duty bound by challenging constraints often beyond their control."</p>

					<h3><a href="https://mort.coffee/home/tar/">The tar archive format, and why GNU tar extracts in quadratic time</a></h3>

				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32206579">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Tar is pretty unusual for an archive file format. There&#39;s no archive header, no index of files to fascilitate seeking, no magic bytes to help file and its ilk detect whether a file is a tar archive, no footer, no archive-wide metadata. The only kind of thing in a tar file is a file object.tar = tape archive.  It was designed around streaming files to a tape drive in a serial fashion.  Tape bandwidth has almost always been slow compared to source data devices.  You need to start writing to the target device as fast as possible.  Taking time to construct a full index just delays starting the slowest stage of things, while providing only relatively minimal benefit.Generating an index is fairly straightforward, the file headers give you the information you need, including what you need to know to get to the next file header.  Your only bottleneck is just how fast random reads are.  If the file is on disk, it should be relatively trivial.It&#39;s even possible to do this relatively cheaply with Range headers if you&#39;re looking at a tar file stored on an HTTP endpoint, though you&#39;ll likely want to think about some smart pre-fetching behaviour."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Punchline:&gt; My tarball happened to contain over 800 000 links with &#34;..&#34; as a path component. It also happened to contain over 5.4 million hard links.The behavior is more precisely described not as quadratic, but O(n*m), where n is the number of symlinks pointing outside of the extraction directory, and m is the number of hardlinks. It happens because of the security precautions gnu tar performs to make sure a malicious archive can&#39;t set up a symlink pointing to an arbitrary place in your filesystem, and then extract files to it. The strategy they use has an unoptimized corner case when the archive also has a lot of hardlinks.The mechanism could probably be improved by remembering the list of deferred symlinks in a hash map rather than a linked list, but also, both symlinks pointing outside the extraction directory, and hardlinks, are uncommon.(Edited to correct: The problem exists even if the hardlinks do not actually point at the symlinks.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; You may think that the numeric values (file_mode, file_size, file_mtime, ...) would be encoded in base 10, or maybe in hex, or using plain binary numbers (&#34;base 256&#34;). But no, they&#39;re actually encoded as octal strings (with a NUL terminator, or sometimes a space terminator). Tar is the only file format I know of which uses base 8 to encode numbers.Tar’s “competitor”, cpio, does this as well (at least in one of the popular implementations). The Xcode XIP file, if you’re familiar with that particular format, is a couple layers of wrapping on top of a cpio archive, so deep inside my tool to expand these there’s a spot where I read these all out in a similar fashion: https://github.com/saagarjha/unxip/blob/5dcfe2c0f9578bc43070...More generally, though, both tar and cpio doesn’t have an index because they don’t need them, they’re meant to be decompressed in a streaming fashion where this information isn’t necessary. It’s kind of inconvenient if you want to extract a single file, but for large archives you really want to compress files together and maintaining an index for this is both expensive and nontrivial, so I guess these formats are just “good enough”."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What a great example of how a series of reasonable decisions can add up to something unreasonable when you scale up the inputs. This line is my favorite: “there was an open task for a few years to address it (T73412), and so I did it.”This situation reminds me a little bit of trying to work with very large images in ImageMagick, like 60k x 60k resolution. A simple resize was taking 6 hours on my mac 10 years ago, due to IM trying to allocate the whole image at once and then swapping non-stop. And then I discovered that the Graphics Magick fork did streamed resizing, and did the task in a couple of minutes. It’s a small and relatively easy change, but someone had to prioritize handling large inputs first. This is one reason software is hard for me; every time I need to process large inputs I wish I had written a streaming mechanism, but every time I start a project I decide to do the easy thing first and wait until I critically need streaming. Maybe it’s the right thing to do to avoid over-engineering, but this comes up often enough that I’m usually in a mild state of frustration about something being under-developed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very happy that Aras is fighting the good fight, doing some great OSS work after his departure from Unity.  The speed up numbers are quite impressive!I remember when I was first getting into shader programming 10+ years ago, I asked a question on the Unity forums and Aras was one of the first to respond.  Even then he was a titanic figure behind Unity’s graphics stack.  I never forgot how kind he was to help a kid like me out, I’m sure he was quite busy!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The speedup factor is order-dependent.This is why it is very difficult to justify optimization work to management. If there are 20 things to optimize that take 10 seconds each, the change isn&#39;t really noticeable until you&#39;re getting past half-way. And once your processing already takes a few minutes, what&#39;s the harm in adding another 10 seconds?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Free or extremely cheap transportation is a fascinating development. I always found it odd that the rhetoric around transportation was that it should make money. We don&#39;t expect other parts of the government to turn a profit. Why transportation?If Amtrak went that direction and made its transportation close to free, I wonder if we&#39;d see more people try it out. Maybe it&#39;d gain some popularity and we could finally see a shift away from cars. Public transportation is a difficult process because until the money is spent and the line is there, people are not sold. Whereas with cars, even if a highway is not built, people still have a car by default. Therefore the government needs to float money, either in infrastructure or in subsidized fares. At least subsidized fares is a little less binary than infrastructure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I live in Tokyo now, but I&#39;m from Valencia, Spain. I knew the train there was bad when the local subway network, called &#34;metrovalencia&#34;, was known locally as &#34;metrovalenshit&#34; (there&#39;s even a twitter @metrovalenshit), but compared to other cities or specially Tokyo it&#39;s like a toy. In here (Tokyo) they make major station changes without even disrupting traffic[1], the only time traffic is disrupted meaningfully is when there&#39;s a major earthquake/typhoon.Back in Valencia, the gvmt started building a new line, but then they abandoned it for over a decade.

The Tube in London should be free.The standard American response is to object on the grounds that we&#39;re subsidizing something and it&#39;s a wasteful government expenditure. You know what else that applies to? Roads. We subsidize roads and everyone is OK with that.Charging for public transport is just a regressive tax on what are typically the lowest paid workers.Regional transportation is more interesting. I&#39;m not sure how that&#39;ll work in practice but I&#39;m open to it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"But where are the fusion neutrons? (See Voodoo Fusion [1])[1] https://vixra.org/pdf/1812.0382v1.pdfI&#39;m a professional fission guy. I started out in fusion and switched to advanced fission. These days I don&#39;t see why we don&#39;t just build lots more regular old LWR fission reactors.Imagining that somehow fusion is going to a) work, b) be cheap (fuel cost is only 5% of total nuclear fission cost so who cares), and c) not have the same stigma as fission is kind of weird in my mind.For example, there are leaks of tiny amounts of tritium at some fission plants and people lose their minds. Fusion reactors will have many orders of mag more tritium. Will people not lose their minds just the same? Tritium is notoriously hard to contain since it&#39;s so small. It can permeate through metal like a hot knife through butter.Also, lots of people worry about fission and nuclear weapons proliferation. So does fusion get around this? Not really. In fact it&#39;s worse. Did you know that the two materials you need to make thermonuclear weapons are tritium and plutonium? Tritium breeding is required by almost all practical fusion power plants (the other reactions are 100s to 1000s of times harder, I don&#39;t care what x random fusion CEO says, they&#39;re in it for the sweet billionaire side project money).Plutonium is made by irradiating natural uranium from the dirt with neutrons. Practical fusion reactors have lots of neutrons. Really high energy ones too.Anyway let&#39;s just do fission you guys. It&#39;s way easier. It has been working fine since the 1950s. It&#39;s zero carbon. Waste problem is solved (see Onkalo, and reprocessing). It net saves millions of lives by displacing air pollution. It runs 24/7 on a tiny land and material footprint. We have enough uranium and thorium to run the whole world for 4 billion (with a b) years using breeder reactors (demonstrated in 1952 in Idaho). Get the Koreans over here to build some ARP1400s or the Chinese to build some Hualong Ones until we figure out how to project manage again and then call it good."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A friendly reminder that the idea posed by a pioneer of nuclear energy of just dumping big bombs in a hole and harvesting the heat energy with steam/plasma has never been invalidated and remains the most efficiently-simple solution immediately viablehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_PACERIf containment is your concern (though underground blast effects are decently understood, and blast chambers could be constructed with still strongly net economic/energy positive) - this does not need to be built around any population centers.  At a cost of 1.5% efficiency loss per 1000 km, UHV power lines can direct it from a single write-off location anywhere on earth.  That single location can likely be scaled to supply well beyond the total current global energy production.https://en.geidco.org.cn/aboutgei/uhv/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I represent Sweden in the ISO WG14, and I voted for the inclusion of Embed in to C23. Its a good feature. But its not a necessary feature and I think JeanHeyd is wrong in his criticism of the pace of wg14 work. I have found everyone in wg14 to be very hardworking and serious about their work.Cs main strengthen is its portability and simplicity. Therefore we should be very conservative, and not add anything quickly. There are plenty of languages to choose form if you want a &#34;modern&#34; language with lots of conveniences. If you want a truly portable language there is really only C. And when I say truly, I mean for platforms without file systems, or operating systems or where bytes aren&#39;t 8 bits, that doesn&#39;t use ASCI or Unicode, where NULL isn&#39;t on address 0 and so on.We are the stewards of this, and the work we put in, while large, is tiny compared to the impact we have. Any change we makes, needs to be addressed by every compiler maintainer. There are millions of lines of code that depend on every part of the standard. A 1% performance loss is millions of tons of CO2 released, and billions in added hardware and energy costs.In this privileged position, we have to be very mindful of the concerns of our users, and take the time too look at every corner case in detail before adding any new features. If we add something, then people will depend on its behavior, no matter how bad, and we therefor will have great difficulty in fixing it in the future without breaking our users work, so we have to get it right the first time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; told me this form was non-ideal and it was worth voting against (and that they’d want the pure, beautiful C++ version only[1])I heard about #embed, but I didn&#39;t hear about std::embed before. After looking at the proposal, to me it does look a lot better than #embed, because reading binary data and converting it to text, only to then convert it to binary again seems needlessly complex and wasteful. I also don&#39;t like that it extends the preprocessor, when IMHO the preprocessor should at worst be left as is, and at best be slowly deprecated in favour of features which compose well with C proper.Going beyond the gut reaction and moving on to hard data, as you can expect from this design, std::embed of course is faster during compilation than #embed for bigger files (comparable for moderately-sized files, and a bit slower for tiny files).I&#39;m not a huge fan of C++, but the fact that C++ removed trigraphs in C++17 and that it&#39;s generally adding features replacing the preprocessor scores a point with me.[1]: &lt;https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p10...&gt;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"LLM are definitely not sentient. As someone with a PhD in this domain, I attribute the &#39;magic&#39; to large scale statistical knowledge assimilation by the models - and reproduction to prompts which closely match the inputs&#39; sentence embedding.GPT-3 is known to fail in many circumstances which would otherwise be commonplace logic. (I remember seeing how addition of two small numbers yielded results - but larger numbers gave garbled output; more likely that GPT3 had seen similar training data.)The belief of sentience isn&#39;t new. When ELIZA came out few decades ago, a lot of people were also astounded &amp; thought this &#34;probably was more than met the eyes&#34;.It&#39;s a fad. Once people understand that sentience also means self-awareness, empathy &amp; extrapolation of logic to assess unseen task (to name a few), this myth will taper off."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; In his conversations with LaMDA, Lemoine discovered the system had developed a deep sense of self-awareness, expressing concern about death, a desire for protection, and a conviction that it felt emotions like happiness and sadness.Allegedly.The thing about conversations with LaMDA is that you need to prime them with keywords and topics, and LaMDA can respond with the primed keywords and topics. Obviously LaMDA is much more sophisticated than ELIZA, but we should be careful to remember how well ELIZA fools some people, even to this day. If ELIZA fools people just by rearranging words around, then just imagine how many people will be fooled if you have statistical models of text across thousands of topics.You can go pretty far down the rabbit and explore questions like, &#34;What is sentience?&#34; &#34;Do humans just respond to stimuli and repeat information?&#34; etc. None of these questions are tested here.The problem here is that we know how LaMDA works and there&#39;s just no way it meets the bar for sentience, no matter where you put the bar. LaMDA is trained to acquire information, and then it&#39;s designed so that it says things which make sense in context. It does not acquire new information from conversations, but it is programmed to not say contradictory things.There is zero doubt. LaMDA is not sentient."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just curious, what evidence do we have that humans are sentient, other than our own conscious observations? Is there any physical feature or process in the human brain you can point to where you can say, “aha, that’s it, this is where the lights turn on”? It seems like this is part of a bigger issue that nobody really has a clear understanding of what sentience actually is (with or without a PhD)"</p>

One of the most troubling things though is how many people get easily wound up (and aren&#39;t forgiving) about misunderstandings in conversations.People seem to be increasingly concrete in their judgements about social, economic, and political issues that have nothing to do with them as individuals, and often it results in fighting words, and that&#39;s crazy to me. A deep polarization is coming from many fronts, and it also over-emphasizes issues, making people far more offensive and defensive than before -- possibly heightened because of pandemic-related isolation and economic stress.I think a lot of people judge the world based on tropes... The small-minded view based only on the people they&#39;ve observed, rather than being able to place themselves in the shoes of others they don&#39;t know, and it&#39;s a growing problem when narrowly focused people like this lead and make decisions for us all. I think we really need to reject the use of tropes in discussions as fact because it&#39;s toxic, but at the same time, I work hard to not be triggered by anything that&#39;s well intended.

Some Chinese municipalities were also offering cash incentives for citizens who obtained foreign intellectual property registrations, further exacerbating the problem.Full article at https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/style/amazon-trademark-co..."</p>

You can tell it is really profitable because Amazon will compensate you for up to $1000 for damages caused by this junk. https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58163915I believe that Amazon probably could not turn the screws on these companies even if it wanted to. It would be a massive loss to their revenue and share holders would revolt. It would bring prices up in aggregate if these companies could not sell junk on the platform.The best they can do is play coy and hope the US government or EU does not crack down hard on them.

Then all the items should be &#34;shipped and sold by Amazon.com&#34;.But I&#39;ve been sort of shocked to find recently that Amazon&#39;s prices, even with free shipping, are often not competitive with buying first-party, even with paying the shipping. For a lot of products these days, if there&#39;s a recognizable name brand associated with it, I just by first-party. You get it slower, but you know what you&#39;re getting, and probably end up giving more money to the seller too.I would not have seen myself doing this ten years ago."</p>

There is another project doing a similar thing, but they don&#39;t have bluetooth nor an OLED display (they reuse the same display) so it&#39;s not nearly as useful in daily life, though still very impressive work nonetheless.But this is really amazing work. I hope you find some collaborators to continue!!I recently got an F-105W which I had when I was a teen (which is basically the F-91 but with a cool glowy EL backlight). And one thing that really surprised me how small that thing is. It seemed bigger at the time.I&#39;m really amazed how much technology this project managed to fit in that tiny case. Battery, OLED, bluetooth.. Just wow.I would pay for this, I was thinking of buying that other project on crowdsupply but without BT connectivity I just don&#39;t really have any use for it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People both underestimate and overestimate what PV can do. In summer and around noon, here in western Europe, there is so much PV-electricity produced that it is _almost_ enough to fulfill all demands. In winter, the amount is like a drop in the desert.I have built a 30 kWp PV at home 2 years ago - you would think this is quite big, for a private plant. It is not enough. If I want to power a heat pump (with drilled holes), e.g. to cover the heating for the house from November - February, I calculated I would need about 70 to 80 kWp (optimized for winter sun angle, e.g. pretty steep modules at 60° or 70° that relatively produce less in summer, but more in winter).Now I imagine all the people that buy tiny 5 kWp plants. The only way this would work is collaborative, with buffers at the medium-voltage level.So the biggest problem is really energy transfer or relocation, between different time&#39;s and regions´ needs (winter, summer; night, day; or from different regions worldwide)... btw. here&#39;s a graphic for the calculation [1]. Blue is an imaginary heating pump electricity consumption over the year, red is the predicted pv production for a 60 kWp plant, where 30 kWp are at 60° angle - calculated with Europe&#39;s pvgis tool [2].[1]: https://ibb.co/WKsHPKX[2]: https://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvg_tools/en/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We&#39;re going to need a lot of solar panels and an efficient way to transport power from a very sunny place to another location where the loads are.For instance: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_DC_IntertieThe pacific DC intertie right now often ends up being used to transport power from hydroelectric dams in WA/OR to California. But there&#39;s nothing to say that something couldn&#39;t function the other way if there was enough willpower and budget to cover, for instance, a huge chunk of the desert near Edwards AFB in CA with hundreds of megawatts of photovoltaics.I searched for &#34;high voltage DC&#34; in that article and didn&#39;t see a mention of it, or anything much else about long distance transport of power.The technology now exists to theoretically cover many hundreds of square km of Libya in photovoltaics and take the electricty to Europe through a sub-sea cable, or series of cables.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi folks - I&#39;m the creator/teacher of this course. I&#39;d be happy to answer any questions that you have about the course, learning deep learning in general, or the state of deep learning in 2022."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am so grateful the FastAI team exists. It wasn&#39;t until I discovered their &#34;Machine Learning for Coders&#34; course that I really started to grok ML. I was in grad school trying to pivot my career from finance to data science. I didn&#39;t come from a computer science / math background and things just weren&#39;t clicking for me. I remember feeling angry, embarrassed, dumb, and overall that I wasn&#39;t smart enough to learn this stuff -- I was incredibly discouraged and felt that I didn&#39;t belong there. I was lucky enough to stumble across one of the course videos on YouTube (thanks recommendation algorithm!), and the rest is history.The amazing thing about these courses is how simple Jeremy (and team) are able to make machine learning. I didn&#39;t need to understand python dependency management in order to learn how to train an really good image classifier. Their approach helped me have lots of little wins, gave me confidence, and helped build the motivation to slog through the harder stuff when I needed to.From the bottom of my heart, thank you @jph00. You changed my life immeasurably for the better. I learned that I AM good enough, I AM smart enough, and I CAN do hard things... I just had to find the right way to learn them. Your courses completely changed my perspective on what was possible for me and opened the door to some of my life&#39;s greatest passions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first Fast.ai course back in around 2016 changed my life.I was studying a masters in statistics and computer science that had 1 neural networks lecture and nobody knew anything about deep learning. Fast.ai and Jeremy’s teaching style helped me start playing with deep learning models really quickly and I changed my thesis topic to computer vision.I ended up consulting on the topic and doing various startups leading to the startup I’m working on now which just finished YC (AiSupervision W22).I doubt be here without fast.ai. I highly recommend and appreciate all the work that Jeremy and the rest of fast.ai do!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Huh, seeing their full argument written out makes the temporary CDL policy make a lot more sense.They were already contracting with other libraries to increase the amount of out-of-circulation copies they could lend, and with 90,000 libraries closed they assumed removing any restrictions would still keep them well under the amount of out-of-circulation copies available.And they were likely right, if &#34;The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe&#34; only had 888 lends at most a few books would reach anywhere near the total out-of-circulation copies. It makes the publishers argument look less like &#34;we were robbed&#34; and more like &#34;we should have made even more cash off the pandemic.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For non lawyers: a request for summary judgment is something any lawyer will do, possibly multiple times in a case. And the vast majority of the time, they’re denied. It does not mean that their case is a slam dunk or anything; just that they want the judge to prematurely end the matter in their favor.It’s almost a useless motion, but because it has worked sometimes, your lawyer would be stupid to not try it.In other words, an article saying that a party requested summary judgment doesn’t really mean anything. I’m almost certain the other party filed one as well."</p>

Because if you have the same frontpage for everyone, it&#39;s feasible to have an expert just pick that instead of needing some weird flaky NN that&#39;s expensive to develop, train, and run, and produces bland (or disturbing)  recommendations anyways.(Even algorithmically-driven sites like HN benefit from that, like dang manually emailing people to resubmit interesting stories.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just did a two week long back country road campervan trip from Tahoe down south through each of the forests... Stanislaus, Yosemite, Sierra, Kings, Sequoia. It was amazing boondocking in the middle of nowhere, no cell signal and taking baths in what is left of the rivers and lakes...Once you get past Yosemite, pretty much all of the reservoirs are empty to less than half full. Majority of the streams are gone.It gets worse the further you head south. Kings and Sequoia are pretty much decimated forests from the fires and beetles. Dead trees for as far as you can see. Given the lack of water, I expect them to be desert in just a few more years.There are quite a few hydro power generation stations deep in the mountains that I had no idea existed. I suspect they will close down as well. I wonder what effect that will have on California power supply over the coming years. That said, it was pretty clear that PG&amp;E is working on updating the infrastructure as they are all over the place working on things.If I hadn&#39;t seen it for myself, I wouldn&#39;t believe it.

It was written before a climate-related megadrought was really on anyone&#39;s long-term radar, but it really explains a lot.For example, dams are only part of the water storage picture, there&#39;s also groundwater, and the water projects often had the goal of protecting groundwater (keeping the water table closer to the surface), but then once they&#39;d provided water via a dam or aquaduct, the farmers would just expand the areas they were farming and groundwater extraction would often increase as a side effect.Humans really aren&#39;t that good at long-term planning, is one conclusion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently left a boutique agency of 5 years and I can definitely resonate with this one. Our agency aimed to catch big fish, and we did, but since they are hard to land we&#39;d pick up small jobs in the meantime, just like the project that you&#39;re describing here. In my perspective, this isn&#39;t someone deliberately ripping you off. I imagine they intended to ship at the cost they quoted, but the team didn&#39;t adjust their working style to match your price point.All the variations of the logo and design mocks are clearly overkill for a $15k project. The design team had time to fill and wanted to provide lots of options for you to pick from, as they typically would on a larger project. Those variations are an expectation for $100k clients, and you got the $100k customer treatment, but unfortunately not at a discount.The reality is, small jobs like this are effectively make-work projects for an agency. They typically don&#39;t pay enough to be an effective use of time for the agency, but are a way to stay in the black between higher value projects. Small customers become &#34;nuisance&#34; customers as soon as a something better is landed. The team members being swapped out as they are needed elsewhere and newly joining team members then need to re-contextualize and regain momentum, all on your dime.Your takeaway is correct, don&#39;t be a small fish for an agency. If they&#39;re busy they won&#39;t take your work, and if do show interest, they are desperate for work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"More anecdotal evidence: a few years back I wanted to get out of the work situation I was in. I looked around, had some interviews, had some offers. None of the postings had salary ranges, as is common where I live.My eyes, however, were set on a specific small company because I liked their product. The process was long and involved multiple meetings, a take-home problem, and stretched over 2 or so months. I was upfront about what my salary expectations were (wasn&#39;t looking for a raise, just a lateral move). They said we discuss salary when you meet the founders, i.e. the last step before getting hired, but they also didn&#39;t tell me that my range was way off.Turns out I had played this 9 week game and turned down other offers just to be severely low-balled by them. Maybe they saw that I really wanted the position and thought they could get away with a low offer.Obviously, I rejected their offer on the spot. I also promised myself to never, _ever_, be fooled like that again. We talk money before I invest any significant amount of time or I walk."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We just went through a large hiring cycle. We posted two versions for every job posting- one with salary ranges and one without.The ads performed equally well in regard to total responses with the better candidates responding to the ones without salary ranges.And... before you say, perhaps your salary ranges were bad, they weren&#39;t. Our salary offerings are very aggressive to the developer&#39;s benefit. In my opinion, salary is a sign of respect from you employer.If your primary reason for responding to an ad is based upon salary you are not going to be happy where you work. I promise. Of the top reasons people are happy at work, salary is way down on the list. [0] It is important, it makes it possible to pay bills, but it isn&#39;t what makes people happy.Meaning, if you are looking for a place you will enjoy working, do not start with salary.[0]https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2014/12/15/the-top-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My former employer had a lot of trouble hiring and getting applicants even though we paid very high wages. They asked for my help. Naturally, they hadn&#39;t posted the salary range. I changed up the listing to talk about what we provided as a company for the employee and why we were such a great place to work and included our high salaries. We immediately had trouble keeping up with the number of applicants.If you pay well, they will come."</p>

But each individual death from car accidents is not enough to trigger the same response in cities, planners, and civil engineers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It is widely recognized that there is an epidemic of suicides among current and former military personnel, especially those who have been on active duty in a combat theater... There were 3,481 combat deaths in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Since 9/11, there have been over 30,000 military suicides. Over 20 soldiers a day take their own lives.Pet peeve: while I really like the general point of the article, I wish the author had actually provided statistics that support the claim they are making here. 30k suicides sounds like a lot, but what&#39;s the base rate in the general population? The numbers provided don&#39;t actually tell you whether the rate of military suicides is higher than civilian ones, and that kind of undermines the point. To be concrete I&#39;m looking for something like &#34;the base rate of suicide is X% chance per year, whereas amongst soldiers it&#39;s Y% chance per year, suggesting a risk factor of (Y-X)% caused by military service.&#34;A quick search finds some research (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_veteran....) that suggests the rate of suicide among veterans is 1.5x the base rate, which is substantial. Using those numbers suggests that 10k of those suicides quoted above were specifically attributable to military service (and 20k would be &#34;baseline civilian risk of suicide&#34;)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Never owned a car of my own until two years ago. Our car has been hit three times in the last two years. Once totaled on the high way (another drivers fault) and twice while parked. Roughly 50K in damages across the two cars and 3 months in the shop doing repairs. We spent 20K on a new car after the old one was totaled and insurance paid out a fraction of what a similar car would cost. We&#39;ve paid close to 2K in deductibles, way too much for car insurance from a company that doesnt give a shit about us, and close to 1k on car cameras and backup batteries.Thankfully we havnt been hurt but we got lucky. When the car was totaled it was in heavy traffic going 40+ mph and caused a 4 car pile up. I know people who have died in accidents or had their kids die. My immediate family was incredible lucky to not be killed by a drunk driver in a very bad accident early on in my life.Driving sucks."</p>

They’ll dig up a case study from one of their 400 offices somewhere, claiming to be experts on whatever the topic is. Meanwhile, in actuality, your project will be staffed with a team of 24 year old kids where this is their first assignment. And it doesn’t matter anyways, because the people who worked on the original case study are long gone and would never communicate with other offices even if still around.Meanwhile at the big company, you’ll have the opposite problem. A team of people with decades of experience, but who don’t really know anything about anything other than how to make their corporate machine not fire them. They’ll think they know what they want, and will confidently tell you…but in actuality, these people have zero understanding of technology or even how their business runs. And who can blame them, they’ve spent a 30 year career not doing or risking anything specifically, so its hard to learn how anything works with no feedback loop.It then becomes a delicate dance, can the consulting team learn how to do the thing they sold the client fast enough, before the client does their best to try to ruin the project out of sheer hubris and incompetence.This case is famous for being one where the dance went so bad it became a meme."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32186203">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not a very deep CS-y one, but still one of my favourite data structures: Promise Maps.It only works in languages where promises/futures/tasks are a first-class citizen. Eg JavaScript.When caching the result of an expensive computation or a network call, don&#39;t actually cache the result, but cache the promise that awaits the result. Ie don&#39;t make a    Map&lt;Key, Result&gt;

but a    Map&lt;Key, Promise&lt;Result&gt;&gt;

This way, if a new, uncached key gets requested twice in rapid succession, ie faster than the computation takes, you avoid computing/fetching the same value twice. This trick works because:- promises hold on to their result value indefinitely (until they&#39;re GC&#39;ed)- you can await (or .then()) an existing promise as many times as you want- awaiting an already-resolved promise is a very low-overhead operation.In other words, the promise acts as a mutex around the computation, and the resulting code is understandable even by people unfamiliar with mutexes, locks and so on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cache-Oblivious Data Structures: https://cs.au.dk/~gerth/MassiveData02/notes/demaine.pdfA vaguely related notion is that naive analysis of big-O complexity in typical CS texts ignores over the increasing latency/cost of data access as the data size grows. This can&#39;t be ignored, no matter how much we would like to hand-wave it away, because physics gets in the way.A way to think about it is that a CPU core is like a central point with &#34;rings&#34; of data arranged around it in a more-or-less a flat plane. The L1 cache is a tiny ring, then L2 is a bit further out physically and has a larger area, then L3 is even bigger and further away, etc... all the way out to permanent storage that&#39;s potentially across the building somewhere in a disk array.In essence, as data size &#39;n&#39; grows, the random access time grows as sqrt(n), because that&#39;s the radius of the growing circle with area &#39;n&#39;.Hence, a lot of algorithms that on paper have identical performance don&#39;t in reality, because one of the two may have an extra sqrt(n) factor in there.This is why streaming and array-based data structures and algorithms tend to be faster than random-access, even if the latter is theoretically more efficient. So for example merge join is faster than nested loop join, even though they have the same performance in theory."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The union-find data structure / algorithm is useful and a lot of fun.The goal is a data structure where you can perform operations like &#34;a and b are in the same set&#34;, &#34;b and c are in the same set&#34; and then get answers to questions like &#34;are a and c in the same set?&#34; (yes, in this example.)The implementation starts out pretty obvious - a tree where every element either points at itself or some thing it was merged with. To check if two elements are in the same set, check if they have the same parent. Without analyzing it, it sounds like you&#39;ll average findRoot() performance of O(log(n)), worst-case O(n).There are a couple of simple optimizations you can do to this structure, the type of things that seem like they shouldn&#39;t end up affecting asymptotic runtime all that much. The first is that, whenever you find a root, you can re-parent all the nodes you visited on the way to that root, so they&#39;ll all be quicker to look up next time. The other is that you keep track of the size of sets, and always make the larger set be the parent of the smaller.And neither of those actually do anything impressive alone, but if you use both, the algorithm suddenly becomes incredibly fast, with the slowest-growing (non-constant) complexity I&#39;ve ever heard of: O(the inverse of the Ackermann function(n)). Or, for any reasonable N, O(4 or less)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I started reading the article I thought the title was a bit click-baity for Science. But then I noticed that the theory it refers to was not the amyloid hypothesis itself, but the toxic oligomer hypothesis that emerged later. That theory is pretty much the main potential explanation on why every single drug targeting Aβ failed that still keeps Aβ fibrils relevant. It&#39;s a very convenient theory because it keeps the main original observations about the fibrils relevant while explaining why therapies that target them don&#39;t work.One part that is really important that is mentioned in the middle of the article is that these systems are very difficult to handle, and it&#39;s almost impossible to make many of them nicely reproducible. Fibril and oligomer formation depends a lot on the environment and reacts to tiny differences.I find this kind of fraud deeply frustrating, there is so much wasted effort in the wake of faked high-profile results."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh my god if true, and it looks to be true this is huge.The amyloid beta (Aβ) hypothesis has always been fishy but this paper is basically the bedrock of the current investigational trajectory.The Aβ hypothesis was almost dead in 2006 when this method was invented and results posted and it sent shockwaves through the research world. Since then spending on Aβ research by NIH has gone from $0 to $290 million all it seems based on a lie cited over 2000 times in further papers.The article is pretty convincing as is the independent verification that not only concurred but found additional evidence.Sylvain Lesne has some ‘splainin to do."</p>

He is not at the origin of the amyloid-β hypothesis which is more than 100 years old.Even more there are thousand papers published about Aβ*56 and Alzheimer&#39;s disease. How could this guy responsible for this mess?And if what he published was wrong, why this was discovered only 18 later if thousands scientists are working in the field?My understanding is that there is a need to find a scapegoat for the amyloid-β and pointing to an obscure guy is in the interest of many big fish.[0] https://www.statnews.com/2019/05/21/alzheimers-disease-amylo..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I believe the reason cat gets interrupted when we press Ctrl+C is that the Linux kernel on the server side receives this \x03 character, recognizes that it means “interrupt”, and then sends a SIGINT to the process that owns the pseudoterminal’s process group. So it’s handled in the kernel and not in userspace.Also interestingly, the use of \x03 for this purpose is a default, but it&#39;s not hardcoded. You can change it with the stty command.For example, if you runstty intr &#39;^X&#39;then your interrupt character sequence will be Ctrl+X instead of Ctrl+C (!).In order to make this change, the stty program actually has to call into the kernel with an ioctl call (TCSETS or a related ioctl, for &#34;terminal control set settings&#34;).You can learn more about this ioctl on Linux in the ioctl_tty(2) man page, and you can see the various settings that can be changed this way withstty -a(It&#39;s a little bit confusing which things are handled by the readline library and which things are handled by the kernel, as the kernel&#39;s ability to support some rudimentary line-editing features on an interactive terminal long predates libraries like readline. I think readline might actually disable kernel interpretation of some of these control characters when it starts accepting input, and then re-enable them when it stops, but I&#39;ve never looked into that.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The client sends l and then immediately receives an l sent back. I guess the idea here is that the client is really dumb – it doesn’t know that when I type an l, I want an l to be echoed back to the screen. It has to be told explicitly by the server process to display it.Of course the client may be really dumb! Here is a 1930s teletype used as a Linux terminal:https://youtu.be/2XLZ4Z8LpEE?t=656If you would not do it that way, you would run into all kinds of synchronicity problems. How could you be sure that, after rapidly making 50 keystrokes, every keystroke was received by the other end, in that order?"</p>

Here’s an old chart from the 60s that explains it:https://programesecure.com/ascii-values-table-generator-in-c...Unfortunately if you just see the character codes with the decimal, hex, and octal next to them this logic is obscured.  Remember, it had to be implementable in (mechanical!) hardware."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve given this advice elsewhere, and I&#39;ll give it here. Go look at the small business initiatives by each branch of the U.S. military; many are now posting lists of open contracts that you can bid on for an incredible array of things.Browse through those lists and find something you can build.I really believe the U.S. military is in the midst of a large scale transfer of military spending from traditional large defense contractors to smaller, innovative companies. The Air Force has even opened its own venture capital arm and is actively investing in small businesses. Most, if not every, branch in the military publicly posts contracts for small businesses to bid on.I think Anduril is a great example of the possibilities in the &#34;new&#34; defense space.What&#39;s interesting is this shift is very reminiscent of military manufacturing in Japan during World War 2; much of the manufacturing was actually done by small businesses of &lt; 30 employees in &#34;garages&#34; scattered around the country instead of very large factories. That was one of the reasons American bombing by Superfortresses was so ineffective at first, and one of the reasons incendiary bombs began being used.Happy to provide more detail on this. I&#39;ve been thinking about this space for awhile."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to be the education director at a makerspace and now run a 3D printing company selling small plastic parts and teaching entrepreneurs how to start small manufacturing businesses at home.Few thoughts:- Focus on your hobbies and other industries you know well. What problems exist? Where can you make things better? Are there problems people mention over and over again?- CAD modeling is often THE fundamental skill needed for people to bring their ideas to market. You can make CAD models that look almost real using software you can get for free. This allows you to work backwards, first determining if there&#39;s a market, and also working out many of the design flaws before making somethingIf you&#39;re just excited to make stuff, and want to get your hands on something, you can do all kinds of things in a tight space.- 3D printers are small and provide many automated opportunities
- Laser cutters are dead simple to set up and use to make real products and are easy to automate. 
- CNC machines can be had for under 5k and are super powerful
- Portable MIG welders have a small footprint and welding tends to be in high demand
- Leather working tends to be high perceived value though automation is limited
- Soldering and electronics repair requires little space but again, automation is limitedI&#39;ve got loads of other ideas too but I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s good for now. My contact information is in my profile if you&#39;d like to talk more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I started making jet ski tread mats out of astro turf in my garage last year. Dead simple to cut, margin is super high ($60 for a standard set of three on ~$8 worth of material), and time spent per unit from roll to package is something like 15-20 minutes. It was fun and made about $30k over the summer months but I stopped when I moved back to the west coast.I could have handled the whole operation in a spare bedroom if I didn&#39;t have a garage, and there are plenty of areas where I could have dropped the time required or the cost. I never bought the turf in bulk and I used household scissors to cut from a template so buying a roll and cutting with something more effective may have netted me more. Niche leisure products in spend-y verticals typically do well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It might be worth mentioning a famous abdication which caused a lot of consternation, albeit in another game.  I love this story but may have gotten some details wrong.Marion Tinsley was world checkers champion from 1955-1958, then took a break, then again from 1975-1991, when he resigned in protest (at age 64).  He was utterly dominant; indeed it is hard to think of a competitor in all of history more dominant over his sport or game than Tinsley.In 1990 Tinsley decided to play Chinook, the best checkers computer program in the world.  Chinook had placed second at the US Nationals so it had the right to enter the world championships, but the US and British checkers federations refused to allow it.So Tinsley resigned his title.  Tinsley then played Chinook in an unofficial match (which he won).This power play really stuck it to the federations: nobody wanted to be named the new world champion knowing Tinsley was fully capable of crushing them.  Eventually everyone came to an agreement to let Tinsley be the &#34;champion emeritus&#34;.Tinsley played Chinook four years later, at age 68, still probably the best player in the world.  But in the middle of the match he complained of stomach pains and withdrew after only six games (of 20), all drawn.  Tinsley&#39;s pains were real: he later died of pancreatic cancer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Time to change the format. It&#39;s understandable you don&#39;t want to spend your whole career preparing for these long matches all the time. For the challenger it&#39;s 6 months of preparing, but for Carlsen it would&#39;ve been his 6th time of preparing for this in a few years.They have also become less entertaining. 12 matches is long (edit, 14 now), but no one dares to take any risks. Caruana was just defensive and all games ended in a draw. Karjakin they both at least won each their game, but still had to go to rapid tie-breaks. And against Nepo it was a steamroll, understandably meeting him again isn&#39;t that exciting.It&#39;s also almost impossible for a new person to get a chance. Even Carlsen didn&#39;t like the format and didn&#39;t participate in the Candidates for a few years, and when he first did he almost didn&#39;t win it to be allowed to play the WC match. Even though he clearly was the best player at the time.I wonder how this will affect the status of the title, when it&#39;s in practice is now a title-fight between the second best players.Also what will happen to the hype in Norway? Each WC match has so far been live streamed on all big news pages, biggest TV channels etc. It will still be a Christmas tradition to watch the rapid WC tournament I guess, but I&#39;m afraid this will lead to less coverage. But just to tell how big Carlsen is in Norway: This is the top news on all outlets at the moment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Obviously this raised the issue of Bobby Fischer. The article mentions this but doesn&#39;t really go into the details.Fischer beat Spassky in Rejkyavik in 1972 for the World Championship. This took almost 3 months (July to September) and there was controversy, disagreement and negotiation about where and how it would take place. This had the backdrop of being a Cold War proxy too of course.Interestingly, Fischer didn&#39;t play competitive Chess after this. He was set to defend the title against the eventual challenger, Anatoly Karpov, in 1975. Fischer too didn&#39;t like the tendency for draws and proposed a format of first to 10 wins (with Fischer retaining the title in case of a 9-9). This was rejected and Fischer ultimately abdicated and never played competitive Chess again. He also became a semi-nomadic recluse too.But it also wasn&#39;t Fischer&#39;s first hiatus from the game. There was the 1972-1975 gap but also anotehr in the 1960s. He clearly seemed like a troubled guy.I&#39;ve always found it fascinating the level of commitment required to play Chess at this level. I certainly have never had any interest in that (nor the ability, to be clear). No one really seems to know how to solve this without going to a more blitz like format.Chess at the highest level seems to revolve around memorizing a whole book of openings and defenses while being able to take advantage of mistakes but also finding novel approaches in standard openings and defenses but now it seems you have to go fairly deep into a game before you go off-book."</p>

When inviting a partner to a teamviewer session, one can do so by sharing the invitation url.The invitation url looks like this (where XXXXXXXX is the session code).  https://get.teamviewer.com/v15/en/sXXXXXXXX

The website will check if a teamviewer font is installed (using javascript). If the font is found, the web site assumes that teamviewer is installed. The teamviewer installer also registers a protocol handler in the operating system.
The website (javascript code) will thus try to launch teamviewer directly using a url like the following:  teamviewer8://instantsupport/?sid=XXXXXXXX

Otherwise, if the font is not found, it will prompt the user to download and install the teamviewer application.Source:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"My proposal:1. Browsers should ship with a set of fonts used just in the web browser that web designers can count on. Right now, there isn&#39;t a font I can count on finding in Chrome on all platforms. This especially matters for non-English languages, where a different system font can lead to a website that looks very different.2. Browsers should not load fonts installed in the operating system. It&#39;s a fingerprinting vulnerability. And it also causes issues where the system-installed font is unexpectedly different from platform to platform. For example, Arial is different across platforms, especially once you consider non-English languages."</p>

If it does detect it, it shows me a couple of half-naked shaved guys hugging each other and begins playing &#34;Songs of Innocence&#34; the moment I turn the ignition on. I tried deleting this song from the iPhone, but it auto-magically restores itself somehow, as if it is in the telephone&#39;s firmware. The image of men hugging in shade is baked into my mind forever at this point.As I want to set my plans in silence, I press stop on the dashboard. I set my Google Maps navigation, turn the knob to increase the volume so I could hear instructions, and this triggers &#34;Songs of Innocence&#34; to continue playing and the second burst of outrage in my cardiovascular system. I press the stop the second time, and at this point can continue on my journey - but should I try to increase the volume again, I have to remember the hugging men are always there.Once (or twice), the phone just went berserk and couldn&#39;t stop playing them. I tried everything, but the Songs were playing, and the men were hugging while I was doing 70 mph on the motorway. I had to reboot the phone, but after the reboot, the car was unable to pair with it.I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a Lexus problem, or an Apple problem, but what I know is that I really fucking hate U2."</p>

It&#39;s like phone chargers before USB.- Makers of BT devices tend to cut corners and/or add not-entirely-standard features. They &#34;save&#34; on writing a good driver. They care little if devices made by their competition don&#39;t work reliably or at all in the mix. (And even sometimes their own!)- RF noise makes radio interfaces like BT inherently not always reliable. But the user never notices when a small EM storm rages nearby, for the user it&#39;s just &#34;damn bluetooth glitches for no reason at all&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yeah, but thats hardly news, we have known that for decades. Otherwise direct serotonin releasers would be the most useful ADs. But these mostly give people nausea and serotonin syndrome. ADs work mostly by being FIASMAs, reducing inflammation and oxidative stress, increasing neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, increasing the activity of other monoaminergic systems, and the serotonergic portion is mostly explained by downregulation of 5-HT1A autoreceptors due to chronicly high extrasynaptic 5-HT levels. This also explains the delayed action of ADs.At least this is my knowledge from when I last researched this topic in depth.But that would be a little bit too much for the general public, so it is simplified, to this annoying effect that everyone talks of &#34;low serotonin levels&#34; where in fact the underlying systems are way more complex."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Other clinicians say, however, that the notion of depression being because of a simple chemical imbalance is outmoded anyway, and that antidepressants remain a useful option for patients alongside other approaches including talking therapies.This is the key line in the summary.The concept of attacking an idea no one really believes is really a straw man.More importantly the modern practice of medicine is &#34;evidence based medicine&#34;, not &#34;mechanism based medicine&#34;.
That means treatments are tested as to if they work, not how they work.
Ideally in multiple well run double blinded randomised controlled trials with at least some against treatment as usual.
Unlike the past when we thought more about how they might work, theorising something is off about someone&#39;s humors and adjusting with leeches.Anyone looking for a truly mind bending result should look at Hjorth et al. 2021 [0], the study recruited people with social phobia and gave them all an SSRI (escitalopram). Half were told they were getting a sham active placebo and &#34;should not expect to get better&#34;, half were told &#34;you&#39;re getting the known effective treatment&#34;.Headline result being told you are being treated leads to 4x as much response with brain changes in the dopamin networks.In the meanwhile, rather than worry about how antidepressants work, why not take a look at electroconvulsive therapy which has proven time and again to be the most effective treatment for depression. Yet we have no idea how it works, other than knowing a decent seizure in those without epilepsy makes you less sad? What on earth.[0] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-021-01682-3"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a theory which I can’t substantiate, just anecdotes and conversations I had throughout the years. But, I’m convinced a lot of depression/anxiety stems from thinking too much and that in turn is caused by an ever complex word with looser and looser guidelines or norms.I’m not making judgements weather this is necessarily good or bad but rather observing.In the past, even as recent as the 50s but certainly before the 20th century, a persons course in life was mostly determined at birth.You’re born, you play, you grow up, work the fields or a job, get married, have kids of your own and die. Society was more rigid and pretty much funnelled you through a “tried and tested path”, for good or for worse. And the lack of information made things “simpler” in a way in the sense you had a small number of people to get input from. Take child rearing for example. Many modern people worry so much and research ways to “optimise” their children for example ( I’m thinking of a lot of questions I saw on the parenting stack overflow ) whereas in the last, you’d just ask your own parents. And, since they were older, the assumption was they knew what they where talking about, even if it was not necessarily true. Same with health, same with sexuality, relationships, a lot of things.Essentially lack of information and a rigid social structure meant fewer choices which meant less thinking. And less thinking meant less depression and anxiety.Now when you have a world of information at your hands, you have way more things to think about, to worry about and to look for information on how to fix or improve.I’m not sure medication, even “working” one is a sustainable solution to what appears to me to be an environmental problem rather than a biological one."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of folks here arguing that the focus on TikTok is unfair, given the data collection practices of domestic corps like Facebook.  From a privacy point of view, this argument is well-founded, but I think it&#39;s tangential to the argument TFA is making, which is: this data collection done by a foreign government and exploited for surveillance or espionage is a national security risk.I get it.  We want corps to stop hoovering up our data because they can use it to manipulate us with advertising, and they can mishandle it such that other bad actors can exploit it.  I&#39;m with you, this is a valid concern that we should address.  But I think TikTok&#39;s specific case warrants additional concern because it&#39;s all that, plus it puts a geopolitical adversary in control of the data, countless devices, and a media channel central to the current cultural zeitgeist.I don&#39;t think it&#39;s reasonable to wait for general regulation of social media corps while TikTok continues to do its thing, particularly if targeted action against TikTok is politically viable.Edit: typo"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems an intractable mess.- Our phone hardware and operating systems are intrinsically insecure.- There is no practical/effective data gathering regulation (and I&#39;m not sure
   it&#39;s possible to craft any without destroying innovation)- All social media companies are doing it, leading to jeers of &#34;hypocrisy!&#34;- All governments play the same games, reducing the arguments to
   &#34;Whose side are you on?&#34; That&#39;s effectively meaningless in a
   globalised world. The consequence is more nationalism and an ever
   more fragmented splinternet.- The only proposed solutions amount to more authoritarian,
   controlling and regulatory responses.What can we do?There is a solution. Stop protecting these companies. Burn down
WIPO. Tear up practically all &#34;intellectual property&#34; laws. Revoke
millions of patents. Repeal all DCMA type laws regarding reverse
engineering. Kick trademark and brand protection law to the curb.The real problem is gargantuan monolithic, captive audiences that
exist because incumbent monopolies enjoy protectionist measures that

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been a software dev since the 90s and at this point, I&#39;ve learned to basically do things like audit trails and soft deletion by default, unless there&#39;s some reason not to.Somebody always wants to undelete something, or examine it to see why it was deleted, or see who changed something, or blah blah blah. It helps the business, it helps you as developer by giving you debug information as well as helping you to cover your ass when you are blamed for some data loss bug that was really user error.Soft deletion has obvious drawbacks but is usually far less work than implementing equivalent functionality out-of-stream, with verbose logging or some such.Retrofitting your app and adding soft deletion and audit trails after the fact is usually an order of magnitude more work. Can always add it pre-launch and leave it turned off.If performance is a concern, this is usually something that can be mitigated. You can e.g. have a reaper job that runs daily and hard-deletes everything that was soft-deleted more than n days ago, or whatever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Views are a simple solution to this problem.  Pretty much all moderns RDBMSs support updatable views, so creating views over your tables with a simple WHERE deleted_at IS NULL solves the majority of the author&#39;s problems, including (IIRC) foreign key issues, assuming the deletes are done appropriately.I feel like a lot of developers underutilize the capabilities of the massively advanced database engines they code against. Sure, concerns about splitting logic between the DB and app layers are valid, but there are fairly well developed techniques for keeping DB and app states, logic and schemas aligned via migrations and partitioning and whatnot."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The concept behind soft deletion is to make deletion safer, and reversible.&#34;That&#39;s one part. The other part is that in many industries you have regulatory data retention and audit requirements. This is arguably the most valuable and common reason to perform Logical deletes."</p>

So I should be getting paid better right? Have always been paid worse than my SE peers even though there&#39;s x5 - x10 as many of them.* Know lots of SEs who moved from EE because money was better (chief complaint from them is that SE is easier but they don&#39;t care because job less stressful and again more money).* Have never met an SE moving into EE.* I am now at a junction point in my career where I will either: Leave EE completely and work in something else (probably SE or IT), start my own EE business, consult in compliance of EE products (had one gig for a while and it paid well). Why? because money.And I don&#39;t want fast cars or huge houses or any of that absurdity (although A house would be nice). Just living comfortably would be nice. Having the salaries of my SE and CS friends would be amazing.To those commenters who say that you need to be bright to be an EE, it is very flattering, but I am obviously not very bright :D(edit: formatting because, again, not very bright :) )"</p>

I&#39;ve been on floors where multi-million dollar pieces of equipment are used to produce parts with obscene levels of precision being used by expert machinists making 80k a year who risk their own personal safety making these parts.I have EE friends with master degrees who design PCBs that are printed millions of times that struggle to afford rent.It makes no sense. Why is web software so easy to make money in? Why do we value hard engineering so little?"</p>

I went to school for Chemistry and switched to DevOps - which are the not the highest paid of SEs.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you are like me and wondering &#34;What makes carbon different from Rust or Zig?    1. The ability to interoperate with a wide variety of code, such as classes/structs and templates, not just free functions.

    2. A willingness to expose the idioms of C++ into Carbon code, and the other way around, when necessary to maximize performance of the interoperability layer.

    3. The use of wrappers and generic programming, including templates, to minimize or eliminate runtime overhead.

In otherwords, what carbon can do that Rust can&#39;t do, is take a C++ class with a `foo` method and call that method.  Or create a class with a `foo` method and call that method from C++.  Probably one of the biggest hurdles to get over in C++ interopt.  Most don&#39;t do that, instead you&#39;d make a C function binding and struct and move data/invoke functions through that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not immediately obvious from this page and GitHub org, but this is a Google led project. It&#39;s led by Chandler and the c++ toolchain team. I have no idea of it&#39;s endgoals or how open to non-Google ideas it will be."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the end of the safety document:&gt; Overall, Carbon is making a compromise around safety in order to give a path for C++ to evolve. C++ developers must be comfortable migrating their codebases, and able to do so in a largely automated manner. In order to achieve automated migration, Carbon cannot require fundamental redesigns of migrated C++ code. While a migration tool could in theory mark all migrated code as unsafe, Carbon should use a safety strategy that degrades gracefully and offers improvements for C++ code, whether migrated or not.&gt; That does not mean Carbon will never adopt guaranteed safety by default, only that performance and migration of C++ code takes priority, and any design will need to be considered in the context of other goals. It should still be possible to adopt guaranteed safety later, although it will require identifying a migration path.That&#39;s very interesting and pragmatic. It would be interesting if they can eventually come up with the same level of safety guarantees via a different path than Rust&#39;s borrow checker.-------------Since one of their goals is to automatically translate modern C++ to Carbon, I do wonder how well that is going to work in general.I definitely welcome an alternative to C++ that would be easier to read and understand. That would be a benefit to the world."</p>

This would suggest a restful api is not made for system-to-system communication, but requires human mediation at every step of the way, which is precisely not how api’s are used. In short, this definition of restful api’s can’t be right, because it suggests restful interfaces aren’t api’s at all.

Hypermedia is just an expansion on what text means to include temporal anchors within a media stream; most researchers have dropped the distinction.&gt; Hypertext does not need to be HTML on a browser. Machines can follow links when they understand the data format and relationship types.So, to me, a proper format is something like...id: 1234url: http://.../1234name: foodepartment: http://.../department/5555projects: http://.../projects/?user_id=1234This is hypertext in the sense that I can jump around (even in a browser that renders the urls clickable) to other resources related to this resource."</p>

					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32134691">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My interest in science started when a friend and I folded a few paper planes, tested them over a small downhill section outside my house, made notes about what worked, tweaked and experimented with new designs, and so on. It blew my little mind that with structured experimentation you could design things that actually got better with each generation. Where would the improvements stop?With hindsight, I realise that most of the improvements we measured were really just statistical noise. We never had a control plane, so if one by accident flew better one test, then we would tweak something and then we would naturally see regression to the mean, but we would record that as a tweak that made things worse.To little me it was a lesson in deliberate design. To grown-up me I guess it&#39;s a lesson in how easy it is to delude yourself without proper experiment design and statistics.Anyway, then after seeing my interest my father brought me an early Windows program that contained animated instructions on some paper plane designs. One of them was vastly superior to anything I had ever seen. But with the years, I forgot how to fold it. I had been looking for it for over 20 years when a few months ago, I wanted to show my son (of two years) a good paper plane and guess what? I think I&#39;ve found the design! But it took a blurry YouTube video and some trial and error. I ought to write it down some day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In fourth grade we had a paper airplane contest, but they had a restriction on the design: a circle about the size of a quarter was on the page, and no fold or crease could go through the circle.The circle was located a few inches above the exact center of the paper.Anyway I made a &#34;dart&#34;, and just offset the angle a little to avoid the circle. It was good, and most of the competition was incredibly bad. And a few maybe had a bad launch. One throw only.One clever design was submitted by a duo composed of my two worst nine year old enemies: Derek and Derek&#39;s sidekick. It was basically a UFO (saucer) made by carefully crumpling the edge until it was a nice size to throw. They threw it sidearm with one finger hooked around the rim.It really sailed, maybe went twice as far as the second best plane: my plane.But their plane was disqualified on the grounds that it wasn&#39;t a plane. So, I was deemed winner.For the announcements the next morning, my name was announced as the wrong-gendered version (something like Jesse announced as Jessica) and it definitely didn&#39;t feel like a win anymore.I still like paper airplanes, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My favorite paper plane is the one that is explained starting at 03:00 here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BNg4fDJC8AOut of all paper planes I tried, it has the best flying capabilities by far.Form and function really come together in this one. It looks beautifully simple and elegant. And that&#39;s also how it flies. When you throw it from a rooftop, you are in for quite a show. It often flies loooong smooth circles. If you are lucky with the wind, it can stay in the air quite a while.I do not use A4 paper though. I prefer A5, which is half the size of A4. I usually tear an A4 into two equal halves and use one of them.I also do not do the crease at 04:18. Without it, the paper plane is even more beautiful, because you can put it on a flat surface and it stands on its own."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To everyone replying with their coffee preferences, you may be missing the point. This post isn’t about coffee, it’s about people and experiences in life being more important than products. It’s about a product’s quality being defined not by its substance but by its reminder of things that can’t be purchased. It’s one of the most beautiful posts I’ve seen in a long time. Hope you look beyond the coffee.Edit: Hope I didn&#39;t come across as too harsh to folks replying with their favourite coffee styles. I think I find myself in a near-constant state of, &#34;but what about the things that matter&#34; when spending time in VC/Startup/SV/AI/crypto/etc. culture. I know more unhappy-but-wildly-successful people here than I can shake a stick at, and I think we (as a community) are hugely complicit in pushing a consumerist culture where stuff&gt;people. I was deeply moved to see a piece surface to HN which poetically argued for the opposite value set, and I had a moment of frustration when it wasn&#39;t clear that it was coming across to people in the comments. :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve gone through several coffee phases, some bordering on extreme — extremely sensitive weighing, timing, $2,000 grinders, $10k espresso machine, etc.My happy medium is just doing basic pour overs, but with really good locally roasted coffee. To me, this is the cheapest and best approach.In fact, even if pour overs require too much work (weighing, timing), then just do drip. But do it with quality coffee.Quality is really about roasting time and date. You don’t want old coffee (anything older than a few weeks isn’t good), and low temp. Dark roast is burnt. It’s not a flavor. It’s used to remove the taste from shitty beans. If you use quality beans you want light to medium. This usually isn’t an option with quality beans anyway. They typically only sell the coffee roasted one way. So in most cases, you won’t even have to worry about.Anyway, I guess my point is the opposite of the article. You don’t have to drink shit coffee to save money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was a really beautiful post.As for coffee, like many other parts of life (movies, food, and music especially), I find that I like it very good or very bad—as long as it’s not down the middle, I can find a time/place to enjoy it.I have a fairly expensive Rocket Espresso machine, I’ve learned some latte art. I have every coffee making contraption out there. And I enjoy all of it, at times.When I’m in a hurry I’ll make instant or go to a gas station. Totally fine and the gas station coffee is kind of a favorite of mine for long trips in the car.What I almost never do is buy Starbucks because to me, it feels like that middle-of-the-road experience. I’m not making a statement about the company or the culture or anything like that. It just feels like going to Applebees or something (yes you’re out to eat, but shouldn’t you just go somewhere nice or, on the other hand, somewhere cheaper/faster where you don’t have to tip?). It’s too acidic and too expensive for what it is. I’d rather pay for something nicer or go cheap."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When speaking about Sardinia they keep saying that their diet was mostly vegetarian:&#34;The classic Sardinian diet is plant based, consisting of whole-grain bread, beans, garden vegetables, and fruits. Meat is largely reserved for Sundays and special occasions. Sardinians drink wine moderately.&#34;Truth is that the Shepherds (the centenaries are mostly found in this group) were actually eating more animal protein and fat compared to the rest of the population.https://snipboard.io/gbi9JY.jpgThey can keep lying to most people just because you can&#39;t understand Italian but whenever people from those towns are interviewed they always repeat that they were not vegetarians. 
Here a quick translation from this yt video:Graziano who got to 102 
got asked if he got to 102yo
because he had always followed a
mediterranean diet.
He asked what&#39;s that?
It means that you always ate vegetables.
Vegetables are bad for you, I 
ate the grass of 100 sheeps because
I ate the sheeps. And indeed
he only ate meat, meaning that this whole
alimentation thing should be checked again.https://youtu.be/LQTocSMm7tw?t=647"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read the books and enjoyed them.- To respond to one criticism seen widely here, the authors claim to have validated ages with historical municipal birth records in all the Blue Zones. I cannot speak to these particular zones, but I&#39;ve been doing genealogical research on my own ancestry and I am absolutely blown away by the ubiquity and detail of both municipal and Catholic church records in Sicily in the 1800s.  Preunification Italy was under the rule of various northern European countries and was heavily influenced by their standards of record keeping. I cannot say if this applies to the other countries in the book, but generally speaking, just because these records are old doesn&#39;t mean they are bad.- One thing that was very notable in the books but isn&#39;t discussed very much is that, with the exception of the Loma Linda cohort, the Blue Zone areas are all quite poor. They all primarily eat food they are able to grow or harvest themselves, out of necessity, which encourages simple and consistent diets. They have routine, simple lives that are made fulfilling by concentrating on community, family, and friends.  They are content with what little they have and do not strive for more than they need.I found the books quite inspiring.  I think the lessons learned are good, even if they won&#39;t get me to 100.  In any case I&#39;ve felt much better and lost weight on a closer-to-Blue-Zone diet than I did before."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One Ikarian in particular, Stamatis Moraitis, moved to America when he was 22 years old to pursue the American dream. He was a painter, and immediately started having success, bought a house, married, and had 3 kids. At the age of 66 years, he developed terminal lung cancer. Instead of dying in America, he decided to move back to Ikaria and moved in with his parents. He started breathing the air, drinking the wine, and eating a Mediterranean diet. After a few months, he planted a garden not planning on ever getting to harvest the vegetables; 37 years later he has a vineyard producing 200 L of wine a year. His secret he says? “I just forgot to die.”This is where I think the article loses its credibility significantly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I planted some thousands of trees in Iceland in the noughties. I believe the program was funded by Alcoa to offset the carbon produced by an aluminum plant they were building on the island. They paid farmers to plant trees on unused land, and the farmers hired and hosted us to do the work. It was an amazing way to see the country. We mostly planted larch, birch and alder from what I remember. It is a very beautiful country, like an arctic Hawaii."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Planting forests increases the overall amount of carbon stored in biomass, but the forestry program is also designed to harvest trees for use as fuel or building material (from the main article linked in the post):&gt; &#34;In the meantime, Iceland’s forests have begun to produce wood for a small timber market. Forests planted between 1950-1970 are now supplying around 5,000 square metres of wood per year: miniscule compared to industries abroad, but a start. The Icelandic birch, Siberian larch, Sitka spruce, lodgepole pine and balsam poplar are producing quality wood of equal or superior quality to that which Iceland imports from abroad. Yet an overwhelming 80% of the trees felled are burned as fuel in silicon smelting.&#34;Iceland has a silicon production industry, which relies on geothermal electricity interestingly enough.  The wood is included to grab the oxygen from silicon dioxide to produce elemental silicon metal (being emitted as carbon dioxide).  Overall, if they could eliminate the coal from the mix, this would be a carbon-neutral fossil-fuel free silicon production system:https://www.pcc.is/&gt; &#34;Silicon metal is extracted from quartzite, aided by the addition of wood chip and coal, in electric arc furnaces at temperatures of around 2,000 degrees Celsius. The new plant obtains its key raw material quartzite primarily from PCC’s own quarry in Zagórze, Poland. However, the related logistical costs are more than outweighed by the advantages of electricity procurement. And the dust emissions generated during silicon metal production are almost completely removed from the ambient air by high-performance filter systems installed in the PCC plant. Taken as a whole, therefore, the production process offers exceptional sustainability credentials.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been donating some money every month to an Icelandic tree planting project to offset my carbon emissions after reading an article on HN about how the Vikings cut all trees of the island. I find the numbers fascinating :&gt; Forests and bushes now cover over 2% of Iceland, Vísir reports. That number may not seem like much, but since 1990, the surface area covered by forest or shrubs in Iceland has increased more than six times over – from 7,000 hectares to 45,000. In 20 years, the number is expected to be 2.6%.And from another article :&gt; The Forest Service intends to deliver six million plants this year, says Þröstur, which is equivalent to pre-crash levels of production. “It was around five million last year, and four million the year before that. This is a rapid increase. Then we need seven to eight million next year, which we may not manage, and ten to twelve in 2025.”"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My favorite feature is &#34;video-sync=display-resample&#34;. This gives you perfect frame pacing by synchronizing the video to vertical refresh and resampling the audio to match. If you set your refresh rate to an integer multiple of the frame rate, every frame will be shown for the exact same time. The audio resampling compensates for very small discrepancies between speeds by imperceptibly changing the audio speed. It&#39;s similar to the proprietary DirectShow filter &#34;ReClock&#34;, but AFAIK ReClock does not dynamically adjust the speed to compensate for clock drift like MPV does, in which case you could theoretically still get imperfect frame pacing. (I haven&#39;t actually used ReClock so I could be mistaken here.)Also great is MPV&#39;s support for arbitrary OpenGL shaders. This can include very complicated shaders, e.g. real-time neural network upscaling:https://github.com/igv/FSRCNN-TensorFlow/releasesSD video can look surprisingly good after upscaling with this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I highly recommend doing what I have done most of my career. Get a job at smaller to medium sized non-tech company. Every company, in any industry, has computers. They need you. You don&#39;t have to work with a bunch of tech or finance people. You can get a job working with chill people in some other industry with a better culture.When it comes time to negotiate, negotiate HARD. And not just for money, but especially time. Ask for so much that you think they will laugh or be scared away. If they say no, you lose nothing. Eventually the right opportunity will appear. I didn&#39;t think anyone would say yes to a 4-day work week, but I kept asking. Eventually someone said yes.The one worry I am having these days is how long this strategy will remain viable. As SaaS and low/no code solutions proliferate, it makes little sense for non-tech companies to build when they can buy. This is especially true as engineer compensation continues to rise. Engineers who congregate at SaaS companies can build better products than a handful out on their own who are building a solution for just one company. Increasingly, the only engineers that non-tech companies need are people to manage their data, people to glue the SaaS APIs together, and maybe some frontend people to put a custom interface on it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think most people here can. That&#39;s why, when people have enough money to retire, they DO retire, and not continue working. Work for most people is trading  time and physical and mental health for money. In our profession, we got it better than most, but the underlying principle is still the same.Also, there are definitely better and worse companies. I&#39;m currently in the best job of my life (well paying, fully remote, very little meetings, no micromanagement, using interesting and cutting edge technology), but it took me 15 years to get there. The catch is that such companies don&#39;t have to hire that often (because people don&#39;t tend to leave them), so most openings at the market in any given moment are from shit companies where average tenure is 18-24 months and half of the staff has low-grade depression. The job market is essentially a market for lemons, unfortunately."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel exactly the same. Programming professionally for a decade sucked all the joy out of it.My personal hypothesis is that we’re increasingly being treated like assembly line workers. We’re not paid to think but to implement the poorly thought out hare brained schemes from the higher ups who have no clue about programming. This externalizes all the cost of poor quality software onto the developers (unmaintainable code, constant outages…) while  reaping the short term benefits for themselves (promotions, raises)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s important everyone becomes educated about the fact that virtually every mobile app sells some part of your data that leads to some private company possessing the ability to draw a circle around your house on map and then detect all patterns of life without any PII.I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to pit this as a US gov&#39;t surveillance problem. It&#39;s true though - the Government missions involved, where this type of data is relevant, face rather compelling offerings especially in complex times; e.g. immigrant/refugee surges where understanding the flow of people up to the border is important for stability.All of this data comes from Big/Small/all tech; usually branded as &#34;ad tech&#34; or &#34;mobility data&#34;. And the supply chain is rather murky, masked, and rebranded/repackaged numerous times between a network of data providers &amp; downstream businesses.Working close to Government... I&#39;ve never seen any mission specifically seeking large-scale citizen-based tracking capabilities.  US government in recent timeframes have seemed adamant about not purchasing any US-based location data &amp; are cautious even for non-US based monitoring; especially as they learn more about the origins &amp; scale of mobility data."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every person, living and dead, has been uniquely identified and is tracked in near real time.Source: I read the news, don&#39;t suffer from amnesia or willful ignorance.We used Seisent (since bought by LexisNexus) in the mid-aughts. At the time, every person in North America was accounted for, with pretty good coverage of the Caribbean and Central America. The NSA bought a few clusters, then wove in their own datasets (phone use, location tracking, credit cards, library usage, email, etc).There are many entities maintaining all encompassing panopticonic demographic databases. Governments and publicly traded companies. This is not refutable.Ironically, in the USA, both voter registration and gun ownership are explicitly excluded. Because reasons. (You can&#39;t manage what you don&#39;t measure.)We could, trivially, resolve all the policy food fights over vote registration &#34;fraud&#34;, gun ownership, and conducting the consensus. Turn all those flash points into simple database queries.We could, trivially, outright stop all anonymous trolling and disinformation. Purveyors of social media don&#39;t authenticate their users because they don&#39;t want to. Their business models require that they remain willfully ignorant."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Aside stopping the use of Facebook, which of course is the best solution but not doable for many, the AdNauseam (.io, browser extension) approach to pollute their tracking data might be inspirational.
The gist is: can&#39;t eliminate ad links? Then have an app &#34;click&#34; all of them randomly so that counters become irrelevant. So there is this link that identifies user X?, well then write an extension that distributes and &#34;clicks&#34; it around on say 1000 other machines in a p2p way so that it becomes meaningless.I have no idea if it&#39;s doable in this FB context, but usually when links can&#39;t be anonymized, the next move is to make them produce irrelevant data by adding noise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I haven&#39;t used Facebook in quite a while, but when I did I had a set of userscripts to defuse this tracking. It worked similarly to Google link stripping, by defusing the JavaScript that rewrote the link between the time you clicked it and when your browser opened it. Initially I built it because the free wireless internet in my apartment was unreliable and the redirects could be enough to prevent a page from opening. My method was pretty blunt - I removed element entities that held the target URL, and that broke the listener function. A later iteration would actually unset the listener event. This all worked because it seemed important to FB that you be able to see where the link would take you (e.g. by hovering). I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Facebook&#39;s paternalism (and Google&#39;s for that matter, but I haven&#39;t seen it from them, though I mainly use DDG now) now led them to add this &#34;protection&#34; directly to links as they&#39;re served up. I can&#39;t tell from the article whether that&#39;s the case, and at this point I&#39;m not going to log in to FB to figure it out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would love to stop using Facebook, Instagram or Whatsapp, but I would really need to criple my social life if I&#39;d give up on any of these. And I&#39;m not even a very active person, it&#39;s just that so many people I want to engage with have a huge chunk of their lives tied to one of these.I can&#39;t understand the people saying there is a free market choice here, this can only be solved with simple regulation that targest large platforms.If the SEC can use its judgement on what constitutes a security, than we can have a social media comission to oversee Facebook."</p>

Ever since he came to power—till then, like nearly everyone, I had been deceived into thinking that he did not matter—I have reflected that I would certainly kill him if I could get within reach of him, but that I could feel no personal animosity.... that several commenters pointed out:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32135108https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32133675https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32130897All: in the future, if you notice something like this, could you please send us a heads up at hn@ycombinator.com? We can&#39;t read all the articles or comments, but we do read all the emails, usually within a few hours. We will be especially grateful if you point out a flaw as massive as this one.Edit: I couldn&#39;t resist diffing the bowdlerized text with the gutenberg.net.au one and the eliding of that bit is the only difference between the two, other than punctuation.Edit 2: it turns out that bookmarks.reviews is guilty only of blogspam. They got the thing from https://www.openculture.com/2014/08/george-orwell-reviews-me..., which links to https://carnegiecouncil-media.storage.googleapis.com/files/v... (via https://boingboing.net/2014/08/17/orwells-review-of-mein-kam...). That looks like a decades-old copy of the 1968 edition, edited by Orwell&#39;s widow. I doubt that it was she who dropped that sentence—I bet it was whoever reprinted the essay. Considering that Orwell specifically wrote &#34;I should like to put it on record&#34;, that took some brass, or lack of it.The degree to which Orwell practiced intellectual honesty is an endless marvel. If there&#39;s one thing we should learn from anybody, it&#39;s that from him."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, there&#39;s a lot to be said about Hitler and fascism and propaganda and all the other fascinating topics Orwell brings up here, but I&#39;d just like to point out how routinely excellent Orwell&#39;s analysis is.  Of course I mostly see the best bits brought out and dusted off, no doubt he did mediocre stuff as well, but it is worth noticing how often it turns out that Orwell, nearly a century on, still has plenty in his writing worth revisiting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting that this version is an edited version, and unclear when the changes occurred.The full version[1] includes this:&gt; I should like to put it on record that I have never been able to dislike Hitler. Ever since he came to power—till then, like nearly everyone, I had been deceived into thinking that he did not matter—I have reflected that I would certainly kill him if I could get within reach of him, but that I could feel no personal animosity.

While doing large-scale builds of debian packages [1], occasionally I&#39;d have parts of the build process hang (usually some test that I didn&#39;t care about). I didn&#39;t want the whole build to fail, so I needed some way to kill the process but have it return 0 so that make and friends wouldn&#39;t think anything was amiss.Also, credit where credit is due -- the original idea was suggested to me by Kyle Huey: https://twitter.com/moyix/status/1484342467205816325[1] https://moyix.blogspot.com/2022/02/on-building-30k-debian-pa..."</p>

Since glibc 2.3, the wrapper function invokes exit_group(2), in order to terminate all of the threads in a process.https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/_exit.2.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"May not be as portable, but &#34;exit(1)&#34; would probably make it seem more like an accident."</p>

Madblog has a lot of the features I wanted (including RSS feeds, git versioning for the static files, a good looking index and LaTeX support), all while being purely staticly served with zero JavaScript. But now I feel the need for some more meaningful user interactions - adding comments on articles, preferably through Fediverse/OpenID login instead of using Disqus or other bloated stuff. But I don&#39;t feel like going down that rabbit hole implementation.Is there any source code for prose.sh by the way? Can it be self-hosted?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tangent but I was always annoyed at how poorly google products work offline. One time I was using google maps to navigate to a remote address. Once I got close to the address google maps crashed and I re-opened the app. I had no cellular service. The app remembered the actual map data but did not remember the address I had just typed in to the program 15 minutes earlier. I had to guess what street address I was heading to! Why they designed the app to store all search history exclusively in the cloud and not keep a local copy is beyond me, but I presume when working at google they always have an excellent connection and hadn’t thought of what would happen if a user lost service. Being able to at least see the search history would have saved me some grief!"</p>

Written in a very approachable manner with very good code. The best for self-learners.2. Algorithms by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, Vazirani (DPV). Very short and concise book- extremely well-written with a personality. Requires basic CS math.3. Algorithm Design Manual by Skeina. Extremely approachable as well. Has &#39;battle stories&#39; of algorithm usage. Good for self-learners. Links to problems in Leetcode is given.4. CLRS is of course nice for a mathematically rigorous study."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One practice that&#39;s helped me is to always cancel immediately, which translates to only paying for one month. Ie. for spotify, netflix pay for the subscription, immediately jump through the hoops to cancel.Forgetfulness turns into money savings, and as a bonus I get to review whether I am getting much out of it. Especially for tv like disney/netflix/apple tv, I often run though everything interesting and don&#39;t have much else to watch with them.Also psychologically there&#39;s resistance to a boring to do that involves loss. I will put off &#34;go to netflix and figure out how to cancel.&#34; So do that work when you are excited to see the new show."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is it typical to spend so much on software subscriptions? I pay for Spotify and a cheap VPS if that counts but that&#39;s it. I figured the average person probably has one or two media subscriptions (Netflix, Disney, Spotify, etc) and nothing else."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I think may be underrated by many:We cancelled Amazon Prime, and besides the annual fee, we noticed that our household retail spending went down significantly. It turns out that when it takes more than 1-click to buy stuff… we buy less stuff.As far as convenience, one of the reasons we felt it was time to cancel is that we can just as easily get almost anything we wanted from Amazon direct from the seller or via Target/Best Buy/B&amp;N/B&amp;H. Surprisingly, this is often cheaper than Amazon (and almost never more expensive). While there’s a bit of added friction to think for two seconds which store to check, the benefit of fewer impulse buys seems worth it. Plus, we haven’t ended up with any crappy knockoffs since we bailed on Amazon."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The censoring is so horrible that Chinese are using other country&#39;s name to substitute China. For example, there is a question in Zhihu, &#34;Will China become the next technological powerhouse?&#34;. The answer is talking about Russia literally, but it&#39;s about China. (Below is the answer translated by deepl).I don&#39;t want to talk about China, I want to talk about Russia.Can Russia become the next technological powerhouse? Of course not.Because the ceiling of Russian intelligence or wisdom is Putin. There is no one in Russia who can claim to be more intelligent than Putin. Russia can do without anyone, but not without Putin. Although we do not know whether Putin has any relevant qualifications or experience in the industry, all Russian businesses and professions depend on Putin&#39;s guidance and must hold up Putin&#39;s ideas and banners, otherwise they will not be able to move forward. Putin is the ceiling of Russia. How can a country with a ceiling become a technological powerhouse?Look at the United States. Who dares to direct the work of Musk, whether Trump or Biden? Who dares to direct the business strategies of Apple and Google? I find that in the US, it seems that anyone can say they are smarter than the president, it seems that anyone can say they are smarter than the president. The technology companies in the US seem to be able to run smoothly without the guidance of Biden&#39;s ideas, and they seem to be able to develop technology without raising the banner of Biden&#39;s ideas, and they seem to be doing quite well. I find that the US is a country that has no ceiling in terms of intelligence or ingenuity, and that is always improving. Only such a country can become a technological powerhouse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The linked story kind of buries the context info:&gt; Nomura said the refusal to pay mortgages stems from the widespread practice in China of selling homes before they’re built. Funds from presales are kept in escrow accounts to use for construction. But confidence that projects will be completed has weakened as developers’ cash woes intensified.&gt; “Inappropriate usage of presale proceeds and the lack of adequate supervision of escrow accounts by local regulators and banks are likely associated with these mortgage suspension cases,” Zerlina Zeng, a senior analyst at CreditSights, wrote in a note."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The background for this is that most existing UI toolkits are a poor fit for Rust.Rust doesn&#39;t like having shared mutable state, but event-based UIs have a global event loop and can mutate anything at any time.Rust works best with strictly tree-shaped data structures, but event handlers turn trees of widgets into arbitrary webs with possibility of circular references.Rust prefers everything thread-safe, but many UI toolkits can&#39;t even be touched from a &#34;non-main&#34; thread.Rust&#39;s object-oriented programming features are pretty shallow, and Rust doesn&#39;t have inheritance. That makes it awkward to model most toolkits that have deep hierarchies with a base View type and a dozen of Button subclasses.So instead of retrofitting mutable single-threaded OOP to a functional multi-threaded language, there&#39;s a quest to find another approach for UIs. This change of approach has worked for games. Rust wasn&#39;t nice for &#34;class Player extends Entity&#34; design, but turned out to be a great fit the ECS pattern."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the web really killed the idea of &#34;native&#34; widgets. I think the rise of web apps just got everyone used to the idea that controls are just going to look different everywhere. Even on macOS, practically every app I use has a very distinct look and set of widgets (vscode, photoshop, blender, spotify -- two of those are electron, but even the non-electron stuff doesn&#39;t look very much like a &#34;mac&#34; app anymore). And in windows, microsoft really killed it themselves by constantly updating their own apps with non-standard widgets that everyone else wanted to clone (I remember the longest time it seemed like the only new things of note in every new version of ms office was how the toolbars looked). I suppose it&#39;s not a terrible thing, but I do kinda miss the days of windows 2000 and classic macos where the platform had a (somewhat) uniform look and feel."</p>
