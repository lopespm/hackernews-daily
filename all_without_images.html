The maximum speed of the bus is 45 mph so it takes about eight hours. The bus constantly tilts right so you have to constantly correct it&#39;s course, otherwise you&#39;ll drive off the road and have to be towed back (also in real time).The only break in the monotony is a bug that splats on the windshield at around hour 5."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Okay so I got to the wrap-up at the end, about &#34;why did nobody else find this&#34;, the author sets up some logical dominoes but doesn&#39;t knock them down. Allow me to try:Earlier in the article, the author mentions that they recently upgraded some network hardware, and the problem seemed to become more frequent after that.Packet loss or other network issues would force the stack to fall out of fast-path and update the counter, avoiding the bug.Running over ssh would avoid the bug. The only time you&#39;d run rsync not over ssh would be within your own network.So it sounds like (this is my conjecture here) this would only appear to someone running rsync internally, over a high-performance network with no packet loss, and upgrading the switches might&#39;ve finally gotten the network good enough to expose the bug?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who thrives on tracking down rare but annoying bugs in a debugger, I love stories like this. It is not just bugs that cause real failures which can be headaches; but also bugs that just slow things down unexpectantly. They can sometimes go undetected for decades like this one.I wrote an article this past year that talks about silent bugs that slowly eat resources and collectively can be very expensive in terms of wasted time and energy: https://didgets.substack.com/p/finding-and-fixing-a-billion-..."</p>

What if Westinghouse had just completely failed and ceased operations?  Who would support the remainder of projects like Vogtle 3 &amp; 4, and ongoing maintenance for the next however-many decades?I guess a company in a heavily-regulated sector like this must have some sort of succession plan, but it&#39;s not clear to me how this would work, in the case of e.g. the company going bankrupt, and all the staff with institutional knowledge about a reactor design dispersing to various other companies.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m quite familiar with this whole lawsuit, and I still think it&#39;s total and complete bullshit (and, to be clear, I have huge concerns about Google&#39;s tracking and surveillance).Incognito Mode basically puts you in a mode as if you had installed a fresh, new instance of the browser every time, e.g. none of your past cookies can be accessed by any websites. Websites, though, can still use analytics APIs, including things like Google Analytics, to track you within that Incognito Mode session. They may also be able to correlate you by, for example, matching your IP address. And, to be clear, the Incognito Mode new window has always made this clear.I can still be really concerned about Google&#39;s overall tracking and also point out this lawsuit is a bullshit money grab from lawyers hoping for a lotto payout."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of folks are commenting on the fact that &#34;incognito mode&#34; never promised that it would conceal your identity.I find it odd that everyone seems to be just ignoring that the word &#34;incognito&#34; literally means &#34;with one&#39;s true identity concealed&#34;.   It is, in fact, reasonable for naive users to expect that their identity would be concealed while using &#34;incognito mode&#34;, Google&#39;s disclaimers to the contrary notwithstanding.&#34;What?  Everyone should have known that we didn&#39;t literally mean &#39;incognito&#39;!&#34;Luckily, every company&#39;s engineers can be counted on to point out the irony of the company&#39;s marketing bullshit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"(I work on Stripe Billing).  This is a question we raise fairly regularly internally at Stripe. The real, prosaic answer is because when we started working on Stripe Billing in 2017, Stripe had already built an internal billing system to bill its own customers. Stripe was 7 years old at that point.At the time, we got lots of feedback from the folks who had built that system. Our goal was to build a flexible billing system for all kinds of companies at different sizes, but we were definitely focused on smaller (doing maybe $100k–$10M of ARR) SaaS companies to start. We&#39;ve come a long way since then and now power billing for a number of large/public companies. Atlassian, Figma, Notion and Slack are either using or migrating onto Stripe Billing today.Stripe Billing is a powerful tool with a role to play in any company&#39;s revenue management system, including Stripe&#39;s. Newer Stripe products (such as Atlas) do build on top of Stripe Billing but we haven&#39;t gotten around to migrating our existing stack. That said, I do have a personal goal of taking on more internal billing responsibilities over time (e.g. I think we could easily use Stripe Invoices internally today, and it&#39;s mostly opportunity cost keeping us from actually doing so).I do want to say that the specific use case covered in the post is something we have thought about a lot. I think about it as a pipeline with stages for collecting high volumes of usage events, aggregating them, mapping them to rate cards based on usage, and then producing recurring bills, collecting payment, dunning, etc... The post claims we don’t do a good job on the first two stages (collecting usage events and aggregating them) is perhaps missing that the style of percentage-based fees is a one-line addition to a Connect integration as my colleague edwinwee mentioned below.  It is also possible to have a scalable usage event collection/aggregation pipeline integrated with Stripe Billing.  You can read this AWS blog post https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/building-a-third-party-saas... for information about how to build such a system according to our best practices.While I’m here, I’m always eager to hear feedback on Stripe Billing from folks who are using it.  My email is ark@stripe.com."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work at an HR/Payroll company with a phenomenal app that we put our blood, sweat, and tears into every single day. And every single day I clock in with Oracle Time and Labor. There&#39;s a legal reason for this and we do it for compliance. I&#39;m guessing Stripe is in the same boat with this product despite its flaws."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"First off, yes, Stripe uses Stripe to bill our own customers. In fact, for our larger customers who have negotiated complex pricing plans, we&#39;re currently migrating much of our manual billing to a system that&#39;s inspired by Stripe Billing.Second, this article seems to miss the point of Stripe. It seems to want to build a platform, which is what Stripe Connect is designed for.For example, charging a percentage fee is just one line (https://stripe.com/docs/api/application_fees):` $application_fee_percent = 5`Slack, Atlassian, and Notion have all built their B2B billing on top of Stripe. But we don&#39;t target just B2B or B2C ecommerce in case a business has multiple revenue streams (which many businesses are increasingly adding). In fact, we designed Billing so it can flex across any business model—per-seat, usage-based, tiered, or even graduated.This is the point of Stripe. A single stack that flexes with your business as it grows and pricing that&#39;s public."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing that isn&#39;t really covered in this article is relevance calculations.A surprising (to me) thing about PostgreSQL FTS is that it doesn&#39;t do TF/IDF or BM25 relevance calculations.These calculations take statistics about the entire corpus into account - they do things like ranking a document higher if it contains terms from the search which are statistically rare in the overall corpus.PostgreSQL FTS uses how often the search terms appear in the document as part of the ranking score, but doesn&#39;t look at how common/rare individual terms are. https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-controls....OpenSearch/Elasticsearch uses BM25: https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/rest-api/expla...SQLite stores these kinds of statistics and can support BM25 or TF/IDF or custom ranking functions. I wrote more about that here: https://simonwillison.net/2019/Jan/7/exploring-search-releva...Meilisearch does something a bit different (on reading this I don&#39;t think it considers full corpus statistics, but I may be misinterpreting that): https://docs.meilisearch.com/learn/core_concepts/relevancy.h...It looks like Typesense only considers the documents, not the overall corpus: https://typesense.org/docs/guide/ranking-and-relevance.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In case you skip to the comments like I usually do, this post is a light comparison of Postgres FTS vs:  - MeiliSearch: https://www.meilisearch.com/
  - OpenSearch: https://opensearch.org/
  - SQLite FTS: https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html
  - Typesense: https://typesense.org/

Some of the callouts from the results:  - Even when consuming similar content, engines can produce different results, but generally ratios between queries on the same engine should be consistent.
  - Postgres FTS is quite close performance-wise to many other solutions, at least in their default configuration.
  - Only Typesense and MeiliSearch properly handled mis-spellings (the &#34;suprman&#34; query).
  - Typesense was relatively strict with matches compared to other engines.
  - OpenSearch was very fast with ingest, but also failed with the misspelling out of the box.
  - In-memory SQLite is by far the fastest, and PG isn&#39;t too far behind for this small data set."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pretty much all these engines (and PG) are fast enough.Gist/Gin indexes are great and do a fine job to make millions of records searchable in very few milliseconds.The problem is accuracy.I’ve tried a few of these and accuracy is wildly different with most of them.Accuracy depends on how much you index.For example, even with decently designed weighting: If you index title, subtitle, tags and content — too much of content ruin relevancy.And yes, we have proper relevancy sorting setup nicely.The best is something like elastic search, but it does not integrate nicely with PG for our use case. Because of the multi tenant nature of our data setup.PG will get us to that magic 80% but that leaves the all important 20% which is not great.Not to mention the inability to index and search Asian character sets.So even though we exclusively use it, it’s not great and every time our team can’t find something that drives my team into the Psql CLI — I start searching for alternatives again.The big brick wall is updating, inserting and deleting from an external solution fast enough so we don’t miss stuff.And quickly searching multi tenant records in that external solution.And no I’m not ready to use ES as my primary database."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey HN!Plane came from our desire to build tools that have the low friction to use of running in the browser, but use more memory and compute than the browser will allocate. The basic idea is to run a remote background process, connect to it over WebSocket, and stream data.This ends up being a surprisingly useful primitive to have, and it&#39;s been used to:- Pixel-stream X11 applications to the browser over WebRTC[1]- Run IDEs and notebooks- Power Figma-style realtime collaboration backends (including https://rayon.design).Here&#39;s a direct link to our repo: https://github.com/drifting-in-space/plane and docs: https://plane.dev/[1] https://twitter.com/drifting_corp/status/1552773567649091584"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A related and also very useful usage pattern: &#34;backend instance per customer&#34;.Because…There are many ways to implement multi-tenant SaaS; but a highly underrated approach is to write a single tenant app, then use infrastructure to run an instance of it per (currently logged in) customer. Plus a persistent database per customer of course.This has the tremendous advantage that you can add another column to your pricing page easily: the &#34;bring a truckload of money and we will set you up to run this behind your firewall&#34; tier. There are still a lot of orgs out there, large ones with considerable financial capacity, who really want this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The implementation makes some weird choices like rebuilding a bunch of services like DNS, cert, weird dependency on SQLite. Wish people would stop reimplementing Kubernetes and just build on top of it.I think &#34;per-user&#34; is probably the wrong killer feature for something like this. Much more potential in shared distributed processes that support multiple users (chat, CRDT/coauthoring). Appears that the underlying layer can probably do that.In any case, super cool idea, and I hope something like this lands in the serverless platforms from all the major cloud providers. It&#39;s always been mind blowing to me that Google Cloud Functions supports websockets without allowing you to route multiple incoming connections from different users to the same process. That simple change would unlock so many useful scenarios."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something similar happened to the cod fishing industry in Newfoundland and other parts of eastern Canada 30 years ago. The reason: overfishing, due in large part to technological advances. Here&#39;s what happened:Canada and NAFO continued to overestimate the abundance of cod in the Atlantic Ocean and therefore continued to set dangerously high [Total Allowable Catches]. This was in large part due to the widespread practice of calculating cod populations from catch rates in the commercial fishery – if fishers filled their quotas with ease, then officials believed the stock size was at adequately high levels. However, fishing technology had become so efficient by the 1970s that commercial catch rates remained high even as the cod population dropped to dangerously low levels. Electronic tracking devices could find fish no matter how small their numbers and trawlers could harvest most species with relative ease. ...Although overfishing in international waters did tremendous damage to northern cod, Canada also failed to maintain a sustainable fishery within its 200-mile limit. The government ignored warnings from inshore fishers and university scientists that cod stocks were in danger and chose to maintain quotas instead of scaling back the fishery, in large part to prevent economic losses and massive unemployment.By the early 1990s, after decades of sustained intensive fishing from Canadian and international fleets, the northern cod stocks collapsed. The spawning biomass of northern cod had dropped by about 93 per cent in only 30 years – from 1.6 million tonnes in 1962 to between 72,000 and 110,000 tonnes in 1992. In July of that year, Canada imposed a moratorium on the catching of northern cod and ended an international industry that had endured for close to 500 years.https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/economy/moratorium.phpThey called off the season in 1992 and it never came back. A pillar of the local economy in the Maritimes was wrecked.As for climate change and its impact on East Coast fishing, I&#39;ve read that lobster fishing is no longer a viable industry in Long Island and it&#39;s declining in southern New England as waters get warmer and the lobsters permanently migrate north."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A bit of context, the south area which this reactor is suggested to be built in has occasionally a 1000% electricity higher price from the northern regions. A big reason for this is that prices in the south is highly connected to markets that the south region is connected to, and those region are heavily importers of electricity creating a higher demand than there is available of cheap energy. For example, in order to address this there is a oil power plant operating basically 24/7 and does so very profitably even with high oil prices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The new coalition government has pledged $40B (approximately the market cap of Twitter, heh) in loan guarantees for nuclear power construction.They have also pledged to create legal guarantees that future politicians will not be able to shut down functioning nuclear power reactors without suitable monetary compensation to the owners/operators of these reactors.In addition to this, they are commissioning an urgent study on how to rebuild Ringhals 1 and 2 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringhals_Nuclear_Power_Plant, about 1 GW each), two nuclear reactors that were prematurely decommissioned by the previous social-democratic government and shut down about 20 months ago.Personally I&#39;m really happy; I think massive expansion of 
 nuclear power is the only realistic way to fix climate change.The first reactors built will be modern but traditionally large. From then on: There has been a lot of interest in small modular reactors (SMR) from the political party that is driving all of this, and they actually got the nationally owned energy company Vattenfall to begin building prototypes at Ringhals a few months ago.In summary: Lots of champagne bottles popping tonight in Sweden in the homes of clean nuclear power proponents. We have been waiting for this for a very long time. Cheers!"</p>

I would think most travel is done by a wealthy few, but most travelers aren&#39;t wealthy- if that makes sense? It sounds like the &#34;travel&#34; being referred to here is &#34;flying somewhere and being a tourist&#34; but in fact to many people &#34;travel&#34; means taking the train/bus to another city, staying in a hostel, wandering around. Most people who go to see a wonder of the world do it because this might be the one time in their life they can afford to visit NYC, a place many people dream of seeing, and so they want to experience those things that are iconic there. I guess it really stands out to me, this writing sounds like &#34;I&#39;m not like those other stereotypical tourists&#34; and the stereotypes are those behaviors associated with privileged westerners- which isn&#39;t really an accurate representation of most travelers.From the Istanbul post:&gt;Most Turks are not secular though, and neither are they religious nuts like them ArabsHe considers education by traveling as sufficient, which I believe is not the best approach. Might be a good idea to read up a little about the history and cultures of a region before going.There is a lot going on with his writing that comes off ethnocentric, uninformed, insensitive. I&#39;m not going to dissect it, but I&#39;ll just say I recommend familiarization with cultural geography, anthropology, and ethnography if the topic of understanding people in different places interests you- because this blog is rife with problematic bias and some really broad generalizations that are prejudice at best, racism at worst."</p>

Just wanted to point out that Chris Arnade has done quite compelling photo journalism based on his way of engaging with communities, so what might seem like non sequitors or edge lord stuff might be in service of an implicit goal of his that most travelers don&#39;t share.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those not in the know the &#34;4080 12GB&#34; as compared to the 4080 16GB was not just the same card with a little less RAM, as you might assume from the name. It also had ~20% fewer GPU cores and was significantly slower for that reason."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My two cents on Nvidia&#39;s rollback reasoning:4080 12GB was universally panned. The 40 series launch also got heat for price gouging, particularly the higher cost for the low end of the launch (4080 12GB). They had to raise the cost of the lower end of the 40 series though if they wanted to maintain the value of the 30 series cards and clear out the remaining inventory. They couldn&#39;t just release a true 4070 for a true 4070 price. While the name was obviously bad, it seems likely that they wanted to obscure the release of a 4070-quality chip for a 4080-price while attempting to sell off remaining 30 series. Pure speculation: maybe they were hoping a &#34;cheaper 4080&#34; would come across to the uninformed as Nvidia trying to lower the entry cost for 40 series rather than raising it through an expensive 4070.Two potential reasons for the rollback come to mind:
1) higher than expected 4090 demand means they can wait to launch a 4070.
2) higher than expected heat for the thinly veiled 4070 price gouging made it worth it to wait on the release since it helps sell more 30 series cards by raising the entry price for a 40 series while getting better PR in the process."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not just that the 12 GB 4080 was a confusing name - it wasn&#39;t the same class of card, at all.In previous generations when they&#39;ve had differing memory sizes for the same card, that was the ONLY change. So, it was useful for something like CUDA, but usually not for gaming. A specific audience.For the 4080, the 12GB version has the following changes:* 12GB VRAM vs. 16GB VRAM (the obvious one from the name)* 7,680 CUDA cores vs. 9,728 CUDA cores for the 16 GB.* 192-bit memory bus vs. 256-bit memory bus (understandable, since this scales with memory size... but also probably means the memory itself is slower).This isn&#39;t just a different amount of memory, it is fundamentally a different product and should be marketed as such. Instead it&#39;s Nvidia being greedy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This release includes a feature I added [1] to support partial foreign key updates in referential integrity triggers!This is useful for schemas that use a denormalized tenant id across multiple tables, as might be common in a multi-tenant application:    CREATE TABLE tenants (id serial PRIMARY KEY);
    CREATE TABLE users (
      tenant_id int REFERENCES tenants ON DELETE CASCADE,
      id serial,
      PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, id),
    );
    CREATE TABLE posts (
        tenant_id int REFERENCES tenants ON DELETE CASCADE,
        id serial,
        author_id int,
        PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, id),
        FOREIGN KEY (tenant_id, author_id)
          REFERENCES users ON DELETE SET NULL
    );

This schema has a problem. When you delete a user, it will try to set both the tenant_id and author_id columns on the posts table to NULL:    INSERT INTO tenants VALUES (1);
    INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 101);
    INSERT INTO posts VALUES (1, 201, 101);
    DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 101;
    ERROR:  null value in column &#34;tenant_id&#34; violates not-null constraint
    DETAIL:  Failing row contains (null, 201, null).

When we delete a user, we really only want to clear the author_id column in the posts table, and we want to leave the tenant_id column untouched. The feature I added is a small syntax extension to support doing exactly this. You can provide an explicit column list to the ON DELETE SET NULL / ON DELETE SET DEFAULT actions:    CREATE TABLE posts (
        tenant_id int REFERENCES tenants ON DELETE CASCADE,
        id serial,
        author_id int,
        PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, id),
        FOREIGN KEY (tenant_id, author_id)
          -- Clear only author_id, not tenant_id
          REFERENCES users ON DELETE SET NULL (author_id)
          --                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^
    );

I initially encountered this problem while converting a database to use composite primary keys in preparation for migrating to Citus [2], and it required adding custom triggers for every single foreign key we created. Now it can be handled entirely by Postgres![1]: https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/CACqFVBZQyMYJV%3D...[2]: https://www.citusdata.com/"</p>

This is a huge QOL improvement when using row-level security with views and is the top reason I&#39;ll be upgrading from Postgres 13 to 15."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"TikTok livestreams are a bizarre experience that doesn&#39;t get fully conveyed by this article. Scrolling through TikTok it will start showing you live streams every once in a while, and they tend to fall in to patterns like:* baby with a giant deformed head in some kind of medical setting, unable to tell if that baby is real -- if it is, then it&#39;s not a good situation for that baby* people who outwardly have disabilities of some sort, but it also looks like how you&#39;d act as having a severe disability if you&#39;re a con-artist (like constantly shaking, or very slurred speech, I still can&#39;t whether these are legit or not)* people with these vibrating bowls of sand with crystals in them, and they take crystals out of the bowl every once in a while to show you* a teenager building a house of cards, and when they get a certain sticker, they have to destroy the house of cards and start building it again. they are pretending to cry while doing this, and begging you not to give them that sticker    \* there was also a variation where it was a kid deleting games off their PlayStation when they got a certain sticker

* people pretending to sleep, and if you donate different kinds of stickers, it plays different loud sounds or trigger lights to &#34;wake&#34; them* people freestyle rapping on the spot, but it&#39;s more like 
melodic rambling to the same backing track, so you don&#39;t really have to rhyme, you just have to rap in a way that sounds like it rhymes or makes sense* and my favourite: some workers in what seems to be a Chinese factory assembling something like AirPods. they take the airpods, they take the case, they put the airpods in the case, and they throw the whole thing on to the completed pileI came across one last night that I hadn&#39;t seen before and was kind of cool. It was a livestream of a woman filling a washing machine with different detergents, and like, way too much detergents for a load, way too much, and then eventually she turned the machine on.It&#39;s a wild show that you don&#39;t ask for, it gets thrust on you every once in a while when scrolling. The whole game is to give viewers a reason to use stickers on the show, which gives the streamer money (and TikTok like 70% of it)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This really is a story for our age:Rather than giving money to organisations and charities that can distribute donations cheaply and fairly to those that need it, people give direct to the prettiest/most entertaining/most harrowing channel on a social media app and even then most of the donation ends up in the pockets of middlemen and for profit corporations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The middlemen said they worked with agencies affiliated to TikTok in China and the Middle East, who gave the families access to TikTok accounts. These agencies are part of TikTok&#39;s global strategy to recruit livestreamers and encourage users to spend more time on the app.&#34;Fascinating and rare insight (to me) on how they acquire some of their users. Recruiting high value livestreamers isn&#39;t new (see Twitch) but the target here is radically different: people that don&#39;t even have a phone. That&#39;s one desperate (or at the very least aggressive) rollout. Like a Jehova&#39;s witness for social networks."</p>

				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33185010">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"1. Every sufficiently complex framework-free application contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of a framework.2. If you have a talented team, that half of a framework can be much better than using a one-size-fits-all framework that is popular because it used to be lean and mean with a small surface area, but has grown over time to do everything for everyone, becoming a complex monster.3. If you have a small team that hires slowly, it&#39;s relatively straightforward to bring new devs up to speed on &#34;the way we do things.&#34; if you are hiring rapidly and/or have a large team, the more bespoke things you have, the harder it is to maintain them.4. Over time, everything degrades. In the long run, many framework-free applications either get walled off as &#34;legacy&#34; apps with new work done in separate services, or replaced outright. If it makes you money before that happens, you win. It is not necessary to try to design architecture that will last for centuries.5. My last and--to me the most significant--observation is this: You want to pay the majority of your attention to the code that has the greatest impact on your desired outcomes.Using libraries and frameworks is like a business outsourcing things that aren&#39;t its core competency and also aren&#39;t competitive differentiators. Most software shops do not win by having their own framework or by not having a framework, they win by using something bog-standard and saving their attention for the part of their code that &#34;moves the needle.&#34;But that&#39;s only &#34;most,&#34; and your business may be one of the few."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every time I see anti framework posts I am forced to frusteratedly chime in. This mentality makes me fume... not all of us work on massive teams where building stuff without a framework is even an option.And even then, whats really a &#34;framework&#34;? You could argue it&#39;s even the language itself. Android apps used to be written in Java, and now they are pushing Kotlin way harder (and it may even be the default soon). Everyone who wrote those JavaScript apps back in the 1990s without TypeScript, are they still just as maintainable as their TypeScript counterparts? Such a shortsided and ignorant view IMO.I think what bugs me the most is any sort of purist mentality (about anything) in software engineering. WE ARE ENGINEEERS. ENGINEERS USE THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE RIGHT JOB! It should NEVER be &#34;always use X&#34;, &#34;never use Y&#34;. Both X and Y exist for a reason, so they are both useful for some reason.And again, because I&#39;m an engineer, I&#39;ve also built my fair share of apps in just &#34;purist&#34; languages, the classic HTML / CSS / JavaScript, so I&#39;m not against the purist approach either. Again, right tool for the right job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The post is promoting building applications in a loosely coupled but highly cohesive manner. It mentions using libraries when appropriate and not duplicating code.I agree with this but it requires a lead who&#39;s good at architecting such a codebase. That person also needs to stay with the company for a long time because they&#39;re essentially replacing the &#34;framework&#34; with bespoke human logic.I think many, maybe most, companies that try to build loosely coupled and highly cohesive code bases end up failing and it ends up being a mess.Frameworks aren&#39;t perfect. But know what&#39;s less perfect? Humans. The really big frameworks try and take the human component out and replace it with codified conventions."</p>

I can’t help but feel that there are so many tens of thousands of similar stories without such a successful conclusion.In previous roles I’ve used BuiltWith before and it’s an invaluable tool. There’s a few companies with similar approaches except focusing on social media profiles (HypeAuditor comes to mind) that spawned in (iirc) 2017 after Instagram made significant changes to what data were available through their API.It seems similar that Etherscan had this type of first mover advantage with automated data indexing and basic discovery tools for the Ethereum blockchain.I wonder what the next wave of straightforward software utilities will be like."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Texas state politics/law is completely f&#39;d in so many ways, but one thing they do that I think is fantastic, and I wish all states did, was have a &#34;Sunset Review Commission&#34;, https://www.sunset.texas.gov/how-sunset-works.Basically, all agencies that are authorized by the legislature are set to automatically be abolished in (usually) 12 years. Once the expiration date is near, the Sunset Commission reviews the agency and recommends whether to reauthorize it, in which case the legislature must pass a law to reauthorize, but the &#34;default&#34; is that the agency expires.This really helps fight the natural tendency of lots of these professional agencies to grow to protect their own power, regardless of their original purpose. And even if agencies are normally always renewed, the review process itself is really useful to, when necessary, smack these agencies upside the head to get them back to their original goal. One example I&#39;m familiar with, a couple years ago the Sunset Commission basically tore the Texas Veterinary Board a new one after they decided to go after animal shelter vets for trying to save animals with extremely limited resources, https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/One-third-of... - actual report at https://www.sunset.texas.gov/public/uploads/files/reports/St..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The biggest difference between an official site survey and you (or him) doing it themselves is liability. It is pretty clear from the language on the site that they aren&#39;t accepting legal liability and are just a convenience over doing it yourself using Google Maps or a tape-measure.I think the article is very well argued, and if this board&#39;s closure notice is allowed to stand then it will infringe on Californian&#39;s right to simply draw a map of their home or business. His business isn&#39;t offering site surveys and doesn&#39;t proclaim to, and to be honest even Google Maps/Bing/Apple could be at risk if this board&#39;s ability to close/ban this were allowed (they do show property boundaries after all).The biggest problem they&#39;re going to run into is: Who has deeper pockets? Since often in the US legal system that can decide the winner/loser."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This really feels like a &#34;spirit of the law&#34; vs &#34;letter of the law&#34; situation - requiring that only a licensed surveyor &#34;depict the location of property lines&#34; seems totally reasonable as to prevent the &#34;location of property lines&#34; from eroding legally, but banning a site loaded with &#34;THIS IS NOT A SURVEY&#34; disclaimers does not.A discrepancy between requirements from building departments and planning and platting departments is par for the course. Everywhere I have ever lived, the building department will accept an informal description of boundaries to determine whether or not a plan interferes with setback requirements, while a planning department or platting recorder will demand an officially certified survey to determine the actual parcel boundaries.I think this site&#39;s &#34;If your building department DOES NOT require a Surveyor, Engineer, or Architect Stamp our plans are just what you need!&#34; disclaimer is quite spot-on and it is rather frustrating that they are getting targeted.My own county (Boulder County, CO) offer a county-sponsored GIS service which is not surveyor-approved, with similar disclaimers. My surveyed parcel at my current household differed from their assessment by 5% and at my last household, by 10%. While this is a significant number, for building purposes, it isn&#39;t unreasonable - just a few degrees either way in the projection of edges. I think these sites should be allowed to stand with the acceptance that a suit based on the material contained in these sites would be bogus."</p>

The teacher asked him what he was doing that was so important that he couldn&#39;t listen, and to please come up and solve the problem.This kid walked straight up to the board and explained how you can design a computer program to factor any polynomial equation string input to it, and in fact had implemented a polynomial equation factoring program while the teacher explained how to factor simple quadratic equations.Since then, I don&#39;t feel bad if someone achieves more than me, because clearly there are some people out there that are born to solve certain classes of problems (maybe their brain structure is better for those, or something, who knows)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Summary:1. Fermat&#39;s Little Theorem: if p is prime, then b^p = b (mod p) for all integers b. i.e. b^p - b is always a multiple of p. 8^3-8 = 512-8 = 504 = 168 x 3.2. Is the inverse true? Does b^n - b = 0 (mod n) mean that n is prime? No. Sometimes n is non-prime (like n=561, divisible by 3). We call these n, Carmichael numbers.3. Okay, so these numbers exist. How common are they? For primes we know they&#39;re common. Bertrand postulated (Chebyshev proved) that for any n&gt;1, there is a prime p between n and 2n. That&#39;s cool!4. Is it true that there is such a bound for these pretend-primes? Well, we have an interesting fact that there are x^(1/3) of them below any x, once we pass a certain point (i.e. there exists an X such that there are x^(1/3) of them below any x &gt; X) so that makes us think it could be true! Worth seeing!5. But what about this common-ness measure like the B-C result for primes? Well, it turns out that it exists. It ain&#39;t as pretty as just between straight integer multiples, but the fact that it exists in some shape at all is cool! That&#39;s what this kid proved.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Allocating all required memory during startup has been idiomatic for database architectures as long as I can remember. The obvious benefits to doing things this way are wide-ranging.There is a less obvious benefit in more schedule-driven database architectures. By implication, the code knows exactly how much of which resources are instantaneously available at all times since it is directly managing those resources. This enables the database to dynamically adapt its behavior and scheduling decisions in response to specific resource pressures or excess resource capacity. This is basically a fine-grained form of internal micro-backpressure, dynamically prioritizing subsets of the workload that minimize impact on the resources under pressure at any moment in time. In some versions, you can switch internal execution strategies to take advantage of currently under-utilized resources. If you outsource this to the OS, you have no idea how close or far you are from the limits, it doesn&#39;t really work.This doesn&#39;t add much performance per se but is great for minimizing tail latencies. It helps to create a robust internal resource equilibrium that handles transients and concurrency more smoothly and consistently than if the database couldn&#39;t make a fine-grained decisions about what to do from a position of total resource awareness."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Building a system that allocates memory once up-front requires up-front thinking.sqlite apparently  has some support for this, although of course you make it more predictable if you control all the code.https://www.sqlite.org/malloc.htmlThey even provide some nice math for you to create the fixed size heap!The problem of dynamic memory allocation, and specifically the problem of a memory allocator breakdown, has been studied by J. M. Robson and the results published as    J. M. Robson. &#34;Bounds for Some Functions Concerning Dynamic Storage Allocation&#34;.

I&#39;m glad to see someone recognized it could apply to a database.My students do this on the GameBoy Advance specifically so they don&#39;t need to learn about dynamic memory allocation to get useful things done early in my course.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been using Signal for a long time. I have repeatedly been unable to convince iOS users to use Signal because &#34;I don&#39;t want another app&#34;. Android users have been much more willing to give it a shot.As an android user myself, I much prefer having SMS built in because I use the search feature often to look back through all my SMS/Signal chats. I also regularly forward an SMS message to a Signal user, or vice versa. I&#39;m already starting to feel like those iOS users who told me &#34;I don&#39;t want another app&#34;...Signal seems to be trying to move further and further from &#34;my preferred way to chat with people&#34; and closer to the chat equivalent of &#34;that protonmail account I only log in to when I need secrecy&#34;.I obviously love having security on messages in transit, but I also like being able to keep my message history around and search my conversations for something that happened a year ago. It seems like Signal is on a trajectory to turn everything into disappearing messages. Are they the &#34;safe for activists&#34; communication app, or the &#34;let&#39;s try to make as many as possible safer by default&#34; app? Feels like they don&#39;t know.And on top of it all the messaging is just frustrating. &#34;we&#39;ve taken away an incredibly useful and heavily used feature so we have development resource to better implement shitcoins and such&#34; is such an irritating defense of the decision that I disabled my monthly donation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an awful decision. I&#39;ve converted some friends and family to Signal over the past years (it took a while) and it is now their default messaging app on their phones. This is going to confuse them and is going to make it difficult for me to keep convincing them that Signal is the route to use. (&#34;Why do I need 3 apps (Android Messages, Signal, Whatsapp) to talk to people?&#34;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m very upset by this decision. I&#39;ve been using Signal as my SMS app for a very long time.Messages that I would have sent via SMS currently will automatically get sent via Signal if the person I&#39;m sending to has started using Signal without my knowledge. This has happened in several instances where I was pleasantly surprised to see a friend had started using Signal. Now that I&#39;m forced into a separate SMS app, this will no longer be a possibility. I certainly won&#39;t be firing up Signal to see if a contact has joined before sending them an SMS."</p>

Enough said, it all adds up.  I still remember how Murdoch ran a successful campaign here in Australia to sink the planned national fibre to the home broadband network - 10 years down the track we never got our national fibre network.  These guys hate tech, especially free information services like Wikipedia and national broadcasters like the ABC Australian Broadcasting Corporation - Murdoch wants to own it all and hates free."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Eno&#39;s most celebrated musical experiments were not exclusively confined to ambient music. He was also involved in a project which asked the question: what would it sound like if you created an orchestra which used standard, established musical instruments, playing well-known classical standard themes, but one that was composed of a combination of both fully competent musicians and totally inexperienced and utterly incompetent first-timers? Eno&#39;s answer was that you would produce extraordinary musical experiences for the listener which amounted to a unique combination of choice and chance. For me and many others, his translated into some of the funniest musical experiences I have ever known. Please listen to The Portsmouth Sinfonia https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpJ6anurfuw"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I went to see him speak at a music festival in the summer. He spoke about one of his recent projects - the 10,000 year clock:
 https://www.solidsmack.com/design/what-jeff-bezos-and-brian-...
The idea is that modern living has been divided into smaller and smaller sub-divisions as processors get faster, media competes for attention and attention spans get shorter. The 10,000 clock was an artistic endeavour to engineer and design for a much broader time span - and every day the peal of bells is unique to that day only.
I found the way he thinks about extending the bounds of creativity in new ways quite inspiring."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was an undergrad in college, I helped design a study on the role of gender perception in expertise.We had a piece of text that the subjects (undergrads) would read and rate the expertise of. We had the same text but we randomized whether the name would be a commonly male name, a commonly female name, or initials.We also randomized if they&#39;d watch a clip of men&#39;s sports beforehand (men&#39;s basketball), women&#39;s sports beforehand (women&#39;s basketball), or no sports. And finally we randomized whether the person giving the subjects instructions would be a young woman (one of my classmates) or a young man (me).Our small study showed what you&#39;d expect- students- men and women students rated male writers more highly than female writers, and initials were right in the middle, though they tended to be more like responses for men.The tester&#39;s gender made no difference that we found.The sports thing made a measurable difference, but it didn&#39;t reverse the skew.My 18/19 year old self was somewhat skeptical we&#39;d find a difference, but I was totally wrong. It taught me a lot about bias and perception, which this study also shows."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a former researcher with multiple high-impact publications I can 100% confirm it:- when I was a researcher in Italy for an unknown lab, all of our articles were generally very scrutinized and went through years of reviews before publication- when I worked in Michal Graetzel[1]&#39;s laboratory things get published much more easily on more higher impact journals with less scrutiny. Not only most of the publications didn&#39;t really add much to the scientific knowledge, but they didn&#39;t even have the very high standards required when I was in ItalyWhy is this bad? You get more funding the more you publish...So labs that publish easier due to the names involved get much more money...which they can use to publish even more and get even more money...which they can use to publish even more...There&#39;s excellent scientists anywhere, really. But funding, fame and politics are extremely asymmetric in academia.[1]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Gr%C3%A4tzel"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Double-anonymous/blind reviewing is completely standard in most areas of computer science, e.g. networking (SIGCOMM, NSDI, IMC, HotNets, MobiCom, MobiSys), systems (OSDI, SOSP, USENIX ATC, HotOS), security (Usenix Security, S&amp;P), machine learning (NeurIPS and ICML), graphics and HCI (SIGGRAPH and CHI), and at least some top-tier theory conferences (like FOCS).So I think most computer scientists would agree with the article&#39;s conclusion that double-anonymous reviewing, while flawed, is better than the alternatives. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve done a non-anonymous submission in 10 years, and as a reviewer, usually I don&#39;t have a strong guess about who wrote the paper (and when I think I know, often I turn out to be wrong). It&#39;s a little annoying that this news article in Nature Magazine ignores the longstanding widespread prevalence of this practice in a conference-driven (but... we like to think important) academic discipline. :-)But:
(1) I don&#39;t think the big benefit of double-anonymous reviewing is that a lousy paper from a Nobel laureate (or, from CMU/Berkeley/MIT/Stanford) isn&#39;t let in unfairly. To me the big benefit seems to be that reviewers have to review every paper as if it might be from their friends or a famous person, and consequently have to review each paper with due care and try sincerely to understand its contribution, which maybe they wouldn&#39;t do if they knew it&#39;s from some random place/author they&#39;ve never heard of or don&#39;t think highly of. I think the way it affects judgment may be more in equalizing time/effort spent to read and understand a paper (and the generosity you give a paper because &#34;maybe&#34; it was written by your friend or somebody you respect), rather than a straight-up bias towards liking whatever the faculty at a famous university are writing about this year.(2) While I do think it&#39;s true, and a good thing, that double-anonymous reviewing helps &#34;marginalized groups of authors who often struggle to have their work see the world&#34; as the lead researcher says, we should probably acknowledge that authors are not the only beneficiaries of a scientific publication. The interests of the reader matter too -- the journal or conference has some duty to serve them. On the margin, maybe some readers would be more interested to learn what Albert Einstein is thinking about these days, or would like to see a well-balanced conference program that includes a good talk by a known-provocative speaker, instead of one more random (but adequate!) paper from a nobody. I&#39;m not saying we should give a huge weight to this -- it&#39;s fine to make people eat their vegetables, but, I don&#39;t think we should act like scientific publication is only to give authors a line on their CV and the readers&#39; preference is 100% irrelevant. A scientific journal shouldn&#39;t exclusively serve the authors. (Other kinds of media care way too much about what the reader wants, e.g. Facebook giving you whatever it thinks will keep you clicking things on Facebook, but there is probably a happy medium somewhere.)(3) The challenging frontier may be in grant submission and reviewing, where proposers are typically not anonymous to the reviewers, which surely leads to some biases. I have heard about government programs where they did use double-anonymous reviewing and it seemed weird to me. (Probably this is a situation where track record should matter, yet trying to summarize your own track record while remaining effectively anonymous seems really hard...)"</p>

Even though I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be tied up in appeals for awhile (and reduced on appeal), hopefully it&#39;ll prevent future harassment campaigns against families when tragedies occur.And before anyone says &#34;but why wasn&#39;t Jones given a trial to determine his guilt? The first amendment is under attack!&#34;, Infowars has repeatedly failed to prepare its employees for depositions, refused to respond to discovery requests, and has perjured itself numerous times. The default judgements received in both this and the Texas cases were well deserved, and anyone with a less explosive personality and media presence would have been given far fewer chances to comply."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a good verdict - defamation in the media is a very serious problem. It&#39;s unfortunate that it took a person like Alex Jones to convince people of it. If anything he should not be taken seriously. Those who are taken seriously have gotten away with much worse by merely apologizing or correcting themselves (as he did as well).As for the amount - the highest fine paid by Wall Street firms for the 2008 crisis was less than $100M. One of those numbers is unjust for sure."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks really promising. But by far the biggest moat that Jetbrains is going to have to cross to get into VSCode territory is the plugin ecosystem. Personally I work on React projects so my first thought was: &#34;is there a Prettier[1] plugin?&#34;. Looking through the landing page it looks like Plugins are in the works but until that is implemented, it&#39;s going to be hard adopting it.ALSO I just noticed this but can someone (ideally from JetBrains) explain what this line means: &#34;Requires login and periodic connection to JetBrains servers to verify the project&#34; (specifically the last 3 words of that sentence). Quite frankly this line is extremely alarming, are you saying that you&#39;re scanning my project to make sure it&#39;s not a &#34;professional&#34; project? I&#39;m going to assume this line means that they are checking the IDE and not your source but I won&#39;t be using this product until I get an explanation for this.

Thinking about it from a client-side perspective, I&#39;m guessing they mean the architecture is decoupled, meaning basically plugins/extensions but with a fancier word?Judging by the &#34;Features Matrix&#34; (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vTWt9RlJ...), sad to see not a single non C-like language is being considered."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Funnily enough when you look at the countries in the &#39;happiness index&#39; they all happen to be countries which fundamentally have pretty good underlying economies (and often they tend to be from european countries that have decent social support structure).Well-being is probably a third-order effect from a strong economy, good healthcare / social care, culture and a variety of other factors. But because it is a third-order it is very hard to measure the impact of policy, because:* They are &#39;arms length&#39; from policy changes.* The indexes are slow to respond to changes.* They are noisy and affected by unrelated factors (i.e. does a colder winter decrease happiness?)* A policy which improves well-being today could very well decrease well-being far into the future (e.g. increasing a countries spending and decreasing tax)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; So — suppose we give this sort of combined well-being survey to a random sample of people, and also measure what products and services they&#39;ve used and purchased. From this dataset, we could make reasonable statistical inferences about the amount of well-being increase or decrease associated with a certain product or service among a certain class of people.Unfortunately, no, you can&#39;t.  There are lots and lots of problems.  Just a few off the top of my head:1.  The effects of products are not uniform across the population.  Alcohol, for example, catalyzes well-being for some people, but for others it has a dramatic negative effect.2.  The effects of consumption on well-being change with the time horizon over which you measure them.  Eating ice cream might improve my subjective well-being today, but harm it tomorrow when it has a deleterious effect on my health.3.  Externalities.  Owning a private jet might improve my subjective well-being, but harm everyone else&#39;s with its noise and emissions.Measuring economic output is actually a not-entirely-unreasonable proxy for measuring well-being because in a free market people presumably make rational choices and spend their money in a way that maximizes their well-being.  The problem is not that the proxy is wrong, the problem is that people turn out not to be very good at making these choices.  It&#39;s not entirely their fault.  A big part of the problem is information asymmetry: producers know a lot more about the potential negative outcomes of their products than consumers do.I think a much better way to tackle this problem is with education and stronger consumer disclosure laws rather than trying to change the metric to something as poorly defined as &#34;well-being catalysis&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"And that is exactly what New Zealand started doing in 2019[0].A large problem with metrics is that they have a tendency of becoming a goal of their own. Instead of them being used as mere indicators, we end up with entire countries whose sole goal is to eternally increase their GDP - to the extent that it ends up harming the general population.People do not solely exist to generate revenue, and it is about time we stop pretending they do.[0]: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesellsmoor/2019/07/11/new-ze..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This study was in Chinese people who were overweight and were eating a lot of carbs (~300g a day). Presumably this was largely high GI rice. IF made a modest difference. They also lost some muscle mass, as expected. The study tested a lot of different variables, apparently without adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing.Hard to generalise these results. If you are eating a toxic diet, I guess more time without it is a good thing. A similar study in a Western population showed no effect of isocaloric IF [1]. In another study, IF with energy restriction in obese subjects was more effective than energy restriction without IF [2].I don’t see that the data supports IF as a universal strategy. If you are obese, then these studies suggest eating less, for less hours of the day and less at night is probably beneficial. Otherwise, as far as health interventions go, exercise has a much larger magnitude of benefit than dietary interventions. It also has the major advantage of simplicity - more exercise is better for everyone everywhere at every age [3]. Contrast this with the utterly confusing state of nutrition science. And exercise also makes a difference even when you do a little bit, whereas eating a little bit better does almost nothing.[1] https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullar...[2] https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/articl...[3] This is not 100% true. There are some contraindications to exercise for people with specific conditions.EDIT: When talking about the benefits of exercise versus diet, I mean the effects on health in general (mortality, lifespan, healthspan). Exercise isn&#39;t an effective method of weight loss as others have indicated."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Students break acceleration world record...for electric vehicles.This isn&#39;t close to the record for dragsters; if they can increase the energy density per unit mass there are traction and downforce improvements that can be used to improve this. It&#39;s very hard to beat chemical energy like detonating gasoline or nitromethane - you&#39;re looking at roughly a factor of 100, with ~40 MJ/kg for gasoline and 0.4 MJ/kg for a lithium ion battery - especially if you&#39;re racing through a 15 PSI gas that you can use in your chemical reaction without having to accelerate it onboard.I suspect that traction control for an electric motor may someday allow electric vehicles to exceed the records held by internal (well, mostly internal) combustion engines. You could keep the tire at exactly the right amount of slip for maximum acceleration, rather than trying to balance centrifugal clutches to get just the right amount of power at the right time.I wonder what the record is for a vehicle that can pick up electric energy from a tether/rail/overhead wire...though cables that can carry megawatts of energy are probably pretty heavy.Edit: I think the most interesting category here is the typical friction-propelled, human-carrying vehicle of either chemical or electric power sources. Railguns, rockets, fan cars (using active downforce), and vehicles which engage the ground by rack and pinion are qualitatively different. When the question is accelerating your own mass forwards using the friction developed by your own mass being pulled down by gravity, there&#39;s an interesting optimization problem trading off weight and power."</p>

It can only get better!I can recommend something beefier than a raspberry pi, though, or at least than than the pi 1-3 speeds that I&#39;m used to. I personally use an old laptop which is plenty fast for, well, anything you&#39;d also ask of a daily driver, except it now doesn&#39;t need to render a GUI which speeds things up a lot. They can peak up to 100W depending on the model, but are usually very low power when nothing is being asked of them.&gt; Oh, and I don’t want to have my home network hacked.Then install unattended-upgrades, put admin panels (phpmyadmin, wp-admin) behind basic authentication, don&#39;t host things you don&#39;t trust (random code written by &#39;someone on the internet&#39; that has never been tested by anyone), put it in a VLAN if you want to be extra cautious, and you&#39;ll be fine. It never hurts to keep your phone and other systems on the LAN up-to-date anyhow so they should be secure as well, even if someone does get in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hosted a phpbb board out of my room during high school. Our school board had just done the &#34;one laptop per kid&#34; thing, and the machines were all locked down and most of the fun sites were blocked, but not my site, because IT didn&#39;t know about it. So everyone went there to chat. We had an IRC server. People became friends that otherwise were in different cliques irl.One time we were supposed to be doing work during class, but everyone was on IRC chatting. The classroom was completely silent. Somebody wrote &#34;somebody say penis&#34; in the channel and the whole classroom started laughing at the same time, for seemingly no reason. The teacher was confused, it was a good time to be a 15 year old dorking around with computers."</p>

I agree that productive VR work is still not ready for prime time, but most of you haven&#39;t tried any of this (let alone the new hardware) and you&#39;re already dismissing even the possibility of it becoming good in the future. Reminds me of the Dropbox thread. You know which one.Also what I really don&#39;t understand is how anyone can have anything against them spending $$$ on R&amp;D? Worst case scenario: their whole productivity angle doesn&#39;t work out, they lose billions upon billions in the coming decade and eventually scrap the whole thing. Then they&#39;ve still invented a lot of super interesting tech along the way. High resolution displays, low latency rendering pipelines, novel human interface technologies, high fidelity hand tracking, lightweight and sharp lenses, the list goes on and on. There&#39;s lots of applications for each of those things and almost nobody else is willing to spend this much cash for such an uncertain roi.
I, for one, am super excited about what the future iterations of this will look like."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really can’t understand why there’s so much time and resources being put into re-inventing virtual meetings.This is supposed to capture subtle facial expressions. I’m sure every generation will capture more subtleties and have increasingly realistic avatars.  So why not just see real faces then?I always see mentions of virtual sticky notes on a whiteboard.  That sounds awful.  Do you need to squint to view them from your virtual seat at the table?  Do you need to walk your avatar to the board and avoid bumping into others who might be posting their own?  We don’t have those issues today with sites like Miro. If the metaverse will somehow avoid these annoyances then how would it be any different from the non-metaverse experience?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been a very early adopter of this tech (Kickstarter backer of Oculus), get zero motion sickness and have a great time working in VR through a virtual desktop. This looks like a few floating screens in front of my face, in a space station and I’m typing on a real Bluetooth keyboard. I think this is the only way companies will be able to keep remote-friendly polices and stay competitive with product. YMMV because I am biased to be for this, but, the way they’ve tuned this Pro model looks like it’s exactly for my use-case."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This sounds like if you spliced together tape of Rogan and Jobs with scotch tape. An interesting concept but I never felt like I was listening to a conversation between two people. Jobs sounds weirdly far away, he also was never a &#34;fast talker&#34;. Listen to his interview at MIT where he takes questions. He always stopped for long pauses, stares off into space for a minute. He didn&#39;t rush into responses and tended to nail timing really well.Rogan sounds more believable but I suspect you&#39;d get the same results sitting down at Audacity and cutting together an MP3. You just have better quality samples of him talking to people in a podcast setting.It&#39;s an interesting demo but I&#39;m not sure why I would want this to exist. It seems like technology which you could only abuse, either through the generation of podcast spam or through the production of fake audio. Podcasts are legion and are already cheap to make and based on open standards."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is mindblowing. Like this could be real, and I&#39;m learning stuff from it: There&#39;s an Indian epic that&#39;s 10 times as long as ...There&#39;s some audio distortion (sounds like clips cut together, little &#34;notches&#34; in the soundscape) but apart from that, and some weirdness in sensing &#34;the spatial location&#34; where this audio was recorded...the concepts and the dialog are amazing.Some parts are weird...but people can be weird. It you tidied this up, and added the right sounds affects and audio processing to this, without the cue that this is AI generated...holy fuck, I think people would believe it. Particularly if you cut it together as a &#34;highlights reel&#34;. Jobs does sound a bit off tho, a bit thin...there should be enough data on him to do a sparse reconstruction of his voice to a level of accuracy beyond human discernment tho.The thing this got wrong about Job&#39;s voice cadence, tho is: Jobs speaks a lot more slowly and deliberately, and with a lot more pauses, than here. I suspect the cadence / timing is not so emphatically modelled by this AI.I think also they&#39;re missing some emotional trajectory coherence in both their voices. Like the emotional register of the voice does not sound or transition as naturally, and is less diverse.Incredible PoC. AI folks are the new dark wizards. WTF can they not do? That list is shorter"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi everyone, cofounder of play.ht (the startup behind this podcast) here. let me know if you have any questions.To give more context, the podcast was totally AI generated, the content itself was generated from a finetuned GPT3 on SteveJobs&#39; biography, the voices were cloned from few hours of both Joe and Steve voices, even though it was tough to get good content for Steve Jobs. And the podcast artwork was generated by SD.We will be releasing more episodes soon which will be even more mind-blowing!"</p>

The subreddit is currently an unmoderated mess, illustrating they have no clue how to run the community.I am unsurprised at Discord&#39;s behavior, handing over a server like that. They have essentially been hostile when not silent to us at WSB with our 600K user server.Reddit has an opportunity to do better here.

Discord owns it and can pull the rug out from under you at any time, regardless of how much hard work you put into building a community, and that hurts.I understand that &#34;server&#34; is an abstract term and just means &#34;something which provides a service&#34;, but most other uses of the word relate to something owned by the person operating it. E.g., if I run a Matrix server instance, it&#39;s mine to administer, manage, destroy, etc. If I start a Discord &#34;server&#34; it&#39;s a glorified chat room or set of chat rooms owned and maintained by the company.Language is powerful and helps shape our world, and by redefining &#34;server&#34; to mean a segmented part of someone else&#39;s website, it&#39;s another nail in the coffin for the concept of real ownership."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to put away a liter of vodka a night. I kept it up for years, accumulating a solid decade of heavy drinking. I was miserable. It was souring my relationship. The stress from work, personal life, and declining mental state of course made me feel even more compelled to drink. I was becoming a shell of my former self, and my dreams were becoming strictly that.I had a confluence of events that changed my course:1. I attended a tech conference where someone I personally knew who had went through rehab was hosting and speaking, and he was filled with a vivacity I hadn’t seen from him before.2. My spouse gave me an ultimatum to quit or he’d be out the door. It wasn’t the first time he had said this, but I had a feeling it was probably going to be the last.3. My progression in life was stalling. I couldn’t keep up commitments anymore, and I was starting to feel like I had already passed my peak.So I quit. Cold Turkey. It was a dangerous, stupid thing to do, but I knew if I tried to taper off, I’d just slide back. The withdrawals were nightmarish, and I was lucky I didn’t die from it. But I pulled through, and then started to do some heavy soul searching for why I ever picked up the bottle — what was I escaping from? And I found those answers, and got to work — A real kind of personal work that most people will never have to put into themselves.Since then, I have been a cofounder, jumped multiple levels in my career, and have been working towards several academic publications, on top of drastically improving my personal life. It’s been nearly five years since I put down the bottle. And every day I choose to never pick it up again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I haven&#39;t had a drink in 27 days, which is the longest I&#39;ve gone in a while. Left to my own devices, I tend to settle into a pattern of 2-4 drinks per night, 5-6 nights a week (I actually tracked this for a while with a spreadsheet).It&#39;s not like, ruin my life, wake up in a gutter type situation, but it leads to just feeling somewhat crappy all the time, and I didn&#39;t like it, so I wanted to stop.Some things that helped / are helping:I have an app Habit Tracker. It&#39;s a pretty simple app with a list of habits you want do do, you can set on some schedule. When you do them, you tick them off and it keeps track of how many times, so you build up a streak. I made a &#34;don&#39;t drink&#34; habit, and check it off in the morning if I didn&#39;t drink the day before. It also shows a notification bubble on the app if you don&#39;t check it off and I hate that. It&#39;s like this little negative reinforcement that I have to live with that bubble all day if I drank the day before. It&#39;s silly, but it helped.Reading the book This Naked Mind and listening to The Huberman Lab podcast episode about alcohol (#86) also helped. Alcohol messes up your body in a lot of ways, even at what&#39;s considered &#34;moderate&#34; or &#34;normal&#34; levels of drinking./r/stopdrinking on RedditAlcohol is an addictive drug and when you stop after using it regularly, you&#39;re going to feel cravings. It&#39;s not a moral failing, it&#39;s physiology. They do get less intense and less frequent after the first two weeks or so."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was drinking heavily and knew that it would be the quickest and most effective hack towards being a better father and husband. I first stepped into an AA meeting and as the opportunity to speak was going around the room I started seeing many similarities between the people sharing their stories and myself. I thought to myself &#39;If I were perhaps an alcoholic, what could I share about it and how it may hurt me and those that love me?&#39; When the opportunity for me to share came up, I said &#39;screw it!&#39; to myself and spilled the beans. &#34;I am an alcoholic...&#34;The meetings made me feel good at first as I kept telling myself that my stories could potentially help someone else. I did not end up sticking with the AA program but the meetings really launched me into the right direction and finding my own path. I do drink NA beer and as many others in the comments have pointed out, there is a lot offered in that arena as of lately.I am a very social person and navigating that lifestyle for the first time without alcoholic beverages was the biggest challenge for me. But I learned to like the challenge and found that sparked a lot of conversations with friends that were interested in quitting or dialing it back. It also identified and strengthened a lot of friendships where people normally wouldn&#39;t drink while doing whatever it was we are doing, but they did because I was &#39;the drinker.&#39;Next week marks my first year of sobriety, so I am certainly no expert, but feel free to reach out if you ever need to hash some things out."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I work at a different FAANG and it seems like more and more the only news that we get from corporate is related to DEI. Also a lot of hiring details are now hidden from ICs. It used to be that you would be apart of the interview panel as an interviewer and then you would get together with your team afterwards and everyone on the team would vote yes/no and that would pretty much be it. Now it’s made by a manager elsewhere and you have no idea why the decision was made.I do worry that my kids won’t be diverse enough to be able to get into a decent school or get a good job like I was able to when they’re older.We used to argue for equality, a level playing field, for all. Now we’ve had the rug swapped from underneath us.It’s no longer about equality of opportunity, it’s about equality of outcome. To quote Kamala Harris’ recent remarks “to make sure everyone ends up in the same place”, i.e. “equity”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I shut my mouth at work and go along with this stuff because I have no choice. I have a family to take care of. I&#39;ve accepted this. But man, why do they always throw in the line about striving to make the workplace a &#34;diverse and inclusive culture where everyone can bring their full and authentic self&#34;? Everyone knows that&#39;s a goddamn lie. I almost want to cry when I read that - it makes me so angry. I haven&#39;t been anything like myself in the workplace for over a decade now and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll never be again. I live a lie when I&#39;m here and so do many, many others."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; You might imagine this policy doesn’t bias the hiring process, since managers are still free to choose who to hire after interviewing the diverse candidates. But because of the number of applicants, most are rejected based on their resumes. Imagine diversity candidates are 1% of the applicants but 15% of those interviewed. This gives those candidates opportunities to do well in interviews that their peers with similar resumes do not get.So minority candidates are given an advantage in getting their foot in the door, but still have to prove themselves qualified for the job by doing well in interviews.On average, those candidates would have started with a disadvantage in getting their foot in the door for several reasons – including outright discrimination, and the cumulative effect of past discrimination, but also softer factors such as being less likely to have helpful personal connections.  This applies not just to the Microsoft job at issue, but to the previous jobs that would have populated their resumes (and for younger candidates, even schools).Compensating for that sounds like a good policy to me.Now, the post also suggests there is pressure to actually hire or promote less-qualified candidates, which might be a problem, but in that area the post is more vague and speculative."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related personal anecdote:I am experimenting with Tinder subscription at the moment, and it feels incredibly exploitative. When you make a profile, matches are frequent and you can tell that you show up for people. However it gradually falls down with time, and the only predictable and obvious way to get back up is to pay for Boosts and/or Priority Likes.Right now my 6-month old profile gets ZERO likes outside of the time it&#39;s Boosted ($3 a pop or something). I get plenty once I&#39;m boosted, so the profile attractiveness doesn&#39;t seem to be a factor.It feels like the app&#39;s algorithms are rigged to gradually push you towards paid subscription options. There must be a huge invisible market of Tinder whales given how exploitative it is, gambling addiction, loneliness, and desperation for dates are correlated traits and I would absolutely bet on Tinder exploiting this heavily."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem really happens when you do algorithmic price setting, which incentivizes you as the developer to get people addicted to the experience of swiping, regardless of whether or not the swiping has the desired outcome for the end user. A user base with just the right levels of dopamine from interactions and loneliness will probably end up buying one of the weekly promotional deals.That&#39;s why when you first start on any dating service, you&#39;re (typically) inundated with activity, so that you can always chase that high, and when you can&#39;t get it, you try to pay for it.Online dating is a tough problem to solve, tougher still when profit incentives misalign with user success incentives! I&#39;m not even sure what an equitable but also successful dating service would look like, because there&#39;s this fundamental mismatch in values."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This blog post has some good discussion about what makes a good locking primitive. On macOS, os_unfair_lock is generally a good choice for many applications. That said,&gt; At this point, you might wonder if os_unfair_lock – possibly coupled with the undocumented flags – would be a good fit for your codebase. My answer is likely yes but you’ll have to be careful when using it.I would hesitate to give this advice. The overwhelming majority of applications on macOS do not have performance profiles like Firefox does. The system allocator (rather than jemalloc) is the right choice for all but very few use cases. There are a vanishingly small number of usecases where using the undocumented flags is appropriate.The rules are different when you’re a popular browser with an existing relationship with Apple and dozens of smart engineers who can (at least in theory) understand the consequences of using this API, and leverage an existing relationship with Apple to ensure that it doesn’t become a liability in the future as the platform evolves.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve used Helix for all my recreational programming projects (in Rust) for about 6 months and I&#39;ve written about 10kLOC of code with it. Still using vim at $WORK for a variety of reasons (giant c++ codebase that does not easily plug in to clangd/LSP), but I might be doing the switch soon.Installation was easy and the default configuration is good. Plugging in rust-analyzer still needed a line or two of config file editing, but that should not be necessary for very long. Hint: use `hx --health` to check that all the tools are properly installed and configured (it shows a matrix of programming languages and their associated tooling, with red/green check marks).My Helix config file is about 5 lines long, but my Vim config is in the hundreds of lines.I had very little friction coming from Vim and a little bit of Kakoune.I particularly like the fact that all the important features are built-in and not half baked scripts with unintended side effects (e.g. opening a Makefile in Vim triggers a ftplugin script that messes editor-global config instead of buffer-local, with the default out of the box scripts).Lots of people are requesting a plugin extension system, which is kinda understandable since every editor seems to have one. But I haven&#39;t had a need to add any kind of plugin, and it&#39;s easy enough to fork a shell for an external process if needed.It&#39;s still rough around the edges, but good enough for a daily driver.Thanks to everyone working on the project."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I fully expect Helix to replace Vim, Neovim, and Kakoune for most users in the long run.Helix is built from the ground up around Tree-Sitter and LSP. This means you get the best syntax highlighting available, and IDE-like functionality, with zero configuration required other than installing the appropriate language server.Those are by far the most important features for a text editor to have, and crucially, they are fully integrated into Helix, but are an afterthought in (Neo)vim and Kakoune. The quality difference is obvious the moment you try it side by side. Nothing else really matters. Vim&#39;s and Kakoune&#39;s syntax highlighting is terrible, and while Neovim can now use Tree-Sitter as well, there always seem to be some additional hoops the user needs to jump through in order to get it to work. Not so with Helix.Regrettably, Helix has inherited Vim&#39;s worst design flaw, namely being unusable with non-English keyboard layouts, but all other Vim derivatives share this flaw as well so I don&#39;t see that stopping Helix from steamrolling the competition once it matures and the word spreads."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been trying out Helix for the last few months as part of my now 24 year quest to incorporate some form of vi into my daily routine. This time, it&#39;s looking good. What sets it apart are the (zero-conf) built-in LSP and tree-sitter highlighting, and the select-verb modal keybindings instead of vi&#39;s verb-object syntax, where you see what you&#39;re about to do before you do it. Some of the key combinations also show a reminder menu, aiding the learning process, which is a nice touch over plain old vi which has zero discoverability. General performance is also very good, the editor feels a lot snappier than a fully loaded Neovim or Doom Emacs, or a monster like Visual Code.I think there are plans to see if a graphical editor could be built on top of it, which would be an interesting project. As a new Rust graphical tree-sitter based editor, it would probably rival the upcoming open-or-not Zed editor by the Atom folks."</p>

They&#39;ve attracted hundreds of contributors and have instilled a unique sense of culture within their community (as an example, going as far to devote an entire GitHub repository to documenting a list of &#34;yak-shaving&#34; yak emojis[1]).I think that kind of social endeavor isn&#39;t something a lot of maintainers can accomplish, not even those with the skills to work on such a project all by themselves.[1] https://github.com/SerenityOS/yaksplained"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Andreas and his project SerenityOS was a huge inspiration for me to start my side project daedalOS (https://github.com/DustinBrett/daedalOS) which I&#39;ve almost been doing for 2 years now. I really enjoy watching his monthly updates on his channel."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if, at some point, some commercial project adopts a part of Serenity and turns it into a huge hit, even outside of tech.Such things have definitely happened in the past.. Not many (average) people have heard of KDE or its web engine, KHTML, but almost everybody these days uses Chrome, which, through Apple&#39;s WebKit, is descended from KHTML itself.Serenity uses its own libraries everywhere, to the point of replacing C++&#39;s std with their own library, AK, which might make stripping it for parts more difficult, but it&#39;s certainly not unimaginable.If Serenity&#39;s web engine gets good enough, I can even imagine some EU government sponsoring an independent competitor to the Google / Apple browser duopoly."</p>

Did MS &#34;intentionally&#34; &#34;left behind&#34; certain APIs and system calls to sacrifice it for some greater good? Like I use Windows every day and have no problems at all. And I use Linux every day too for work.

It&#39;s called Facebook, and the reason why other social networks like Instagram and Twitter exist _at all_ is because Facebook could not keep everyone on their network.Lest we forget, Facebook was the ONLY social network people used for a good long while, at least when I was graduating HS and entering college. You had Facebook for actual social networking, band/music pages on MySpace, and everything else was essentially porn bots and pedophiles, aka &#34;spam city&#34;. So you have to wonder, if an everything app actually is a good idea, why couldn&#39;t the one company who had the most opportunity at the perfect time with as much funding as they could possibly need...not be able to do it?Just because something works in China, doesn&#39;t mean it will work everywhere else. Actually, I would say that if something works in China, your best bet is that it _won&#39;t_ work anywhere else. TikTok being a notable exception."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The web is an everything app, and despite capture by incumbents it is still the most open platform we have and it is not illiberal. The reason for that is open standards that are not owned by anyone. We need open identity standards and open payment standards so we can have an everything web that is liberal. But governments have to allow those things to happen. Right now their legislation favors the incumbent monopolies"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish I could go back in time and just curb crypto from growing into the current tumor it has become. Decentralization efforts applied to app servers and services would have been such a better use of time and energy imo.If there was a protocol for cab hailing, and anyone could roll it out for someone to connect to their network (like xmpp), and anyone could offer to become a driver or play another role like customer support, they earn their local currency and are a part of their local economy. The same protocol could be used in Norway and in Taiwan. There might be a gap that’s too hard to fill, and someone else could create another protocol that works in their local economy, maybe like a matrix protocol. They’re completely different but serve to solve the same problem of real time communication.Then Elon’s super app could offer users a platform which tries to implement multiple protocols, or have a in app protocol marketplace which is the sub apps. Apps for buying shoes, or buying groceries, or hiring movers. Users could become consumers or agents, so they can both work for various protocols and spend their money on them. They would be vetted and backed by the super app.It would be fully decentralized, except for the payment part. If you have everyone on your platform you don’t need to issue tokens and other bullshit. Just build something useful and they will come."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Is &#34;cheapest&#34; the right objective? Because if that&#39;s the case, book piracy seems like the clear winner.But maybe we should consider &#34;cheapest with some boundaries&#34;. For instance, we probably agree that bookstores are nice for a myriad of reasons, even if we don&#39;t frequent them. They employ people in the area, they offer curation and recommendations, they invite speakers and host events, and they help local authors get started. They may offer benefits or profit sharing.But a physical space like that costs money. Experience costs money. Curation costs money (indirectly).I&#39;d argue that cheapest as a metric undercuts best as a metric. Cheap is one important input to the purchasing decision, but it shouldn&#39;t be the only one.We have to learn to accept some inefficiencies and some personal inconveniences for the sake of a healthier social ecosystem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s always nice to hear about someone writing a cool program just because they felt like doing so.  Every time I think about writing a forum server, I find I return to the thought that Usenet was better, and that if I wanted a web forum, I&#39;d consider putting a web front end on an NNTP server.  That would among other things let people keep using NNTP clients (I like gnus.el) if they don&#39;t want to use a browser.  There are a bunch of NNTP web clients already, but afaict they all needlessly suck.You might take a look at Fossil (fossil-scm.org) which is not a forum, but is an all-in-one source control system, bug tracker, wiki, and web backend, all implemented as an SQLite client written in C.  Its blurb says a scripting language might sound more attractive than C superficially, but in Fossil, SQLite does all the heavy lifting that would otherwise have been done with scripts.  On my bottomless todo list I want to study its implementation sometime, since I think it would be a good example of &#34;advanced&#34; uses of SQL and SQLite.  That is completely independent of Fossil&#39;s purpose as a VCS application.  I&#39;m ok at basic SQL but not so clueful about sophisticated uses.One thing to watch out for is that since SQLite is an embedded DB, when you make an SQlite query, the overhead is basically a local subroutine call rather than the network traffic that a client/server DB would incur.  That in a way changes the asymptotics of an application: particularly, the &#34;N+1 queries&#34; antipattern of some client/server DB apps is a perfectly ok design strategy for SQLite.  I believe Fossil may rely on this in some way."</p>

The piece is based on the fact that this frequency is not stable, it fluctuates subtly around 50 Hz as a direct result of supply and demand in the power market.The composition consists of a self-resonating piano that is tuned to resonate on 50 hz and overtones of 50 hz (100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz etc.) The piano is fitted with vibration-elements – transducers – plugged directly into the electrical grid, causing the resonance and timbre of the piano to change with the fluctuations on the power market.The piano is accompanied by a string octet. The musicians are equipped with voltmeters that measure the frequency of the current in real time, as well as a score of instructions on how to respond to changes in this frequency.https://vimeo.com/370554138"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The one part of this article that I totally agree with is how terrible the API integration has become. In the early days, Stripe sold itself on a few things, one of which was the simplicity of integration. Since the whole PaymentIntents and SetupIntents introduction (along with the documentation fiasco that happened at the same time), integrating with Stripe is something like PayPal from 10 years ago. Its shit.PaymentIntents workflow (including the necessity to listen for webhooks) deserves a special place in hell. Its like they decided to copy Paypal IPN.I have used, recommended and intgrated Stripe to multiple businesses over the years (generating hundreds of US$ millions). For the past 2 years or so, I have migrated most of them away from Stripe, and any new integrations are done through other payment processors."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is extremely confusing and filled with do many errors it&#39;s hard to even list them all. However, the bit I wanted to focus on was the author&#39;s claim that PayPal got &#34;sued&#34; and &#34;stopped taking money from people&#34;. Getting sued is part of the ordinary course of business for a company like PayPal, and ~85% of lawsuits like that go nowhere, and result in no internal changes. The specific lawsuit the author seems to have been talking about was dismissed entirely by a judge in July, because the contact you sign with Facebook when you use their account explicitly forbids you from suing them instead of going through private arbitration proceedings: https://www.pokertube.com/article/chris-moneymaker-s-class-a... (Chris Moneymaker&#39;s Class Action Lawsuit Against PayPal Falls At First Hurdle).And again, this is the kind of thing that happens to PayPal all the time. The fact that some random lawsuit that never even required a substantial reply from PayPal got picked up by Zed as evidence of their bad behavior &#34;finally catching up to them&#34; really erodes my confidence in the way he represents any of the other details in this article. What else is he misrepresenting or exaggerating?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"May I suggest a purely rational, evidence based take?The trap is your belief in a linear relationship between effort and
outcome. Working harder and longer produces more productivity, right?That&#39;s false.As you say so yourself, your memory goes to shit. It&#39;s not just a law
of diminishing returns. For coders, past a certain point, exhaustion
leads you to start undoing your work. You are into negative
productivity.I&#39;ve pushed through all-nighters where I poured out a few thousand LOC
only to find the next day that I had broken everything and introduced
more bugs than I had time to fix. I just had to revert. An exhausted
hacker is worse than no hacker at all. You&#39;re a liability to yourself
and the project.So, like driving when tired, realise that the urge to continue is
completely irrational, and probably based in the emotional drives of
fear or pride. It would be completely irrational for any manager to
want you to code in that state, and anyone who pushes you to is also
the idiot."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; small hurdles spike my anxiety, my anger flares at the slightest confrontation, I notice fewer jokes, fewer attempts on my part to make people laugh. My memory goes to all hell too and I can’t seem to concentrate on prolonged amounts of anything. Books fall off my radar, I stop listening to music. My phone is in my hand at all times, scrolly-anxiety-inducing apps become impossible to avoid.This describes me perfectly. Unfortunately I can’t take a break because it’s entirely due to being the parent of young children."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On top of taking regular breaks, I think we should also work slower. Burnout is a scary place to be in. While the news calls it “quiet quitting”, I think many people are simply burnt out from the last few years of world conditions and add on the rubber band effect of everything going back to “normal”. It’s just too much change in a short amount of time.I wrote a book about this topic when I was in a state of burnout. I had enough of the many different aspects of the world (overwork, the news, social media, etc) that I believe led to stress based illness.I don’t feel bad for taking time off anymore. You got to put yourself first sometimes to be able to show up for others."</p>

There is nothing in the EU law that requires a banner, only informed consent.So if I have DNT=1 set in my browser, pop a quick non modal notification saying &#34;we wants to track you but but we won&#39;t because you said not to. Click here if you want to change that&#34;. Solved.I&#39;m informed. I made my choice.But that&#39;s not what it&#39;s about.Because the vast majority of people would not consent. Who are you kidding? This tracking is not benefiting us. It&#39;s like when politician says it&#39;s &#34;for the children&#34; or &#34;to fight terrorists&#34;. Everybody knows there are full of it.So the banner is just the most annoying way that is legally allowed to try to get people to force-accept tracking. In fact, some banner are crafted to make rejection the hardest path for this very reason.Those corps chose to make the web terrible a little bit more every day: tracking, auto play, scroll hijacking, dark patters, cookie banners...We should thank the UE a 1000 times to reveal who are the bad players."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Firefox also plans to have builtin support for auto-rejecting cookies when there is a consent banner. See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1783015. From my understanding, this should be similar to Consent-O-Matic. It will be available on both desktop and mobile versions. This is enabled recently by default in Nightly (but I don&#39;t use Nightly)."</p>

The experience is not only the pixels on the screen and the sounds of the speaker, but the whole spatial relationship with the physical object.It probably doesn&#39;t need to be an almost perfect replica like the 64 Maxi, but having the keys in the same places (even if there is no ESC key - looking at you, DEC LK-201). On my desk, my two daily drivers are a Sun Type 7c (Type 7 is in storage, waiting for its rotation) and an IBM/Lexmark/Unicomp PC-122 Model M, and I can say each of them provides a unique experience, tactile, spatial, and, on the Model M&#39;s case, auditory.I&#39;m thinking about learning how to build keyboards and make a couple DIY ones.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This point is so good and so important:&#34;Getting lost in your knowledge management system is a fantastic way to avoid creating things. Or calling that friend you’re estranged from. Or doing anything else even mildly threatening. It’s also a fantastic way to convince yourself that unpreparedness is what’s between you and creative work. If you believe you’re unprepared, know that you will never transmute into the perfectly prepared person that you think exists in the future.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think we conflate two types of note-taking:  1. List-style notes of things we need to remember

  2. School-style notes of information and ideas

I think the former requires a tool, but nothing particularly sophisticated - Apple Notes for example with its search indexing is fineI think the latter we write only to stimulate our brain to process information and learn better.I think there is a discrepancy where a lot of tools attempt to make Type 2 notes more &#34;convenient&#34;, i.e. to trying to somehow make them an extension of our brain, but the truth is that it&#39;s like hacking a hard drive to work as fast as a CPU register -- retrieving and working with information is always going to be orders of magnitude slower than working through your thoughts in your brain."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Any article that pretends to know what the right way of taking notes (say, &#34;This is known as a commonplace book, and it is about how detailed your note-taking system should be unless you plan on thinking more elaborately than Leonardo da Vinci.&#34; in this article) is missing the point.People think differently, people have different purposes and goals, people have different constraints on their time, their memory, their field. Can you procrastinate on note-taking? Sure. So can you on writing, and publishing, and building an audience, and writing papers, and doing the dishes.Can people have a fantastic creative output by just opening a blank page and jotting down their thoughts? Sure. Can other people write great books with an elaborate notetaking system? Of course. There are plenty of people out there with terrific, obsessive note-taking and reference systems, Kubrick being one of the prime examples.As someone with what looks from the outside to be an overarchitected note-taking system ( https://publish.obsidian.md/manuel ), it is a system that works great for me, and it is a system that makes me more creative and helps me discover ideas I would have never been able to articulate without. I used linear sketchbooks where I would write and draw whatever for years, filling hundreds of notebooks, and it came nowhere near my obsidian setup in terms of output and effectiveness."</p>

In short, this uses ptrace, which is the same Linux kernel mechanism used by debuggers, to attach to a running process and manipulate the open file descriptors (amongst other things) while it runs. So basically it attaches to the process, and changes stdin (fd 0) and stdout (fd 1) to point to your tmux session stdout and stdin.Pretty cool use of ptrace."</p>

Not a knock on it - just curious if I&#39;m missing something.My problem with these types of plugins is that, although it&#39;s a bit more annoying to type out a few more characters, with my vanilla Vim workflow I can pre-compute the motions in my head - I can figure out I need to type d7l or whatever way before I get to the point in my editing where I need to, and as I&#39;m typing it out I&#39;m already thinking about what I want to do next. With sneak, easymotion, or leap, it looks like I can&#39;t actually figure out what keys I need to press to get to where I want until I&#39;ve already started the motion. That means I need to take some time to read the label, etc. So maybe I&#39;ve saved a few milliseconds of not having to type one or two more keys, but I lose that and more by having to parse what to do.Curious about other experiences and if I&#39;m off base though.[1]: https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I didn&#39;t expect to learn much from this article - but it actually really resonated with me. I often am responsible for purchasing decisions and found much of the advice to sales reps really insightful.(1) The number one thing that bothers me is when I reach out to a company to explore their product and I get scheduled with a BDR who&#39;s sole job is to &#34;qualify&#34; me as a lead. I know BDRs are in a tough spot - but if you have someone reaching out and interested in your product, take advantage of that and get them straight to the person who can demo and answer questions. I&#39;m shocked at how many companies make me want to prove myself as a customer before spending time on demoing.(2) Ask before recording meetings, and if someone doesn&#39;t want to be recorded make sure you actually have the ability to turn that recording off. I&#39;ve been on calls where the person who set up the Zoom/Gong wasn&#39;t on the call, and so no one had the ability to stop recording.(3) The details of what is shared on calls is often completely lost. Every time a new person gets on the call, they ask the exact same questions that have already been answered. Make the customer feel as though you&#39;re interested in their business, have discussed their pain points, and have a plan ready to help them.(4) Discounting discussions are always a pain. It&#39;s a game that no one likes to play.(5) Offer to send some swag to the implementing team at your customer - not just your champion. It&#39;s a nice gesture and goes a surprisingly long way towards building positive sentiment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just thought the call out for &#34;Protected Health Information&#34; was weird, and it&#39;s wrong. If you&#39;re just having small talk with someone on a zoom call and you say &#34;Yeah, that last COVID booster really wiped me out, I was in bed for 2 days&#34;, that doesn&#39;t mean the call contains &#34;PHI&#34;.First of all, you shared it. The whole reason for protecting PHI in the first place is limiting what others can do with your information, not what you can do with it. And if you share it willingly, and not for medical purposes, it doesn&#39;t mean that the person you shared it with suddenly has a higher burden of security/privacy with that info.Just calling this out because so often see people that fundamentally misunderstand what &#34;PHI&#34; means in a legal sense, and specifically what the HIPAA regulations require."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who was accidentially thrust into an IT role and had to do some purchasing... I absolutely hated sales cales and B2B selling. The simple act of buying a server means finding an &#34;authorized reseller&#34;, going through some sales calls, proving that you are a worthy customer, then they want to know all about your other setup to make sure it is &#34;supported&#34; (which turns out to have no consequence whatsoever). The quoted price is completely different from what is listed, and there are arbitrary surcharges. Isn&#39;t there an easier way? Yes, but the pointy haired boss decided we have to go the proper route. Funnily the reseller had a very trustworthy name like &#34;usedserverdiscount24.de&#34; or something.The worst one was when I was trying to get some antivirus licenses. We were willing to spend a lot on Sophos, because it had good reviews, we were happy with the trial, and so on. But the reseller tried to upsell us, insisted we buy matching firewalls, and so on. So in the end we stuck with Windows Defender (we got a bunch of licenses for Advanced Threat Protection from MS for free)."</p>

I want to use it in common contexts with as little code as possible. Heck, at least provide me with a kitchen sink so I can copy and paste common patterns."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fwiw I had something akin to the overview effect when I attended a full solar eclipse. I thought I was prepared. I had read up on what to expect because I wanted to make the most of the experience for the kids. I wanted to make sure we observed the &#34;shadow bands&#34; (snake like shadows traversing across single colored surfaces that aren&#39;t always visible).Everything did proceed as I expected (including the shadow bands), but when the eclipse was full, the earth went quiet. All the animals stopped and wondered (including the younger children who were boisterously playing seconds before the full effect).As I stared up into the heavens, I had this deeply profound realization that our planet is traveling through space like all the other planets. The observation and experience of an eclipse made the abstract concept of space a reality and brought it closer to me in a way that just thinking (a lot) about space has never done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It was among the strongest feelings of grief I have ever encountered. The contrast between the vicious coldness of space and the warm nurturing of Earth below filled me with overwhelming sadness. Every day, we are confronted with the knowledge of further destruction of Earth at our hands: the extinction of animal species, of flora and fauna . . . things that took five billion years to evolve, and suddenly we will never see them again because of the interference of mankind. It filled me with dread. My trip to space was supposed to be a celebration; instead, it felt like a funeral.Very well written. Conveys his feelings quite well I find."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unfortunately sending every millionaire into space for them to realize this is an hostile environment is taking us closer to earth destruction. Sorry to be sour about this, but people could just teach themself astronomy and realize there is no place out there to welcome us when the earth will be on the verge to become unlivable. Even assuming a colony of a dozen women/men is ever established on the moon or Mars, they will die in a matter or months or years once the tether to earth is broken.Reading this guy paid millions of $ to realize these basic facts fills me with overwhelming sadness too. Can his experience be of value for us? Given that he could have discovered what he just experienced by reading good books, I think this n+1 experience has zero value. Send human beings in space to perform scientific experiments. Period."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While I agree this is a problem - one which I have been the victim of as well - Amazon accepts the return with no questions and/or charges. This, of course, is not a great consolidation, especially for a novice who doesn&#39;t understand or encounters it too late. But I strongly disagree with &#34;Amazon runs little to no risk selling the fraudulent products, but still makes money off of them.&#34; In the next paragraph the author outlines how they&#39;ve lost trust in Amazon and will not be buying electronics. Erosion of trust is absolutely a massive risk, and one that eBay is also arguably pretty publicly recovering from. I suspect Amazon would prefer not to have fake drives and the costs associated with returns and erosion of trust for the infinitesimal rounding error that makes up the extra revenue they get from fake $20 thumb drives.
I&#39;m far from an Amazon fanboy, but I think the problem is more complex than Amazon turning a blind eye because they&#39;re making $10k extra profit a year from phony thumb drives. As an outsider, it seems like a difficult tradeoff of not creating incredible hurdles to list products, versus counterfeits getting through.In my case, the phony thumb drive I bought was delisted before I got home from the walk to the mailbox, literally."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think there&#39;s one thing that should be clarified from the article. &#34;Sponsored&#34; does not mean that the product is &#34;sponsored by Amazon&#34; as italicized in the article. It means the seller paid money to be at the top of the search query.Perhaps it is a healthy dose of old aged jadedness, but I have a habit of trying to avoid Sponsored items."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have refused to give Amazon any business of my own for several years because their directly-operated logistics business is morally disgusting to me. Realistically they run many businesses, that’s one of them. Their retail business is little more than branding. Their real business is private infrastructure.The retail business overall is a scam. Example: I’ve been trying to find a comforter for a while, and I haven’t been happy with some of the options I found because a lot of other ecommerce sites have not great search experiences. I thought, well I can search Amazon for my preferences and buy it elsewhere. Nope, not even a single filter I applied was true for any search results I looked at. Amazon didn’t even try to serve me cotton comforters, much less any other refinements they offered.They’re in the business of selling business. Whether that’s their logistics connecting suppliers and shipping with sales, or it’s their tech services connecting startups with time shares on a server.I wouldn’t buy a USB drive or a blanket from IBM either. It’s the same thing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is so much more to our report than what was focused on in the WSJ article. The full report will be shared shortly…"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “Outside his online play, Hans is the fastest rising top player in Classical [over-the-board] chess in modern history,” the report says, while comparing his progress to the game’s brightest rising stars. “Looking purely at rating, Hans should be classified as a member of this group of top young players. While we don’t doubt that Hans is a talented player, we note that his results are statistically extraordinary.”I basically made the argument that, in any sport, when a player does statistically much, much better than their previous performance would predict, that in and of itself should be considered evidence of cheating - perhaps not conclusive evidence, but definitely evidence warranting further investigation: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32990022&gt; All this talk of &#34;Carlsen accused him of cheating with no evidence&#34; reminds me of the blowback against some athletes in the 70s and 80s who accused rivals of taking PEDs &#34;with no evidence&#34;.&gt; Sometimes the evidence of someone doing monstrously better than can be expected by their history is sufficient IMO. I mean, look at this article about swimmer Shirley Babashoff [1], dubbed &#34;Surly Shirley&#34; at the time by the media, for suggesting the East German women were on PEDs in the 70s. Nowadays we look back on those images of the East German women, looking more manly than any dude I&#39;ve ever seen, and wonder how we considered with a straight face that they weren&#39;t on a boatload of drugs. Similarly, it completely baffles me how any sane person can think that Flo Jo wasn&#39;t on PEDs in the runup to the 1988 Olympics - her 100m dash record still stands today.&gt; I&#39;m not saying Carlsen went about it in the right way, because now Niemann is basically in an indefensible position, but I&#39;m also not willing to quickly dismiss it because Carlsen has &#34;no evidence&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The fact that an athlete in a competitive sport was allowed to partake in an event even after admitting to cheating not only once, but twice, is outrageous in itself."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33043945">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The attention economy corrupts everything it touches: not just science, but journalism, politics, and even childhood.Being famous used to be rather difficult. Of course there were exceptions (writing To Kill a Mockingbird, being the guy who dove into the river to save a drowning child, for example), but for the most part, you were going to live your life known only to the few hundred or thousand people you met personally.Even though you could pick up a phone and dial anyone in the world who owned a phone, you wouldn&#39;t, and if you did, they&#39;d hang up on you. Now you can force your idiotic, or great ideas onto the screens of millions of people you&#39;ll never meet.Is that a good or a bad thing? It&#39;s certainly bad in some ways, and this is one of them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having spent over 10 years in a university and been a professor, the problem isn’t attention seeking behavior but a lack of accountability.  For example, you can literally make up any data you want in a grant proposal and so long as it sounds right no one can or will double check it. The foundation of academia is rotting, but maybe it’s always been like this"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What most people fail to realize is that fundamentally, most principle investigators, the people who actually run the research world, are primarily fundraisers. Their day-to-day job is a mix of grant and proposal writing, relationship building/organizational meetings, and checking in on their postdocs, candidates, and lab techs.Your main goal, as a PI, is to keep your lab running, and thus research flowing, by any means possible. For some PIs, this means milking every drop of available talent and time out of your doctoral candidates, and is the most common cause of the horror stories you hear about people leaving academia. On the other end of the extreme, they can embed themselves so deeply in fundraising with private or public capital that their lab staff don&#39;t see them for more than 15-30 minutes a week, because they are essentially living their lives hopping from sales meeting to sales meeting.This wouldn&#39;t be a problem if the job of the PI was explicitly meant to be that of a salesman, but the actual role of a PI is to define the research being done. They draft the hypotheses, the expected impact, etc, because that is their intended role, but in reality these will always be constructed in a way that makes it easier for the PI to solicit funding.It&#39;s impossible for the attention economy to not play into the research funding loop then, because every set of eyeballs is another potential revenue source for future research, or a tool to justify growing the footprint of your lab. I wouldn&#39;t go so far as to call the superstructure corrupting of science though, not in those words. I&#39;d say it forces science to be mission focused, where the mission is a subtle negotiation between the people funding the research and the people performing it, and often times the person with the capital lands much closer to their ideal."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33120534">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In one of the later posts, the OP writes that the homeless will lose any physical thing after N weeks. So what kind of 2FA would be homeless-proof? I don&#39;t see a solution.Also, fully acknowledging Google and other bigtechs 2FA is far from ideal:The other thing is, we want at the same time Gmail to be unhackable against best hackers and state sponsored adversaries for the billions of users, including high profile dissidents, journalists, and senators who will inevitably have accounts; and at the same time to homeless people who can&#39;t keep any physical thing. It&#39;s kinda difficult to meet those conflicting requirements well at the same time.Maybe the solution should be to have some basic free state-paid email provider for those people. They are not forced to use Gmail specifically (albeit the number of non-sucking and free email providers is probably close to zero)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can definitely understand not realizing that you could lose access to your account if you lose your phone number. But once it happens the first time, could you not pick any free email that does not require 2FA, and warn fellow homeless to avoid gmail?I disagree with the idea that because a very, very niche audience is in dire straits that the design decisions should be based on their needs. The forced 2FA system has probably prevented identify theft and financial loss for a very large number of people. I&#39;m saying this as someone who thinks Google is a shady and dangerous entity in general.It&#39;s similar to the idea that hard cases make bad law."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who uses 2FA extensively and even has 1Password autofill the OTP codes - 2FA is objectively fucking brutal.Half of you in here have never met a non-technical user. These folks should not have 2FA on ever, because they can&#39;t even use the damn thing with it on.Yes, those users run a higher risk and should be notified of that extremely clearly. But 2FA is a garbage solution to the problem and it should always be possible to disable it.I&#39;m going to continue using 2FA happily like most of those in here - but man the lack of empathy is outstanding in here. I feel bad for your users.And fuck Discord for not allowing me to reset my account with my own damn email address when my phone broke that one time. Total morons, through and through. I&#39;d never want to work with anyone so objectively ignorant and unwilling to admit their ass backwards position."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was in b-school, it was like they were trying to train us to have contempt for employees, especially the jobs where wages were low. They wanted us to treat them as fungible, replaceable cogs in the machine, not unlike this whole stupid pets-vs-cattle debate with servers.I got my degree but left utterly disgusted with management and MBA types. I am of the opinion that business degrees and business school are a toxic influence on most companies and that, with a few exceptions, they would be better served by hiring management types from other parts of the business and giving them some light compliance training instead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I always wonder what business schools actually teach.I worked at a company where it was decided that the tech support department had a bunch of college drop outs and nobody had a business degree so they had to hire some.   A few MBA guys were hired.   These guys had MBAs straight out of school with no experience outside some internships... and man it showed.Their first job was dealing with managing a schedule for about 25 people who manned the the tech support line 24/7.They just couldn&#39;t wrap their heads around the idea that on the spreadsheet if you schedule someone on Friday until Midnight... starting them at Midnight on Saturday doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense / they would be working 20 hours in a row.It&#39;s was horrible working with these guys.  They embodied the &#34;I&#39;m business guy and I made my decision for business reasons and you should follow them.&#34;Eventually I (worker drone) took over the schedule because what became known as &#34;the MBA team&#34; couldn&#39;t handle it / had no idea how to balance priorities and etc.I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some great schools for business / MBAs but I really wonder what they teach at those schools if just understanding simple hours, math, responding to emails in a timely / professional manner isn&#39;t it.   It was almost like the old FedEx advert: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcoDV0dhWPAPerhaps they should all be required to go manage a McDonalds for a year or something?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I dropped out of a MBA after they had us learning that managers and employees are separate classes of people. It&#39;s just not in my character to ever think like this.I personally believe the best managers are those who have been at the front line and work their way up. They know the business from bottom-up and know how to treat people at each layer.Also got super turned off when everyone just compared where they went to get their MBA at. Those who spent like 200k to go to Wharton and do the same job as me always felt weird. Those same types can get a job just about anywhere with that credential alone but also may reduce wages &amp; profits."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is one of the strengths of a federated system run by people who aren&#39;t looking to profit. Firstly, they care about their users and are more likely to take difficult decisions, like the one Ash has made, for the good of themselves and their users. In doing so everyone involved has time to make an orderly move.Secondly, the service survives. Mastodon didn&#39;t shut down. The Fediverse didn&#39;t close. One beloved instance bows out and whilst it is a loss to many, their network endures as they thank the admin(s) and move on.You think this shows a disadvantage compared to twitter? Let&#39;s talk once twitter shuts down. Because it will. How will your argument hold up when f*c*book finishes dying? We&#39;ll find out soon enough. Or how about when a telecoms/media conglomerate buys out flickr or tumblr and puts a stake through their heart? Oh, that already happened.This is a bittersweet testament to exactly how the Internet should be built: on the foundations of openness, community and decentralisation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thanks for your hard work Ash, and sorry to hear about your loved one.As much as I love the Fediverse, I think the culture leans toward instances that are too big. I think the number of people on each instance should be much closer to 1 than 1000.The problem is self-hosting is too difficult for the average person. But that doesn&#39;t have to be the case. Self-hosting shouldn&#39;t be any more complicated or less secure than installing an app on your phone. You shouldn&#39;t need to understand DNS, TLS, NAT, HTTP, TCP, UDP, etc, etc. Domain names shouldn&#39;t be any more difficult to buy or use than phone numbers. Apps should be sandboxed in KVM/WHPX/HVP-accelerated virtual machines that run on Windows, Mac, and Linux and are secure-by-default. Tunneling out to the public internet should be a quick OAuth flow that lets you connect a given app to a specific subdomain, with TLS certs automatically obtained from Let&#39;s Encrypt and stored locally for end-to-end encryption."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A major note in the Mastodon fediverse brought down by the fact that it&#39;s administered by one person who, despite the fact they are running a social network node, never built up the real world trust connections to find somebody they could share the toil of administration with or tap in when it was time for them to bow out because we are all mortal.The technological problems are not the hard problems in this space.

Ideally this should be part of the OS.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m really excited to see support for torrents v2.
If only because transmission will stop chocking on hybrid torrent files, which should lead to more adoption across the board.I wish transmission supported mutable torrents (BEP46). It would allow completely re-thinking distribution: grab a torrent of your favorite distribution, and have it auto-update to the latest version.Or grab a &#34;super-torrent&#34; that lists isos for all known distributions, select the ones you&#39;re interested in, and let it update... Of course, that can be used for file-sharing repositories too.Maybe transmission is not interactive enough for such a use-case (you&#39;d have to ask the user what they want to do when the torrent mutates, and possibly add simple scripting interfaces for more complex heuristics)."</p>

It seemed less featureful than others but now I like its simplicity, does everything it needs and it is also very reliable.It is not very known but there actually is a transmission-cli for common torrent operations that may come in handy some time."</p>

Modern cell phones have been steadily tuned to reduce interference with other electronics though - good thing, otherwise you couldn&#39;t use them in a modern home with its dozens of connected devices.  And modern avionics have been shielded to protect them from outside electronic interference - also a good thing, otherwise the next terrorist could simply turn their laptop on.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Circa 2009 or so, my absolute favorite app for the iPod Touch was Patrick Collison&#39;s Offline Wikipedia (yes, that Patrick Collison: https://web.archive.org/web/20100419194443/http://collison.i...). You could download various wikis that had been pre-processed to fit in a very small space - as I recall, the entire English Wikipedia was a mere 2 GB in size. It was simply magical that I could have access to all of Wikipedia anytime, anywhere offline - especially since the iPod Touch could only connect to the Internet via WiFi. It was particularly useful while travelling, since I could load up articles and just read them on the plane.As I recall, there were several clever things that the app did to reduce the size of the dump; many stub/redirect articles were removed, the formatting was pared down to the bare minimum, and it was all compressed quite efficiently to fit in such a small space. Patrick gives more technical detail on an earlier version of the app&#39;s homepage: https://web.archive.org/web/20080523222440/http://collison.i..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FYI, the internet archive hosts a ZIM archive that has dumps of wikipedia and many other works. https://archive.org/details/zimarchiveI wish it was a little more obvious how to search it, or what all the variations mean, but it looks like a valuable resource.It is worth noting that Kiwix works on multiple OSes and on phones and has a wifi hostspot version (that you might run on an raspberry pi, for example). Internet-in-a-box similarly works as a wifi hostspot for ZOM archives.Lastly, it is worth mentioning that there are tools for creating your own ZIM files; it looks like the most straightforward way is to take a static website and use a utility to convert it into one self-contained file."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kiwix is great - I have a collection of various things from their library https://library.kiwix.org/?lang=eng downloaded for when I&#39;m on a plane or the internet is otherwise unavailable.That and the TeXlive PDF manuals can get me through anything."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It really is remarkable how far cancer treatment has progressed, even in the last few years. I&#39;m one of the unfortunate people who, through a close family encounter with cancer, knows more about this stuff than anyone should have to. The oncologist told my relative that if they had presented with this particular cancer just a decade ago, his recommendation would have been to start hospice care.However, in recent years, a very effective checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy has been developed for the cancer in question. ~2x the success rates of traditional chemo, greatly increased overall survival statistics, and with massively reduced side effects. The results speak for themselves: this drug has granted my relative years of extra life in the worst case, and a path to a deep, long remission in the best case.I think that as the technology develops, by 2040 we&#39;ll be looking back at the present state of the art with the same incredulity that we currently have for, like, bloodletting with leeches in the Middle Ages. I think they&#39;ve been saying this for a long time now, but it&#39;s truer than ever that a real cure for cancer is right around the corner."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is not a single disease, but rather a result of several errant biological outcomes.  The mortality rates have improved a lot with better treatments, and around 60% of the population will develop some form of the disease in their lifespan.The most disturbing part is most people are unaware they are ill until relatively late stages of the disease.If you live long enough, one will know many good people that go this way. It is a worthy area of research, as it improves the lives of many families. =)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here is the only clinical data:
https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2020.38.15_suppl.46...Looks as promising as any other promising cancer therapy in phase I trials!There is a renaissance in cancer drug delivery at present, exemplified by antibody drug conjugates. The tech in the article is very interesting, and a superb bioengineering effort. A caveat is that complex multi-unit therapies don’t have a great track record. They are hard to manufacture reliably, and have a very large optimisation volume, so it’s difficult to increment the development as you only have finite resources for human trials. Contrast this with small molecules where there is a well defined process over various chemical and pharmacokinetic factors, prior to testing in humans. We also lack a good system for developing and trialing ‘platform’ tech like this - the current system is set up for single drugs/combos to be tested and eventually reimbursed in each cancer type separately. If you have a platform for delivering tailored therapies agnostic of cancer type, you will run into many barriers. There is currently only one drug I know of simultaneously approved across multiple cancer types (pembrolizumab in mismatch repair deficient tumours, a rare population). So many challenges ahead of the hype here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Every now and then I like to read through Wikipedia pages for things I know more than the average person on. It keeps me skeptical of the things I read on there. For people unfamiliar with a subject (students) I think Wikipedia pages are misleading, poorly organized, and sometimes wrong. That doesn&#39;t make Wikipedia useless, but the author&#39;s best advice is to use Wikipedia as a map to other sources of information.I don&#39;t think Wikipedia has a path forwards for fixing the quality of its articles. In my opinion it requires every page being rewritten by an expert with a single voice, as a traditional encyclopedia would have, which is the exact opposite of Wikipedia&#39;s core. Though I did check, and they have more than enough cash to write a traditional encyclopedia."</p>

Society places a lot of trust in teachers, and there are few checks against bad teachers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You should be fighting this at the school. Wikipedia should not be used as a source for academic purposes; the sources being referenced on Wikipedia very well could be though and as such Wikipedia is an incredibly useful tool for surface level research and schools should absolutely be taking this approach to using it.They should not, under any circumstance, have children &#34;Googling&#34; the answer to questions. Most of these kids parents already use that phrase as a keystone of their parental pedagogy and they don&#39;t need that in school, too.Wikipedia is wonderful. They have more money then they will ever need so don&#39;t donate; but, they are great. Everyone should have a copy of Wikipedia locally updated yearly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is jaded and angry, but I think there is another archetype called &#34;the politician.&#34; They play the game extremely well, providing poorly thought out solutions quickly to problems they haven&#39;t dug into the complexity of. They lay operational traps everywhere in their quest to get things done fast (like directly embedding config data in code to avoid fixing the config format). Once they&#39;ve picked the low hanging fruit and left too much complexity to maintain, they hop to another company where they sell themselves on all they accomplished leaving out the absolutely unmaintainable mess they left behind."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Archetypes are useful in how you sell yourself. Don&#39;t forget that it&#39;s not what you are, just how you sell yourself.You can change between these every review cycle, job, career, all you want - no one in management is keeping track of your &#34;archetype&#34;. They are keeping track of your impact.Lastly, you are the &#34;person in the box&#34; once you are senior enough. Take the archetypes, look at your org, and see which they need. Whatever is missing will be the most value to the org. How you see yourself accomplishing that box is the real challenge of executives, not this endless &#34;what color parachute are you&#34; self evaluation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A little meta commentary: I&#39;m seeing a lot of negative takes using the word &#34;they&#34; (so presumably these are from people who either haven&#39;t worked in a staff eng capacity, or have, but in dysfunctional organizations).The intent of this article (as I understand it) was to help people navigate the emerging nebulous role that &#34;staff engineer&#34; was, particularly as it started to become a more mainstream concept a few years ago (whereas prior to it, the dichotomy was largely that senior was &#34;the&#34; terminal IC role and you had to transition to management past that).Many engineers on the upper side of the senior spectrum have clearly been operating above and beyond what is typically considered senior level, but not in the capacity of a typical manager archetype, so this was meant to help people understand how to identify/categorize these people as well as help people understand what kinds of challenges to look at after you&#39;ve become a &#34;full-fledged&#34; senior engineer. Resources are useful, whodathunkit.My advice for those eyeing for a staff+ level would be to avoid making &#34;hot take&#34; categories, everyone can do that and if they&#39;re coming from a position of inexperience w/ the subject matter, there&#39;s a good chance it&#39;s a bad take. Instead, try to derive action items from each of the archetypes, and incorporate those into your work. A good point I heard is that no staff engineer qualifies as a single archetype exclusively; the role is usually a mix of all archetypes, with different people leaning more strongly one way vs another.It&#39;s very easy to make sour comments like &#34;oh staff people just spend all their time in meetings, what good are they for&#34;. It&#39;s quite another to be that staff engineer and have to balance technical depth acquisition, alignment among disparate groups and the multiplexing required to operate at high levels at both. It&#39;s easy to chalk it up to politics, but it&#39;s quite another to be able to visualize power structures as tools, and use them as such to accomplish large scale engineering goals. There are classes of engineering challenges that only really arise at the staff+ engineer level, and engaging with them can be rewarding in their own right."</p>

But this &#34;Marg bar Āmrikā&#34; shit is an unflattering look for such a thoughtful community and it ignores that huge parts of this community are a direct personal object of very nasty remarks made &#34;in general&#34; on a fairly daily basis.People are quite pleased to enjoy the corporate funding of all the open-source projects that wouldn&#39;t exist without the megacorps: try saying something bad about Kubernetes if you don&#39;t believe me.It&#39;s not a 1-bit thing, and Hacker News is Hacker News because when people (and I&#39;ve been that guy) throw rocks, we demand better."</p>

It could also potentially help the Democratic Party in the upcoming election.But if you believe in what the Democratic Party is trying to do for the country, that&#39;s not a bad thing. There&#39;s no corruption in doing popular things that can help get people in your party elected. That&#39;s just good governance and acting according to the will of the voters.The majority of people in the US, 60%, and even a plurality of Republicans support decriminalizing recreational cannabis federally. The support for medicinal cannabis, possible if Cannabis wasn&#39;t scheduled as it currently is, is even higher.Recreational:https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/22/10/29166025/new...Medical:https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interestingly, he specifically excludes illegal immigrants who are not US citizens from the pardon, as well as (implicitly) people who used to be lawful permanent residents but no longer are (perhaps because their visa got revoked after being arrested for possessing marijuana), as well as former US citizens (if there are any who have been charged with this &#34;crime&#34;) and people who were never residents in the US at all (perhaps they got arrested when they changed flights at a US airport).  So this is a step in the right direction, but not nearly far enough.  I wonder why he went to the trouble of making all those exclusions."</p>

The tested it incorrectly, told us we were at fault and needed to fix it, and gave us 2 weeks to do so. We scrambled to figure out what the issue was, only to find after they eventually replied to our emails (all they told us up-front was &#34;it doesn&#39;t work&#34;) that they had tried to use a sign-in only button to sign-up, similar on many websites, not at all for our flow and not something it was possible for us to do. We explained this and they dropped the audit.2 weeks later, they audited us again, failed us again, and gave us a deadline to fix it. We replied pointing to the previous case and explaining again why it was working. We never heard back.2 weeks later, they audited us again, failed us again, and gave us a deadline to fix it. We replied asking what the hell was happening (politely). We never heard back.1 week later &#34;Sign in with Facebook&#34; stopped working with no other warning. We opened a support case, we emailed our ads account manager, we emailed our previous ads account manager as the first was on holiday, and all we got was &#34;we&#39;re looking into it, but it looks legit, fix it&#34;.I asked for a call and explained that the current user experience for users was that they would click &#34;Sign in with Facebook&#34; and see an error saying &#34;Facebook is currently not working, please sign in another way&#34;, and that the only way we had to resolve this was to email all our Facebook auth&#39;d users a password reset with an explanation that Facebook sign in no longer worked, and to then remove the feature from our site.&#34;Ah. Ok yeah let me see what I can do&#34;. It was working about 2 hours later, and we weren&#39;t audited again in the rest of the time I was at the company."</p>

One year without warning or explination they Facebook just deleted all our events (we would travel from one uni to another over the summer). I frantically tried to get a response from facebook. I never got one.I sued in small claims court and they settled the case (not before being very threatening through high paid lawyers and trying to dodge the case altogether) they never did explain what had happend or why.Ultimately it&#39;s partly the reason I shut the company down, facebook was our channel, without certainty we could host events and promote them it made no business sense to invest in the company."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t have a specific solution for you, but I also run a domain with some thousands of subdomains and is always a fight to not be banned from Google, Meta, internet operators etc. Sometimes is enough one bad actor under one of your subdomains to have a full ban on the whole domain.What I suggest is for your and your clients to contact Meta through the Business Center support. Their support for paying clients is much better. I would also recommend you become a Meta Business Partner if Facebook/Instagram is important for your SaaS."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would have agreed until I started working at Google. Also, you should completely avoid having Remote Desktop and instead use ssh + an editor that works with remote files.At Google we have a custom fork of VSCode running in browser and builds can either be distributed or run on my Linux VM to utilize build cache.I liked it so much I started doing a similar setup for small side projects. Just boot up the Cloud Console on GCP and start coding.Advantages are:- Accessible from anywhere (I use my pc, my laptop, etc. The env is always the same)- More compute (I can attach more CPU + more RAM flexibly)- Less friction to start (minimum environment setup, most tools are preinstalled)- Datacenter Network speeds + Artifacts cached (installing dependencies is fast)Disadvantages:- network dependenceThere are some adjustments that need to be made to your workflow. And for some applications you are dependent on having the correct tooling. However, my personal prediction is most companies will move to this type of development workflow as the tooling improves."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nothing beats working directly on a fast but quiet workstation sitting next to my table.At least for me, the productivity gains associated with quicker builds, IDE resyncs (CLion, looking at you) or just being able to have email, chat, calendar and an active video conference running without making the system crawl to a halt or long latency spikes are huge. 3-4k for a machine that will likely last 2-3 years is nothing in comparison."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ken Thompson wrote in his famous paper [1] about quines:&gt; If you have never done this, I urge you to try it on your own. The discovery of how to do it is a revelation that far surpasses any benefit obtained by being told how to do itEvery once in a while I give them a try but I couldn&#39;t yet create one and it frustrates me very much. Afraid of being denied that &#34;revelation&#34; I never dared to read his paper past that point. I&#39;m afraid I might never read it because of my ego.1: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/487/papers/Thompson_1984_Ref..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This issue imploring Yusuke Endoh to write a paper about it is amusing:https://github.com/mame/quine-relay/issues/10&gt; p-e-w:&gt; This is more than a cool program – it&#39;s a computer science breakthrough! Apparently, you have discovered a method for constructing quines based on an arbitrary blueprint involving any amount of languages.
&gt; 
&gt; Please write a technical paper describing your approach. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll have no trouble finding a CS journal that will publish it.&gt; mame:&gt; Okay I&#39;ll submit to the Journal of Universal Rejection.Later:&gt; mame:&gt; I&#39;ll soon publish a book, &#34;The world of obfuscated, esoteric, artistic programming&#34;. The book explains how to write a uroboros quine. Hence, I proudly close this issue.&gt; It also contains my almost all (about forty) works, including alphabet-only Ruby program, radiation-hardened quine, etc., and explains many techniques to write such programs.&gt; You can buy my book on amazon.co.jp. Unfortunately, it is written in Japanese, yet another esoteric language. I hope anyone can translate to English."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is nothing but a bad strawman from start to finish.Sprints are not made to help organize things, they&#39;re a tool to get more predictable deliveries. Their very short nature forces participants to construct tasks that are easier to estimate and therefore complete on time with a higher probability.This certainly adds overhead to an idealised scenario where people take the shortest reasonble route often enough and that is the tradeoff. Plus: people actually seldomly take the optimum routes in the first place.Nobody has to like it, this is probably not the best method and maybe it&#39;s not even good. But the author misses the point completely."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kanban is the best middle ground IMO. I agree sprints are a distraction. The planning and ceremonies alone sap time. Sprints are really just a form of pressure. In my experience the stories estimating is not accurate enough to set up a predictable sprint, and the inevitable deviation from the plan just creates additional work to audit and adjust, along with a sense of failure around what has often been a productive 2 weeks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I get the hate for sprints, and the bastardisation of agile. I think however, the root cause of this is the way in which our society as a whole has been modelled, in a top down manner where control is wrested from the bottom, and perceived control is given to those in between. Each of these articles that make, valid criticisms in my opinion, always makes me think of Bullshit Jobs [1][2]. Most of our lives nowadays are inundated with menial bureaucracy, and each attempt to reform it within bureaucractic systems has simply lead to the red tape being rearranged. I think this stems from our hesitancy to have more horizontal models of ogranisation.[1] - https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-on-the...[2] - https://bullshit.ist/bullshit-jobs-how-our-modern-bureaucrac..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My favorite nuclear disaster! Criticality events.I lived in Los Alamos for a while. I looked into renting a studio space. I became curious about the property across the street from my prospective rental which was surrounded by a chain link fence with green canvas. I researched and learned it was the site of an original Manhattan site waste dump which had, a few years prior, been enclosed with a negative pressure tent and cleaned up at a cost of 2-3 billion. Apparently the government had dumped an unknown quantity of high level nuclear waste there in an unlined pit in the dirt in the 40s. This led me to research the history of the area.After a couple of months I figured out that my house in White Rock was about 3/4 of a mile from the current waste dump for the entire lab, known as TA-53 or MDA-C or something. They were in the process of excavating the three 200 foot deep pits of MDA-C - one for low level nuclear waste, one for transuranic (as they call “high level” these days) and one for classified waste. If I stood on my roof I could see the negative pressure tents surrounding them. My favorite non-classified project which was disposed of there was the “experimental high temperature plutonium reactor”, from the 90s.The lab has some rather interesting history. There was no concept at all of safely disposing of anything or even recording what they dumped and where until the 60s. The first ever radioactive metal working facility, out on a ridge by the entrance to town (TA 21? 23?) dumped all of their wastewater directly into the canyon untreated. This has recently been cleaned up at a cost of several billion dollars also, and now they are building homes there. The heavy/radioactive metal plumes went down into the earth over 500 feet. In fact, all of the waste from the entire lab used to be dumped into a stream in the middle of town. They cleaned it up, opened it as a park (“Acid Canyon”), then after heavy rains found some barrels they missed which were determined to contain plutonium waste. Oops, cleaned that up some more and now it’s a nature preserve and hiking area. There are still untouched facilities from the 50s where Feynman worked on polonium experiments sitting a few hundred feet from the banks of the Rio Grande.There was a power plant right on the edge of a native reservation neighboring the lab. According to the federal government, the plume of chromium contamination it left ends exactly on the property line of the lab to the reservation.Everyone I met in Los Alamos had zero concerns about pollution having an impact on them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They keep saying that profit seeking was the issue, but taking selfies with plutonium, running a lab for 4 years that produces nothing, and not having any employees that don&#39;t understand the most basics of nuclear physics does not sound like profit seeking. It sounds like someone just has way too much money and runs a nuclear weapons lab as vanity project."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Virtually all of the Los Alamos engineers tasked with keeping workers safe from criticality incidents decided to quit, having become frustrated by the sloppy work demonstrated by the 2011 event and what they considered the lab management&#39;s callousness about nuclear risks and its desire to put its own profits above safety.&gt; When this exodus was in turn noticed in Washington, officials there concluded the privately-run lab was not adequately protecting its workers from a radiation disaster.Excellent response from those engineers."</p>
