								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a concern about REPL driven development, which is around how maintainable the result is.The reason people like REPLs is because they can experiment to discover the right way to write the code in a very fast feedback loop. This alleviates a huge pain when you are operating with uncertainties or at the edge of your knowledge - &#39;does this function return null if no matching entries or an empty list?&#39; - etc.The problem is that the reader of your code is not going on that journey with you. They are coming in naively without knowing all of that experimentation you did. The writer now has the opportunity to create code that &#34;just happens&#34; to work by a magic of coincidences and conveniences based on very subtle non-obvious properties of the APIs and systems they are working with. The reader is severely disadvantaged and will have a much harder time to reach parity with the state of knowledge that the writer had. For example, some property of a function or object may not be documented at all, but through the REPL the writer has ascertained it is true. How can the reader know this?So its a double edged sword in that the more you empower the original creator of the code, the greater imbalance you create to the later readers and maintainers of the code. Used well and with great discipline I could see it being very powerful and positive force to make better code. But in the worst case scenario, you&#39;ll end up with extremely unmaintainable code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having used Clojure and Common Lisp professionally, I think advocates for REPL driven programming universally overstate the utility of a first rate REPL.Yes, it’s nicer than Python’s. Yes, it’s convenient. No, I never ended up doing my development in the REPL first. Why? Because editing mistakes in a REPL usually sucks, because a REPL is not a text editor.What I ended up using heavily was REPL to file integration, which gave me the ability to write a function normally, evaluate it in the attached REPL session, and then play around with it in the REPL. This is far short of the “REPL driven development” that’s commonly discussed, and frankly something that’s probably possible with the Python REPL if they wanted to.Editing data and functions in the REPL is a neat trick, but it’s a double edged sword, because a REPL can crash, and it provides incredibly rudimentary support for diffing current state and migrating changes back to permanent files. I would never start with anything more than a trivial “how do I manipulate this list” in the REPL for that reason. Oh, and we had a lot of issues with REPLs getting into a bad state with Clojure due to multi methods and protocols; if you’re doing your primary work in the REPL, then having to restart it due to it becoming unstable really sucks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"He&#39;s right to emphasize the properties of the systems that support interactive development with a long-running image. In Common Lisp, the difference between defvar and defparameter is a simple example. Traditional Smalltalk systems only supported image-based development. But I always preferred the moderate approach exemplified by most Lisp systems where the source code isn&#39;t overly entangled with the image state.As a long-time but now lapsed Lisper, I never understood some people&#39;s elevation of the REPL. A command-line REPL is a poor man&#39;s development environment. If you&#39;re doing interactive development in Lisp, you&#39;ll be far more productive if you use a normal buffer with eval-defun, eval-buffer and friends. When debugging, you&#39;ll primarily want auto-updating watch expressions and object inspectors. And when you do have good use for a REPL, you&#39;ll still want it to exist within a proper buffer with persistent history, inline object inspection, etc, instead of the low-effort rlwrap terminal experience which usually passes for a REPL.All of this holds doubly true for Smalltalk environments."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ve had similar experiences with other google products:My mom forgot her gmail password and no longer had the same mobile number for a reset, the secondary reset option was set to my email but would not send a reset despite this. We had a live session via thunderbird but there were no channels of support. Luckily we were able to register her old mobile number to achieve a password reset, thanks to a helpful phone provider and NOT google.My mailserver is marked as spam by gmail, a helpful HN commentor pointed out it may be my lack of ipv6 which appears to be the cause. I have no idea why ipv6 would indicate that I’m not a spammer, I can’t ask google because they don’t have a support line.I understand others have far more expensive (read: &gt;1m$) problems with google specifically, and I know I’m not alone here.I just hope that by continually airing grievances with lack of (useful) customer service by major providers, they end up caving and investing in customer support.Until then, fuck you google."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Taking a look at your site, it seems quite clear where all your traffic went. You have a pretty great backlink profile compared to other affiliate sites ive seen but the content is incredibly thin. Based on this, me or anyone else who visits the site just sees an advertising site. There are no personal experiences with the products, the products are not related and the UX does not make the user want to continue exploring the page they landed on. The content here seems more like a statistics site for products than it is a reviews site.The other comments here mentioning cheap as a flag word are somewhat accurate but not entirely. Its possible to rank a site using the word cheap assuming you&#39;re supporting it correctly with related content about a specific product and proper explanation as to what makes it cheap.Honestly, I am very sorry that you lost all your traffic and your revenue but this seems like a VERY fixable problem considering your backlinks. Take your best performing posts, and dramatically increase the word count, add more photos, add overviews of each product instead of just a single line or two pulled from reviews.Happy to help with additional pointers if you want to shoot me a PM."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is one of several posts I&#39;ve seen on HN lately following a similar trend: sudden and unexpected drops in search engine traffic. On the one hand it must be jarring to suddenly have a drop in traffic. But is it necessarily indicative of a bad administration of a search engine?Popularity of sites shift. People&#39;s tastes change. Even without an algorithm change we would not expect search traffic to remain constant. And algorithm changes do shift attention to sites that previously weren&#39;t getting traffic. Would the world better with static search traffic? The incumbents always win, and newcomers have a tough time getting a foothold. That&#39;s what it would take to avoid situations like these, and I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s an improvement over the status quo. Between living in constant worry that the algorithm might change and shift search traffic, and a world where the algorithm never changes and search traffic remains rather static I&#39;m not sure which is really better. In the latter goodcheapandfast.com might never even have existed.Bing&#39;s blocking mechanism seems pretty crude, though, and not sharing why it was blocked seems particularly wonky. Sure it&#39;s a cat and mouse game between scammers and devs, but it&#39;d be nice if they at least vaguely alluded to why the false positive happened."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;[Line] fixed it by adding a random number to the user&#39;s destinationThis is a imperfect solution. There&#39;s two possibilities: the offset (aka &#34;random number&#34;) is dynamic, or it&#39;s fixed. If it&#39;s the former all you have to do is sample enough times to get through the noise. If it&#39;s the latter, it&#39;s not vulnerable to the previous attack, but if you have a known point of reference (so you can deduce what the offset is), then you can still stalk them (forever?). IMO the only way to do is &#34;properly&#34; is to quantize people into map cells, like how apple does it with their coarse location feature[1].[1] &#34;Apple doesn&#39;t reduce the accuracy of location fixes by adding noise. Instead, they&#39;ve carved up the world into regions, allowing approximate locations to preserve the user&#39;s current city when possible.&#34; https://radar.io/blog/understanding-approximate-location-in-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A user does not show up in “People nearby” unless they enable the function. Doing so triggers a warning from Telegram informing you your location is about to be published and it may lead to undesired attention so it really can’t happen by accident.I’m also using the app on iOS, the operating system asks periodically if I want to continue sharing location in the background (in case I forget to turn it off) or I can just choose to enable it while using the app (which is what I usually do)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So many dimensions come to play here.1. There&#39;s the obvious legal aspect i.e. how these laws are framed and interpreted.2. Then there&#39;s the geopolitical aspect. Is it fair to impose sanctions on Iran.3. There&#39;s another aspect around GitHub policy that asks if an entire organization be banned for the location of one team member.4. Finally, there&#39;s the aspect of relinquishing control. Your app development is on the cloud. IDEs are on the cloud. Deployments are on the cloud. App stores are on the cloud.You have relinquished so much control, why be surprised if that stares you back in the face?Ironically, Git is a decentralized version control system."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The US sanctions on Iran has such a massive impact on Iranians that most of us don&#39;t realise.All US companies have to comply and majority of the tech companies are unfortunately in the US.I know you can use a VPN and configure it on a router level to make sure that you are always connected via a VPN but just the fact that 1 slip-up can result in account level blocks (which google is notoriously good at and can essentially shut down your business) means no company would want to work with someone working from Iran.Coming from a 3rd world country, I know the problems of internet censorship which Iranians also face but being too toxic to touch for everyone outside Iran because the US leadership thinks so is just infuriating and heart breaking.Imagine being a programmer in Iran. Not only do you have less resources to learn and grow, you have a massive handicap to find good work as most work is outside of the country.Only bet is to leave the country but even there you have a very low probability as you basically can&#39;t have a trial period for your job as most companies don&#39;t want to risk having their accounts blocked.Most of us here know how degrading and infuriating the tech recruiting processes can be and now add to it the horrors of working from Iran.Wars are not supposed to have civilian casualties but this one has a generation of civilians being starved of information and experience critical for them to grow."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow. This is amazing. Although I wish they documented how much compute and data was used to get these results.I absolutely believe we&#39;ll crack the fundamental principles of intelligence in our lifetimes. We now have capability to process all public data available on internet (of wikipedia is a huge chunk). We have so many cameras and microphones (one in each pocket).It&#39;s also scary to think if it goes wrong (the great filter for fermi paradox). However I&#39;m optimistic.The brain only uses 20 watts of power to do all its magic. The entire human body is built from 700MB of data in the DNA. The fundamental principles of intelligence is within reach if we look from that perspective.Right now GPT3 and DALL-E seem to be using an insane amount of computation to achieve what they are doing.

The examples shown are likely from a set of well-defined (read: lots of data, high bias) input classes for the model. What would be really interesting is how the model generalizes to /object concepts/ that have yet to be seen, and which have abstract relationships to the examples it has seen. Another commenter here mentioned &#34;red square on green square&#34; working, but &#34;large cube on small cube&#34;, not working. Humans are able to infer and understand such abstract concepts with very few examples, and this is something AI isn&#39;t as close to as it might seem."</p>

Doing this requires a huge amount of work to be done, as Apple Silicon is a completely undocumented platform. In particular, we will be reverse engineering the Apple GPU architecture and developing an open source driver for it.This looks like the major bullet point.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"How about an immediate-mode renderer that works like a Rust async executor?The executor could run all of the rendering closures on one core and benefit from caching.It could detect slow rendering closures and automatically switch them to buffered mode and run them on a &#34;slow renderers&#34; thread.  This would keep the rest of the UI snappy.  It could also tint those portions of the UI so users can see which app is the culprit of UI slowness.I hope that Rust can someday be used as the basis of an OS that does not rely on sandboxing for security, but instead uses the compiler to enforce security.  Such an OS could use cooperative multitasking and use a lot less energy and less expensive hardware than our current multi-core CPU + MMU + kernel ring model."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Welcome to Project Lightspeed. This is a project that allows anyone to easily deploy their own sub-second latency live-streaming server. In its current state you can stream from OBS [1] and watch that stream back from any desktop browser.This has been a super fun project which has taught me more than any other project I have done. It uses Rust, Go and React and can be deployed fairly easily on a very lightweight server. For example, I have been doing my test streams on a $5 Digital Ocean droplet and the CPU usage is at around 20%. Granted not a lot of people are watching however it is more lightweight than a solution such as Janus.The point of this project is twofold. First I wanted to learn more about WebRTC and real-time communication in general. Second, I wanted to provide a platform where people can setup their own little live-stream environment. Maybe you just want a place where you and some friends can hang out or you are sick of the main-stream platforms.Anyhow as of writing this post it is v0.1.0 and considered an MVP release. In the coming months I (and hopefully some of you :)) will be adding more features and trying to flesh this out into as much of a full featured platform as possible. Feel free to take a look at the repo and let me know what you all think :)[1] Open Broadcast Software (OBS): https://obsproject.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"About the choice of license (MIT): could you share your considerations about it? (if any)It&#39;s a topic I&#39;m interested in. Mainly to see examples (and learn from them) about when people prefer lax licenses on the style of &#34;do what you want with this, including a closed-source proprietary business&#34; (MIT, Apache) which has allowed in the past that big Co&#39;s. benefit from it without giving back (lots of cases in HN), vs. strong copyleft &#34;do what you want except closed-source proprietary stuff&#34; style (generally speaking, the GPL family -- EDIT: I know that this, being mainly a server-side thing, would be more affected by AGPL than by GPL. Bear with me.).If there are no business / commercialization intentions in the foreseeable future, would it make sense to use a GPL license (one of them) to build a strong open-source community?Or it doesn&#39;t matter in practice? (i.e. it doesn&#39;t really affect the chances of building a good and strong developer community)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is awesome! I wanted to make something like this too after Mixer shut down and I didn&#39;t have good options anymore to stream low latency gameplay to friends. But I was too lazy to do it properly.I ended up with this hack: https://i.imgur.com/jDeMxly.pngRedirect the &#34;Record&#34; button of obs to make ffmpeg output to an http endpoint, which is a small server that just forwards any bytes it receives to connected consumers. They can then play it back with    ffplay -fflags nobuffer -flags low_delay -framedrop -strict experimental https://stream.server/lawl

I&#39;ve found that most of the latency is actually coming from the player. I.e. VLC has way more latency, even if you tell it to not buffer. TCP is a bit of an issue since ffplay doesn&#39;t speed up playback when it falls behind, but it mostly works and you can just restart ffplay if you fall behind too far. When it works (good network conditions) it also achieves sub second latency.Will definitely have to give this a try over my hack."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reading the judgement the key points are on pages 116 onwards and the extradition is denied under section 91(3) of the EA 2003 which reads:&gt; The condition is that the physical or mental condition of the person is such that it would be unjust or oppressive to extradite him.The judge states:&gt; it is my judgment that there is a real risk that he will  be kept in the near isolated conditions imposed by the  harshest SAMs (special administrative measures) regime, both pre-trial and post-trialAnd goes on to contrast with the conditions at HMP Belmarsh:&gt; many of the protective factors currently in place at HMP Belmarsh would be removed by these conditions. Mr. Assange’s health improved on being removed from relative isolation in healthcare. He has been able to access the support of family and friends. He has had access to a Samaritans phone line. He has benefited from a trusting relationship with the prison In-Reach psychologist. By contrast, a SAMs regime would severely restrict his contact with all other human beings, including other prisoners, staff and his family. In detention subject to SAMs, he would have absolutely no communication with other prisoners, even through the walls of his cell, and time out of his cell would be spent alone.These conditions sound barbaric to me and I&#39;d go as far to describe them as torture. Amnesty International do a better job of outlining the problems with this regime than I can: https://www.amnestyusa.org/reports/entombed-isolation-in-the...Frankly I don&#39;t understand why the UK continues to maintain an extradition treaty with a country which clearly has a poor record on human rights and fails to maintain a justice system that meets the UN&#39;s Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners.She concludes:&gt; I am satisfied that, in these harsh conditions, Mr. Assange’s mental health would deteriorate causing him to commit suicide with the “single minded determination” of his autism spectrum disorder.&gt; I order the discharge  of Julian Paul Assange, pursuant  to section 91(3) of the EA 2003Whilst a victory nonetheless for Assange, it is unfortunate that the entire judgement seems to come down to this point alone. Let&#39;s hope it is not overturned."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If there&#39;s anything to learn from Assange and Snowden:1. Our western &#34;liberal&#34; democracies stop being liberal when the government gets angry at you at a personal level.2. With enough propaganda, you can make people believe anything, even that Snowden is a &#34;traitor&#34; to the US.3. Politically vociferous people (the mob) don&#39;t give a shit about you unless you&#39;re instrumental to support the cause du jour"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually don&#39;t think this is such great news for him.Extradition was specifically blocked on the grounds of a particular regime he might be subjected to (to be fair, probably the only legal grounds on which he had any chance of succeeding). That leaves the US with a way out if they want to proceed with the extradition - guarantee a different set of circumstances.If the judge had found on more substantive grounds, those would have been much more resistant to that. For instance, all the claims based on language in the extradition treaty and other international agreements failed and they failed for pretty fundamental legal reasons. English courts only have regard for domestic law and it is for parliament to pass laws consistent with the treaties that have been signed, therefore claims based on treaty language won&#39;t work.That means that none of the claims on the political nature of his activities were upheld and those would have provided a much more robust and durable bar to extradition."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I talk to colleagues in tech about unions I hear a lot of misconceptions, seemingly based in stereotypes about what unions are for and who they serve. People often seem to think of unions as being purely blue-collar operations, and this just isn&#39;t true.For example, I&#39;ve had people tell me that they don&#39;t support unions in tech because they&#39;ll be &#34;paid less&#34;, or less competent engineers will be promoted faster.And it&#39;s strange, because the other major industry in California - the film industry - is heavily unionised, and you just don&#39;t see that happening there. You have vocally supportive multi-millionaire card-carrying members of the Screen Actors Guild, the Writers Guild, and the Directors Guild to name a few. None of these unions are limiting the work their members are carrying out.This is because those unions are serving a very different purpose to the stereotypical union some engineers seem to fear. SAG, the DGA, and the WGA aren&#39;t guaranteeing hours or limiting pay: they&#39;re simply trying to curb abuse in what it a very abusive industry, and putting in place procedures to protect members and resolve grievances.And they don&#39;t always get it right, and I don&#39;t pretend that Hollywood is a perfect utopia of worker relations, but I think it&#39;s pretty undeniable that the industry is a much better place with the unions around."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever seen Hollywood in the modern era without unions, so not sure how you can claim it&#39;s &#34;undeniable&#34; the industry is better off. We basically have no clue if it&#39;s better off or not.Unions are intended for industries where a worker doesn&#39;t have a marketplace of options as there is a single or just a few employers (e.g. Hollywood, teachers, coal mining towns, hospital staff, etc.). Unionizing at Google makes no sense, as there are thousands of tech companies hiring engineers in the valley -- engineers can &#34;collectively bargain&#34; with Google by simply leaving and working somewhere &#34;better&#34;.The reality is that Google is an easy place to work relative to how much people get paid. People don&#39;t want to leave a cushy job for one where they would have to work harder for their money, so instead, they are trying other means to have their cake and eat it too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems incredibly significant that only 230 people are officially involved with these plans to unionize. As of 2019, Google had nearly 120,000 employees.[0] That seems quite small, relatively speaking.Legally (I think, just learning about this now), to form a union, a majority of workers must show their willingness to form a union. Alternatively, to choose an existing union to join, an election with 30% of the workers support is required.[1]So with that said, am I reading this right? Does this group of 230 people need to find at least ~40,000 more people for this to be a valid effort to form/join a legal union?[0]https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/02/google-employee-growth-2001-...[1]https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/how-to-form-a..."</p>

XMPP is much more mature, and works very well for chat, but doesn&#39;t have a nice package that does all the Slack stuff--at least not that I&#39;m aware of. I&#39;d love to be proven wrong there.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Back when I worked at Marvell Semiconductor (circa 2005), we made laser printer ASICs for HP. We did a lot of dithering in hardware. We had a hardware block that did error diffusion, we had a hardware block that did regular diffusion. We also had a hardware block that did Blue Noise. I was responsible for implementing the firmware that drove those printers&#39; scan/copy path: scan an image in monochrome, run through the dither hardware to create the bit pattern fed to the laser engine.No one could explain to me how to use the blue noise block. I couldn&#39;t understand what the blue noise block was doing. This is the first article that explained, in terms I could understand, how blue noise dithering works.I can die happy. Thank you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is such a well-written article: it describes the impetus, it is researched, it has great examples both as code and as output, and it piques interest. In the late 1990&#39;s I contracted with an embedded software company to optimize a dithering algorithm for 8-bit MCUs that was used in most laser printers &amp; copiers, and this paper is a really good overview."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;ll plug a little innovation of my own: mixing ordered and error diffusion dithering. The idea behind it is actually pretty simple: technically all forms of dithering use a threshold map, we just don&#39;t tend to think of it when it&#39;s one flat threshold for the entire image. So there is nothing stopping us from decoupling the threshold map from the rest of the dithering algorithm, meaning it&#39;s trivial to combine error diffusion with more complex threshold maps:https://observablehq.com/@jobleonard/ordered-error-diffusion...(For the record, I picked a default example that highlighted a &#34;hybrid&#34; dither with a very dramatic difference from its &#34;parents&#34; instead of the prettiest result)Interestingly, and perhaps not surprisingly, a variable threshold map interacts with the error diffusion itself, making it amplify local contrast and recover some fine detail in shadows and highlights (although also possibly overdoing it and crushing the image again).What&#39;s also somewhat interesting (to me at least) that this is really simple to implement: take any error diffusion dithering kernel and make it use the threshold map from ordered dithering. In principle it should have been possible to use them on any old hardware that can handle error diffusion dithering."</p>

Why do we need faces? It just distracts from the content. I love the idea of being able to link former colleagues together - that&#39;s neat - but I&#39;m very anti-face and  there are any number of ways to do it that does not involve people&#39;s pictures.Edit: Wow this got a lot of upvotes. So, I&#39;ll continue for a sec: There is so, so much conscious and unconscious judgment and game playing with pictures, I don&#39;t even know where to start. Let&#39;s leave this to be simple, clean and beautiful without the faces."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tech recruiter here.Pros:+ Very beautifully designed project+ Super readabilityBig, easy to fix negative:Force people to add months to the years! You only asks the year when someone started in &#34;Work Experience&#34;. If I read &#34;2012-2013&#34; I can&#39;t tell if someone has been at a place ~12 months or ~1 month. This information is very important.Also, please calculate the durations to allow readers to grasp tenure faster. Sometimes people need to skim through 200 CVs per day, so every inch of improvement is a big deal. Check how Linkedin does it: &#34;May 2012 - June 2012, 1 year 1 month&#34;Here a video where I improve some CVs, maybe that helps to make the product better: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haQ4rtEjhJQ"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a good start, but I&#39;m not a huge fan of this the way it is now.First, the font is tiny for my old eyes.  Not all of us, especially hiring managers, are still in their 20s and can read these tiny fonts. I measured it with a ruler and the text is 1mm tall.  Also, the font is gray on white, which is pretty but hard to read. In contrast, Linkedin is three times bigger and black on white, much easier to read.Second, after looking at the example, I have almost no idea what you&#39;ve done.  All I see are job titles.  I don&#39;t see any accomplishments or even job duties.  It looks like I could add those things when I create my own profile, but having them missing on the example isn&#39;t a good look.Third, the face circles.  I see face circles under each job, but they aren&#39;t clickable nor are there tooltips.  I have no idea what those are.  I assume they&#39;re other people who worked at the same place?  Maybe connections of yours who have worked at the same place?  That&#39;s a cool idea, but it needs to be more discoverable.  At the very least a tooltip would be good.Overall, when I&#39;m looking at a professional profile, I&#39;m usually doing it because I want to hire or work with someone.  The main information I want to know is 1) Do we have anyone in common I can ask about you?  2) What did you accomplish at your previous workplaces or otherwise?  3) Have you worked anywhere that I recognize and when, so I can ask my other friends who worked there if they know you?The face circles accomplish #1, so that&#39;s great.  #2 looks possible, but the design seems to minimize the accomplishments, as opposed to Linkedin which sort of puts it in your face.  And #3 seems to be covered but again the design minimizes the information I want most.I would say a good place to start would be asking yourself, &#34;Why does Linkedin look the way it does?&#34;.  A lot of their design comes from customer feedback, and their main customers are recruiters and hiring managers.  Steal their good stuff and leave their dark patterns behind."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have many fond memories of my first real job as sysadmin/render wrangler for a small animation company about fifteen years ago.Cores and memory were indeed what mattered, and as long as frames could be fitted into memory then the machine was left to render the frame and then save it back out to shared disk. There was no virtualization, just raw compute hardware running at full capacity 24/7. The scene was already split into different layers and rendered as sequences of frames that were then composited into final products.First job, first mini-datacenter in a new building, and there I am asking contractors to knock a hole in the building to fit air handlers due to the heat we were expecting to generate. Was great fun.It taught me a lot about automated systems management."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh man, I wanted this to contain much more details :(Whats the hardware? How much electric energy goes into rendering a frame or a whole movie? How do they provision it (as they keep #cores fixed)? They only talk about cores, do they even use GPUs? What&#39;s running on the machines? What did they optimize lately?So many questions! Maybe someone from Pixar&#39;s systems department is reading this :)?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some ideas on this topic:1. Inconvenience based solutions don&#39;t address the problem: using apps to restrict phone use, physically hiding the phone etc. Once you leave those carefully constrained conditions, you are more vulnerable than ever. Not to mention the contradiction with the core issue that it&#39;s a symptom rather than a cause.2. Turning abstinence as an ongoing status condition (e.g. &#34;X days since I did Y&#34;) is a trap. It sets you up for later failure by burdening you with a perpetually unfinished objective with psychological consequences that only increase as the &#39;highscore&#39; increases. This could work with things that are less easily accessible like heroin, but it&#39;s not going to work with something as easily accessible as a phone or computer.3. The solution that works with 1 and 2 is probably urge surfing as it tackles the issue directly4. It&#39;s easier to think of it as an addiction to browsing rather than an addiction to the phone itself. You have to catch yourself during any browsing moment in any context to eventually make progress. Be intentional in almost every action instead of going on auto-pilot, although obviously resting at the end of the day is fine. It&#39;s more a general philosophy than a hard rule meant to exhaust you.5. The eventual goal is a rich life where you no longer feel the need to distract yourself"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The paper they are basing the opening sentence &#34;phone addiction is one of the biggest non-drug addiction(sic) in human history&#34; on is written by a Doctor of Business Administration, a dean that has &#34;particular industries of interest are banks and non-profit organizations&#34; in his bio and a third researcher with 2 publications total, including the article in question (published 2011).This may in no way weaken the point that some of the brightest minds of today are working on producing digital Skinner boxes, black on top, with humans as the rats, interfaced via phones.But basing an attempt at a strong argument about the addictive nature of cell-phones on an article with low relevance in scientific fields specializing in addiction could be described as suspect (most citations on g.scholar on the piece could be delineated as in the fields of business and management )."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I basically discourage addiction by making things “difficult” for myself on my phone:- Minimal web bookmarks (i.e. I have to type in most web sites I want to visit; this is just enough of an encumbrance that I won’t flip open things like Reddit every 30 seconds).- I never install apps meant for content consumption, I use their web sites.  (This is usually a better experience anyway, since the vast majority of them are somehow worse than their web sites, packed with ads/notifications/spying/crap that no one should want anyway.)- Certain web sites I refuse to use at all on mobile.  This gives me a much larger and more useful view anyway, and I can enforce sanity with a lot more plug-ins that way.- As of latest iOS, I shove most apps into the Library so they are not even on my home screen.  That way, they are straightforward to retrieve with a swipe-down search but not as easy as just tapping them open.  I find that I use them slightly less this way.- I turn off many notifications, since app-makers have long abused them anyway (as virtual ads, or designed in some way to suck people back into their apps for no reason; I drew the line when apps started outright lying about things, e.g. red dots implying messages that were not actually there, etc.).- I set it up so that my lock screen will not show most things without an extra step."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Judge Patricia Millett characterized the DOJ’s argument as giving the government the ability to “unilaterally decide to kill U.S. citizens,” according to coverage of the argument by Courthouse News Service. “Do you appreciate how extraordinary that proposition is?”“DOJ” in this case is the defense attorney. What a shit job. Regardless, the DOJ is not giving the USG the ability to kill US Persons with no judicial review. Judge Millett’s exasperation should be an example of how preposterous this is.The way this post is titled is misleading and is intended to flame."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can someone explain to me how the headline matches up with the content?&gt;The government sought to dismiss the case, invoking the state secrets privilege because Kareem sought discovery on whether he had been targeted, the process the government used to target him, and whether the United States had attempted to kill him. A federal judge agreed with the government.The involvement of state secrets is what is preventing discovery of whether or you were targeted by the government, not whether or not they are allowed to kill you. This seems very different from the government
 provably killing someone, and then claiming &#34;state secrets&#34; as a defense for being allowed to do it.True, it may not be provable that you were targeted if &#34;state secrets&#34; prevents evidence from coming to light, but this is orthogonal to whether or not killing you is legally allowed, which is what the headline is suggesting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The incidents described occurred in Idlib, Syria between June 2016 to August 2016. This was contemporaneous with the US effort to support the Syrian Kurds around Raqqa. But Idlib is quite far away.Secondly, Airwars.org does not show US strikes in that area and the US insists coalition forces in general did not have any air strikes at Idlib during the time in question.Finally, I do not find the title to be a fair summary of their argument for dismissal:&gt;Plaintiff lacks standing to pursue this suit.  Plaintiff alleges that he was in the vicinity of five near-misses in Syria—a nation with an ongoing civil war.  But he alleges no facts specifically linking the United States to those attacks.  The most he offers is an unsupported assertion that one attack involved a type of missile used by the United States, among other countries.  And he likewise fails to plausibly allege that any of these attacks, even if attributable to the United States, actually targeted him."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am one of the few people that inspects the source-code of extensions. It&#39;s easy to do, for Firefox for example, just right-click and save-as in the extensions site, then rename your extension to a .zip file and extract e.g:    addon.xpi --&gt; addon.zip

Then manually sift through the code looking for obvious malicious intent (or not so obvious malicious intent if the author is doing obfuscation). Note: obfuscation is a red flag! A simple scan for `https://` / &#39;http://&#39;  would usually yield interesting URLs where data is sent. I have actually spotted malicious addons in the wild this way and reported them to Mozilla. They were thankfully removed.Note: Obfuscation is NOT the same as minification, and I don&#39;t mean minification when using the word obfuscation!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been telling everyone who will listen[1][2][3] that as an extension developer, I&#39;d love to be able to guarantee through the Chrome App Store that an extension matches a git commit (or auditable build pipeline artifact) exactly.It wouldn&#39;t fix everything (for example, you could still put a payload in an innocent-looking dependency), but it would at least fix the blatant problem that a maintainer can add code when uploading an extension even if the extension itself is open source and therefore (appears to be) auditable.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23265699

								<p class="story__comment_others">"We need to talk about how difficult it is to monetize browser extensions. Most of these problems occur when a reputable extension gets sold to a less reputable owner, frequently for a relatively small amount of money (4-5 figures). Even very popular extensions have a hard time monetizing. Unfortunately, Chrome has recently made the situation worse by deprecating Chrome Web Store payments, and Firefox eliminated their paid extension store several years ago.If the only way to monetize an extension is to exploit its users for data, this kind of thing is going to keep happening. It&#39;s perfectly understandable how someone who is doing a lot of work for no pay will eventually get tired of it or have other priorities in life, which is what happened in this case. Perhaps we all need to stop taking it for granted that browser extensions ought to be free? Or maybe the browser vendors themselves can find ways of financially supporting extension authors. I feel that money is essential to both the problem and the solution.Of course, paid upfront software gets sold to new owners too. But if the software is paid upfront, the expectation is that the new owner will perhaps do a better job of maintaining and marketing the software, and that&#39;s why the new owner buys it. When the software is paid, the new owner has an opportunity to make money legitimately, without secretly exploiting the existing user base."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I still remember Craig Silverstein being asked what his biggest mistake at Google was and him answering &#34;Not pushing for ECC memory.&#34;Google&#39;s initial strategy (c. 2000) around this was to save a few bucks on hardware, get non-ECC memory, and then compensate for it in software.  It turns out this is a terrible idea, because if you can&#39;t count on memory being robust against cosmic rays, you also can&#39;t count on the software being stored in that memory being robust against cosmic rays.  And when you have thousands of machines with petabytes of RAM, those bitflips do happen.  Google wasted many man-years tracking down corrupted GFS files and index shards before they finally bit the bullet and just paid for ECC."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I beg this, every time this conversation comes up it’s the same answer “I don’t see a problem”.It’s so easy to chalk these kind of errors to other issues, a little corruption here, a running program goes bezerk there- could be a buggy program or a little accidental memory overwrite. Reboot will fix it.But I ran many thousands of physical machines, petabytes of RAM, I tracked memory flip errors and they were _common_; common even in: less dense memory, in thick metal enclosures surrounded by mesh. Where density and shielding impacts bitflips a lot.My own experience tracking bitflips across my fleet led me to buy a Xeon laptop with ECC memory (precision 5520) and it has (anecdotally) been significantly more reliable than my desktop."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who has had to read thousands of random game crash reports from all over the interwebs (you know when Windows says you might want to send that crash log?  like that), I totally agree.Of all the things to be worried about, like OS bugs, bad hardware configuration, etc. bad memory is one of those really troubling things.  You look at the code and say &#34;it&#39;s can&#39;t make it here, because this was set&#34; but when you can&#39;t trust your memory you can&#39;t trust anything.And as the timeline goes to infinity, you may also get one of these reports and be asked to fix it... good luck."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Apart from those benchmark games a lot of real world C is a lot less performant than people think it might be. I spent a fair amount of time reviewing C code in the last 5 years - and things that pop up in nearly every review are costly string operations. Linear counts due to the use of null terminated strings and extra allocations for substrings to attach null terminators, or just deep copies because ownership can’t be determined are far more common than exceptional. This happens because null terminated strings feel like idiomatic C to most people.Rust avoids those from the start by making slices idiomatic.Another thing I commonly see is the usage of suboptimal containers (like arrays with linear search) - just because it’s there’s no better alternative at hand (standard library doesn’t offer ones and dependency management is messy). Which also makes it less surprising that code in higher level languages might perform better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Once LLVM fixes some bugs with `noalias`, at which point Rust will begin using it again in more circumstances [1], I&#39;d expect to see Rust get even faster in these benchmarks, given that the Rust compiler knows much more about which pointers do/do-not alias than most other programming languages [2] and the myriad optimizations this knowledge allows.[1] https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54878#issuecomment-...[2] https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/aliasing.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Stepping back a bit, I feel the argument is analogous to how music is becoming more mainstream and generic, how casual gamers &#34;corrupt&#34; the art form of gaming, how clickbait and stupit stuff is overshadowing lovingly curated independent websites, eternal September etc.One answer to all these propositions is that the valuable stuff is still there, you just have an additional flood of mediocre boring predictable stuff. You can still find enough indie music and games and movies to spend all your free time on.Similarly, if you know where to look and whose papers to watch out for, you can read more interesting stuff. The existence of more bullshit makes the filtering somewhat more effort, but it&#39;s bearable.Most papers are never deeply read anyway, outside of the reviewers. Even citations don&#39;t mean someone really read the paper in depth.So, most medíocre, boring papers get ignored.It&#39;s an illusion to expect that every researcher can pump out multiple really interesting non-boring papers every year. So we pretend. We write, we cite, we present, overiflate, overpromise etc. It must look like there is steady hard noble work and toil. It&#39;s like a ritual. The scientists are writing all these papers so tax payers can sleep well that their money is paid for hard work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing to keep in mind is that some of the papers which reviewers consider very marginal turn out to be breakthroughs. For example Jim Allison, who later won the Nobel Prize:&#34;Allison was hoping to be published by one of the leading peer-reviewed research journals. But nobody at Cell or Nature or any of the A-list, peer-reviewed journals was willing to publish the findings of this junior academic from Smithville, Texas. “Finally, I ended up publishing the results in a new journal called The Journal of Immunology.” It wasn’t Science or the New England Journal of Medicine, but it was in print, and in the world.“At the end of the paper, I said, ‘This might be the cell antigen receptor, and here are the reasons why I think that it is the T-cell antigen receptor,’ and I just listed it out, all the reasons.” It was a bold announcement regarding the biggest topic in immunology. “And nobody noticed it,” Allison says. “Except in one lab.”&#34;https://www.wired.com/story/meet-jim-allison-the-texan-who-j...So you really need to publish the marginal stuff to make sure the breakthrough stuff gets published as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"But on the other hand, with a severe replication crisis in science (https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21504366/science-replicat...), isn&#39;t it a good thing that we have a bunch of boring papers that are close to stuff that&#39;s already happened? It&#39;s not people replicating others&#39; findings exactly, but it at least gives points of comparison that can help to weed out some of the problematic work out there."</p>

Older versions of Adobe Writer (maybe even the current one too?) would always append and never overwrite. So if you edited pages, it would add those edits to the bottom of the file. As long as you did everything in the Writer workflow and didn&#39;t Save As a new file, you could see a history of old edits.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a Python programmer with limited experience with compiled languages, Rust code was more intimidating to read or look at than C++, Java or Go. After only an hour, I am overwhelmed by the sheer beauty and mature design of this language - it almost reads like Python or as well as any compiled language can. I cannot believe that I am smitten by Rust within an hour. Its features seem, obvious. My experience with Go was frustrating since I felt like I had to give up elegance for practicality. I did not expect to learn 1-2% of Rust when I woke up today. My thanks to the author.I&#39;m curious what other what other developers who primarily use Python think of this article and Rust in general?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; There is a special lifetime, named &#39;static, which is valid for the entire program&#39;s lifetime.I&#39;ve heard this many times before, but as the guide[1] says:&#34;You might encounter it in two situations... Both are related but subtly different and this is a common source for confusion when learning Rust.&#34;&#39;static means different things for references and trait objects.ie.&#39;a: &#39;static --&gt; reference with lifetime &#39;a lives forever and can never be dropped.T: &#39;static --&gt; Type T has no references in it; it is effectively &#39;entirely owned&#39; by the owner of an instance of T.These are totally different things with the same name.(I believe technically there are actually three; `&lt;T: &#39;static &gt;` is a type constraint and `T + &#39;static` is a trait bound, but that both mean the same thing as far as I know)[1] - https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/scope/lifetime/sta..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Funny, I actually have an open Pinetime in front of me right now. I use it for my masters thesis and it&#39;s a really nice project. If you want to try out some embedded development (that you can actually show to friends who don&#39;t aren&#39;t developers), I think this is the perfect project."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d be the perfect target for the products of a company like Pine. A long-time geek who uses open-source software on nearly all of his devices, a tinkerer who doesn&#39;t mind recompiling a kernel or picking a solderer to make things work, and someone who seeks for absolute flexibility from his devices with zero corporate compromises.Unfortunately, the mediocre hardware used in their devices keeps holding me back.First came a phone with a 9-year-old A53 Cortex chipset. Then a tablet with the same outdated chipset. Then a laptop that ships with a Rockchip RK3399 with 4GB of RAM, in an era when 4GB barely suffice to run a browser with a few tabs. And now they are releasing a smartwatch with a 64 MHz core and 64 KB of RAM - some specs you would have expected from a very cheap smartwatch released 7-8 years ago.Why should I use a device whose hardware is almost a decade old at the time of purchase? And how do they even expect anyone to actually use these devices as their primary daily drivers, and not as proofs of concept, nice toys to tinker on every now and then or show off to friends?I understand that Pine wants to use 100% open hardware, and that comes with heavy compromises, but are these compromises worth it?If you ask even the geekest user out there whether they prefer a device whose source code is 100% pure and doesn&#39;t contain any binary blobs, or a device that doesn&#39;t start freezing/lagging after a couple of minutes of normal usage, I bet that anyone would opt for the latter."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ok, just to make sure I understand this correctly.- This is basically a commercial smartwach (the Colmi P8) that is based on a well documented SOC, the nordic nRF52832- The open source version comes with an enclosure that is not glued shut, so that it is easy to access testpoints on the pcb.- Development is done by accessing the nRF51 SWD interface with pogo pins or similar. The programming interface can be a standard SWD interface such as an STLink cloneOk, sounds easy enough. It should be possible to just buy one of those smartwatches and crack them open? But OTOH the developer version is not much more expensive.The main question is now: What software to run on it, that goes beyond a few experiments? Is there any kind of open source smartwatch OS that would run on this?Edit: Corrected typo, of course I meant SWD interface, not SWM. (SWM or rather SWIM is for STM8)"</p>

There is simply no good way to share a filesystem between Windows and Linux that is both 1. fast 2. fully correct - i.e doesn&#39;t break some code.SMB/NFS just never work super well because they are slow, or programs think they are local filesystems so things break (e.g VScode won&#39;t detect new files created on the linux side of a SMB mount without a manual refresh). Plenty of details on getting permissions right too. Not to mention extended attributes which differ slightly and break stuff. Network file systems in general are just too different to local FS&#39;s for programs to work seamlessly.The 2 non-ideal solutions I&#39;ve found are 1. keep all files in linux + edit over network using VSCode Remote or IntelliJ Remote support or 2. keep a copy of the dev workspace in windows, and use something like unison (or manual git) to sync."</p>

I created a script that takes in a Seek TIFF and outputs an 8-bit greyscale integer TIFF:https://github.com/dheera/iceland-thermal/blob/master/script...I then panoramically stitched those 8-bit TIFFs together (some with the help of hugin, and some manually with GIMP) and distortion-corrected them as best as I could to a black-and-white visible light image. I also created an artistically-chosen color map for each image. For the final output image, hue and saturation are fully based on thermal data, and lightness is a combination of thermal and visible data. Scripts to generate the final output images, along with the panoramically pre-stitched data, and the color maps I used:https://github.com/dheera/iceland-thermalAlso, my Instagram, which is mostly astrophotography of late, but I did post thermal images there before and I may do so in the future again if I can find another good set of interesting thermal subjects to do this in!https://instagram.com/dheeranet/"</p>

But what&#39;s really weird is it seems to not be available anymore. I&#39;m guessing export restrictions or massive demand for thermal cameras during Covid along with supply chain issues. IIRC it is also 25 frames a second, which is unusually high for thermal cameras due to export restrictions.Edit: Here&#39;s a post on creating panoramic images with therm-app. https://www.flickr.com/groups/therm-app-users/discuss/721576..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The new edition has been split in two parts. The pdf draft (921 pages) and python code [1] of the first part are now available. The table of contents of the second part is here [2].From the preface:&#34;By Spring 2020, my draft of the second edition had swollen to about 1600 pages, and I was still not
done. At this point, 3 major events happened. First, the COVID-19 pandemic struck, so I decided
to “pivot” so I could spend most of my time on COVID-19 modeling. Second, MIT Press told me
they could not publish a 1600 page book, and that I would need to split it into two volumes. Third,
I decided to recruit several colleagues to help me finish the last ∼ 15% of “missing content”. (See
acknowledgements below.)The result is two new books, “Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction”, which you are
currently reading, and “Probabilistic Machine Learning: Advanced Topics”, which is the sequel to
this book [Mur22].Together these two books attempt to present a fairly broad coverage of the field
of ML c. 2020, using the same unifying lens of probabilistic modeling and Bayesian decision theory
that I used in the first book.
Most of the content from the first book has been reused, but it is now split fairly evenly between
the two new books. In addition, each book has lots of new material, covering some topics from deep
learning, but also advances in other parts of the field, such as generative models, variational inference
and reinforcement learning. To make the book more self-contained and useful for students, I have
also added some more background content, on topics such as optimization and linear algebra, that
was omitted from the first book due to lack of space.Another major change is that nearly all of the software now uses Python instead of Matlab.&#34;[1] https://github.com/probml/pyprobml[2] https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book2.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is probably my favorite introductory machine learning book. The fact that he places almost everything in the language of graphical models is such a good common ground to build off.This really sets you up to realize that there is (and should be) a lot more to doing a good job in machine learning than simply minimizing an objective function. The answers you get depend on the model you create as do the questions you can hope to answer.I don&#39;t see a clear list of differences between this new edition. Does anyone know what&#39;s new?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For anybody truly serious about this field, I recommend the below book. It has some poor reviews on Amazon, which I was shocked to see, but it is my favourite book and taught me the core of probability theory and statistics, in a way most books don’t. Your understanding of Machine Learning will be better than 90% of those out there, if you can get through the principles in this book.I topped statistics at the most prestigious university in my country both at the undergrad and postgrad level, and had no problem discussing advanced concepts with Senior PHDs in Quantitative Fields, and I thank this book the most for beginning my journey on this. But, and this is important, make sure to do all the exercises!https://www.amazon.com/John-Freunds-Mathematical-Statistics-..."</p>

Working for a company that is publicly known enough for people on HN (and Reddit) to comment about it. It has been hilarious and scary to read comments from people who don&#39;t work at the company say completely inaccurate things like they are facts.In this case, it&#39;s easy for me to recognize they are wrong. But what about other topics (or companies) I don&#39;t know much about? I have no easy way of recognizing inaccuracies so I default to mostly accepting them. Sadly, you need to be skeptical of almost everything you read even when the person sounds like they know the subject matter."</p>

Be it metalwork, mountain biking, computing, drones or any other hobby regularly discussed online.The reality is you can make do with in so many different ways that if you can&#39;t afford the best you can still have oodles of fun on cheaper equipment. Half the fun is learning all this &#34;expertise&#34; the internet has on your own.Can&#39;t afford a Bridgeport mill? Buy something cheaper and work around the edge cases. Can&#39;t afford a full suspension bike? Get a hardtail and have tonnes of fun.Someone is always quick to add in the caveats, but guess what, a new rider doesn&#39;t give a shit that he can&#39;t send 8ft drops on his hard tail. There are hours of fun on the bike ahead, none of it sending 8ft drops.

They are not normal people from a statical standpoint.On average a person does not do any one spicific thing.Everyone online has contributed to the internet, everyone has written something and everyone has excersised.I&#39;ve seen this brought up before that only 2-3% of redditors contribute, like it&#39;s a bad thing or a unique thing.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"KDE on Linux used to have something similar in the late 90s - it allowed you to open a website URL as a directory listing, so you could browse the site&#39;s asset directories and open image files, etc. Think like a client-side generated version of Apache&#39;s index pages, but using your local file manager. It was a plugin to the VFS framework (KIO) the desktop and all the apps use, so it would also work e.g. in Open File dialogs from anywhere within the toolset.I remember using this regularly to mass-download the images embedded into a page - open the page this way by replacing http:// with a pseudo-protocol, copy all, paste, done.KDE always came with a lot of VFS trickery like that. Ripping a music CD into MP3s was similar - you&#39;d open the volume in the file manager and see your tracks along with a virtual folder full of MP3 files. The rip and encoding would happen on the fly, and you could do this e.g. straight from the file attach feature in an instant messenger.Desktop Linux was a lot less friendly to get working smoothly back then compared to now, and feature discovery was by word of mouth more than anything, but it sure felt like living in the future early."</p>

The one thing that&#39;s frustrated me is the relative black box that my browser represents, and writing a shim between my WM and browser tabs has been on my TODO list for a long, long time (through a couple of aborted attempts due to a combination of Chrome&#39;s at-the-time obsolete documentation and probably-necessary security model).I&#39;m cautiously optimistic that this is going to represent a dramatic step function in ease-of-use of my OS, in the same way that i3 was.EDIT: I should clarify that I did read the author&#39;s note that this is experimental, not secure, etc. I&#39;m mainly just excited about having a jumping-off point to play around with and possibly hack on a little."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a brilliant piece of work. As someone who has thousands of tabs open, I&#39;ve always wanted to &#34;close all tabs with a single command&#34;, or view all the open tabs and mass select them and close, for years. Otherwise, going through them one by one and deleting takes forever. Now somebody make a vim pluggin so I can delete tabs by visual selecting a bunch of them and typing &#34;d&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is undeniably a good thing if you put yourself in the shoes of the restaurant.Imagine if someone went around impersonating your business online, leveraging the good name you have built for yourself over the decades. They create ads offering your expert development services, ostensibly competing with your existing website, but with intentionally slashed pricing and a ‘creatively’ misrepresented offering (aka growth hacking). Then they subcontract the job to some crappy outsourcing firm that bungles it, but who cares, they got their cut and you signed the TOS.Now bad reviews are piling up online about the bad experiences people had with your business, your reputation is destroyed, and your business is next.I know it’s not a perfect analogy but try to empathize with the restaurants here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it would have been much better to outlaw misrepresentation and advertising without prior agreement (ie the pizza place that did not agree to partnership should only pop up in the search results if the user searches for it) and there should be a warning mandated like &#34;Startup Inc is not affiliated with the Moms and Pops Pizza. If you proceed, we will place your order by calling PHONE_NUMBER and pick up your order from ADDRESS&#34;. It should still be legal for the end users to have a service do chores for them including picking up food but only if there is no confusion on the side of the user what is happening here (incl. the fact the pizza may get cold through a no  fault of Moms and Pops Pizza).Edit: oh, the law would also outlaw food picking apps from delivering from Walmart too (&#34;The code defines food facility [...] as an operation that stores, [...] or otherwise provides food [...] at the retail level.&#34;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There was a post a few months go about a pizza place that started getting customers complaining about their food arriving cold and damaged: except they didn&#39;t offer delivery. They discovered that a popular search engine was offering free delivery. The story ended with them ordering dozens of pizzas from themselves to themselves and making a nice profit."</p>

I have used Petri nets to build my own workflow engine previously.  Building a workflow engine is one of those things... nearly every enterprise app has one, and normally you shouldn’t need to build one if you can source one... but it is an exercise that makes you a stronger engineer/developer too, deepening understanding of the patterns that lie beneath most systems.Back when I was building, openly available workflow engines, BPML, BPEL etc. were not really a thing yet, so it made a little more sense to be building one.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_net"</p>

All the people playing video games have mastered skills that aren’t being taken full advantage of. Anyways, coroutines in Unity can be used to do interesting things over time while attached to the game loop.My point, despite my digression, is just how there are still basic/intermediate topics I have only been able to appreciate recently.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Posting anonymously for obvious reasons.Unlike others, I actually find this story fairly believable.When I first joined Apple, straight out of college - a good program, top three in the country - I was abused similarly. I joined a team that was on a project behind schedule.Our manager was a brusque, no-nonsense sort of dude. But he clearly had anger problems. On the team were 2 senior engineers, me, and a junior engineer that had just completed his internship and was on a work Visa.As the project got closer to the deadline, and the scope increased, the manager got agitated. In our team meetings, he would start yelling at us. People down the hallways would stare at us with those &#34;looks.&#34; In our 1:1s he told us we might not have a job if our product doesn&#39;t ship on time (we were competing with another internal team to beat them to the punch.)The two senior engineers decided they&#39;d had enough and quit the team. The manager told us to work overtime (no overtime pay, but we had to for fear of our job). He promised us that if we did it that we would get a month of vacation on him, and that he could secure it for us.The product released. After countless nights of overtime we did it. Our manager left, our guarantee of a month of vacation evaporated, and for the next three months, us two junior engineers were left on 24/7 primary/secondary on-call for a critical service. It was a nightmare. Calls at 3 AM, 6 AM, on weekends.Our manager got a promotion and is fairly high up at Apple now.Horrible experience. I left for a new company that pays me nearly double."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I dont quite remember the meeting room names in Mathilda 3 over at the Apple on Mathilda Ave, but if the MA03 (in the screenshot) refers to &#34;Mathilda 3&#34;, then this story is totally believable.I worked at Apple and it was absolutely horrible. I remember sitting on the train and actually thinking about killing myself. Reasons were many, but mostly I just didn&#39;t fit in there, I think.I felt like people there were also a bunch of whiny little bitches to be honest. Always having some problem with a hand or a back or some family problem or whatever which demanded that they take days off. There were a few people whom I felt were probably talking some shit behind my back, but I couldn&#39;t really believe it until I read this story. It was just a horrible horrible place and I can also recognize that thing about having a predecessor, who was apparently a &#34;bad person&#34; and thus had to be terminated.Every other day I would have people telling me how great a place it was and how lucky we were to be working in a place so big while still having that startup feeling. I have worked at startups and I always just imagined to myself that 40 year old &#34;dude&#34; who refuses to grow up. That is Apple..Never again.I got dragged through the whole white boarding experience also for the first time and it was fun enough, but in hindsight, they should just have asked me if I would suck Steve Jobs dick, if he came in that door. The answer to that question alone would have provided them with enough information about whether I would have been a good hire or not.I am 45 and have never every experienced a work place like that. Always had positive feedback and never had any problems with colleagues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is awful. I&#39;m sorry that happened to you. However,  If Apple refuse to take actions, I will interview with major media outlets describing the experience in more details and I will release a list of all individuals involved from senior management to the HR director and all the evidence as public record.

You&#39;re wasting your time if you think they&#39;re going to do anything with this kind of approach. Get a lawyer first before thinking on doing any of that, though.And let this be a reminder to everyone else that HR isn&#39;t there to help you - it&#39;s there to help the company.In this kind of environment it almost feels like one needs to record everything that&#39;s happening in order to defend themselves. Cops use cameras, maybe it&#39;s time for employees to start wearing them too. Maybe."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A fun anecdote from my youth near a US seaboard was that our elementary and middle school buildings were designed by the same person who designed a few prisons around the area.When I bounced around cities later in life, I was surprised at how many of my peers said the same thing as a conversation piece.Maybe they used the same governmental bidding process. &#34;Needed: a building. One food preparation and eating area. Hallways suitable for lining up and proceeding in rows with many small rooms. One yard with sporting facilities.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who&#39;s been to prison and school, lots of comments here sound pretty tone deaf. Prison in the USA is really bad. Yes school is authoritarian, but most popular entertainment on prisons downplays how bad it really gets. Watch some interviews of people who have actually been to prison. Murder and rape is common (I saw it happen), you will get your possessions stolen under the threat of murder/rape, you&#39;ll probably spend 10-30% of your time in solitary confinement for reasons outside your control (torture according to human rights groups: I&#39;ve been there, I&#39;d prefer nonpermanent torture), you have to learn violence and get into fights with people who might be carrying a knife or else get taken advantage of indefinitely, ... It&#39;s bad. And psychologically, you have no freedom whatsoever: no you cannot poop or drink water whenever you want to. You can only poop when your cellie isn&#39;t around (1-2h/day). You will be abused by prison staff (false accusations, physical abuse, food deprivation, ..)The whole thing is an abomination. It serves no useful purpose to society to subject most criminals to prison: it doesn&#39;t serve as a deterrent (based on talking to ~50 prisoners about this), it only radicalizes them further against &#34;the system&#34;, making it easier for them to break further laws.Why don&#39;t we have more outrage against this outdated institution created out of 1600 era values?The amount of human suffering it creates... It&#39;s astounding. Most prisoners would probably rather a super old school punishment like chopping off their arm over the prison sentence they get. And it would be more effective."</p>

They routinely fail to catch harmful junk—I&#39;ve shut down a few top-grossing bogus antivirus apps for Mac, and the publisher of Untitled Goose Game routinely posts screenshots of clones that are trying to make money off confused users.They&#39;ve banned apps like Phone Story and a drone strike tracker for being &#34;objectionable and crude,&#34; yet they don&#39;t apply any content moderation to the Book Store or to Music or TV (or to Safari for that matter).

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I thought I should look at the App Store and see what this app is doing in comparison to similar apps.The logo is basically a big pill and the tagline &#34;Powerful keep-awake utility&#34; which is clearly alluding to the drug. https://imgur.com/a/RJXHaBaThis was consistent with the feedback the author received: &#34;[the] app appears to promote inappropriate use of controlled substances. Specifically, your app name and icon include references to controlled substances, pills&#34;Almost all of the other top apps in the app store in the same category use some reference to caffeine either in the name or tagline or description (e.g. &#34;Jolt of Caffeine&#34; or &#34;Owly&#34; which has a logo of an owl in a cup of coffee) https://imgur.com/a/yySBqELThere&#39;s one other, much less popular app called &#34;Coca&#34; which appears to reference cocaine, but doesn&#39;t also have a drug-referencing icon or tagline, and which only has 15 reviews. By comparison, Amphetamine seems to be the most popular result, at least for the search term &#34;awake&#34;, with 1.37K reviewsThe guideline in question doesn&#39;t seem to consider excessive use of caffeine as problematic to encourage. &#34;1.4.3 Apps that encourage consumption of tobacco and vape products, illegal drugs, or excessive amounts of alcohol are not permitted on the App Store. Apps that encourage minors to consume any of these substances will be rejected. Facilitating the sale of marijuana, tobacco, or controlled substances (except for licensed pharmacies) isn’t allowed.&#34;Overall, Amphetamine did seem to be pushing the drug-use angle much harder than other apps in the category based on the logo, tagline and title, especially if you consider caffeine abuse not problematic.Added: I don&#39;t have a strong opinion on this one either way, other than edgy naming has pros and cons. Word of mouth is easier, but sometimes a problem like this happens."</p>

I took 2 years to build it, and in this timeframe people started building sematic websites with CSS, and abandoning table-based designs.
I managed to sell 100 copies, for some reason 90% to India.
After some years without selling nothing, I open sourced it: https://github.com/RangelReale/htmlbutcher.
The good thing is that I REALLY learned C++ with this project, and this knowledge was the basis for my current company where I made a digitalsignage application in C++ that runs in some of the largest DOOH places in Brazil, in Windows, Linux and MAC (targets of HTMLButcher).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The tweet mentions that you could &#39;just&#39; send an SWF file to someone and it played. Well, if anybody had to fix a computer, or hosted anything Flash-based during that era, then they would know that&#39;s bullshit. Sure maybe with the standalone Flash player it worked allright, but that&#39;s not how people really used Flash. Even in my experience, a single SWF running locally didn&#39;t always work across all versions of Flash player.Flash on the web only worked if you had Flash player plugin installed. Both browser and Flash updates themselves would break the Flash plugin constantly. That was across all browsers and platforms. Keeping plugins updated and reliable was a mess, for a long time there weren&#39;t even auto updates.Flash was a mess the whole time. Let&#39;s not pretend that it ever really &#34;just worked&#34; because it didn&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is true but it is a common misunderstanding imo. Nobody is arguing a tool like Flash shouldn’t exist; it should. People are arguing a runtime like Flash shouldn’t exist, and that HTML5 has all of the components that are needed to be that runtime and then some. A tool should give us what Flash did but with the HTML runtime.So why doesn’t that tool exist?Well... as far as I know it does. I’m pretty sure this is exactly what Adobe Animate is meant to be:https://www.adobe.com/products/animate.htmlSo why isn’t it causing a Flash-style revolution?In my opinion... Because of YouTube. Twitter. Etc.Before everyone had heaps of bandwidth, you needed to consume smaller files. A full 1080p video was unfathomable with the codecs, compute and network bandwidth available in the early 2000s. Swf files however were small and easy to distribute. The perfect storm occurred due to the structure of early internet, and communities like Newgrounds flourished.I honestly think Flash just got a bit stale. It stopped being new and exciting, and for animations video sites were probably going to win out anyways. For games, a lot of indie devs now target PCs and game consoles. Unity and Construct export to HTML5. People wanted to do more advanced things to the point where Flash itself started doing things like 3D rendering, at which point the appealing aspects of Flash started to make less sense anyways.Many seem to argue passionately, probably from an emotional place, that Flash was killed. Honestly, I just don’t agree. Flash was dying either way. Everyone just gradually decided to cut off the life support.The era it ushered in will be missed, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve come across a lot of similar sentiment from ex-Flash devs, who romanticise its heyday as a period of fertile creativity (true) and say that HTML5/JS/CSS/SVG is an inadequate replacement (false).In truth, the fundamental capabilities of the modern web platform matches and typically exceeds anything that was offered by Flash. What these people are really lamenting is the ease of authorship that Flash provided to non-technical users.Macromedia/Adobe provided a suite of powerful tools for authoring Flash animations and applications. There is no free equivalent available targeting HTML/JS. This is not a problem of capability in the platform technologies. It is because there is no economic incentive to make and give away such tools. What equivalents do exist in this sector cost money.When it comes to Flash, the old adage, &#34;if you&#39;re not paying for the product, you are the product&#34; holds true. The Flash authorship tools were free because 3rd party authors creating Flash content were assisting in the promulgation of a proprietary platform that was gradually replacing open web standards. Had they succeeded, Macromedia/Adobe would inevitably have looked to squeeze and monetise their domination of the web.Programmers are often accused of not understanding what Flash offered to artists. Maybe that&#39;s true, but I&#39;ve not encountered many artists who conversely understand the above."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a *nix sysadmin since before Google was a thing, I find articles like this frustrating and arguably dangerous.They lay out a set of &#34;rules&#34; the author has collated as a dogmatic doctrine that only a fool would not follow. But they provide no &#34;why&#34;, take absolutely no context in to account, and talk only about their perceived upsides.Anyone reading this should take each point as &#34;here&#39;s a possible thing you should go and research yourself&#34;, because there are consequences to most of these rules.I&#39;m not saying anything they&#39;ve written is wrong (though there is a lot of unsubstantiated opinion there), just that you should learn what any of these changes truly do before implementing them AND that your particular context is really important.Edit:There is a disclaimer at the top which mustn&#39;t be forgotten while reading.&gt; DISCLAIMER: Do not attempt to apply anything in this article if you do not know exactly what you are doing. This guide is focused purely on security and privacy, not performance, usability, or anything else.I do appreciate people putting work into producing this sort of content, but I think the article could be improved by phrasing the various steps as suggestions and perhaps linking out to more detailed documentation on the &#34;why&#34; elsewhere."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some omissions IMO: never let people SSH in with a password, and for the love of god, stop leaving private SSH keys on servers. Privat SSH keys should never leave your physical proximity. They should be on your laptop, or desktop, or your yubikey, but never on servers. Also SSH agent forwarding is the devil. Don&#39;t do it.Lots of really braindead advice in there too, like disabling RDRAND because there might be a backdoor.. come on.. even Linus knows that&#39;s obvious bullshit.[1][1] https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/09/11/rudest-man-in-li..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This list is cool, but I think it would be more useful with some quick notes on side effects. I think all but the most hardcore Linux lovers won&#39;t have enough breadth and depth to understand the full ramifications of many of these config changes.I&#39;m no Linux expert but even having used it for a fair number of years, I only have a shallow understanding of most of the things that are tweaked here, if I&#39;ve even heard of them at all. For example, it says &#34;kernel.kexec_load_disabled=1&#34;, and points out the threat which I can understand, but I don&#39;t know what that&#39;s used for in the first place. Perhaps it isn&#39;t really ever used for anything, but it&#39;d be nice to be told that, because my initial line of thinking is that these defaults must be defaults for a reason and that makes me hesitant to actually make any of the changes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To me, what sucks about JIRA (and would suck about any well-designed tool that replaces it) is not &#34;feature x&#34; but the entire JIRA mentality. All of it.It encourages micro-management. It encourages more and more process. It is the enemy of getting better at the DORA metrics, which requires streamlining process.tickets in JIRA are not the work itself, never was and never will be, it is a LARP of the work, but it gets taken for the central thing. This is an illusion.  Fixing a bug without filing a JIRA ticket is in itself progress. Moving a JIRA card without any other change is not. Yet the second is what&#39;s visible and therefor what&#39;s rewarded.Any problem gets solved with &#34;more JIRA &#34; which stops working when the remaining problems are caused by too much JIRA. And yet they keep trying, because it gives &#34;control&#34;. JIRA is a like metastatic tumour that will grow until it kills the host.In case the cancer metaphor didn&#39;t make it very clear, I don&#39;t like JIRA much. Yet if JIRA were to die today, the middle management who live by JIRA would replace it with something else equally bad, if not worse.Filling in missing features won&#39;t and can&#39;t fix that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a hundred small issues with Jira, but there&#39;s one huge one:  It&#39;s slow. Really, really slow.Atlassian seems to make a lot of money, so I guess they&#39;re optimising for something that matters to someone, but from my point of view I have a simple process for evaluating tools:1) Can I use it at all? 2) How many of the features I want does it have?I&#39;m pretty sure Jira would score great on the second question, but since it hard fails the first, I&#39;ll never know. And it&#39;s been slow for so many years now, I assume they have no interest or ability to fix it. And their slow drift towards cloud installs over letting people self host isn&#39;t helping them either since, embarrassingly, their cloud instances seem to be even slower.(Incidentally, there&#39;s a lot of competition in that space, but I&#39;ve been pretty happy with Clubhouse. I wouldn&#39;t mind a few more features, but it&#39;s good enough. More importantly, the UI is clean and snappy, and that hides a multitude of sins.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every bullet point says &#34;Missing...&#34;, but I feel like the main issue about Jira is that it has waaay to many features, and that it&#39;s super slow!The only bullet point I do agree with, is that Jira is missing an easy (or IMHO a minimalist / simple) interface. The tool is a mess, and the people using it are probably also using it in the wrong way, making the whole situation way worse.Don&#39;t get me wrong, I like Jira to some extent, but its performance and messy UI are really making my life harder rather than simpler."</p>

(and that&#39;s only if you&#39;re considering software)  when you think about it, it&#39;s staggering.i suspect we&#39;ll be seeing a lot more attention on reproducible and cryptographically secure build environments, similar to the gitian stuff in bitcoin land."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I agree with most of the points raised by the author but as a Venezuelan Bitcoin is a godsend. If you live abroad and want to send remittances to your friends and family it can be pretty easy in a normal country , with wire transfers,western union and so on. If your family lives in Venezuela your options are extremely more limited.These are some of the options Venezuelans have had to use:1. Ask the money to be sent to Colombia with WU and then travel hundreds of kms to get  what usually amounts to a few hundred dollars at most.2. Use Zelle, send dollars in the US, and receive Bolivares in Venezuela. But for that you need to have an US bank account, and find a person you can trust also with an US bank account and plenty of highly volatile Bolivares in Venezuela willing to make the exchange.3. Use paypal, same as above with way higher commissions and the risk that paypal (and the other person) will fuck you.4. Buy Amazon gift cards and use the same schema above, be exposed to scams and high commisions fees.Trading bitcoins in say localbitcoins.com, you have a very liquid market and somewhat secure transactions (Bitcoins are not liberated until you check the money is in the Venezuela account). There are risks of course, especially because of BTC volatility but at least is a fast,convenient,widespread option. I wish something like that, only more stable and with less of that Tulip-craze whiff BTC has."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bought my smartphone from Hong Kong, in part because I wanted a specific variant that would be more likely to work with open-source ROM&#39;s.The seller initially requested payment via Transferwise, who sought crazy amounts of personal information and bullied me into a privacy-hostile customer agreement.  Days went by and they still hadn&#39;t activated my account.Growing frustrated, I convinced the seller to accept Bitcoin, which was comparatively instant.  The phone arrived a few days later, meanwhile the Transferwise morons still had their heads up their arses with no movement and no good explanation.  I&#39;m not a financial risk; I&#39;m a good little citizen with no red flags.  Reading between the lines my sense was their staff were overloaded or their onboarding system was simply broken.Bitcoin was incredibly helpful for me that day, and my favorite feature about the phone is the way I paid.  In addition to a great story, I&#39;ve got to admit there was something liberating and empowering about giving what felt like a big middle finger to the slow, decrepit, old-fashioned institution who couldn&#39;t even deliver on their core business proposition.  Like saying &#34;screw you, I don&#39;t need you and your crappy service anymore, come back when you can compete on merits&#34;.Whatever else you criticize about Bitcoin, it&#39;s still &#34;cash you can email&#34;, and even if that&#39;s all it ever amounts to I still find it a bloody useful innovation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have no idea what he is talking about.I use bitcoin to buy things both onchain and via lightning and the experience is so smooth and much much better than the circa 2017 period when fees were high. Don&#39;t keep it on exchange. The real thing that is stopping adoption is countries trying to classify it as a commodity and insist to pay capital gains on every microtransaction. Some countries are backwards (US, UK) than the others. Germany and few other countries are forward looking. No VAT on bitcoin transactions and no CGT if held for a year."</p>

In Switzerland a law that would have changed this was recently rejected. Hopefully another country makes the first step."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Recently, Apple&#39;s supplier, Wistron faced revolt after treating workers unfairly here in India. And India is not really the most shining example of protecting our workers from unfair and harsh working conditions. So, if such treatments don&#39;t fly here, I don&#39;t think they will fly anywhere else. The kind of labor expectation that these companies have after their stints in China is ethically incompatible with most other countries. So, I can&#39;t see the condition improving in the near future, companies will continue chasing profits at all cost and China will remain the most fertile ground to do that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Traditionally slavery was an alternative to death for the conquered.  I&#39;m morbidly curious what the effects of all Western corporations banning slave labor would be.  I doubt it would result in liberation.  Would working conditions for the slaves worsen when they worked for local, lower-margin factories instead?  I can&#39;t imagine them improving.I have little faith in legal remedies to liberate slaves.  Arming them seems the only long-term effective solution.  Otherwise the man with the gun will order the slave back to work the second the man in the wig isn&#39;t looking.  And the man in the wig will remain silent, to avoid revealing his impotence.Slave labor is inefficient, so perhaps the best way is to topple inefficient slave societies through full-spectrum competition, from military to economic.  This pressure incentivizes efficient human resource utilization.One thing&#39;s for sure:  Individual Westerner guilt over whether to buy the next iPhone will add zero value."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the biggest problems in science (in general) is that your reputation and therefore funding is highly tied to a particular subfield.  Everyone in a subfield knows each other and gives positive grant reviews and external tenure letters to other practitioners.  If you try to move on to new areas of research, your reputation and funding are gone.  The outcome is that areas of research interest become quasi-permanent, even when they are no longer interesting. I talk to the people today that still work in my specialty of nuclear physics (relativistic heavy ion physics) and I&#39;m shocked at how little intellectual progress has been made.  At the risk of offending people it&#39;s time to give up and declare victory, but the consequences would be dire (hundreds of professors all over the world without grants)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In computer science, researchers who had spent decades working on feature engineering for images got completely blown out of the water by deep learning.  All those decades of papers would never get another cite.  Everyone moved on.String theory doesn&#39;t actually do anything though, so there&#39;s no way to say it&#39;s better or worse than anything else.  It&#39;s like someone saying they&#39;re working on solving the halting problem or something and eventually they&#39;ll get there and they&#39;ve been working on it for 20 years without any code that actually works.  At some point, you just have to give up and do something else.  They keep getting grants to work on this stuff though for some reason.  Someone needs to interview the people who are giving out string theory grants and ask them why the heck they are still giving these people money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"1. Don&#39;t try too hard to make science funding more efficient / market lead or whatever - just fund more - double the science budget tomorrow And again every five years for a generation.  We are about to go through a societal refactoring with solar / electric / digital / climate change hitting at once.  Spending a few quid to help out the fundamentals won&#39;t hurt anyone.2. The above might upset people but string theory is a good example - partly yes people are held hostage by funding (much like it&#39;s hard to avoid being typecast as an actor).  But the solution to that is to fund lots more (experimental) movies, not to hope studio heads can pick better winners.I am perfectly happy for a slice of my tax dollar to go on someone thinking about Pram theory (#) for a decade simply because we have no idea whatsoever how to tackle the big ones in physics, so spray and pray is going to be a lot better than most other options.(#) Red Dwarf episode. worth watching episode just for this joke."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting shift in strategy. Instead of giving the second dose within a few weeks of the first they’re going to allow up to 12 weeks between doses. Allows them to get more widespread level of some protection with dose 1 before later boosting protection."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks like they approved the two-dose 62% ~effective~ efficacy  regiment.There was a lot of hope for the one-dose given the supply constraints or a retrial for the more promising half+full dose for greater efficacy.I wonder if people will ask which vaccine they&#39;re receiving. 62% is kinda underwhelming when there&#39;s two 95% ones (Pfizer/Moderna), a 92% one (Gamaleya), and a 79-86% one (Sinopharm). With the latter two also not needing subzero temps."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazing news, and so happy to see a lot of good sense here from the UK.They have distanced themselves from the US with the fastest approvals of Pfizer and Astrazeneca, the smartest targeting of the population (a focus on saving lives by targeting most vulnerable groups first), and the enormously helpful focus on getting some immunity first before worrying about second doses.The UK is no longer constrained by manufactured doses or anything else. The faster they put that existing supply into people, the faster they are done.  They could be done with the pandemic by the end of January."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a somewhat pervasive idea that advertising and brand recognition are coercive tools that will ultimately die out, replaced by better objective information about products. I&#39;m kind of partial to this idea myself.But increasingly we seem a long way from achieving this. Amazon reviews have become such garbage, I&#39;ve fallen back to pretty much relying on name brands as my placeholder for product quality.There&#39;s still a lot to be said for established brands. Brands can afford widespread advertising because they have thriving businesses that generate lots of cash. Brands can get stocked in major retailers because you need decent products to make it through Walmart&#39;s buying process.These are signals that are harder to fake, and they&#39;re kind of the best we&#39;ve got right now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Skip the Amazon resellers and order direct from China on Alibaba. Their reputation system is less spammy than Amazon&#39;s.One of my areas to watch: solid state relays.Here we have yet another fake Fotek solid state relay on Amazon.[1] Note the &#34;Made in China&#34;.Here&#39;s the real thing.[2] Note the &#34;Taiwan made&#34; from the real Fotek. Costs a lot more.
That&#39;s because it will actually handle the rated current. The fakes are notorious for overheating and burning out. The real thing has overheat and surge protection, will shut off if it overheats, and can stand a big short term overload for motor starting or when a short is in the process of tripping the circuit breaker upstream.Here&#39;s a similar solid state relay from China, from the actual manufacturer.They actually provide a table which shows how much they
exaggerate the ratings. They&#39;re over-rated by 2X for
a resistive load, and 6x for an inductive load.
&#34;For a motor with rated current of 15A and the motor
is inductive load, the formula is 15A x 6 = 90A, so
you should choose to buy 100A solid state relay&#34;.For a little extra, you can have your own fake label. Minimum order 200 pcs.Here&#39;s a fake Fotek.[4] What&#39;s amusing is that this is the actual manufacturer in China selling the fakes. They&#39;re in Guangdong, and they&#39;re selling under their own name, but with a fake label. No shame.There are legit manufacturers in China selling solid state relays.[5] They put their own name on the product, show pictures of the inside their rather grubby factory, and have realistic numbers on their data sheets, along with pictures of UL certification documents. About 4x more expensive than the fakes. If you&#39;re in China and are building industrial equipment which needs these components, you need ones that won&#39;t fail and shut down a manufacturing line.Here&#39;s a teardown of a fake. [6] The fakes are just solid state switches with power ratings way beyond what their components are good for. UL warning notice about fake Fotek solid state relays.[7] UL issued that notice six years ago, and they&#39;re still on Amazon and eBay.[1] https://www.amazon.com/SSR-25-DC-AC-Solid-State-Relay/dp/B07...[2] https://www.fotek.com.tw/en-gb/product-category/143[3] https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/1PCS-SSR-10-DA-DC-Con...[4] https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/High-quality-SSR-25DA...[5] https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/SSR-S25DA-H-DC-TO-AC_...[6] https://youtu.be/DxEhxjvifyY[7] https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ul-warns-of-solid-s..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps I&#39;m in the minority of frequent amazon users, but I don&#39;t buy anything from 3rd party sellers anymore. There is simply too much fraud. In practice, this means that I often need to skip past amazon entirely and go straight to the product manufacturer, sometimes paying more, just to be sure I&#39;m not being screwed."</p>

I should have also mentioned that I work 7.5h per day, and the only time I work overtime is when I&#39;m travelling to a customer site (which itself is rare, obviously not happening at all now!)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Slightly off topic:Something funny is happening in my native Belgium. Some people drop their fifth formal working day to become bicycle couriers, Uber drivers or whatnot in the &#34;sharing economy&#34;. The reason is taxation regimes.80% or 100% gross wage as a median income employee will hardly make any difference in net wage around there. A friend for example recently got a promotion from an entry level job (with tax discounts) to something more in line with her qualifications (without tax discounts). 600€ gross salary increase translated to 155€ net salary increase. All the rest got eaten by tax and social contributions increases.Belgium combines high formal job taxes combine with a low tax scheme meant to formalise &#34;sharing economy&#34; jobs. These enjoy super low 10% taxation up to 500€ per month. Many people actually do the math. They switch to 80% formal jobs hardly losing any income. Some actually increase their income by becoming pizza couriers or Uber drivers in their 20% time...UPDATED: corrected the net wage delta from 100 to 155€."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In-person social organizations.Social isolation is probably the biggest cause of unhappiness in advanced countries. Having a strong social network has lots of advantages including providing better romantic and career opportunities, as well as improving physical and psychological health.Humans have a long history of dishing out lots of money to be parts of strong communities too--country clubs and fraternities have high fees. Church goers regularly give up 10% of their (gross) income to be part of that group. Cult members might even hand over ALL of their possessions to join.The camaraderie and experiences that go along with being part of a strong, long lived community tends to be the thing people value most in life. Yet finding those communities has become increasingly difficult in the modern era. People move away to different cities, or just don&#39;t run into the same set of people everyday. With the rise of remote work, social disconnection is only going to rise. I think there&#39;s a lot of room to create new social organizations with pretty minimal technology, and make a pretty profit from doing so. Humans are still human--they want those connections--they mostly just need an introduction."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Premium-feeling laptops that aren&#39;t Apple machines.Yes yes, I get the economical barriers. I&#39;m past caring. It is so incredibly frustrating to look outside the Apple ecosystem and feel like the entire PC industry is content to sell the bare minimum of quality (outside of Gamer hardware, which looks obscene - but I get that it&#39;s subjective).It&#39;s a horrible business idea on the numbers and nobody would do this, but if some lunatic out there wants to blow the money, build and sell a laptop at whatever price point you want that:- Supports CoreBoot- Isn&#39;t a rebranded Clevo shell and has close enough fit and finish to a recent MacBook. Read: No. Plastic. Case.- If there is ever the phrase &#34;panel lottery&#34; uttered about your machine, you&#39;ve messed up.- No logos, or throw them on the underside like Purism.- The screen has to be relatively close to the MacBook in brightness + viewing angles. Give me an option for a glossy screen.- Trackpad must be glass. You won&#39;t get close to the MBP trackpad on the first or second pass, but try.- Go for some crazier vertical integration ala the M1. I don&#39;t care if it blocks upgrading certain parts, since I consider the industry to move fast enough that I won&#39;t _want_ the machine anymore in 4-5 years.- There is no need for touch of any kind, nor the ability to flip the screen or anything. Just make a damn laptop.- Edit: high quality boutique feeling support. I don&#39;t need an Apple Store equivalent, but at least invest in this.I get why Apple can do all of the above. I would pay literally twice what I pay Apple for a competing product. Currently, every laptop that I try feels like stepping back a few years.The upcoming Purism Librem 14, in terms of images, feels like it could _feel_ close - but I&#39;m not impressed with their other products so I&#39;ll believe it when I see it. I remain shocked that System76 hasn&#39;t bothered with this.End my rant about this industry, I guess."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Standardized interchangeable packaging for consumer goods.Ever been to a book store in Japan? Practically every book is the same size. As a result, bookshelves also are designed to be the right size to optimally fit books. This allows people to fit more books in small homes. It makes books easier to transport in book-sized boxes and book-sized bags too. You can get perfectly-fitting reusable cloth covers to protect your library books.American bookstores are a war between publishers to stick out from the shelves as much as possible. There&#39;s not much that a bookshelf designer can do except guess and have adjustable, oversized shelving.That also describes the state of today&#39;s packaging. With more shopping happening online, the need for items to stand out on a shelf is lower, and the need for them to fit nicely in boxes is much higher.Nobody would force you to design your products to fit the closest available standard package size, but companies would tend to do so more often because of the efficiency gains. Logistics companies like Amazon or Fedex could offer incentives."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A bit off-topic but related to the intro in this readme..&gt; Why?
&gt; I&#39;m super bored in lockdown. Add a Raspberry Pi 400 and a few tiny displays...I feel like there are two distinct kinds of lockdown experience. One, you have kids, and you have absolutely no free time because now your kids are home and you&#39;re working from home. Two, you don&#39;t have kids, and you&#39;re super bored every day. Seems like not much in between."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is a weird spot in the display market that is painful as a embedded developer:Displays under 400x240 pixels, usually the gfx buffer can be managed in the ram of the MCU. Nothing fancy needed, can get decent framerate on SPI bus running at 16 MHz. Anything above this range gets super ugly: no good displays exist and if they do, they&#39;re expensive or outdated (800x480 resolution is basically impossible to obtain). Furthermore, driving this display requires crazy shit like multiple SPI channels (QSPI), or some neutered version of DSI protocol...impossible to find docs for and if they have docs, theyre in Chinese.Then there are ultra high resolution displays, for e.g. cell phone market or laptop screens. You&#39;re now looking an entirely different beast. MIPI/DSI hardware support is required and a bunch of NDAs, need dedicated GPU and a proper linux running.Ideal display tech would be 5&#34;inch diagonal, OLED (low power consumption), 800x480 (or similar) and can be run using ARM Cortex-M4 or similar microcontroler arch. That would open up opportunities for so many device categories that doesn&#39;t exist today. Imagine a VT100 terminal clone running on 8&#34; 1024x768 resolution screen with a cheap ESP32 + display driver chip. Or a slightly more beefy Cortex-M7 running zephyr/linux. So many things we could build."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked at a company that heavily used the maps API in 2018. The 1,400% price hike really was an eye opener. It wasn&#39;t just the money involved, which was large, but the fact that it came so suddenly and with so much magnitude.Google&#39;s choice to bump these prices made me realize that they could do the same thing with their compute cloud pricing or other APIs, again with little notice. That, in turn, led to the realization that we needed to remove our reliance on Google&#39;s entire stack, and quickly, or we&#39;d be in a terrible bargaining position later.This one choice by the maps team likely cost Google significantly in the medium to long term, if any other companies realized the same things we did."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really want to use Apple Maps full time on my iPhone, just because of how much clutter Google Maps has accumulated on the screen.If anything tells me Google is losing the ability to innovate it&#39;s the newly added pill buttons for pre-set searches and branded POIs on the map. I remember when this was added to MapQuest circa 2010, and was the transition from trying to have an excellent mapping experience to just adding revenue focused features.Google is still operating from an extremely strong position, by nature of having nearly infinite budget and owning their mapping and search dataset. It&#39;s concerning that the iOS app seems to be suffering from the same issues that preceded the gradual downfall of MapQuest from a product perspective."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great article, but I think the conclusion about Google Maps languishing because it’s a low margin product is wrong.While Google Maps as a distinct product has a bottom and top line I think the author underestimates the value that the underlying places data has for Google’s core search product.The local place data is _massivley_ important to search. I don’t see any foreseeable way Google let’s the product that generates it languish. It’s far too strategic for them. Not to mention the amount of brand value maps has for them as an ecosystem.My view is that as Google’s Maps advantage dwindles, they’ll do more and more strategic acquisitions of places data sources. Tying more data into their closed ecosystem. Whether the new tech anti-trust landscape in the US and EU allows this is another question."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m one of those people who is entirely bemused by violent videogames and films (I&#39;m sure there are plenty of people who would be bemused by my pastimes too). I&#39;m not trying to argue to stop anyone doing it, but I would really like to understand it better.Many video games are essentially simulators of things that we&#39;re prevented from doing in reality, because of the laws of nature or society. Whether that&#39;s dropping blocks into place, building a city, chasing and eating ghosts, flying a plane, performing magic spells, or engaging in physical violence.And there&#39;s a never-ending push to make experiences more photorealistic, to make simulator even better. From that I can only conclude that people want to get as close to the experience of perfoming the prevented act as possible.Chopping someone up is heavily frowned upon in real life, but perfectly acceptable to emulate in someone&#39;s living room. Somehow the simulation escapes the taboo. And that escape seems to be absolute: In the range of violent acts you could commit, from a gentle nudge to grisly murder, simulation of the most extreme extent is permitted.But if that&#39;s the case, why is the realistic simulation of some societal taboos (e.g. physical violence to the point of murder) mainstream, but others (e.g. sexual violence in any of its forms) not? They are both very serious offences, but somehow one gets a free pass to let anyone pretend to do it, but the other not.Is it a reflection on the ultimate limits of those taboos in the society that produces most of these games? Or is my logic broken somewhere?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of when I was at grad student in that area. It was really frustrating to read all of the studies from e.g. Anderson and Bushman asserting the links between violent media and aggression.These publications were headline-grabbing, but some of the study design was laughable. The whole state of affairs led me to leave the discipline (which led me to a career as a software engineer). I&#39;m glad that I did, because the reproducibility crisis hit hard within a few years of me deciding to do something else with my life.Some of the studies that I read made me think that there was a link between frustration (caused by e.g. undesirable outcomes in videogames, or performance issues like high latency) and aggression, but of course the researchers assumed it was the violence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s worse than I thought. They measure &#34;aggressive behavior&#34; based on a questionnaire.They look for a correlation between the &#34;class&#34; of gamer; literally &#34;people who play a lot at younger ages, drop, and then increase&#34;, &#34;people who play a moderate amount at younger ages, drop and then slightly increase&#34;, and &#34;people who play only a little bit at a young age but increase&#34; and report no correlation between those classes and the aggression assessment based on the questionnaire.I admire the fact that they didn&#39;t do more work to p-hack their way into a correlation; they went with one methodology and showed that it didn&#39;t produce a correlation, and reported that. But even though I agree with the article&#39;s conclusion, I don&#39;t think the data support it in any meaningful way."</p>

It&#39;s amazing.It makes me a little sad more people are not aware of the ridiculously cool technical advancements going on lately. Many of my relatives and friends in my home country haven&#39;t even heard about any of these. They&#39;re not mentioned in the news or magazines whatsoever. Granted, they probably don&#39;t have any use for this information for their daily lives... but I do believe learning about this keeps alive my sense of childlike wonder, and it&#39;s sad to know others are missing out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I didn&#39;t know who Boston Dynamics was, I would have said that this is just CGI. The animations look so fake. I think the issue is that they&#39;re aggressively smoothing the motion since mechanical systems don&#39;t have the ability to accelerate &amp; jerk as fast as biological systems. Cheap mocap animation has the same problem because the frame rate of the capture system is too low. They interpolate between captured keyframes which results in the wrong velocities in the end."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of commments on military applications, but bipedal robots are inferior to wheel vehicles, planes, and aerial drones, in terms of speed and maneuverability.Everyone&#39;s so afraid of Terminators hunting them down, when in reality, mostly invisible , and mostly silent, Predator drones from a mile away that will kill you with precisely targeted missiles should be your real fear. Or commercial quad-copters carrying anti-personnel mines.The expense, complexity, power, etc to build bipedal assassins is higher than wheeled RC vehicles, quad copters, and missiles.The weapons that exist today are much more scary than these robots."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The way the art has been preserved makes you sorta realize that &#34;ancient times&#34; weren&#39;t that long ago.2000 / 25 = ~80 generationsIt&#39;s not some uncountable number with a million zeros. Assuming everyone knew one of their grandparents, it&#39;s more like 40 interpersonal &#34;links&#34;.I honestly feel like if Europe didn&#39;t have the Early Middle Ages (~500-1000AD), we would feel pretty connected to all the history that happened before in the same way that we feel pretty connected to Copernicus developing Heliocentrism or Columbus arriving in the New World.I wonder whether civilizations with seemingly more continuous histories like China feel more connection to the rest of their history. India&#39;s history was sort of interrupted by Islamic invasions starting from the 1200s. The Middle East, despite its tremendously long history, experienced a significant shift in culture with the rise of Christianity and then Islam.If Chinese people don&#39;t feel that historical connection, on the other hand, it might mean that our disconnect with ancient history might more just be a product of Modernity and the rapid change of the last couple centuries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"More so than the art and tools/homeware (which are very modern - often better than utensils I own now!), the Pompeii graffiti really changed how I think about the past.When you&#39;re growing up, it seems like the older generation is so different, and the generation before that is unrecognizable. I assumed that modern day life would be absolutely foreign to someone from 2000 years ago.Then you read the graffiti and realize, nothing has changed! https://kashgar.com.au/blogs/history/the-bawdy-graffiti-of-p..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the greatest System Design stories of all time is the evolution of mammals.Warm blood? A huge, complicated heart? Are you insane? The metabolism rates will be off the charts.Record-breaking spin-up times before adulthood? Where the parent animals will have to actively care for their helpless young? And spend bodily resources to produce a fluid with which to constantly feed each one?  How could they ever compete with a species that lays 10,000 eggs a year, dashing off after — or before — they hatch?And yet, as They Might Be Giants put it, these disruptive designs, so seemingly flawed, made the difference between extinction in the cold and explosive, radiating growth.P.S. Did you recognize the chicken-and-egg problem in the second paragraph?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think one reason for the negative comments (speaking as someone trained as a Systems Engineer, with 10+ years of experience and now working as a Consultant and performing Systems Engineering occasionally) is that the majority of the &#34;Engineerings&#34; choose to quantify anything fuzzy in a certain way, and then state that it doesn&#39;t matter. For example, the human factor. Whereas the reason Systems Engineering is so abstract and high level is the assumption that those unquantifiable factors have to be accounted for in &#34;boxes and arrows&#34;, regardless of the fact that they can&#39;t be quantitatively engineered.... And many can&#39;t handle the fact that these things can&#39;t be quantitatively engineered [Edit to add the statement post ellipses]"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m shocked by how aggressive a lot of the comments in this thread have been. This is a well written article, regardless of where anyone stands on questions like whether to rewrite vs improve, build vs buy, etc.Questions of systems design are anyway not answerable by appeal to a formal theory, at least not yet, so like most gray questions of life, they are not ones where one should take a fixed stand. There are too many unpredictable or emergent effects of an answer to such questions."</p>

At Netflix we once had a billing issue and it took a while to even notice, because no one in the company was paying for it (it was just free for everyone), but it looked like just general attrition, not people slowly having failed payments.After that incident, the company gave everyone a $16/mo raise (which is what it cost to have streaming and DVDs at the time) and then asked us all to set up our own payment.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So far, everyone growing vertically is growing crops that are almost entirely water because they&#39;re the only things that grow fast enough to turn a profit. They then sell them to rich people who pay 5x for taste and the feeling of eating local. It&#39;s a quality-differentiated product, not a solution to food scarcity or security.Until someone can grow cash crops, vertical isn&#39;t gonna make a dent, and it&#39;s gonna be really hard when competing with the free rain, free sun, and insane automation available for field agriculture already. Even Plenty with SoftBank&#39;s extra &#39;nutrients&#39; tops out at strawberries. See https://www.eater.com/2018/7/3/17531192/vertical-farming-agr... for some raw data on unit economics.One application of vertical that does make sense to me is as a community hub or a public health initiative around healthy eating. See https://www.thegrowcer.ca/ who makes container farms for isolated communities in northern Canada and measures success by community outcomes and entrepreneurs inspired, or https://farm.bot/ which encourages hardware hacking and food supply awareness."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It outproduces salad, but not potatoes, wheat, and most of all humus. Also the need for heavy machinery has a real cost in green house gas emissions (same issue as with electric cars).There are real ecological services provided by a healthy land and natural agriculture that can&#39;t be provided by such food factories.As @systemvoltage wrote, this is good for a heavily centralized system that&#39;s owned by big corporations looking for big profits but that&#39;s not a solution to the global environmental and soon to come (and it&#39;s already here for a lot of us) food/water crisis."</p>

Repurposed brownfield site, existing buildings would also reduce impact.I fear a loss of jobs and richness in ag. Supporting towns. Jobs are empowering, even crap ag. jobs but a reality here is that farming is overwhelmingly industrialised and jobs are either kept in the family or massively exploitative piece rate so this isn&#39;t a killer argument against either, but I do worry the rural area depopulation is a continuing trend."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Foster&#39;s brilliance and wit are legendary.Less well known, I think, is that he was a deeply religious man and a fearsome ascetic.  It is not a coincidence that he joined the Discalced Carmelites -- among the more mystical, contemplative, and historically, among the more severely austere of the Catholic mendicant religious orders (it was founded by Teresa of Avila and John of the Cross).He almost never wore the traditional habit of the Carmelites (or even &#34;the blacks&#34; of a priest), because he felt clerical garb no longer represented what it originally was (the dress of the poor).  He owned almost nothing, gave anything given to him to the poor (except books!), dressed like a plumber, and slept on the floor.  I read somewhere that his office had a dictionary, a telephone, and not much else.He was so famous for being &#34;the Pope&#39;s Latinist.&#34;  I have often wondered if anyone ever asked him about his faith or the pursuit of holiness.  Because I sincerely think he took these matters just as seriously, and probably more seriously than Latin."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got to study with Foster at his very last Aestiva Latinitas Romae session, in 2008. (After his illness and retirement, he continued teaching in Wisconsin until last year.) He was a really amazing personality and so humble about probably knowing more Latin than any person in the twentieth century, as well as having had an inside view of decades of world events by writing several different popes&#39; official reactions to them.He also wrote, among other things, the Vatican ATM UI translation and the Vatican heliport dedicatory plaque.https://www.flickr.com/photos/thrillho/2360283395  (literally &#39;please insert card in order to find out what to do&#39;)https://orbiscatholicus.blogspot.com/2008/06/from-vatican-ci...His death reminds me that he taught us to sing the &#34;In Paradisum&#34; Gregorian chant, which he considered very beautiful. Have a listen in his memory!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7F-N-Yd8dE"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I met Fr. Foster as a volunteer at the senior facility he resided in. Studied Latin with him. Ate olives and drank wine in his room. Was able to see him a few weeks ago. We planned on watching “Barbarians” on Netflix when this pandemic business was over.  Talked about cross country train trips. He asked for a hug when I left. Told him I couldn’t get that close. Last thing we said to each other: “love you”. I have no words and I have so many words."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Playing with the AI dungeon a while back (on the GPT-2 mode) I was presented with a tilapia recipe, titled &#34;Kittencal&#39;s Broiled Tilapia&#34; - it sounded bizarre so I decided to do a google search and I found that it was directly pulled from from https://www.recipezazz.com/recipe/broiled-parmesan-tilapia-7... - the user who posted it was &#39;Kittencal&#39;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; There is a legal grey area as to how these regulations should apply to machine learning models. For example, can users ask to have their data removed from a model’s training data? Moreover, if such a request were granted, must the model be retrained from scratch? The fact that models can memorize and misuse an individual’s personal information certainly makes the case for data deletion and retraining more compelling.This is an interesting angle I had not considered before. It seems like “right to be forgotten” requests could be quite damaging to the “train once run anywhere” promise of some of these models. (Or this could just mean that the training data needs to be more carefully vetted for personal data, but probably both as no vetting process can be 100% successful)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Walking in circles within the house and talking to myself out loud: I do this all the time, especially when I need to figure out a particularly hard problem (an algorithm to solve a particular issue, an architecture that handles my business needs etc).Last time I started a new project and worked on its architecture, I walked over 10km in a single day, according to my cellphone pedometer. In a tiny apartment! This trend lasted for a month, after which I sat down to actually implement this.I thought it was just me being autistic but it&#39;s interesting to know others do it as well :)I never worked in an office setting, but I can only imagine it would be extremely prejudicial to people like me and the author. Restraining us to a table would limit our output for the sole reason we would be unable to pace and think (no space and too much social pressure).Anecdata: sometimes I visit my parents and work from their place. I can&#39;t pace there because I don&#39;t feel comfortable doing so, and that alone is enough for me to not be able to tackle challenging problems there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To solve a problem, we need to be smarter than the problem - or the problem needs to be dumber than us.When vocalizing something, you&#39;re forced to constrict the blob of complexity you&#39;re carrying in your head into a linear narrative, which is by definition simpler. Now that you have simplified the problem you are more likely to get hold of it and solve it.This happens all the time - when I am solving a technical/logical problem, sometimes I feel like my wife thinks I am just staring blankly at the screen day-dreaming. So I get insecure and start to explain to her how hard the problem is, but because she&#39;s a physician I have to translate it into common language first, and 99% of the time I say &#34;never mind, got it&#34; before I have a chance to really bore her.Come to think of it, this may be how therapy works. You are forced to take all the &#34;mess&#34; that&#39;s in your head and narrate it to someone else, in the process getting much simpler perspective on it.Writing is the same way for me. For example, all the ideas in this post were in my head in some amorphous way, but now that I wrote them out they became neat little analogies I can use in the future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is partly why Rubber Duck Debugging[1] can sometimes work, especially if you&#39;re vocalising the steps. I&#39;ve often started typing a question on Stackoverflow when suddenly I solved the issue just by the act of verbalising the question as I type.I&#39;ve found this to also help when I&#39;m doing any sort of creative work or brainstorming, simply talking and explaining as if I&#39;m presenting to an audience helps me generate ideas. Never spoken out loud to myself in public though...[1]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This reminds me of “The Bell Jar” by Sylvia Plath, which has a quote Aziz Ansari used in his series “Master of None”:&gt; &#34;I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn&#39;t quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn&#39;t make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Much of my life hasn&#39;t played out how I expected. I had dreams like many people in high school and none of them came true. Instead of finishing college I joined the military after the stock market collapse in 2008/9. Impressions were left on me throughout my early life that I only came to know as an adult. My family got sick, I ruined the relationship that I&#39;d worked for, and at times I alienated people close to me out of my own sense of self-defense. I pushed myself to the brink repeatedly. My twenties were filled with stress, frustration, confusion, and at times anger. These things taught me acceptance and forgiveness of both myself and others. Looking back, I would not trade them for an easier or more prestigious life.When I came back from Afghanistan I had to scratch, claw, and climb a ladder without a degree thanks in much part to people who saw in me what I could only hoped to have seen in myself. I looked around me when I arrived and I saw Ivy League and top school graduates with multi-million dollar homes, Teslas, and their own literal fig trees in their back yards that complained about everything in life. I&#39;ve now had the opportunity to live in multiple cultures with varying degrees of prosperity. These things taught me to know my value but to have perspective on what I&#39;m really asking for.Here I am considering selling all my belongings, buying a truck and an RV to go embrace the new open road that is remote work. Life isn&#39;t about looking back. It isn&#39;t even about getting what you want. It&#39;s about navigating the road in front of you and making the best of the opportunities in front of you and for everyone around you. All that to say, I&#39;ve embraced the idea that whatever lies ahead is where I&#39;m supposed to be and I needn&#39;t look at what my neighbors value or what they have because I don&#39;t care. This life is mine to live."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a fascinating subject. It looks like many people are commenting about alternative realities and that exploring them is a fool&#39;s game (BTW. I concur with that).The thing which bothers me is upbeat comments about living here and now and planting the seeds for future changes. It feels like current problems (and desire to wish them away via woulda/counda/shoulda) didn&#39;t happen entirely randomly. These problems are a result of systematic behavior/decision making.As an example, it&#39;s too easy to say to yourself, &#34;I will start doing sport tomorrow&#34;. However, you wake up tomorrow and notice that your day is so busy that you don&#39;t have time to do sport until 9pm and by that time you are exhausted and can&#39;t do sport. And you repeat the cycle saying, &#34;maybe tomorrow&#34;. You start teasing your day apart and find that to squeeze in sport won&#39;t require you just to add it, but also to kick something out. And that all the things you have the energy for in the day, you implicitly regarded as more important than sport. And as a result, you are stuck in the loop wishing to do something better but being limited by your other priorities.And frankly, this bothers me way more. The immutability of the past is normal. Being so set in your ways that you can&#39;t change the future - this is what scares the shit out of me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another reason to use cursors is to avoid the problem of repeated or skipped elements caused by concurrent edits. If you use offsets and you’re on page 10, and someone deletes an item on page 1, the whole list shifts and you can accidentally skip an item on page 11. Likewise if someone adds an item on page 1 and you’re on page 10, one of the page 10 items will also show up on page 11.Cursors elegantly sidestep these issues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Use The Index Luke material about this is essential background reading, but in terms of actually implementing:My favorite SQL implementation of cursor-based keyset pagination can be found on this Hasura issue: https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/issues/141, specifically this comment: https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/issues/141#issuecom.... 
Something so elegant about this SQL. I enjoy it a lot.Also really enjoy this answer about how to implement keyset pagination on multiple columns:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38017054/mysql-cursor-ba..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think that cursor should be used more with realtime data and more stable data like products in an e-commerce shop should use paginated queries.There&#39;s many UX benefits for paginated queries. It gives customer a clear overview of how many products there are and customer can also navigate faster to get a better understanding of what general prices are. If the table/list doesn&#39;t have good filters, customer can easily act out binary search to find what they are looking for in an ordered list of items.Same with highscores, forums threads and other similar things. Say you are browsing highscores and you want to see what scores are around 10000th position etc.As a user I find having only prev/next buttons a bit claustrophobic in this case. I think UX should trump whatever performance gains there are from it."</p>

It&#39;s easy to think your hard work isn&#39;t noticed, until you realize how seldom you acknowledge other people&#39;s work.Unfortunately, explicit gratitude is very rare. Donations are even rarer. The &#34;ask a question&#34; and &#34;support this site&#34; buttons on my website are next to each other. I get 15 questions for every donation. About 30€ per 100 000 visitors, from 1-3 visitors. Those who email me with questions never donate. I&#39;m not complaining about any of this, just illustrating my point: you can&#39;t use gratitude as a metric for the value of your work.Critics, on the other hand, are disproportionately loud. As a community moderator, I learned that for every complainer, there are dozens of quietly happy users. You can only tell by the votes. No one will create a thread to say &#34;everything is fine, keep it up&#34;.If someone made your day easier, or if they created something good, take a minute to thank them. If they saved you a ton of work, consider a small donation. A lot of people are tirelessly, thanklessly creating things that benefit you. It costs nothing to acknowledge it. Never let a compliment go unused.In the last few years, I became better at expressing my gratitude to creators, maintainers, colleagues and friends."</p>
