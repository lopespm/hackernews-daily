								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For me, the utility of being at home versus being at the office is massive. If I need a 15 minute break, I can start a load of laundry, or run the dishwasher, or do some other chore.I can wake up later since I don&#39;t have a commute. I don&#39;t lose two hours a day due to the commute.I can wear as comfortable clothing as I desire. I can delay my shower until after my daily workout (Which I can do since my workout equipment is at home).I can control my environment so there are as many or as few distractions as i like. I can put on videos or audio that might not be considered work appropriate. I can use speakers since no one is around me to hear the sound.The number and magnitude of inconveniences we subject ourselves to by heading to an office every day has been fully revealed. I will do all I can to work from home for the rest of my life."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"OK. I WFH as well. I know all the benefits. And as I&#39;m WFH for pandemic only I&#39;ve been trying to find remote work post-pandemic and there I realized some bitter points:1. I compete for positions with people all over the world. Who can complete with a fraction of the salary I need.2. As a remote worker -most often working as a contractor- I&#39;m even easier to be replaced in a heartbeat. No severance or anything alike.3. Did I mention that I compete with all the planet? That makes competition for good roles really crazy.4. Work blends into life and it is very hard to keep it from. This gets worse depending on the company/role but in general these things tend to go the employers way not yours.5. You need to find new ways to socialize (and the motivation to do so is minimal) or you risk mental health issues.All I&#39;m trying to say is be careful what you wish for because you might get it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hope this is the start of a nation wide trend towards better work life balance. Production output has gone up over the past few decades and we’re expected to work the same amount of hours. I think the future probably looks something like 4 6-hour work days each week. Life is way too short and precious to be spending so much of it working for somebody else, even if you mostly do love your job."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hmm, it&#39;s such a shame that we have a single point of failure for so much of internet culture, not to mention people&#39;s actual creative lives.This is one of the reasons I started using youtube-dl. I wanted to create an independent backup of all my favorite creators and contributors in the event that they have to leave or delete their channels.This content should belong to everyone. I wish I could trust that all my favorite videos will be there forever, but this is just not the case. Removing the comments on music videos already hurt a lot."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s great to see more projects in the space, but for me it&#39;s not really about the editor itself any more, it&#39;s about the ecosystem and the extensibility. The act of selecting and changing text is just a small part of the problem space.I use emacs not because I&#39;m a neckbeard, but because I can script it to do whatever the hell I like. I switch to vscode when I want to do something my emacs setup isn&#39;t yet good for (like, working with Typescript).On the flip side, I use sublime text as a notepad replacement because it&#39;s that fast. I still use nano as my default editor for commit messages. Sometimes I use vim because that&#39;s what I happened to type to open a file.This isn&#39;t a comment on helix editor itself...just that, it&#39;s a pretty saturated space and I&#39;m keen to see something as novel as light table play out again, but only more successfully."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Built with Rust. No Electron. No VimScript. No JavaScript.Great. So, what&#39;s the extension language? Rust is utterly inadequate to be a scripting language (if you have to recompile the text editor to reconfigure it, that&#39;s a non-starter).VimScript sucks, but it&#39;s better than literally nothing. Emacs Lisp is weird, but powerful. Python is great and everyone knows it. Lua is small, simple, blindingly fast, and literally designed to be embedded in compiled projects.Why is there no mention of extensions or extensibility?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; &#34;We’ve redesigned and modernized the core experience to be cleaner, more inviting, and easier to use.&#34;Why does the UI change with every single Firefox release? I find myself having to re-adjust every time a new update is shipped.What&#39;s wrong with having a consistent experience that survives for more than 6 months? It&#39;s just a URL bar, and a bunch of tabs. Just leave it be already."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find it infuriating how designers keep adding more and more whitespace and padding on my desktop computer. If you want to make your UI easier to use on touch devices that&#39;s fine, but Windows 10 has a tablet mode that I keep disabled, so there&#39;s no reason to assume I&#39;m not using a mouse. If I go to Customize toolbar there&#39;s three density options: Touch, Normal, and Compact (not supported). Why aren&#39;t there a supported compact mode, and why is the normal mode so full of unnecessary padding?With the new design my bookmarks menu that previously had plenty of vertical space left now needs scrolling. Tabs have poor contrast and lack visual anchoring to the web content they contain.I&#39;m going to keep browser.proton.enabled to false in about:config as long as it&#39;s possible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love Firefox ethos, Firefox keeps redesigning itself over and over, and this time, for the worse.I have a 400 LOC userChrome.css file because the new redesign was barely usable since Firefox beta received this makeover.- There is no tab contrast, and very difficult to tell tabs apart. Made worse on sides without Favicons.- I loved the mic/speaker icon when a tab is playing/listening audio. They had to make it TWO lines in the tab, and made it difficult to notice when you have more tabs.- I could use some icons in the right top menu. It looks nice and easier to use in Edge, that has icons for every option.- Compact mode is gone, that was discussed here before.That said, I like the native elements (buttons, up/down arrows, etc). The new icons in the addressbar look nicer and fits nicely in."</p>

I know it&#39;s annoying if you&#39;ve seen them a lot. Sorry.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People have the cause and effect backwards in my opinion. You know why &#34;binge drinking&#34; isn&#39;t a problem in Germany, except for when the Australians turn up for Oktoberfest? It&#39;s because you can just buy a beer on the side of the road with your currywurst, and drink it without being hassled. If you act up, you get arrested for acting up. Try openly having a few beers in the park in Australia or the US, you&#39;ll be run out by the constabulary, or at the least they&#39;ll make you empty it in the trash. When you treat people like naughty children and bake into your culture the idea that drinking is itself an anti-social behaviour that always leads to fighting and dickheaddery, then that&#39;s how they act."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s hard to reduce the US to a single culture. Alcohol consumption habits vary greatly from region to region, or even city to city depending on where you live.I&#39;ve noticed that heavy drinkers tend to cluster with other heavy drinkers. The more you see your friends and coworkers binge drinking regularly, the more you feel it&#39;s an acceptable and even common behavior. Likewise, non-drinkers tend to cluster with each other because it gets tiresome to have friends who want every event to revolve around alcohol.Statistically, the median drinker in the US doesn&#39;t drink much alcohol at all. The vast majority of alcohol is consumed by the top 10% of drinkers. You may have simply ended up with a cluster of heavy drinkers that aren&#39;t representative of the median US alcohol consumer.Statistic here: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/09/25/think... Note that the median US alcohol drinker consumes less than 1 drink per week."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My favorite OBS feature is that you can bring in transparent browser windows all over the place. As such, I have my work conferencing set up so my time appears in the upper-right corner. I’m on the east coast and everyone I work with is on the west coast. It’s a nice way to remind them of my current time. (It also passive aggressively animated to purple with a moon when its “after hours,” a/k/a 5pm for me.)I also have shortcuts to pull in live weather conditions, our company stock price, crypto prices for fun, a 1- and 3- and 5-minute timer, as well as a countdown of days until important work events.It’s fun, and all just a bit of HTML and CSS and JS. (And PHP/cURL/cron to pull stock and weather prices in the background.) All this for free with OBS.Easily a top 5 app for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Excited for this release since it contains M1 Apple VT H264 Hardware Encoding support[1] — I know on my Intel Mac, OBS would massacre the CPU if I didn&#39;t have the hardware encoding enabled. On the M1 it&#39;s not quite so bad, but being able to use hardware encoding does save a lot of CPU cycles when streaming at higher bitrates![1] https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/4170"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"OBS is such wonderful software. It&#39;s immensely powerful yet approachable and performant. I am not a streamer, but I&#39;ve found it really useful as an audio/video swiss army knife. Many thanks to the team and community behind it!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I haven&#39;t heard of using docker compose for production development, only local development. In production I normally see people building production images and spinning up them up in their cloud with Terraform and whatever other infrastructure they need, especially for databases where your local MySQL container isn&#39;t going to be configured or provisioned like an AWS RDS instance. What do you hand a docker-compose file off to in production? Swarm? When would you choose this path over a separate system to provision your production resources (like Terraform)?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I run my personal services (Web, db, mail, nextcloud, traefick) off a cheap hetzner vps using docker-compose and its a pleasure how simple is to manage it. Before that I ran a vps with manually configured services and, specially for mail, it was very hard to deploy and manage. Also if p0wned a service, the whole box was as good as gone.Now, there are other alternatives with less downtime, more scalability and a lot more or complexity? Sure there are... but for my personal box I won&#39;t be touching any of that, thanksEdit/Add: ... and also VPN, which I added later on in like, 10m or so. Adding OpenVPN in my previous box was not as trivial, I tell you that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s widely accepted “best practice” to not run processes in docker containers as root but I think it does a disservice to not explain why. The top benefit in my mind is to be able to mark interpreted code (server side JS/python/ruby) as read only in case someone gains shell access in the container. It’s great to set up another user for execution, but you should also make sure to copy in code and build artifacts as read-only. I’m curious if people can name other direct benefits to a non-root user other than “I don’t trust docker/Linux process isolation”."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The thing about smoking is that when you quit smoking you quit it every day. Imagine a light switch on the wall. You turn it off by quitting smoking and you can always go back at a desperate time for instance and turn it on. And some time later off again. Smoking your first cigarette implants that light switch on your mind and you can&#39;t make it go away. Since you know how it makes you feel good when the switch is on, you at some level desire to back to it. Whole idea of quitting smoking is then finding ways to stop yourself from turning it on again and this is true until you die. So do yourself a favor and avoid any substance that creates such light switches in your mind.Edit: Of course this is not the case for 100% of humans. Everyone is different. Some weak some strong in willpower, discipline, etc. But we can all agree that it is an addiction that sucks life out of you slowly. You wouldn&#39;t want to test your willpower your whole life against such a sneaky enemy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I started smoking when i went to study in China. Someone gifted me an expensive brand of cigarette, and I kept it hidden in a drawer for two weeks as I didn&#39;t smoke. One very cold day with no where to go and nothing to do, I took the pack out and lit one stick. My did it have a lovely scent. The heat it created inside me was also soothing. It took me about a week and half to finish the pack of 21 cigs. I couldn&#39;t afford to buy the same brand often but i had become addicted to smoking. I struggled with anxiety back then and smoking calmed my nerves. Within 1 year I was smoking 2 packs a day.Smoking is frowned upon in Ghana, so upon my return there were few places I could smoke. One day while out and about I got really anxious about something and I needed a cig badly. I had to go some distance to get one, and even got a harder time finding a place to hide and smoke. I felt like I was committing the most heinous of crimes cause I had to take off my shirt to ensure the smell didn&#39;t stick on me. I didn&#39;t even enjoy the smoke because the quality wasn&#39;t that good, I smoked in a hurry and kept looking over my shoulder. I simply couldn&#39;t live like that anymore. So I quit after that day. The next time I tried to smoke again was 2 months later. I couldn&#39;t even finish a stick as it made me feel sick. I have disliked the smell of cigarettes ever since. And that was 7 years ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ian Banks in his novel Complicity writes powerfully decrying smoking. Quoting from the novel.  I take out another cigarette, light it and draw deeply. I 
  gag again, coughing and hacking and feeling the whisky 
  and the can of Export I had earlier slosh around inside 
  me, almost coming up. My eyes are watering. What a stupid 
  drug, what a completely useless fucking drug; no real hit 
  after the first drag, highly addictive and lethal in all 
  sorts of ways, and even if the lung cancer or the heart 
  disease doesn&#39;t get you you can look forward to 
  gangrenous legs in your old age, bits of your body just 
  rotting away still attached and dying in instalments for 
  you, rotting and stinking while you&#39;re still alive and 
  then they have to cut them off and you wake up after the 
  operation wheezing and burning with pain and gasping for 
  a fag. Meanwhile the tobacco companies sponsor sport and 
  fight off advertising bans and look forward to all the 
  new markets in the East and the Far East and more women 
  taking up the weed to show that they can be brainless 
  fucks too, and suits with worm-shit in their brains go on 
  television and say, &#39;Well, nobody&#39;s actually proved how 
  tobacco causes cancer you know&#39;, and you sit there 
  seething and then you find Thatcher is taking half a 
  million from Philip Morris for a three-year find 
  consultancy and you swear never to buy any of their 
  products ever again but at the end of the day you still 
  light another cigarette and suck in the smoke like you 
  enjoyed it and make more profits for those evil fucks.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Let&#39;s be clear about this, the donation money isn&#39;t just used to keep the encyclopedia online. They have hundreds of language versions of Wikipedia itself, and many related &#34;sister&#34; projects, with perhaps the most clearly impacting being Wikimedia Commons (a huge repository of free-content media with a focus on educational use - including much media in the public domain) and Wikidata (a project that has now emerged as the closest thing to a &#39;hub&#39; in the still-developing Semantic Web ecosystem).  Quite a bit of their funding also enables growth in least-developed countries, where access to high-quality educational content in local languages is going to be especially impactful wrt. broader development goals.People like to focus on the excess growth of management roles within the foundation and call it &#34;cancer&#34;, but all large organizations have some possible waste within them.  It might just be one of the many costs of doing business and pursuing what are in reality some very ambitious and perhaps worthwhile goals.  And building a long-term endowment only looks like the prudent thing to do, since the results of fundraising can be quite volatile and uncertain."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The WMF also has high-flying, global plans to “become the essential infrastructure of the ecosystem of free knowledge” by 2030. It says it wants to create “knowledge equity”—a world where people everywhere will have as much access to information in their own language as a first-world citizen—and that this will require continuous budget increases.Godspeed to them in this endeavor. I think this is not the time to become absolute purists in the choice of tech overlords. The tech world is being controlled by less than a handful of trillion-dollar monopolists that crush anything that stands in their way. A few hundred million in this war is a drop in the ocean.Yes, power corrupts, and money is power. Yes, left to their own devices, people in NGOs will maximize revenues and expand their employee empires - just like those in the for-profit sector. What matters is the strategic goals and their execution by the leadership, and there is nothing - absolutely nothing - to indicate that WMF went astray from its stated mission.I cannot but feel this is another pissing contest like the open source world experienced, where everybody and their brother started their own distributions/forks to virtue signal their true commitment to the open source goals. This led to a massive fragmentation of the scene, the few companies that tried to use the model, like Redhat and Ubuntu, were exposed as deviationists from the party line; meanwhile big tech ate the world and put every man, woman and child on the planet in invisible jails."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ridiculous question and even more ridiculous factoids.The assumption that operating as a non-profit implies an entity should stop asking its audience for help advancing the mission, or that it should pay its necessary staff less than competitive wages...please.Give wikipedia more so they can take on the MUCH more well-endowed and entirely opaque private capital taking over nearly every other information outlet in the US and often around the world."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article suggests using a probabilistic failure model instead of a large a safety factor, and explains how a safety factor established in the 1930s affected the cost of the Space Shuttle. But spacecraft might be a special case, where any additional weight is so expensive, and you also expect the models to be especially accurate and manufacturing to be extremely precise.For more everyday civil engineering, I think the safety factor &#34;covers up&#34; a lot of systemic inaccuracies everywhere in the system, from modeling to design to manufacturing to unintended uses. Some of those you might account for in a probabilistic model. But it&#39;s very difficult to probabilistically model errors in the model itself, as the financial industry found out the hard way.When driving over a bridge built the way suggested here, how comfortable can we be that certain stresses aren&#39;t correlated in ways that the engineers didn&#39;t anticipate? Or that a certain distribution isn&#39;t actually as well approximated by a Gaussian as it was assumed to be? Intuitively, it&#39;s a lot harder to be wildly wrong with the factor of safety approach.To put this another way, a more complex way to reason about safety necessarily has more moving parts, and is thus more likely to be wrong. So in effect, adopting more complicated safety models introduces a safety risk all on its own. I think that needs to be considered as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Grossly increasing the factor of safety is a subtle way that science fiction stories connote a feeling of very advanced technology.For example in the JJ Abrams movie Star Trek Into Darkness we see the Enterprise operating at depth in an ocean, then dramatically zooming away into space. Then later another ship falls from orbital height and plows through San Francisco without losing its hull shape.In Star Wars the Millenium Falcon is constantly doing things that would seem to be outside a normal design for a spacecraft, and it survives (aside from the radar dish).Even as far back as the movie 2001, the monolith is made out of a material that humans can’t dent or cut. Why so strong? It’s basically just an automated radio.The idea is: this advanced civilization has such command over physical technology, that they can effortlessly engineer unnecessary strength without losing any of their designed performance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;&#34;&#34;A non-empirical alternative to the factor of safety has been around since the 1940s, but still doesn’t have widespread adoption. I think the image below describes the concept, called probabilistic design, best.&#34;&#34;&#34;This is _exactly_ LRFD (Load Factor Resistance Design) which has been in the Civil Engineering building codes since the mid 80&#39;s, and became common in use the 90&#39;s when I was an Engineer (in training).(It&#39;s the difference between the older green book and the newer (at the time) silver steel design handbook)It was absolutely drilled into us in school though, that Safety Factors and LRFD factors covered material and other uncertainty, they did not cover blunders."</p>

They were more expensive, as in a gazillion times more expensive. The delivery schedule was already falling at the time. They were already terrible planes at the time compared to their competition. Most hilarious of all, they don’t actually fit into our small country because they are loud, so the government is still buying up properties in areas that they’ll have to fly over because the noise levels are so illegal they have to let people move away. They are also struggling with what to do with the airspace in one of our Airports, because the only two routes these planes have around it is over the ocean (fine but typically avoided during rain because of the low altitude they fly to avoid the airport) and our second largest city, ooops.Somehow it still won, to no ones surprise. And that’s really just how it is. The US wants bases in Greenland? Well, it’s technically not really Danish territory but we’ll make an exception and to full colonial masters. The US wants a radar thing in one of our commercial airports? Sure! (Since moved to another part of Europe). The us wants access to data on Moslem citizens? sure thing!

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This story is amazing. The story of US war games seems to commonly be &#34;Yeah the Read Team won but...&#34; and no changes are made. Maybe those are just the stories I hear.It&#39;s also interesting to consider if the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor would have happened if it weren&#39;t for our own dress rehearsals we carried out in front of the Japanese. Maybe war games are a bad idea when they&#39;re too big to keep secret and you&#39;re too politicized to integrate the lessons. Admiral Yamamoto didn&#39;t have to worry about upsetting US Navy top brass. He was able to benefit from our lessons, even if we weren&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well, in retrospect it&#39;s easy to say that air power is the future and battleships are obsolete. But with the information available at the time, I don&#39;t think it really was that clear back in 1932. Back then, no capital ship had been sunk let alone been severely damaged(?) by aircraft. Aircraft, and in particular naval aircraft, at the time were flimsy biplanes, with monoplanes slowly entering the scene. Sinking a battleship with those? Pfft, entirely reasonably people said.I mean, put yourself into the hypothetical supreme naval planner of, say, the US or Japan at the time. Are you really going to gamble your entire nations (or empires, if you will) capability to project force overseas on the notion that air power is the future and battleships are obsolete? If you&#39;re wrong, the enemy battleship fleet will just shrug off your feeble aerial attacks and proceed to crush your navy and conquer your overseas assets.So in that sense it&#39;s no surprise that both USN and IJN built both battleships and carriers. And at least the US kept building them long after Pearl Harbor (though the Iowas were all ordered before Pearl Harbor, but they weren&#39;t cancelled in favor of carriers or converted into such either)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Colonel Billy Mitchell, the &#34;father of the US Air Force,&#34; was famously court marshalled in 1925. He had predicted that in the future Japan would attack Pearl Harbor with aircraft. He predicted &#39;aircraft traveling 1000 miles per hour would fight each other in the stratosphere&#39;. He predicted troopers would one day parachute behind enemy lines. He predicted long range heavy bombers. He aggressively argued for stronger investment in air power, against a resistent brass, who, irritated with him, had him court martialed. A great 1955 Gary Cooper film tells his tale, &#34;The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell.&#34; This is the climactic court martial scene:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecMYH3dPIUI"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The desktop is broken not because of the file/folder paradigm but because we stopped using files to represent information. Figma, Slack, and Notion should save their information to disk. You should be able to open a Notion document, or a Figma design, from your desktop, instead of through their Web interface. You should be able to save a Facebook post or Tweet and their replies to disk.Why can&#39;t you? Well, for one, social media companies don&#39;t want you to save stuff locally, because they can&#39;t serve ads with local content. Furthermore, browser APIs have never embraced the file system because there is still a large group of techies who think the browser should be for browsing documents and not virtualizing apps (spoiler: this argument is dead and nobody will ever go back to native apps again). Finally, the file system paradigm fails with shared content; you can&#39;t save a Google Doc to disk because then how can your friends or coworkers update it? It&#39;s much easier for Google to store the data on their server so that everyone can access it instead of you setting up some god-awful FTP-or-whatever solution so that your wife can pull up the grocery list at the store.I&#39;m hoping the new Chrome file system API will bring a new era of Web apps that respect the file system and allow you to e.g. load and save documents off your disk. However, this still won&#39;t be good enough for multiplayer apps, where many devices need to access the same content at the same time. I don&#39;t know if there is any real way we can go back to the P2P paradigm without destroying NAT - WebRTC tries but WebRTC itself resorts to server-based communication (TURN) when STUN fails."</p>

I opened it because I had a task to complete and all this junk is getting in my way.And same when I close a program, as the author hits on very well.Basically, the computer/program/etc always wants me to do something for it, but it never asks for those things at an opportune time.No, I don&#39;t want to update my computer right now, and no, updating overnight tonight isn&#39;t good either because I need to keep this program running until tomorrow. I understand that your new UX is better for me, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll love it, but forcing that on me right now is preventing me from doing what I need to do. I see your error dialog describing some odd issue, but I don&#39;t have time to triage that right now and decide to take the time to fix it.I wish software would respect the human element more.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing I&#39;ve seen happen again and again in a lot of technologies is a &#34;framework gravity&#34;. A lot of people see this as engineers just wanting to work on &#34;hype&#34; technology but I think what is actually happening is a reflection of global engineering time.React is great for SPAs. Most large companies are working on honest-to-god SPAs. By extension most engineers are working on SPAs. So most tooling is created for SPAs. Now if you aren&#39;t building an SPA you look around and find almost every resource is around building an SPA. Even if you know you don&#39;t need an SPA, it&#39;s easier to hire, iterate, and even use other open source solutions if you are building an SPA, so you try to hamfist your project into an SPA.It&#39;s a bit like having a bike commute in America. A bike might be the best thing for you to do - cheaper than a car, keeps you healthy and you don&#39;t need a garage. But you quickly find that everything is built for cars and it&#39;s easier to deal with the disadvantages of a car than try to commute with a bike.I remember thinking the same thing about Hadoop 5-6 years ago. If you had &#34;small data&#34; you could get what you wanted with SQL and fast disks. But everything else assumed you were on Hadoop. Newgrads were trained in hadoop. New tools were Hadoop first. New research was all hadoop. If you hit a small issue with your DB, almost every solution would be &#34;this is how it&#39;s solved in Hadoop&#34;. It was hard to even know if what you were trying to do what even possible without Hadoop.The only optimism I have is that maybe in 5 years we will all collectively wake up and stop trying to shove React everywhere just like we stopped with Hadoop."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The amazing part to me is that SPAs are so much harder to do right compared to old-school server-side rendered HTML. One could be forgiven if they think a &#34;simple&#34; SPA is a good starter project, but they&#39;d be very wrong. Async programming (Javascript Promises and/or async/await) is difficult, error-prone, and should be avoided whenever possible. On top of this, understanding how data flows through these SPAs is no small task.Compare this to server-side rendering where you run some DB queries, generate some HTML based on those results, and send it to the browser to be rendered.There are some cases where you actually need a rich experience in the browser. In those cases, I would start by seeing if plain old Javascript would work.In writing this, I definitely feel like a &#34;get off my lawn&#34; guy. But I&#39;ve just seen too many junior and senior engineers (me included) fall flat on their face trying to use these SPA frameworks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As mostly a user that doesn&#39;t develop web apps anymore, all this feels very true to me.I&#39;m soooooo sick of interfaces that load an empty useless shell of UX chrome and then slowly trickle in content at some later time, and leave spinners, or even worse, gray boxes simulating text.Send the text content in the initial reply, please! It&#39;s bad enough having to wait for webfonts, but when you wait to start doing the slow database query for content until after an html shell has been loaded, and after a huge JavaScript bundle has been parsed and executed, you&#39;re just wasting time. Reminds me of the Google Web Toolkit of yore. We really haven&#39;t progressed much in the decade for single-page apps since then, when it comes to the user. And that&#39;s a horrifying thought."</p>

The package went &#34;missing&#34; with the shipper with obvious fake tracking data, like multiple &#34;customer not home&#34; delivery attempts timestamped at 12am in the morning. The packages never showed up. Amazon kept saying it was the shipper&#39;s fault and the shipper said it was Amazon&#39;s responsibility. Lots of tweets, etc, got me nowhere.In the end Amazon finally refunded me, but it was a nightmare. They wouldn&#39;t even talk to me until I waited a number of days after the package was late and even then all they would say is that it had to be escalated to management who would review the issue eventually. Even when they finally agreed the package was lost, I had to wait for another management review to actually get the refund issued. They had my money tied up for weeks with no recourse for a package they never even delivered. I can only imagine how bad it would be if the shipper claimed it was delivered.My recommendation is to skip Amazon for anything expensive or at high risk of shipper theft/fraud. Your customer experience will not be the same as when they lose a $10 package. They will treat you like a criminal no matter what your past history with Amazon is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I do not trust Amazon to ship anything safely and securely anymore. Almost everything I receive is damaged, late, or mis-delivered. Books are especially abused somewhere in Amazon’s fulfillment. (They’re always bent, creased, or dirty.) Items that are supposed to be 1-day shipping typically take &gt;=3, and Amazon’s tracking mostly says “oops! it’ll come trust us”. (Not verbatim, obviously.)Amazon’s return process is becoming incrementally more obtuse as time goes on. While they’re still decently good, it’s getting harder to do easy, no-nonsense returns. Typically—if they don’t just tell me to dispose of the item myself—they demand I drive to Amazon lockers or Whole Foods or Kohl’s to drop stuff off at no charge, and pressure me into just getting Amazon credit.I would never buy a $7,000 item on Amazon under any circumstance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This was despite the fact that when boxed the Sony a1 weighs 3.22 lb (1.46 kg), and the Chiles’ package was listed by UPS as weighing only 2 lb (900 g).Not sure why Amazon was still arguing at this point. If UPS confirms the package was basically empty, then Amazon has no reason to believe the customer was lying."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seems like commenters are misreading the lawsuit here. My first instinct after reading the top paragraphs of Stoller&#39;s post was also &#34;so what, this seems fine,&#34; but if you read to the end and see what the suit is really alleging, it&#39;s not just a policy that punished sellers for offering discounts on their products when sold off Amazon. It&#39;s the fact that Amazon is charging anywhere between 30-45% in fees to the sellers, which is much higher than other online marketplaces and obviously less than the 0% they&#39;d charge themselves to sell through their own site (though they&#39;d still need to pay money to operate the site), and then punishing them if they sell somewhere else that has lower fees for a lower price.That seems like legitimately monopolistic behavior and something that is illegal and should be stopped. The post is still misleading in that it doesn&#39;t mean Amazon is raising prices across the board by 30-45%. But they are raising prices across the board by whatever the delta is between their fees and WalMart&#39;s fees, or some other marketplace that charges even less, minus the difference in shipping.Normally, market forces would solve this problem without any need for legal intervention, because some other marketplace like WalMart can just offer lower seller fees and attract all the sellers. But that doesn&#39;t happen precisely because Amazon&#39;s massive subscribed user base represents so much of the market that no can afford not to sell there, which is seemingly the definition of a monopoly and why legal intervention is called for. Lower-cost marketplaces can only compete if Amazon is not allowed to blackball sellers from access to the only customer base that matters."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know how some can see it as shady or misleading, but I still prefer it.  That is, I prefer having the price baked in, right in front of me...no surprises.  Versus some indy site I&#39;ll think &#39;oh only six bucks?  sure I&#39;ll try it&#39; only to be shown it&#39;s actually closer to 20 after shipping and tax.  That just wastes both our time.Further, even if it&#39;s a hair more expensive, I&#39;ll still pay it for the no hassle returns.  I recently purchased a knife I saw on Amazon, but decided to go through the seller&#39;s official site to save a couple dollars.  It was not worth it, and not something I&#39;ll do again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Now, if this were all that was happening, sellers and brands could just sell outside of Amazon, avoid the 35-45% commission, and charge a lower price to entice customers. “Buy Cheaper at Walmart.com!” should be in ads all over the web. But it’s not. And that’s where the main claim from Racine comes in. Amazon uses its Buy Box algorithm to make sure that sellers can’t sell through a different store or even through their own site with a lower price and access Amazon customers, even if they would be able to sell it more cheaply. If they do, they get cut off from the Buy Box, and thus, cut off de facto from being able to sell on Amazon.&#34;This was the missing piece for me. Would like to see more specifics about how Amazon does this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; If people are trying to assign blame to a bug or outage, it&#39;s time to move on.This is one of my favorite excerpts. I once worked in a lab where we would have frequent catastrophic failures because there was never any disaster planning or contingency management plan. I personally triaged 3 such incidents alone or with people who happened to be there when the problem arose and attempted to disseminate some suggestions for how to prevent similar problems in the future. No one was interested. People were primarily interested in tearing my head off because I hadn&#39;t handled the problem the way they would have done it (of course, they were out drinking beers or sleeping while I was dealing with the issue at 12 AM or on a weekend).After the third time I said fuck it, the next time there is an issue I am going to insure my own projects are safe and then I&#39;m going home and turning my phone off.

Seriously, if there&#39;s any recommendations, I&#39;d seriously pay for a course (like probably a lot of money, maybe 1k for a course if it guaranteed that I could write good docs.)I agree but think it is more than just _documentation_: effectively communicating ideas through text was one of the most underrated skills in software engineering. I say &#34;was&#34; as I think there is much more focus on it now with remote work and video call fatigue becoming the norm for many."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"“But it’s like the early Internet!” shouted the Emperor’s coinholders. “The Internet wasn’t yet useful a mere, um, thirteen years after its invention either.”I can see how people in their twenties would fall for this argument because they can’t remember. The reality is that the internet was immediately extremely interesting (either useful or fun) for practically everyone who got access. Email and ftp alone were killer apps. A bit later came Usenet and IRC and MUD gaming. There were things to download, people to meet, flame wars to participate in. People would stay up until 4am to get a chance to go online in university shared facilities.With cryptocurrency there’s nothing to do. You could pay $100 to buy a “cryptokitten” or whatever, but then you’d be stuck shilling it on somebody else somehow. The community is a mix of Scientology-like groupthink and multi-level marketing sales pitches. The early Internet was infinite times more fun."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These two resonated with me:&gt; A lot of intelligent observers look at cryptocurrency, see that it makes no sense, and reasonably infer that they must be missing something profound on the technical level. Tech culture has a nice tradition of not deriding new ideas, but we need to break it here and speak out&gt; [non-tech people] don&#39;t see the huge silent majority of tech people who know it&#39;s a scam. That&#39;s on usIt is on us. I never realized this before today. I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s nothing but a pyramid scheme, but I always gave the enthusiasts the benefit of the doubt. After all, Elon is so cute when he&#39;s enthusiastic! But yeah he probably knows it&#39;s a scam too, what was I thinking."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I could waste a huge amount of time refuting the author&#39;s points, but will make it more of a meta comment.Crypto is vast, complex, and inherently not suitable for binary thinking. I&#39;ve studied the space for months and have come to the conclusion that crypto is two-sided in almost every aspect.Many/most coins are speculative, which you can associate with words like &#34;greed&#34; and &#34;casino&#34;. Yet also provide wealth savings/growth to people locked out of it in our traditional system.NFTs are a cruel joke right now, yet ridiculous as they are, may be a precursor to various groundbreaking uses having real utility, in an exponential way.Smart contracts are largely dysfunctional, yet there&#39;s early success in replacing financial products like staking, lending, leverage. When it works, it&#39;s permission-less, which has interesting social benefits (access not defined by your identity/social class).And so on.I&#39;m not here to debate any of these points, my only point is to not dismiss crypto as a whole (binary thinking) and to not underestimate it. The topic is too complex for it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I will postulate an opposing view to TFA:Quality consumer goods are better in two key areas. First, they are replaceable. I don’t want a military grade mixer in my kitchen if getting a broken whisk or motor on it is going to require me hunting all over eBay for the specific part hoping it’s available. I was very excited at one point about the idea of getting a commercial dishwasher that can run a load of dishes in like 90 seconds. Problem with those is that you can’t go to Lowe’s and get a replacement part when it acts up. You have to call a restaurant equipment servicing company and pay them what a restaurant with a broken dishwasher would pay. Or more because you aren’t a frequent customer. Sure, maybe it’ll break less but here’s the thing: my modern LG dishwasher will be more convenient to use and if I get 10 years out of it rather than 20 I still spent only $1000 on the top of the line one rather than the $4k on a 10 year old used commercial unit that I will struggle with the entire time.Second, consumer goods are replaceable. I am used to my Kershaw knife. I broke it yesterday. I can get it serviced by the manufacturer or get a brand new one, or both. If I buy some special forces surplus knife and chip the blade I am either done with that knife or I’m taking it to a specialist or I’m buying a new one. Knowing that I can replace an item I’m used to when a one-for-one replacement is a comfort. Obviously that doesn’t work for everything but it works for items that are made by high quality manufacturers.Bonus: a military grade mixer is going to suck to make high end pastries because it’s geared towards making mashed potatoes for the troops. I feel like the author is romanticizing ma class of products that in reality aren’t all that amazing except in a couple of key areas that to most consumers aren’t as big of a deal. So while it’s possible that, as the author states, the average consumer is an idiot, I don’t see much evidence that the author is much ahead of the pack here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love to use professional-grade items where i can, but sometimes &#34;overkill&#34; means a worse product.  like the professional-grade fan - it&#39;s not just designed for a high duty cycle, it&#39;s also probably designed to be operated in an environment where people regularly use hearing protection, so quiet operation is not a consideration."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The average consumer is an idiot, so the bean counters keep milking them... They want pizzaz over functionality and durability. They want shiny stuff in a bigger box... The industrial, military and commercial market doesn&#39;t mess around. They want to purchase equipment that works reliably and performs to a specification. It&#39;s professional and their livelihood depends on it. It sort of self filters the entire market. Shitty things drop off the radar due to poor sales.This sounds like a cool hobby and conversation starter. But it&#39;s hard to take the author seriously when he proselytizes on the practical virtues of buying ejector seats over retail chairs. Industrial goods are often built for very specific use-cases. If those use-cases don&#39;t align with your own needs, you&#39;re just paying a lot of money for something you don&#39;t need. And often, something that fails to deliver on your actual needs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The idea that a field can be reformed by making it worse until it suddenly faces a reckoning and emerges much better is ... I don&#39;t know where people keep getting the idea that this might work. It has never worked in any field ever in history.The thing that can happen: fields gradually split into rigorous and non-rigorous camps. Like with evidence-based medicine, or chemistry/alchemy. Depending on the field, either might prevail in the market. Medical research and bridge-building are mostly rigorous, programming is mostly non-rigorous.AI/ML has a range of rigor levels, from fairly good to total crap. I think people in the field have a reasonable idea which is which. It&#39;s frustrating to people outside the field that think they can just take the technique with highest reported performance numbers and expect good results."</p>

This stuff is widespread. This is much more accurate:&#34;because everybody is complicit in this subtle fraud, nobody is willing to acknowledge its existence&#34;Littman is at Brown, where the majority of the CS department engages in this !@#$%.

I needed to improve their observability so that we can keep bureaucracy at bay by maintaining a high level of trust.&#34;Poof. Another Big Tech middle manager got their wings.This cynical surrendering is not keeping bureaucracy at bay, at all. It&#39;s joining the bureaucracy and increasing its size. It is the bureaucracy.At companies that have competent managers up and down the hierarchy, it doesn&#39;t have to be like this. Good work can be judged by good managers, and rewarded, without anyone having to play bureaucratic games. There are companies, mostly smaller, that work like this.It seems to reliably fail as companies scale, but for each company it might fail at a different point. The longer competent management can be maintained, the better chance of the company succeeding in a big way.But all it takes is one good manager hiring a bad manager and the whole thing can start to fall apart. Once the company culture starts to reward people for playing bureaucratic games more than doing good work, it becomes broken and dysfunctional. Diseased.Everyone quickly realizes that the dynamic has shifted. That good work isn&#39;t rewarded any better than bad work that is well marketed internally.And so the best people, who have the most confidence and ability, go to smaller/better companies that know how to reward the people that do the best work. The other people stay and settle in for long-term escalating bureaucratic warfare.And these broken companies are left to fail or ride out the momentum generated before they were broken. All the while being miserable places to work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I actually experienced an interesting incident that made me switch from Charter with no intention of ever giving them my business again. They had upgraded their default speed in my area from 200 Mbps to 300 Mbps but you wouldn&#39;t get it unless you called in for them to increased it. Then a short time later they announced it as a increase to service at no additional cost and it would automatically take affect. Then a couple of months later they reduced again and said it was never an option. I was just so annoyed I switched to 1 Gbps service for an extra $30. I really hope that one day cellular or satellite gut them. Charter/Spectrum is one crooked company that should be sued out of existence."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"So that invites an obvious question: Why isn&#39;t the competitor available on that next street too?Some streets are more expensive to dig on than others.

And per this article, those gains are clearly coming at the expense of user trust and goodwill, something not reflected in click thru rates and RPM.Here&#39;s hoping we can get past all this invasive retargeting / surveillance / privacy-invading crap and get back to straightforward contextual ads, like car parts ads on a hot rod website - our world would be better for it, and maybe Google could restore a little of its rapidly fading goodwill."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There’s a huge privacy battle on the horizon in tech. The initial scuffles are just the beginning. Google and Facebook’s business models depend deeply on being able to track information that consumers are increasingly unhappy to share. Both companies attempts to diversify their dependency on such info for their revenue have been broadly unsuccessful (Google fiber or a Google car anyone?).Meanwhile the likes of Apple and others are taking a stance of making it increasingly hard for Google and Facebook to do what they want to via updates now advertised as “features” that protect consumers. As these documents highlight Google knows consumers want this privacy and it scares the $&amp;!&amp; out of them. Interesting days ahead."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;In addition, the researchers are investigating a gel or solution with the engineered peptide to treat hypersensitive teeth. This problem results from weakness in the enamel that makes the underlying dentin and nerves more vulnerable to heat or cold. Most common products currently on the market can put a layer of organic material on the tooth and numb nerve endings with potassium nitrate, but the relief is only temporary. The peptide, however, addresses the problem permanently at its source by strengthening the enamel.I want this so badly.I&#39;ve never had a cavity despite my poor dental hygiene habits and lack of dental practice visits but apparently I suffer from bruxism that can make half of my teeth hurt whenever I bite on anything harder than a wet noodle. Just now I brushed my teeth with a pain-numbing toothpaste and just the act of brushing my teeth made them hurt. Although sometimes I can go for some time without pain, it&#39;s been pretty much a constant in my life for the last years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The idea for the lozenge design originated with Deniz Yucesoy, a graduate student in the UW’s Genetically Engineered Materials Science and Engineering Center who received a $100,000 Amazon Catalyst grantThis grad-student/researcher just handed over a multi-million dollar business to Amazon in exchange for $100k towards the research. Why on Earth would anyone sign over 100% ownership of their idea, just to be able to test their idea? I guess he thought it would look good on his resume as begs a company for a job after graduation?Who owns the IP if I join Amazon Catalyst?[1]Amazon Catalyst is a place to see your idea come to fruition without the risk of starting a company on your own. As such, the IP that is developed in Amazon Catalyst is property of Amazon.[1][1] https://catalyst.amazon.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The lozenge produces new enamel that is whiter than what tooth-whitening strips or gels produce.I wonder how white?I&#39;m a bit nervous about having those over-whitened glow-in-the-dark teeth, that you sometimes see.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Estonian here. At Skype (10+ years ago) I observed, that members of large cultures (American, British, Hindu etc.) had real trouble adjusting to the predominantly Estonian-based engineering culture. Probably because they had never had to adjust, commonly people adjust to _their_ culture as it tends to dominate large organizations. But once they did make an honest attempt, that was always most welcomed and gained them a large amount of goodwill. Our US CEO going to a sauna with 20 naked engineers...I’ve also seen the “how are you” thing described in comments unfold.A Hindu pm had the habit of sitting next to developers while they worked, sometimes putting a hand on their knee. After being politely explained  that the size of an Estonian personal space is measured in astronomical units and that this was the reason devs literally scattered upon his approach, he immediately changed his behavior and became great friends with the team.A US lady came to hr complaining about an Ukrainian dev approaching them inappropriately during a party. The hr-person, having witnessed the situation, explained that this was just their way of showing friendly interest and no disrespect was intended. A while later, a Japanese guy came to the hr person complaining the original lady from us had hugged them. Again, it was explained that this is just what Americans do.Cultures are hard and take a lot of mutual respect to work through."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Plenty of contribution already,so I&#39;ll just add a personal anecdote. Some years ago I happened to have some beers with a Latvian Russian,who lived here, in London. He tells us that he doesn&#39;t get the Brits. He just doesn&#39;t understand the reasoning in some situations. I ask to elaborate. He says: last year, I had a pretty serious trauma and ended up in a hospital. It&#39;s so bad, pain, lots of tests,etc. And I&#39;m pretty fed up with all of it. Then, one day, a surgeon comes in, says hello and asks me &#39;how are you?&#39;. And I reply: &#39;really bad!&#39;. And suddenly surgeon&#39;s face changes: his eyes start moving faster,he looks at me and then observes the room,then at me again. Then the surgeon,in a slightly panicky voice ask me again: well what&#39;s wrong,is it the food? Is it the nurses? Did they do all the tests? What&#39;s going on?&#39; Then the Russian looks at the doctor and says: well look, I&#39;m in a hospital, I&#39;m ill as hell, I&#39;m in pain and you have the audacity to ask how am I? Are you crazy? It should be pretty clear that it&#39;s definitely not my day! The surgeon goes on to explain the subtleties of the question and etc. At that point I already lived in the UK long enough to understand the doctor&#39;s position but I also found the Russians point to be absolutely hilarious.From personal experience I find the Russians absolutely hilarious even without much smiling (the young ones smile more).They are somehow similar to Italians,who are also hilarious, but as is the case with the Russians, the funniest things tend to be equally tragic too. Kind of a never ending tragicomedy on full blast."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am Ukrainian. Came to the US when I was 14. I may never be cool like all the hard looking dudes in movies and whatnot but I smile all the time because either I find something funny in what I’m engaged in or if I don’t that I try to think of it as such. I have always been this way and I can’t imagine not doing it.Also, I have read a few comments in this discussion about how fake American smiles and “how are you?”s are and I have to disagree somewhat. To a large extent Americans use “how are you” and “what’s up” as generic greetings but at the same time you can often tell when someone is using it instead of “hello” vs having 30-120 seconds to chat pretty easily. If my day is going well I make a point of telling the random person I’m interacting with why that is: “I’m doing great. The weather is so nice and I had a lovely cup of coffee on my back porch today.” Quick interaction, mostly meaningless, but to me it’s a nice way to break up the monotony. On the other hand if I’m having a bad day I don’t feel like hiding it but the trick is to not make it the other person’s problem: “I’m getting by. I blew a tire on the way to work and I just had all four tires replaced. But oh well, that’s just how irony works I guess.” Again, quick and simple and not the typical “fine” response. At worst they go “oh that sucks. Paper or plastic?” but more often it could result in a short conversation and I don’t think there is anything wrong with that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can’t wait for electric motorbikes to be more diverse and advanced.I used to be a “my loud exhaust helps me to be seen” kinda guy. Until one day, sat in standstill traffic in my car on the M74 motorway just outside Glasgow, a rider on a BMW S1000XR, with the same loud exhaust as on mine, filtered past the window and I didn’t hear him until he was level with my rear passenger door.Exhausts sound great, i love the sound of a nice engine, it’s utterly intoxicating but it turns out that modern insulated cars block out the noise too well to make them useful as an awareness tool.So, i’m fine with a silent electric bike from a safety point of view. The exhaust noise was a false comfort blanket that deserves no faith put in it as a device to be better seen on the road."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really interesting concept. I like the general lines of the bike. Looks really well thought out/clean sheet mechanical design.Two points of contention:1) 
After putting over 40k+ miles on various bikes, I never once wished there was a self balancing feature to make it stand up on its own. At a stop light; I put my foot down; at a really long stop light, I put the kickstand down.If the self balancing feature can function as form of driver aid. Meaning you declarivity tell the bike &#34;I want this line with this apex&#34;; then the bike will follow through with it&#39;s active systems. That would be wild.2) 
The device right behind the rider gives me goosebumps. In a crash; seems like a great way to break your back and be pinned in the bike.Background data:MechE background. Owned and crashed high CC several motorcycles. I&#39;m doing totally fine healthwise; just really lucky."</p>

That will download the file locally with that file name.- Put the file on Dropbox or something that will get it to your phone.- From dropbox on iphone, share and export the file, then choose your podcast app. The podcast app that worked for me is &#34;Pocket Casts&#34;.- Now in Pocket Casts -&gt; Profile -&gt; Files, you should be able to play the mp4s with nice podcast-style controls and learn physics and be happy!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I know what building an MMO is like, having worked on one 10 years ago that was already 10 years old and still exists today (small audience though).Building something like these people are talking about requires more $ than a Marvel superhero movie to get anywhere. We could manage about 100 simultaneous players visible to each other in a reasonable time but no more; the internet is not fast enough to manage more than that many &#34;people&#34; with anything resembling real behavior, even then its hard to maintain the illusion of fluidity with the random latency of so many streams using prediction. Supporting millions of users like these people claim is fantasy even if you only saw a handful. Maintaining state in a single world at that volume is impossible with real people (you can fake a lot of &#34;AI&#34; characters but not actual players). There is reason why most MMO and similar games limit the number of players, or like Eve throttle the game time and slow everything down if too many ships appear in the same place (not possible in a &#34;on ground&#34; sort of world).Also building something of this magnitude and even getting it to do even a small subset of what they want requires people with lots of experience, as this is highly complex and specialized programming, not to mention an enormous amount of art creation, lighting, audio, story and other content, unless you go the No Man&#39;s Sky route and generate everything. But they don&#39;t support huge numbers of&#34;local&#34; players either."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been following the DreamWorld saga on YouTube for a hot minute now, mainly because I find it so interesting how they got through the YC vetting process when I myself have applied twice (maybe 3 times) and I also know plenty of people -- brilliant, motivated, entrepreneurial folks -- that applied many (many) times as well and were rejected (YC is mega-competitive after all).IMO, it&#39;s a bit insulting to the struggling startup community at large, and not to mention damaging to the YC brand."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There was a recent submission saying the same things:DreamWorld (YC W21) MMO raises all red flags - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26898266 - April 2021 (195 comments)I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s driving this, but I&#39;m not inclined to moderate the current thread in any way, even though the title is breaking HN&#39;s rules egregiously, as I explained here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27321926.The reason is that we moderate HN less, not more, when YC or a YC startup is the story: https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;qu.... It&#39;s important that when people accuse us of manipulating HN to serve YC—as internet users, you know, kind of do from time to time—we can answer in good conscience (https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;que...). Taking lumps like this are the price we pay for that. This a low-quality drama story that normally wouldn&#39;t clear the bar for HN&#39;s front page even if it weren&#39;t a quasidupe of a thread from a month ago.Moderating HN less, however, does not mean not moderating at all—that would be a loophole you could drive a truck through. If and when the story comes up again, we&#39;ll probably start moderating it closer to the standard rules that we&#39;d apply to any similar story: when it&#39;s an ongoing saga, we downweight follow-ups unless there is significant new information. Here are the relevant links about all that in case anyone wants to know:https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;so...https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sor...https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;so..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting to read this here. When my son was born (naturally, normal weight, fully healthy, and around expected due date), the midwife in Denmark had educated us about the Danish way of handling the birth - as soon as the baby comes out, they literally put the baby on mom’s chest, and leave us(parents, and baby) alone in the room for about an hour. Nothing needs to be done other than the baby being in care of it’s parents! They believed it helps the baby form a natural bond, but also acclimate to the outside world better than being whisked away and cleaned.It was such a lovely experience. One of the many things I am thankful to Denmark for.Several things that I was surprised to learn while going through this in DK.1. Childbirth is handled by midwives (Jordemothers) instead of doctors. Doctors are brought only when medication or any treatment is necessary.2. Child birth is considered a natural process and never treated/thought of as a sickness or medical condition. This is reflected in the whole process.3. The social healthcare system works great. It changed my perspective even more. Not having to think about hospital bills or insurance leaves us parents to enjoy the arrival of our little one.4. If everyone in the country, regardless of their current financial condition gets such an experience for their childbirth, I will gladly pay my taxes, and never complain. Healthcare should not be a business imho."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting.Our baby arrived 10 weeks premature and although it wasn&#39;t immediately after birth (as I&#39;ll explain why below), the hospital strongly encouraged the kangaroo care as mentioned in the article, which mom did daily until we could take our baby home.In a week it will be a full year since birth and the baby is in no way behind developmentally compared to other 10 month olds (when adjusting age due to prematurity). So although anecdotal, I can believe this can be a very helpful practice.Due to arriving mid-pandemic and because neither of us had COVID tests prior to the unexpectedly premature birth, we weren&#39;t allowed to visit the baby in the NICU until our tests came back negative, which was about 30 hours later. I wasn&#39;t even allowed to be with mom during delivery, but the doctor did allow me to see the baby for a couple of minutes from a distance and under the proviso that I touched nothing in the NICU (including things like walls, windows, doors, handles, etc).Anyway, somewhat superfluous information at the end there, but it was quite an experience and I&#39;m just happy everything turned out fine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I received the opposite care. Was delivered by C-section, no contact with anyone while in incubation for several weeks. My mother would often tell the story of how she was unable to touch me for weeks after my birth.45 years on and I haven’t a single bond, not with family, not with friends, not even with animals. Like a ghost floating through the world with no attachments and seemingly no compelling interest in them. Active avoidance is on point. But don&#39;t be sad for me. It&#39;s just the way I developed. And the lack of bonding, skin-to-skin contact with my mother is one possible reason.They’ve tried to make a number of diagnoses fit, from autism to Schizoid Personality Disorder, Bipolar to Asperger&#39;s. Nothing. Nothing fits. There&#39;s nothing wrong with me except that I don&#39;t bond, at all.One of the more disturbing experiences was watching what happened to chimpanzees when their mothers were taken away from them after birth (or were denied bonding entirely). They rock back and forth with anxiety; they grapple for the nearest comfy thing; more rocking. It was like watching myself. I&#39;m typing this 45 years later holding a pillow for comfort. You&#39;ll rarely see me seated without one. I rock all the time. The pillow, the rocking. They fill a hole. It&#39;s protective somehow. I&#39;m sure a shrink would say it reminds me of the womb that was stolen from me.And I know I&#39;ll live the rest of my life like this, without bond, alone, and not really sad because of it, just totally missing what compels others towards their own kind, to bond.So, yeah, more skin-to-skin sooner. No more lost people like me. Again: not sad about it, but life without others 
(and very much not wanting them) can be a severe challenge. You have only yourself."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is the kind of failure mode that I imagine (now with hindsight) should be mitigated by (re)designing the system in such a way that the timestamp desync would always be detected because each part of the system should have its own internal model of the approximate times that it should be receiving from other systems and never blindly trust them.I imagine it is sort of like the organisms early in evolution that simply believed their sensory system when it had in fact been hijacked by something that wanted to eat them. There aren&#39;t many sensory systems with those issues these days because anything that doesn&#39;t have an internal model that it can use for comparison winds up being a snack or crashing on an alien planet."</p>

Fortunately my system is data-collect only so the worst outcome is some wrong filenames.I learned only way too late in the project that most GigeVision cameras emit timestamps that can be synched using NTP and/or PTP. The camera specs/manual said nothing about this. Only found it by accident looking through the GeniCam XML API.Moral of the story: ensure your cameras emit timestamps on device. Don&#39;t rely on system time."</p>

He&#39;s an _incredibly_ thoughtful person and provides good lessons in staying focused and keeping scope down.I consider him a mentor and his approach to software is something I really resonate with. He has a keen focus on software quality but understands he can&#39;t make everything perfect in one sitting. This approach helped me get away from decision paralysis in my projects and at work.This isn&#39;t even mentioning how much I&#39;ve learned about software in general from his videos. Whether it&#39;s debugging kernel bootstrap assembly, porting doom, writing a live feedback GUI editor, implementing syscalls, to messing around with the dynamic loader. He&#39;s really got a video for it all.And he tackles each video with such clarity and careful consideration.

I remember seeing your project pop up here (early 2019 I think?) and just being absolutely blown away by the undertaking. What I love most about the project after following it since though is you&#39;ve really shown it&#39;s absolutely doable, not only by you or superstar programmers but by folks willing to put the time in, and along the way made so many others realize this whether they contribute to Serenity or not. Your YouTube videos are absolutely great and there is just something about it all (probably the &#34;under one roof&#34; philosophy) that makes showing the &#34;adding/fixing this little piece&#34; so much more consumable. In short, thank you for doing all of this for not only yourself but everyone else now involved with the project.Anyways I always told myself I should chip in for all of the great content over the years and so now I&#39;ve joined your Patreon - here&#39;s to hoping more are able to as well and you can continue living the dream!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"THIS IS SOOOOO INSPIRING.With all the FAANG and the Leetcodes and promotions and L6 - L7 TC and all of this nonsense, true hacker spirit and the fun of just building cool stuff with technology has gone from the hacker space. In fact, the hacker space is actually shrinking.Projects like these and people like Andreas Kling, are a beacon of hope and light during these troubled times.May more people be inspired with this and commit to the path of a true hacker."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Covid has got me thinking about the government’s role in social welfare.Providing social welfare through money allows for people to misallocate the money or skim off the top of the money. For the vast majority of people their covid stimulation money did not go into their pockets, it went to their landlord or their mortgage holder resulting in a massive wealth transfer from public funds to banks and those who own land.I think the government should directly supply the basic needs of its citizens instead of using money as an intermediary for supplying social welfare. Money is only a means to an end for obtaining the basic necessities to live: you cannot eat a dollar bill for nutrition or sleep under a dollar bill for shelter. Government provided housing and food should be available to any citizen — no questions asked. At that point you can get rid of all welfare programs since the government is directly supplying the basic necessities for those in need.People would still be incentivized to work in order to obtain luxuries which are not supplied by the government: a private house, travelling, a car, etc.Stories like this further affirm that handing out money is not a good way for the government to provide welfare."</p>

So how is the ossification broken?Every app has to implement it itself rather than calling a syscall and letting the OS deal with its complexities (same as for TLS, making fewer apps implement it without a lot of extra work). Which also increases context switching. In the future more protocols will be built on top of QUIC, expanding the user-space stack, increasing fragmentation of application-space IP stacks. And are network cards now going to start implementing it?It&#39;s painful to watch us stride headlong into the future depending on band-aids because surgery is too complicated."</p>

This makes their queries super complicated with multiple joins.Once you have the schema figured out, it&#39;s dead easy to build a third-party client that works better than the official one. Even search works great with a simple LIKE query but Apple re-indexes all messages leading to your CPU going over 1000%: https://twitter.com/KrauseFx/status/1396433852126670852Source: I built a third-party desktop client for iMessage at https://texts.com and reverse engineered the complete sqlite structure."</p>

These old conversations take up several gigabytes of space, yet there&#39;s no good way to search them (because search for old messages is unreliable).This aspect of the iMessage user experience has remained untouched for a decade, despite everyone&#39;s chats growing longer. Searching for particular iMessages sucks because the results miss the broader context of the conversation (a single message is not useful when you want to reread a conversation).(Also just noting, as the post author I created a title better-suited to HN&#39;s 80 character limit.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There’s a question as to why that fake consensus emerged. But I think the more troubling question is: How did people let the original story of what Tom Cotton even said go so badly awry? Essentially Cotton said something that was then transformed into a fake claim of a Chinese bio-attack, then the fake claim was debunked, and then the debunking was applied to the real claim with little attention paid to ongoing disagreement among researchers.I think this part of the text really sums up everything I hated about reading the news and social media in 2020. Each site seemed to be funneling you into a single source of truth and way of not only thinking, but FEELING about an event. I don&#39;t like being reminded of corporate sponsored social movements if I open facebook/google/amazon/twitter. I don&#39;t want my app reminding me to vote/get vaccinated(I did both btw) every time I open it without a way to dismiss and select &#39;I already did, stop reminding me.&#39; I don&#39;t want reddit creating a central sub-page for discussing [Current Event] within the narrow bounds of what their moderators think is acceptable. I don&#39;t like non-dismissable context text on twitter and under youtube videos that are often off topic and triggered by bad speech detection that simply take you to a link dump of regular news articles. I don&#39;t like the idea that there&#39;s an oligopoly on &#34;truth&#34; and &#34;credible sources.&#34; No amount of branding will convince me that &#34;fact checkers&#34; are any more objective and impartial than regular newspaper columnists; fact checkers are what editors are supposed to be. There&#39;s no academic rigor to fact checking, and the reality that so much casual skepticism on a variety of topics was suppressed and equivocated with being a flat-earther is sickening."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m not necessarily worried about climate change per se. It will result in hardship for many, for sure. Temperature changes will render some areas uninhabitable, it will cause mass migration, and probably destabilize the world politically.What am more worried about is the direct wholesale destruction of the biosphere. There are absolutely bonkers numbers about extinction, ocean acidification, runaway permafrost melt that actually could choke out a majority of people.Worse still, these effects aren&#39;t easily solvable by stopping emissions, or blocking out the sun with mylar sheets, or any of the &#34;low hanging&#34; technological fruit -- the stuff that could be solved with today&#39;s space technology or electric car tech.In order to actually solve these &#34;deeper&#34; problems, we will need an absolutely massive bio-engineering effort that is probably only possible with some kind of entropic breakthrough.Evolution is basically hyper-organization, a point of locally super low entropy that only happens by hundreds of millions of years of energy expenditure. When a species dies, it&#39;s not those individuals, it&#39;s every one of those individuals that ever lived that dies. All that concentration of local entropy, destroyed forever. It&#39;s like using every GPU on planet earth to train a hyper-smart GPT-4, for many human lifetimes -- and then hitting rm -rf on the weights."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Climate change is real, we are warming up and should/can solve this, but I&#39;m skeptical that apocalyptic narratives help the cause.&#34;A senior U.N. environmental official says entire nations could be wiped off the face of the Earth by rising sea levels if the global warming trend is not reversed by the year 2000.&#34;https://apnews.com/article/bd45c372caf118ec99964ea547880cd0"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We&#39;re definitely going to go beyond 2ºC in the coming decades.Even if a miracle happened and we stopped all human emissions today, current GHGs in the atmosphere will keep trapping more heat for some decades. This is known as climate inertia or climate lag.Another aspect I don&#39;t see frequently mentioned are feedbacks. Again, even if we stopped all emissions today, self sustaining climatic systems will keep adding more heat to the atmosphere (methane, etc) or the sea (Arctic ice melting).We&#39;re currently at aprox 36 billion tonnes of carbon emissions per year [1] only counting fuel burning. It would be a miracle if we could even reach 50% of that in our lifetime, which was aprox the emissions from the 70s.[1] https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel like I must be living in an alternative reality from the Twitter deriders in this thread, I&#39;ve had almost the exact opposite experience. I&#39;ve made more friends and acquaintances on Twitter than any other social network. It&#39;s also easily the most intellectual social network. (If that sounds crazy, really compare it to the others. They&#39;re either not intellectual or [youtube] not really social.)If you care deeply about something, you will find other people on Twitter. If you work in public, people will find you. Someone right now I met from Maine is currently drawing up the plans to teach me to timber frame a structure I just got approved. About 20 people I met from twitter have been over my house (for dinner, etc) at different times. Far more people read my work because of Twitter.If you don&#39;t use it as a political mouthpiece it&#39;s incredible and there&#39;s nothing like it. And that&#39;s really up to the user."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a reasonable twitter following (between 5-10k followers) and have recently realized that I needed to remove the app from my phone and only occasionally check it from time to time on a laptop. I&#39;m considering giving it up all together.I&#39;ve struggled a bit with this decisions since I&#39;ve made a fair number of real friends through twitter (people I keep up with in real life after) and come across a lot of interesting books, papers etc.But I&#39;ve come to realize that despite its benefits, twitter is ultimately toxic to your mind. I&#39;ve seen far too many people I care about slowly dissolve into a fever of dopamine fixes as they slowly contort their personality into a stream of memes and rants looking to gain followers.I always tried to fight the urge to post stupid shit just to grow followers, but anything genuinely nuanced or thoughtful you post will have virtually zero engagement. This is fine in isolation, but it leads all conversations to eventually degrade in to a miasma of garbage thinking that is just a mix of groupthink, rage and memes.The final straw for me was finding myself angry about the vague opinions of people I don&#39;t really care about at all. This same type of thinking is what got me to drop facebook entirely years ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My main issue with Twitter is that you follow people, but those people have different interests. So I may follow @JohnSmith because he’s a known dev in the JS community and tweets about JS, but he also tweets about his country’s politics, what he ate at lunch, and engage in heated debats about pineapple on pizza I don’t care about.Twitter recently introduced topics, so that you can follow one topic that aggregates lots of tweets from various people.
This is not what I want: I’d like to follow @JohnSmith, but only for the JS content.As someone who tweets, I’d like some sort of kafka-ish topic queues: I would post tweets about JS in the JS queue, and tweets about Italian food in that other queue, so that people could follow the queues they want. In the end I don’t tweet on either topic because I’m afraid I’ll deceive people who followed me for the other content."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is great and I wish this mentality was pushed earlier on reddit.There was a golden era of reddit right before the great Digg migration. Excellent comments, diverse opinions, and really great back and forth being shared of individual&#39;s experiences in almost every single subreddit.Today, it&#39;s definitely harder to find good commentary and exchange. It&#39;s also super heavily astroturfed by political groups in all the subreddits (on both sides) to try to influence the general groupthink narrative/consensus. It&#39;s so disgustingly obvious but doesn&#39;t seem to be an issue for the team.Maybe I am just getting old. I guess what I&#39;m try to say is nothing will beat simply Google searching a topic and typing &#34;reddit&#34; afterwards to query some super insightful and awesome 5+ year old forum post on whatever the content is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People keep saying how great Reddit is, but I tried signing up to a bunch of my &#34;Niches&#34; and all the posts where just low quality junk; for example every other post in the 3dprinting subreddit is just &#34;MY FIRST PRINT!&#34; or &#34;I BOUGHT A THING!&#34;  and for some reason people think it&#39;s cute so they upvote it.  EDC?  here is another picture of my gun!  Tech reddit; &#34;here is a link to a medium post that you can&#39;t see unless you subscribe!&#34;.And the rest of the posts are just people re-asking the same questions over and over because they can&#39;t be bothered to search.Reddit is just a fire hose of low quality content."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I did to improve my reddit experience:1. unsubscribe to all the big default subreddits, like askreddit, funny, etc (don&#39;t worry, you can still check them out if you want).2. go to r/all and use the filter feature to block the most annoying content or popular stuff that you absolutely don&#39;t care about. I blocked politics subreddits, some memes, anime, communities for popular youtubers, some of the worse default ones. Just look at the current /r/all listing and block whatever you don&#39;t care about that appears in the first few pages, refresh and do it again a few times. I go back every once in a while to repeat the process.3. subscribe to specific things you care about. smaller communities are better, some of the large ones are better moderated than others.4. favorite a few (3-4) subreddits that are about things I want to check often.My home feed is mostly tailored to my interests, even if there&#39;s some fluff. Smaller subreddits I don&#39;t check often and appear there. Then I check my favorite subreddits for specific things, and there&#39;s r/all for the popular stuff.I find that general topics like tech, music, sports are usually bad, but more specific, not necessarily niche, are better (a sub about a specific framework, maybe, or about your hometown, favorite band, or favorite team). Moderation style helps a lot."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At a high level, I really like this. Some UX concerns are all that stop it from being amazing:- The mouse should be a pointer, not a hand. Not only is that the expectation when an element is interactive, but it helps with precision clicking.- The map almost made me sick when it starting moving. It needs to be slower and smoother. You already let people speed it up, but start slower.- Dragging the map should be possible. I wanted to scroll back to something that had moved off-screen, and the map dragged a few pixels, then snapped back. If it is supposed to be draggable, let it drag. If not, don&#39;t let a drag start  and then snap it back.But really, those concerns aside, this is a nice tool."</p>

Would prefer some kind of click/tap-state or gesture. More easily noticeable of an inconvenience on an ultrawide screen."</p>

Generally all these kind of approaches make your app invisible to screen readers.The amount of work Apple, Google and others have put into making all this work is staggering, and life changing for people who are blind. Please don’t throw all that work away in your apps just because you think some UI toolkit is shiny."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having several friends on the Apple a11y team, they really do work tirelessly to make the accessibility experience amazing. A lot of the engineers on that team have visual, audiotory, or other physical impairment as well, which is really cool to see and as a result they’re all really invested in making the product accessibility awesome.Personal favorite “Easter egg” in their accessibility utilities is the baroque voiceover descriptions for the built-in wallpapers. A current colleague of mine shared it last week as part of Global Accessibility Awareness Day - https://twitter.com/mattt/status/1395439320652148736?s=21"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There will come a day when Apple will lean in heavily on Accessibility just like they&#39;ve recently amped up Privacy in ads lately.I, for one, absolutely love this about Apple! Accessibility is a beautiful core value to strive for (Privacy and others too). But I particularly appreciate Accessibility.Good designs/affordances such as gestural trackpads or mouse cursor support on iPads are all accessibility features, except they cover a major swath of humanity rather than those traditionally considered &#34;less-abled&#34;.Disclaimer: I work at Apple so I&#39;m biased. More likely, my heroes at Apple such as Sue Booker are accessibility experts  -- so I&#39;m always fan-boying over these features!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few years ago, I ordered the cheapest six-axis robotic arm from ebay for about $100 that came with basically no software or motor-driver boards, so I did it all from scratch with a PCA9685 board, a basic kernel driver and some very hacky scripts from user space.One day I had some friends over for a glass of wine, and wanted to show off my creation. I invited them into my &#34;lab&#34; and placed my wine glass down on the desk so I could type a few commands with both hands.My rudimentary software had some motion smoothing once it was up and running, but upon initialization, if the arm was significantly displaced from where it had been when it was turned off, the PWM board would instruct the motor to immediately &#34;be&#34; in a position that required the arm to travel clear across the desk in effectively as little time as possible.In this case, where it had been previously happened to be where my wine glass was now, and the flimsy aluminum at high speed was enough to shear the stem from the glass and explode the bulb. Luckily the wine didn&#39;t get in any sensitive electronics, but I learned a valuable lesson about the difference between messing around with hardware vs software."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"About seven years ago I got a bright idea to build a quadcopter. I had experience with little $25-50 drones that bumped around the house with their fragile one-inch propellers, which obviously qualified me to build and pilot something significantly bigger.Off to Aliexpress and Banggood I went. I ordered a carbon-fiber chassis, big strong motors, ESCs, 3-inch propellers, a FrSky receiver, a Devention transmitter, an STM32-based controller, giant li-poly batteries, and all the cables and fasteners I needed. Over the coming weeks the parts trickled in. Finally once the whole kit had arrived, I assembled everything, connected the TTL serial, built the firmware, downloaded it to the controller, and like the brilliant software engineer I am, plugged in the batteries on my bench at home.Nothing happened. Those of you who have blown off fingers wondering why the firecracker under the Coke can hasn&#39;t exploded yet can guess what I did next.I examined the chassis closely and began fiddling with the cables and connectors. Again, like the brilliant software NOT HARDWARE engineer that I am.Evidently, I fixed the problem. Which caused four gigantic propellers to begin whirling around my hands and face. And four brushless electric motors to emit their usual high-pitched whine, which today I instinctively hear as them saying to me &#34;You god damned idiot. You are so ours.&#34;I was not injured. But that evening, I came close to slicing at least a couple things off my body. I hadn&#39;t appreciated the scale of the thing I was building, or the inherent risk in debugging it once I&#39;d slapped it all together. I shelved the project for years, eventually giving it to someone at work who claimed to know his stuff when it came to drones. I hear he&#39;s doing fine.Disclaimer: this story isn&#39;t about code or my own code. But I think it fits here because I approached dangerous hardware with the &#34;build, run, see what happens&#34; mindset of a software developer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few random thoughts here:* some better tools for searching, tagging, tracking my history, etc to allow me to better use and self organize their docs on &#39;mdn plus&#39; would be a useful service.  it may also give them some more insight on how people are using it and what areas are of bigger utilization.* tools to allow me to ask private questions in areas of their docs, with some prioritization for answers/responses.* IDE plugins - I think there&#39;s one for IntelliJ Ultimate, but not specifically from MDN.  Having more direct access to MDN info while inside my IDEs would be something probably worth paying for.  I suspect they may get some useful data on when/where people are having trouble.  I wouldn&#39;t even mind contributing some of my source code snippets back from within the IDE if it would help give more examples to MDN.* a couple years back, a friend started a podcast experiment of just reading MDN docs for javascript.  It was... a bit different, but trying out some other formats for their docs.  perhaps a Q&amp;A podcast where mdn folks answer some of the answers (taken from the paid-Q&amp;A bullet point above).  (but yeah, they fired a bunch of people last year, no?)$2-$3/month, if there were/are nicer tools to help me track what I&#39;ve seen, perhaps letting me add private annotations so when I come back I can jog my own memory... I would try that, at least for a while (I think I&#39;d get use out of that).  $10/month - for just some &#39;premium&#39; content?  Probably not.  $50/year would, for me, probably be an upper bound (unless/until I see more potential benefits).EDIT: had not seen &#39;down below&#39; - they have &#39;Bookmark and annotate free and paid content for reference across devices.&#39; as a feature - possibly along the lines of what I was thinking above.  Signed up for waitlist."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish they’d clarify if the money is used to support MDN or not. I wouldn’t be opposed to supporting MDN patreon style, and if it comes with “perks” like articles, sure, why not. But I would do this to support MDNs core documentation, not because I’m dying for technical deep dives.That said $10/mo is a bit steep for me. And in any event, if they don’t make explicit that the money goes to support MDN upkeep and development then it’s a nonstarter. I’m not giving Mozilla money to fritter away on another rebrand or whatever else they want to use it for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Obviously it would be nice if everything everywhere was always free, but docs and opensource suffer a lot from lack of sustainability when based on voluntary donations. Companies simply have no incentives to pay for anything.There are surely tens of thousands of companies worldwide, whose employees rely on MDN on a daily basis. There are poor startups among them, but many of those companies have pretty deep pockets. If just a small percentage of those employees ask their bosses for this $5/mo. sub, this can improve things considerably. For now everything is free, so no one has an incentive, or a way, to pay.As developers, we are collectively guilty for never asking our employees for anything which costs $$$. Many of us (me including) assume that asking for a few bucks sub is almost a crime. Or we don&#39;t want to deal with stupid bureaucracy and an arcane process to set up the sub.Personally I hope the experiment will work. Let&#39;s see in a few months.I think the best model would be something like: subscribers get the premium content immediately, other people with a few weeks/months delay. This would keep a healthy balance and keep the incentives in place for people to pay."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey Everybody,We are really excited to open source NocoDB today.NocoDB is an open source Airtable alternative.Github : https://github.com/nocodb/nocodbNocoDB works by connecting to any relational database and transforming them into a smart spreadsheet interface!NocoDB currently works with MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite, Amazon Aurora &amp; MariaDB databases.This allows you to build no-code business solutions collaboratively with teams.Getting started is simple :    docker run -p 8080:8080 nocodb/nocodb
    or
    npx create-nocodb-app


Also NocoDB&#39;s app store allows you to build business workflows on views with combination of Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord, Twilio, Whatsapp, Email &amp; any 3rd party APIs too. Plus NocoDB provides programmatic access to APIs so that you can build integrations with Zapier / Integromat and custom applications too.For storage you can connect to S3, Mini, GCS, Azure, DigitalOcean spaces &amp; any S3 compatible APINocoDB gives programmatic access to REST &amp; GraphQL APIs. And with our API tokens it can be easily integrated with Zapier / Integromat.- - - - - -Also please join our community at :- Github : https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb- Discord : https://discord.gg/5RgZmkW- Twitter : https://twitter.com/nocodbWould love to hear usecases &amp; feedback.Thank you,Team NocoDBedit : made the comment short :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks more featured than Seatable I was looking into.
A few questions on features and plans:1. Are all the views mobile friendly,2. Any plan for a map view,3. Multiple views in a page? (aka dashboard)4. How does AGPL affect getting payed to create a solution based on this? I&#39;m not talking about offering it as a service as is  as happens with elastic, redis and the cloud providers.5. How do we create plugins?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great news. I don&#39;t know if anyone remembers this, but there used to be a program called Ecco Pro that Airtable really reminded me of. I haven&#39;t run Ecco in probably 20 years to more so I could be entirely off the mark, but the &#34;freeform spreadsheet&#34; seems really similar."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Klarna is no stranger to criminally lax attitude towards data privacy and security. In Finland, they implemented a checkout flow based only on your SSN (personal ID number). By simply entering someone else&#39;s SSN (which is not hard to guess/pry) you can reveal anyone&#39;s official home address.Further, they enable a &#34;pay later by invoice&#34; checkout flow, again by just knowing someone&#39;s SSN. Scammers use this to order items from web stores to automated pick-up lockers with someone&#39;s else&#39;s SSN for payment info. The victim usually only becomes aware about this activity when they start getting debt collection notices for unpaid invoices from multiple stores for thousands and thousands of euros. The debt collection process in Finland is famously unfair and harsh towards the supposed &#34;debtor&#34; (here: victim of fraud).Unless the &#34;debtor&#34; (victim) actively opposes each and every individual collection, the cases will eventually end up in court with summary judgement. This will ruin the victim&#39;s credit rating, which has devastating results for just about all aspects of life. People are known to have collapsed under the burden of all this and ended up taking their own life.Klarna&#39;s response to all this is that they want convenient checkout experience and some fraud is unavoidable. Although there are excellent technical means available to strongly identify users in Finland, they add a minor layer of inconvenience compared to just typing in your SSN. This is OK for Klarna since they give exactly zero fucks about security as long as they can make a little buck from it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At a large site I used to work for circa 2011, before everyone had gone fully HTTPS, we received similar panicked reports from users: &#34;I&#39;m logged in as someone else!&#34;  Turns out an ISP in the Philippines decided to just ignore `cache-control` and `vary` headers and forcibly started caching logged-in responses along with auth cookies. Bad times. Made it clear to me why the whole web would have to go HTTPS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked in a project over 10 years ago where something very similar happened!We had built and authentication service that, among other things, was used by a SyncML service that was used back in the day of feature phones to syncs contacts etc. You can imagine that getting someone else&#39;s contacts on your phone isn&#39;t exactly ideal. This was how we came to know about the problem, from customers getting other customers data!The error was caused by a CDN switch. Our instructions to the the CDN team responsible for the switch was &#34;Make sure the CDN honors our cache headers, if our HTTP responses say something can be cached do so, if they say that the response should not be cached then don&#39;t&#34;. We were in at least three meetings where we repeated this mantra.I believe that the CDN team thought that they had setup the CDN correctly but they had missed an edge case. The CDN was in fact setup to cache even uncacheable responses, and served those, _only_ when it could not reach our servers.So if there was a traffic spike and the CDN determined that our authentication servers were unreachable it would fall back to serving data that should never have been cached in the first place! Happily returning tokens to random users that had authenticated just before the traffic spike..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not to downplay the cultural importance of The Very Hungry Caterpillar – but can I suggest another one of Eric Carle&#39;s books?It&#39;s called &#34;Pancakes, Pancakes!&#34; In it, the protagonist wants to eat some pancakes – but he discovers that in order to do so, he needs to harvest and mill some wheat, milk a cow and churn some butter, and so forth.I read this to my kids when they were little, and it struck me as actually a pretty good lesson about how much work goes on outside of our house, in order to make Saturday Pancakes possible. But it&#39;s not presented in a preachy way at all – more of an excited way, like &#34;isn&#39;t it interesting how much background work goes into Saturday Pancakes?&#34;.I credit that book with getting my kids interested in food/cooking and much more than that as well – the seed of thinking about what has to happen for an Amazon box to show up at your door with a particular gizmo.So I&#39;ll pour out some pancake batter for Eric Carle on Saturday morning."</p>

Oh, and my partner’s phone and headphones too.Anyway - I’ve cables and chargers dotted around the house, plus some A-C ones for use with power bricks - and never had any grief powering/charging any device from any of them.

Today you want to watch an Apple show you must go to Apple&#39;s VOD.We could really use laws that force, once again, some sort of separation between production and distribution.

Looking at the (pretty!) picture [1], I  was shocked to see &#34;Wow, it&#39;s mostly storage?&#34;. Is that from going all flash?Heading to https://oxide.computer/product for more details, lists:- 2048 cores- 30 TB of memory- 1024 TB of flash (1 PiB)Given how much of the rack is storage, I&#39;m not sure which Milan was chosen (and so whether that&#39;s 2048 threads or 4196 [edit: real cores, 4196 threads]), but it seems like visually 4U is compute? [edit: nope] Is that a mistake on my part, because dual-socket Milan at 128 threads per socket is 256 threads per server, so you need at least 8 servers to hit 2048 &#34;somethings&#34;, or do the storage nodes also 
 have Milans [would make sense] and their compute is included [also fine!] -- and so similarly that&#39;s how you get a funky 30 TiB of memory?[Top-level edit from below: the green stuff are the nodes, including the compute. The 4U near the middle is the fiber]P.S.: the &#34;NETWORK SPEED 100 GB/S&#34; in all caps / CSS loses the presumably 100 Gbps (though the value in the HTML is 100 gb/s which is also unclear).[1] https://oxide.computer/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Frenders%2..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m most excited for the treesitter integration and its potential to amplify Vim&#39;s &#34;killer feature&#34;: text editing as a language.Vim&#39;s editing language feels most powerful when I&#39;m using its text objects: &#34;ciw&#34; means &#34;change in word&#34;, &#34;cis&#34; means &#34;change in sentence&#34;, and so on. But Vim&#39;s built-in text objects are not always a perfect match for the code you&#39;re editing. Suppose you want to change the first argument of a function, for example; there&#39;s no built-in &#34;first-argument&#34; text object. But Treesitter integration makes it easy to create text objects that understand the AST. Without much effort, users will be able to make mappings like `cia1` to &#34;change in argument 1&#34;, and these mappings will work across all languages with Treesitter support."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use nvim in the terminal and gvim/macvim on the desktop. I don&#39;t like how the nvim community seems to be throwing themselves wholeheartedly into lua and lua-only plugins (vimscript plugins are better because they work with both vim and neovim). Switching to init.lua also means losing all compatibility with vim, and I cannot fathom why people would want to do that considering that there is nothing that init.vim cannot already do.I also don&#39;t like how there looks to be an upcoming split in the plugin community when Vimscript 9 releases and the neovim community will ignore it while plugin authors in the vim camp (e.g tpope) may start moving their plugins over to it.That said, the built-in LSP for nvim is very good thing and I plan to migrate away from the node-dependent coc.nvim once nvim 0.5 releases."</p>

The topic of an affected channel I was in said: &#34;See also #foo on irc.libera.chat&#34; (as we hadn&#39;t decided whether or not to move). And everyone in the channel was banned from both the #foo and the ##foo channels on Freenode.Needless to say, Freenode kindly decided for us whether or not we should move to Libera for good."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very good to watch a “Hard Sci-Fi” show like the expanse. Not many of these out there.Not just the UI, but The tech is realistic and possible and usually backed up by basic scientific principles.The social scenarios are also quite likely in the future.Even the language makes sense - a kind of hodge-Podge universal accent.And it tangentially originates from Larry Niven’s belter stories just before mankind sent the ram robots to distant stars.The Expanse is everything to like."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the most unrealistic things about depictions of futuristic computer systems and UI design is that they almost always do exactly what the character wants with a minimum of hassle. No, technology in the future is going to cause as many problems and as much frustration as it does today. And those problems will be more keenly felt, because in space, your life depends on the technology working properly. There should be episodes where, for example, the main challenge and risk doesn&#39;t come from aliens or hostile humans, but from the fact that the OS running the ship&#39;s engines crashes and needs to be restarted every 5 minutes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember a comment by Adam Savge on one of his YouTube videos where he visited the sets. He also had a brief cameo in one episode (as a ceew member of the Arboghast, I believe), sitting at a terminal. He remarks that the terminal screen wasn&#39;t just showing a random animation, but had a fledged out menu system that changed screens on touch input. So he could actually &#34;use&#34; the station while acting instead of just making stuff up.As far as I know, a lot of films had only blank screens on set and the computer display was added in post, trying to match whatever &#34;interaction&#34; the actors came up with on the set."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a bit surprising, but hardly the biggest problem. I’ve posted before about it, but academic has to get away from the infantilism of using KPIs to judge creative intellectual work.Part of the problem is that people seem to want an objective evaluation of a piece of research, and measure the value for taxpayer money. Well, you can’t get an objective evaluation. It’s all subjective. And “impact” as a quantifiable entity in general is nonsense, for one thing the timescales prohibit its measurement at the point where it may be useful.The solution is to use management. Lots of people object here and say “but nepotism, favouritism” and yep that’s a problem, but it is less of a problem that the decline of western universities. You can circumvent it somewhat by rotation, by involving external figures, by a hierarchy that ensures people are not colluding, but ultimately you just have to trust people and accept some wastage.People aren’t in academia for the money. It’s a vocation. You’re not going to have many people milking the system. Things went pretty well before the metric culture invaded the academy. They can go well again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One way forward could be to lower the bar for publications.Once it&#39;s no longer about being in the esteemed and scarce &#34;10%&#34;, they won&#39;t bother because they don&#39;t need to. Imagine a process where the only criteria are technical soundness and novelty, and as long as minimal standards are met, it&#39;s a &#34;go&#34;. Call it the &#34;ArXiv + quality check&#34; model.Neither formal acceptance to publish nor citation numbers truly mark scientific excellence; perhaps, winning a &#34;test of time award&#34; does, or appearing in a text book 10 years later.I&#39;ve been reviewing occasionally since ~1995, regularly since ~2004, and I&#39;ve never heard of collusion rings happening in my sub-area of CS (ML, IR, NLP). I have caught people submitting to multiple conferences without disclosing it. Ignoring past work that is relevant is common, more often our of blissful ignorance, and occasionally likely with full intent. I&#39;m not saying I doubt the report, but I suspect the bigger problem that CS has is a large percentage of poor-quality work that couldn&#39;t be replicated.BTW, the most blantant thing I&#39;ve heard of (from a contact complaining about it on LinkedIn) is someone had their very own core paper from their PhD thesis plagiarised - submitted to another conference (again) but with different author names on it... and they even cited the real author&#39;s PhD thesis!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It has long seemed like there was soft collusion in academics anyway. There is plenty of complaining and suspicion about how bad and rigged reviews can sometimes seem to be. There are plenty of rumors of PIs who influence what gets published through back-channel alleys. But even in the absence of outright nefarious activity, there&#39;s a reinforcement cycle where bigger labs influence what papers get in, receive more grant money, and get better about influencing what papers get in. Even gently guiding what topics are acceptable, in the long term shuts out newcomers. Just about any graduate student by the time they graduate has reviewed papers in a &#34;double blind&#34; system where they could reliably identify the authors, there are always tell-tale markers and styles. It&#39;s really hard to find true anonymity.I&#39;ve been thinking on an off about review system that might improve on things. I&#39;m imagining perhaps: reviewers and authors both get to see who they are, and conflicts of interest can be called out by other people after review and before publication; reviewers are chosen at random, not allowed to bid; reviewers are sent a series of pairs of papers, and asked to choose which one they&#39;d rather see, scores and ultimately publication can be decided by rank choice vote rather than reviewer assignment; comments on paper improvement would be completely optional. Would this be better or worse than what we have? Would it deter explicit collusion?"</p>

The employe retaliated by using their moderately large social media presence to disparage my friend and her company.Strangely enough, other people with zero experience in the matter were piling on to support the claims.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a lot of bad advice being tossed around in this thread. If you are worried about having to jump through multiple files to understand what some code is doing, you should consider that your naming conventions are the problem, not the fact that code is hidden behind functional boundaries.Coding at scale is about managing complexity. The best code is code you don&#39;t have to read because of well named functional boundaries. Without these functional boundaries, you have to understand how every line of a function works, and then mentally model the entire graph of interactions at once, because of the potential for interactions between lines within a functional boundary. The complexity (sum total of possible interactions) grows as the number of lines within a functional boundary grows. The cognitive load to understand code grows as the number of possible interactions grow. Keeping methods short and hiding behavior behind well named functional boundaries is how you manage complexity in code.The idea of code telling a story is that a unit of work should explain what it does through its use of well named variables, function/object names, and how data flows between function/objects. If you have to dig into the details of a function to understand what it does, you have failed to sufficiently explain what the function does through its naming and set of arguments."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Finally! I&#39;m glad to hear I&#39;m not the only one.  I&#39;ve gone against &#39;Clean Code&#39; zealots that end up writing painfully warped abstractions in the effort to adhere to what is in this book.  It&#39;s OK to duplicate code in places where the abstractions are far enough apart that the alternative is worse.  I&#39;ve had developers use the &#39;partial&#39; feature in C# to meet Martin&#39;s length restrictions to the point where I have to look through 10-15 files to see the full class. 
 The examples in this post are excellent examples of the flaws in Martin&#39;s absolutism."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Worth noting in all of this that Belarus recently closed their land borders to citizens [1], under the guise of COVID, but in reality to stop people leaving. The only way out was flying from Minsk, which is now even less of an option if there are no flights to the EU.As others have said these sanctions will likely do more to harm the repressed citizens of the regime than Lukashenko[1] https://www.bnt.eu/cs/zpravy/pravni-novinky/3137-belarus-int..."</p>

decision has still to be made by the council, and then - to my understanding - implemented by all member states one by one. It&#39;s a typical example of media interpretation of facts.See here https://en.belavia.by/news/4674378/ -&gt; Belavia confirms UK and FR banned, but it was their decision."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As someone who used to be involved in the decision to not implement native context menus, and did a bunch of work on the non-native ones, I want to try to explain why this took a long time.It has nothing to do with engineering resources, and we always wanted native context menus, but they were not customizable enough to meet the perceived needs of web, XUL, and extension developers at the time. People expected to be able to change colors and layout with CSS, for example. The native APIs put heavy limitations on what you could do with a native context menu and it was just not compatible with the expectations of people building against the rendering engine at the time.There was some discussion of switching back and forth between native and non-native menus based on styling, but that got complicated quickly and it wasn&#39;t thought to be worthwhile.It sounds like perceived needs have changed, and maybe the native APIs allow for bit more flexibility now. Glad it&#39;s happening, excited to see how well it works!"</p>

I am a huge user of the macOS &#34;Look Up&#34; content menu feature and it being missing in Firefox always frustrates me.As silly as it sounds this might just be enough to get me to use Firefox as my main browser on macOS. I have played around with Nightly recently and love the new UI design. Can&#39;t wait for this to hit release."</p>

				</div>
				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27277819">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi HN! We’re Matt and Brendan, co-founders of Fig (https://fig.io/hn). Fig adds VSCode-style autocomplete to your existing terminal.We built Fig because of our own struggles in the terminal: we were tired of context switching between man pages, Stack Overflow posts, and Medium tutorials anytime we got stuck. We wanted our CLI tools to be more discoverable.The terminal is powerful, but unforgiving. It emulates the constraints of hardware (like teletype printers and video terminals) that became obsolete a generation ago. There are no built-in affordances. No hints about the &#39;right way&#39; of using a tool or even finding the right tool for the job. Beginners are thrown in the deep end. And even seasoned developers can screw up their system with a few unfortunate keystrokes.To solve this, we add a UI overlay that is linked with the interactive shell. As you type, Fig pops up subcommands, options, and contextually relevant arguments in your existing terminal. For example, you can type `npm run` and Fig will show you the scripts available in your package.json. You could also type `cd` when SSH&#39;d into a remote machine and Fig will list the folders within your current directory on the remote machine.We use the Accessibility API on Mac to insert text on your behalf and read what you&#39;ve typed. We also integrate with the shell to determine the current process and working directory. We are built natively for macOS in swift. We built our UI using web technologies so we can ultimately go cross platform. We render it using a WKWebView (not Electron).Fig is free for individuals and always will be. All completion specs - the templates used for generating CLI suggestions - are open source and anyone can contribute [0]. We plan to monetize by supporting autocomplete for companies&#39; custom scripts and internal CLI tools. Ultimately, we want to bring other process documentation (like SRE runbooks or deployment workflows) closer to the environment where it&#39;s used. You can see an early iteration of Fig in this HN thread from last July. [1]Fig is designed to be private. All processing happens locally on your device. None of your keystrokes are ever transmitted or stored by Fig.We&#39;d love to hear your feedback on what we’ve built! We&#39;re still in private beta (so things may break!!), but we are letting HN users skip our waitlist today and tomorrow using the link above! :)----Edit----We really appreciate all of this feedback! Brendan and I want to address some of the most common concerns below:Telemetry:
Fig has basic telemetry in order to help us make product decisions. We currently give the you option to opt out of all non-essential telemetry by running `fig settings app.disableTelemetry true`. This removes everything except for one daily ping. We use this ping to help us understand how many people were using Fig.Adding this ping was a mistake. We have already removed it and will be pushing this change in our next build (v1.0.43).Business Model:
Under the hood, we&#39;ve built an API layer on top of the terminal. This API lets you create visual apps. Autocomplete is the first app we&#39;ve built using this API. We have many more planned for things like interactive runbooks for SREs and automating deployment workflows. You can see some early prototypes here. [2] We plan to monetize these team-based apps by charging per-seat.Autocomplete will always be free for individuals. We will never sell your data.[0] https://github.com/withfig/autocomplete[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23766980[2] https://withfig.com/videos/old-sizzle-reel.mp4"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I detest that it has become normalized to grant tech companies access to personal data with only limp promises that it won&#39;t be misused.If you give Fig permissions to look at what you are typing into the terminal, you should be prepared for them to look at what you are typing into the terminal and use it how it best serves them. They&#39;re asking for more permissions than that of course.Imagine giving FedEx a copy of your house keys &#34;just so they can guarantee safe delivery&#34; without any legal recourse if the delivery people decided to help themselves to the contents of your fridge, or make photocopies of your documents."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am a software developer in the US with a Vietnamese origin, so I am no historian and my views are probably skewed.I am among the minority Northern Vietnamese people in the US, most Vietnamese people in the Bay Area are (refugees) from the South. People can tell where one comes from with one&#39;s accent. It was undeniable that much suffering and injustice was done for Southern people, especially after the war ended. So many still have a lot of resentments against the Hanoi government in particular and people from the North in general. Some still secretly view Northen international students in the US as red princes and princesses. The truth is far from that, they are just ordinary people looking for a better life. Many of the Northern people also have resentments with the current government as much as anyone else. However, I have to say much of the suffering and conflict is fading. I am so glad that in the last three years I was in the Bay Area, I have made many new Vietnamese friends, and have gone to many Vietnamese-owned shops buying groceries. I have not once had bad experiences with anyone in here. We spoke to each other and caring about each other despite of the differences.When I was a student in the US, I borrowed as many books and DVDs about the Vietnam war I could from the library and began watching to understand where I came from, and what to make of the war. I am still searching for the answer. One thing I began to understand is the reason that the North won the war. The people from the North did have a charismatic leader and more importantly, they had a sense of righteousness and revenge when they participated in the war. I still remember vividly, one day I watched an (American) documentary about a farmer after the 1972 bombing operation. The bomb killed all of his family members and all the pigs he raised and left him with nothing. He cried and vowed to fight till he dies. The guy had lost everything, he had nothing left to lose. That was the moment I realized it was inevitable that the North would inevitably win.I see that pattern a lot in places that talked about the war, for example in the article:&gt;She was only 24 years old but had been widowed twice. Both her husbands were soldiers. I saw her as the embodiment of the ideal guerrilla woman, who’d made great sacrifices for her country.I do not have as much exposure (or at least as much as I wished) to the literature, arts, and music of the South, but I can say that the sense of righteousness while fighting wasn&#39;t as strong in places that I have looked into.My (personal and flawed) conclusion is that it wasn&#39;t the policy, the brainwashing, or the political power of communism, or the help of Russia that made the North win. They won despite despite being poor as hell, they won despite being communist, and they won despite having lost more troops. They won because they took part in the war with a sense of righteousness.By chance, I just revisited the Vietnam war and the scar it left a couple of days ago, how much it matters in my everyday life, and wrote an essay about it on my blog. Here is the blog I wrote a couple of days ago about the war, btw, if you&#39;re so interested: http://www.tnhh.net/posts/lullaby-of-the-artillery.html"</p>

I am using FPDF with an EPS add-on, and after study of the PHP source, I was able to open the EPS with a text editor and reformat it so that it would successfully import.Unfortunately, it loaded upside down, so I was forced to flip and save again in inkscape, then repeat the formatting. This odd behavior is also present in the (downstream) TCPDF library, which appears to have close to the same code.Complain as I may, I didn&#39;t have to buy Adobe Illustrator."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At this point AWS has gotten so complex that one has to jump through a dozen hoops to get the simplest of things done.To scale up our reporting I thought it’s a good idea to offload report generation to a lambda function. Read from MySQL, dump into S3 and mail a link to that S3 file, make the link expire after couple of hours. Reasonably simple enough. But by God was it painful!! IAM is a rabbit hole, now later VPC restrictions on top and couple that with terribly organized document it makes no fun at all.I get the need for all those layers of security but without well organized document everyone has to go through the ordeal. What we need now is plethora of how-tos for these common architectural patterns."</p>

There were no hijackers claiming to have a bomb? Just ATC telling them they have a bomb on board? And instead of landing at the nearest airport of Vilnius they turned to take a longer, more indirect route to a further away airport of Minsk?This would seem obviously suspicious to me. If you have a bomb on board, wouldn’t you want to go to the nearest airport, not the one further away? Wouldn’t you ask why you are being redirected further away? Then wouldn’t the response when you point out you’re closer to Vilnius and for safety want to land there make it clear to you something fishy was up?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think what the CountThings app is doing is great. There are too many industries where tasks are being performed inefficiently due to a lack of applying readily available technology. They had the foresight to develop a product for a very common problem and make a business out of it.I’m a bit surprised that this is making the rounds of HN though. OpenCV and other computer vision libraries have trivialized such counting applications for decades now. ML isn’t really necessary.The watershed algorithm for example, comes built-in and allows segmentation which can then be followed up with blob counting: http://www.cmm.mines-paristech.fr/~beucher/wtshed.htmlI don’t want to diminish OP’s work since the product seems to be well-developed and respond to a real need. I guess the challenge must have been making the app robust enough to support different workloads, lighting conditions, etc. I suppose the novelty factor is seeing to what extent the technology that we as developers and engineers work on every day is often disconnected from practical application."</p>

Now on FreeBSD it&#39;s not default but it&#39;s there, and if you turn it on, you have to mark WX-mapping binaries by running `elfctl -e +wxneeded`.Firefox actually became W^X compliant all the way back in 2015: https://jandemooij.nl/blog/wx-jit-code-enabled-in-firefox/"</p>

I suppose a lot could go wrong, but only a few games seemed to have especially strong reliance on floating point behaviors to begin with, and I sort of expect the behavior of JITs to be influenced by the interpreter a bit due to the way things are laid out in dolphin.I tried porting a much simpler JIT to M1 and ran into the problem that Rosetta 2 was simply better at translating an AMD64 JIT than my attempt at a JIT. It could’ve been related to W^X performance, but I actually suspect the real answer is that Rosetta’s optimization passes were doing things the JIT did not do natively. I don’t know how to debug that, though, because from the debugger’s PoV, emulated processes look just like native Intel processes."</p>

And to be honest, I&#39;d appreciate it if you eased up off my back about it.”

A minigame with extremely vague description that you have to react to quickly to pass.Thinking about it some more it fails the primary criteria for a CAPCHA: it needs to be harder to write the bot that cracks it than each test case, by at least a couple orders of magnitude.  Otherwise bot makers will just create custom bots for each contingency.  They have more time and funding than you do."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The Wuhan Institute hasn’t shared raw data, safety logs and lab records on its extensive work with coronaviruses in bats, which many consider the most likely source of the virus.Nevertheless, the gain of function research with coronaviruses has been documented in the peer-reviewed literature.The lack of new information from the Wuhan Institute, despite its longstanding research activities, is probably the most compelling evidence in support of the lab escape hypothesis.If the evidence pointed elsewhere, it would be released. The most likely explanation is that the Institute&#39;s fingerprints are all over this thing.The second most compelling evidence is that to date the reservoir species has not been found."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The author&#39;s definition of what makes a &#34;decentralized application&#34; is too strong and I don&#39;t agree that email isn&#39;t an example of a decentralized application. She argues that it&#39;s not because it&#39;s really hard to run your own mail server.To me, &#34;decentralized&#34; doesn&#39;t mean every user has to run their own node. It means it&#39;s an open network, anyone can join, and there&#39;s no centralized control / censorship. You can buy a domain and use Proton, Fastmail, or any other provider to have your own email. If you become unhappy with them, it&#39;s easy to move. We have open specs that allow every service to interoperate, so you don&#39;t need to know or care what provider your recipient is using."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The decentralized applications don&#39;t need to &#34;win&#34; (in market share) to be successful. They just need to be viable alternatives for a non-insignificant number of principled people willing to use them. This is enough to ensure that big players are kept in check. It&#39;s a basic application of Taleb&#39;s &#34;Minority Rule&#34; [0]I don&#39;t care that gmail has the majority of the market. I care that Google can not simply break compatibility with SMTP/IMAP and force everyone into their version of it. And no, &#34;it&#39;s hard to self-host&#34; is not enough of an argument. There are plenty of smaller professional hosting companies and as long as there is an option this is enough to stop Google from monopolizing the market.Likewise, I don&#39;t care that Matrix still doesn&#39;t have a perfectly polished client. As long as it lets me talk and have video calls with my family and friends without being forced into WhatsApp or iMessage or whatever closed solution is popular, I&#39;m willing to deal with its inconveniences and shortcomings. Bugs can be fixed, privacy violations can&#39;t.Crypto as well. For all the talk about &#34;investment opportunities&#34; in crypto and the &#34;get rich quick&#34; schemes, there are still a good number of people working on it that understand that the important thing is to have an alternative to the existing financial system.The worst part of the article though is not that it presents a problem that does not exist, it&#39;s the proposed solution: political intervention and regulation always works out in favor of the status quo.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"All I can really say in response to this article is that I expect it to age poorly.2021 is just a bad time to make confident pronouncements about decentralization. The vast majority of the population is living in Facebook/WhatsApp/Discord/Visa&amp;Mastercard land, sure.But I&#39;m a heavy Matrix user, it works great. I torrent all the time: it works great. I&#39;m also on urbit, and it works great. I don&#39;t use Mastodon personally but I hear few complaints from people who do. Podcasts are fine, other applications of RSS are pretty crippled by bad defaults of only including a little bit of the blog post, but Substack at least doesn&#39;t do it that way, which has me using an RSS reader again. It&#39;s nice!The big elephant is the cybercoins, and it&#39;s just a weird time to declare them a failure. It&#39;s like no one remembers 2017, this has practically been a carbon copy, just with more institutional buy-in and bigger numbers.No one knows if cryptocurrency is going to fulfill the promise of becoming a global store of value, let alone if it will be Bitcoin or Ethereum or some dark horse: but it pretty much has to go from worth nothing to worth everything, and the middle stages of that are going to be weird.The one I&#39;m really betting on is Matrix, though. They have reliable income from the French and German governments, and plenty of motive to make a really good platform. I fully expect them to be as slick and featureful as Slack and Discord within a couple of years, and start to eat those company&#39;s lunch.&#34;Redecentralization&#34; is harder than the first phase of building a green-field decentralized Internet, because there are entrenched powers with a head start. But there are some compelling advantages to decentralized technology, with means, motive, and opportunity, to build them out.Yeah. Don&#39;t think it will age well. Let&#39;s check back in around 2031 and see what actually happened."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Vitalik is consistently one of the most interesting people to follow in the blockchain space. Even his (5+ year) old writing is quite interesting, if nothing else to see how Ethereum&#39;s research thinking has evolved over time.A few questions re: why &#34;Ethereum is not going further than quadratic [sharding].&#34;The first reason given: there&#39;s a minimum number of nodes required for shard for safety guarantees. So, a couple hundred shards, each with 1000 users seems like a limit. But I wonder: 10 years from now, if the blockchain (maybe pipe?) dreams succeed, then why do we expect 1000 * 500 = 5M nodes? This seems like it&#39;s quite small.Especially if running a node on a phone ever becomes reasonable, or at least participating in the data availability process is possible here, then why would we not go further?The second reason for non-super-quadratic sharding is data permanence. But here, couldn&#39;t we design different shards with different appetites for data permanence. Sure, NFTs currently are forever, but I can think of many applications where users do not give a damn about data permanence, and even some applications where users would prefer if data was just forgotten about.In which case, what&#39;s stopping us from saying &#34;these shards, we save. The other ones, who cares about.&#34; We would want users to opt into such guarantees, of course, but it seems reasonably possible.Of course, let&#39;s get a good sharded blockchain before we optimize for more.I&#39;m excited to see how sharding research continues to involve and drives the cost per TX (economic and environmental) down. Consider me a cheerleader rooting for you all!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has some really questionable assumptions.
Like the part about permanence.&#34;An important property of a blockchain that users really value is permanence. A digital asset stored on a server will stop existing in 10 years when the company goes bankrupt or loses interest in maintaining that ecosystem. An NFT on Ethereum, on the other hand, is forever.&#34;This is wrong 2 times.First, there is no general requirement of permanent storage. Its not important at all. It solely depend on the use case. Thats why it is very much inefficient to use a DLT with that property to move value (btc/eth etc.). I dont care how my coins was moved 10 years ago. The only storage that is relevant for me, now, for value transfer is the current undisputed state (aka the balances). Sure the Tx history has use cases and people who need them should store them but making that a technical requirement is only going to degrade performance and drive up Tx cost.BTW cash does not have a recorded Tx history who thought &#34;p2p cash&#34; should?
Its only because of the way BTC works (chain of all Tx) that this &#34;believe&#34; became common. Its technically not needed at all. There is absolutely no reason to recreate the whole chain to come to the current state. You either use the current state or you cant participate. If you would find an error in the chain whatcha gonna do about? Nothing. The current majority accepted state is all that matters. The &#34;validation&#34; is placebo it does nothing. And by running the exact same software as anyone else your validation would simply do the same error if there would be one.Second, the &#34;forever&#34; is a blatant lie. There is no way to know. Its will exist for however long at least someone is willing to store it. Exactly the same is true if storing is optional. But without the downside of crippling the performance and impose cost on the people running the DLT.
The cost for storage should be paid by the user of the storage.
If I can impose cost on all participants of a decentral system for all eternity with a one time payment then the system is deeply flawed. The possibility for abuse can be limited by simply making it expensive at any given time. But this obviously reduces the usefulness of the whole system especially for value transfer. The idea of an internet of value is to make value move like data, dirt cheap and decentral so no one takes a cut."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The really obvious weakness in any blockchain setup is the software. Whoever controls the software upgrade channel will always have potential control of the blockchain, whether that&#39;s the official entity in charge, or some intermediary.If you want really widespread distribution of full nodes, you need to make a consumer-friendly distribution of the node software, and package it and keep it updated in a way that regular users can run it and forget it. This same convenience introduces a centralization problem that obviates the whole point of running a distributed ledger.This is a point so obvious I hesitate to make it, but I&#39;ve learned that in blockchain territory there is no flaw too obvious to point out."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Even if you&#39;re a &#34;computer person&#34; who is comfortable messing with the internals of a PC, be very careful with the power supply. Opening it up should really be left to professionals. Capacitors can remain charged for a long time after disconnecting the power cord. If despite all the warnings, you open it up to fiddle with internals because you think you understand the components and can pay attention not to touch things, at the very least, use only one hand at a time to avoid creating a circuit through your heart.In most other parts of the computer the worst that can happen in most cases is that you damage the computer, the power supply is different, there you also have a good chance of getting shocked."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had some contact with PSU designers at a name brand server company and learned some things:1. Electrolytic capacitors: Only Japanese brands can be trusted (this sounds racist or something, but it&#39;s an actual requirement).  They all should be de-rated for reliability (have 2x the voltage rating).  Only exception is the main bulk filter capacitors, where your only reasonable choice is 450V, but these should be 105C.  Tantalum capacitors: not allowed.2. Main switch MOSFETs: only Infineon can be trusted.  Single active clamp / single switch topology is a no-no due to bad experience.  (I think the one in the article uses a diode clamp, so should be OK).3. Standby supply needs its own fuse.  The problem is that the main fuse is too big for the standby supply.  If there is a standby supply fault, you will fill the machine room with smoke and your brand will be mentioned in the news when machine room is shut down.  This destroys shareholder value.The current limit for any exposed 12V rail is only 20A or something line that (240VA UL limit), so you must not have exposed 12V when the server cover is open.There was basically a 100 page requirements document all along these lines."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some components, mostly capacitors, have the wrong hole spacing for their pins, and leads were bent to fit. That suggests part substitutions during assembly. Many of the through-hole components were not pushed all the way down into the board. That suggests overworked assemblers. This was obviously hand-assembled.The author makes a point that there&#39;s a clear division between the AC line side and the DC side. That&#39;s required for UL approval, but power supplies do show up without it. The power transformer that crosses the boundary should also have a split bobbin, so the AC line side coil and the output side coil are separated by a barrier, not wound on the same bobbin.There are worse power supplies.[1][1] https://linustechtips.com/topic/515473-teardown-and-review-o..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m adamantly pro dry-run and like OP I&#39;ve found that you really need to design for it. From my experience, OP&#39;s two main ideas are spot on: librarification and pushing dry-run logic deeper into library code.Here are two other things I&#39;ve found:1. Regardless of where you push your run/dry-run dispatch to, the underlying &#34;do it&#34; logic really needs to be factored properly for individual side effects (think functional). Otherwise, you inevitably end up with loads of &#34;if dry-run / else&#34; soup or worse, bugs _caused_ by your dry-run support.2. You still need safety nets for when someone is doing dangerous operations without dry-run. Pointing and calling [0] is a great trick for this. For example, say your tool is about to delete X, Y, and Z. Instead of a simple &#34;Yes&#34; confirmation which the user would quickly end up doing on auto-pilot, you could have a more involved confirmation like &#34;Enter the number of resources listed above to proceed&#34; and then only proceed to delete if the user enters &#34;3&#34;.Very curious to hear about design idioms folks have come up with![0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointing_and_calling"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At my work I&#39;ve gone through and setup a variety of &#34;replacement&#34; commands for commands that may have dire impact on production systems. All of these replacement commands dry run by default (or fake dry run/try to create a dry run the best they can) and require a &#34;--do-it&#34; (think emperor palpatine voice) flag to do the intended operation. I&#39;ve had multiple coworkers thank me for this setup as it&#39;s saved people from silly typos and mistakes, one such being the different handling of programs in the use of and ending &#34;/&#34; in folders. ex. &#34;/etc&#34; is different than &#34;/etc/&#34; sometimes for certain operations.I&#39;d like to one day see a global flag on operating systems to dry run nearly all commands that changed anything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Their example of pushing it into the type system is nice but requires a language with a fairly powerful type system. Once simple way to do this in basically any statically typed language is just requiring a &#34;Run Token&#34; for any bit of code that does something &#34;for real&#34;. This method works well if you want the output to be similar or identical for dry run and actual run.    struct RunToken;

    fn do_the_thing(_: RunToken, ...);

The general approach works for just about any statically typed languages (although null is the enemy).You can make it a bit more tedious to generate that RunToken so that a `do_the_think(RunToken, ...)` looks more natural. But the idea is simply that if the only place you create a RunToken is when parsing the --no-dry-run flag you can&#39;t accidentally do_the_thing when you move the code out of the `if is_dry_run` block without noticing.Of course this is a simple way to get fairly reliable dry run. I do agree that having seperate plan and apply steps is approach is the best when you can do it."</p>

Living in Palo Alto, it’s frustrating how hard it is.I’m thinking maybe, just maybe, introducing repairability laws won’t solve the problem.I am perfectly happy upgrading the memory on my MacBook Air with a reflow air station rather than swapping out some dims if it means my laptop is half as thick and twice as rugged. I’m also just as happy dropping my phone off at a corner shop to replace the glass (while preserving the same electronics) using an industrial laminating machine.My problem today is not that repairability laws impede my progress here (they certainly don’t exist in China either).My problem is I can only get the chips and schematics I need to effect the repair on the Chinese Internet (WeChat/Taobao) or find someone to do the repair for me for $40 on the Chinese street markets (Huaqiangnan in Shenzhen). When I go to a corner store in the US the “solution” to swap the whole sub-assembly (glass+electronics) not just glass in case of a screen repair for $100+"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple&#39;s fight against right to repair while pushing materials to the public that state they are trying to reduce their carbon footprint is the absolute peak of hypocrisy. I understand the closed off design of their products is a result of the Steve Jobs era, but why can&#39;t the current leadership make a change?Why can&#39;t Apple make their products easily repairable while making them aesthetically pleasing? The typical &#34;private companies must satisfy the shareholders&#34; answer is just a scapegoat. Truly innovative companies (and companies of Apple&#39;s size and worth) should be able to solve these problems. Doing anything else is just fucking laziness."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I genuinely do not want repairability anywhere near the top of the list of performance and design trade offs.Ruggedness, longevity, sure.  Avoiding need to repair, definitely.  Repairability?  Other concerns, things that change the day-to-day use of the device, should weigh more.Spent too many years as a full service PC network support small business to ever again want to deal with parts that aren’t actually attached to each other.  Connection issues (especially on heating and cooling, so intermittent) were essentially all the problems except a vanishingly small proportion that were components.The thing is, the repair shops get what’s left after the design is iterated until other problems are gone.  So maybe only these component failures are left.  Reverting to the old methods of replaceable components would likely re-introduce a massive class of problems that have by and large been eliminated.Only the remaining problems have a voice, who is advocating on behalf of all the problems that the last 20 years of more solid design eliminated?// Apologies for the HN trope, but see also Chesterson’s Fence, a tech version of “get off my lawn”."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I definitely identify with the author. A big mistake I made in the past was to assume that other software engineers are equally enthusiastic about these kind of projects, or the least bit impressed by them. I was asked for a job interview to prepare presentations on two projects I was particularly proud of. I chose a hobby Operating System kernel I&#39;d developed from the ground up, and a fully-functional MIPS assembler I had written. The interviewers (senior developers within the company) really just did not get it. Responding with questions such as: &#34;Is this going to make you any money?&#34;, and &#34;When do you expect this to be complete?&#34;. They really couldn&#39;t understand my motivations. I did these projects for no other reason than that I love programming, and I have never stopped loving learning about it. I have never needed to consider, or justify to myself why I did these things. I do them because I enjoy what I do.I ended up pivoting to discuss some comparatively banal professional project migrating a mid-sized financial product to a new tech-stack, which managed to captivate their attention. I found this experience extremely disheartening, however important a lesson it was to learn. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s changed my outlook in any way though, admittedly. I still work on the same kinds of projects, and I still think the best developers are the ones who do work on toy projects for their own enjoyment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since a little less than two years, I live from a website I built, and I have a lot more control over my schedule.Since then, I built a lot more useless stuff. I&#39;m the only user. I can hardcode things, introduce breaking changes, manually migrate data and so on. I can cut corners, or over-engineer everything. Other people can use it, but I don&#39;t care about what they think of my variable names, or which features they want.The turning point for me was the concept of apps as home-cooked meals [0]. If a gardener can grow flowers only he will see, I can write code only I will run.[0] https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The biggest reason to make useless stuff instead of useful stuff is to avoid harassment. If you have something useful on GitHub then entitled users will come out of the woodwork to request features, report &#34;bugs&#34; (read: the user is doing something wrong), or otherwise expect free work out of you."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi all! I&#39;m David, CEO @ Retool. I&#39;m looking in to this right now and will update my comment here with a response in the next two hours.Edit: just did a bit of digging.It looks like we have a Retool template that has some fake data in it (https://retool.com/api-generator/). This is an app built in Retool, and has a few thousand rows of hard-coded data.Most of this fake data is self-generated, but we used the faker.js library (https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/) to generate three datatypes: IP address, avatar, and industry. This MIT licensed library, when used, creates data that links directly to fakercloud (https://cdn.fakercloud.com/avatars/). Here is the code itself: https://github.com/Marak/faker.js/blob/master/lib/internet.j..., and here is a demo that shows the library generating those links: https://rawgit.com/Marak/faker.js/master/examples/browser/in....I just spoke to the engineers who worked on this project, and we are sorry for including links to fakercloud. This wasn’t intentional, and we just pushed a commit removing all avatars from the template. This is already deployed. I hope you all can understand why we trusted the data generated by the MIT licensed project, and didn’t think it would link to anything proprietary.I myself am an engineer (and avid HN reader, as evinced by how I found this while reading HN on a Sat night), understand Marak’s frustration, and agree that monetizing OSS is hard. While we’ve already contributed around $10k to various libraries we use (https://opencollective.com/retool), including faker.js, Babel, ESLint, and JSON Schema, I’m going to see if there is more we can do. We’ll be writing a blog post about it this week and I will follow up with more next steps. I wonder whether there is a better way of sponsoring OSS, other than just donating dollars every month?  (Maybe we could commit one engineering-day per month for contributing back to OSS libraries we use heavily?) In the meantime, we&#39;ll certainly continue sponsoring all the libraries we’re sponsoring already, including faker.js.(Also: I’m sorry to Marak for not responding to his email re. acquiring Faker. More in this child thread: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27252420)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate to be that guy, but idealism in software needs to die.Don&#39;t use a license that&#39;s more permissive than you&#39;re willing to tolerate.It&#39;s absurd to me for a project to publish something with a 100% open source license and then complain when somebody tries to profit off of it.Doesn&#39;t really matter how egregious or large the perpetrator is. If you want exceptions, write it into the license. People want the goodwill that comes with open source, without accepting the consequences.That being said, I do empathize with the plight of the author. Perhaps they were naive to this possibility."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Random bits of semi-related advice:1. If you wanted Retool to stop using your service, you should have said it up front instead of beating around the bush. From what I can gather from your emails, you sent their CEO a random sales pitch and he ignored it. Hard to fault him for that.2. I love faker.js. I have used it in the past, and I&#39;m sure several teams in my company use it today. I would, however, never ever pay for your cloud service, simply because taking a dependency on a third party hosted website to run unit tests is madness. The old school corporate software licensing model might be losing favor, but that does not mean it isn&#39;t apt for any use case. If faker.js was still downloadable but needed a license key to run I&#39;m sure people would pay for it. It would probably be the easiest thing in the world to bypass, but the same Fortune 500 companies you mention would gladly break our their checkbooks rather than risk getting sued."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Cook used more privacy and safety claims to defend that system, saying it would be both insecure and inconvenient to let apps process payments separatelyThis one is always funny to me, because sellers of physical goods are of course totally exempt from IAP rules, because it would be untenable otherwise.I can type my card number directly into the Amazon app and buy a paperback without any intervention from Apple.And yet it’s apparently insecure for me to buy a Kindle book with the exact same mechanism in the exact same app? Get the fuck out of here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only aspect of the Apple App Store that strikes me as truly anticompetitive is their prohibition on adjusting prices to include Apple’s fees, or even to tell the user what they are.I can accept that Apple can demand a 30% fee for billing customers on their devices. And I can accept that they would prohibit installation/sales of software any other way. But I should be allowed to mark up the price by 30% and then call it out as a line item.The fact that Apple can control what prices I set on other platforms and prohibit me from disclosing what’s happening to my users...That is the part of this that strikes me as dystopian, and that’s the area where I think antitrust and free speech laws perhaps ought to step in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I will not buy any device that does not give me control of the device. If I can&#39;t sideload apps, can&#39;t install a 3rd party store, do not have the ability to root my own device, I won&#39;t buy it. Apple has decided that&#39;s not allowed, fine, I won&#39;t buy their product. That&#39;s between Apple and their customers.But it is certifiably insane that Apple thinks they have the right to dictate to Epic what Epic charges for its apps on their store. If Epic thinks Fortnite is worth $30, and Epic charges Android users $30 for the binary to sideload onto their Android devices, and because Apple charges a 30% surcharge, Epic sells the same app on iOS for $42.86, and Apple says, &#34;no, you&#39;re not allowed to do that, you have to charge $30 just like you do on Android&#34; -- no. Absolutely not. Apple does not have the moral/ethical right to do that."</p>
