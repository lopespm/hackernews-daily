								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just to put this in perspective, the global population of mountain gorillas is 1,063, so this represents the symbolic adoption of over 3 times the mountain gorillas alive in the wild!I hope this unexpected boon in capital will allow for some meaningful work in preserving and protecting these rare animals.  It would be an interesting footnote in history if we can look back in 50 years and draw a line between an internet meme, reckless asset trading, and a change in the trajectory of the fate an endangered species."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The title is confusing, perhaps worth changing &#34;Reddit investors&#34; to &#34;Wall Street Bets users&#34; or something similar. I genuinely thought the article would talk about owners of Reddit, not it&#39;s users."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Generic question: I see a lot of news articles stating that WSB has &#34;10 million members&#34;. Does being a &#39;member&#39; go beyond clicking the &#39;join&#39; button on that subreddit? If so it&#39;s more like a &#39;follow this channel&#39;, isn&#39;t it?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have not significantly used Notion, but this isn&#39;t really a replacement for it is it?Notion seems to be focused on wiki and notes, with built in structured data allowing you to setup things like boards and task lists.This seems to just be the boards and task lists without the free form notes and wiki? It pretty clearly replaces Trello and Asana. Notion seems like a stretch from the 5 minutes I poked around in it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just downloaded and tested the standalone desktop app. It has a very pretty and responsive interface compared to Kanboard.I have been self hosting Kanboard on my rpi for my own work, and I think that Kanboard still has many &#39;poweruser&#39; features that Focalboard is missing.If there is an easy way for me to migrate my Kanboard data over to Focalboard, I would definitely give it a shot as a daily driver."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wonder if they have any sales to large enterprises or similar institutions.In my experience, the larger organizations will have a &#34;security&#34; questionnaire required of their vendors, and the person administering it is a droid, incapable of evaluating whether the questions, originally written in the mid-00s and only updated for buzzword compliance since, are applicable to modern security practice today, or to the particular product/service/vendor in question. And no firewalls or routers would be massive, disqualifying red flags on such a questionnaire.Never mind that a KISS setup tends to bring security because of its minimized attack surface. In the minds that write and administer those questionnaires, security only comes from sufficient amounts of the right kinds of complexity.I&#39;m sure it can be done. IIRC, Cloudflare doesn&#39;t use any firewalls, and they do some big business. It just isn&#39;t easy to get past the droids programmed to ensure that all pegs shall be properly square, IME."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I start the day with a short walk outdoors. I don’t want the first thing my eyes see to be print, and I don’t want the first thing my body does to be sitting. So I walk a bit.I like that. I like that a lot. That&#39;s a very enviable practice. I think I know what I&#39;ll be experimenting with this next week.Did not expect to read that article and have the most stand out thing be a routine change I&#39;d want to copy. You never know."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice article. rsync.net is one part of my personal computing setup that I never even think twice about. It&#39;s simple and it works, and that clearly applies to the infrastructure too. I use ZFS locally and it has made managing my own data strangely pleasing, and it&#39;s nice to have the same system on my off-site storage too.On the laptop-front, I find myself drifting towards a similar setup to John. I have a hefty workstation laptop but the battery life is dire and it weighs a ton, so I pretty much just run it as a headless machine next to my server now. I&#39;m planning on picking up a Pinebook Pro as an &#34;outdoors&#34; machine to just remote in. I also find myself extremely unwilling to arse about swapping multiple machines on my monitors so being able to keep my work machine separate and secure but operate it from my desktop is a nice compromise."</p>

				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26503572">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The idea was to create a tool to sort the named CSS colors in a way that it shows related colors together. So, next time I can&#39;t decide between a few CSS colors, I can just check them here side by side.I&#39;ve created this tool last summer, but I hadn&#39;t shared it here back then. It&#39;s a PWA that I made with pure JS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is definitely a cool way of exploring CSS colors.But, serious question: does anyone actually use CSS colors except for a handful of the basics (&#34;red&#34;, &#34;blue&#34;) for prototyping/debugging?I mean, the idea of typing &#34;background-color: lightsalmon;&#34; just feels so bizarre to me.Whenever I&#39;ve needed to come up with colors from scratch, I&#39;ll just start with an intuitive best guess -- e.g. &#34;hsl(30, 80%, 50%)&#34; -- and then iterate a couple times till I get what I&#39;m looking for.It seems like even more effort to try to select colors from the CSS palette when it might turn out that there isn&#39;t even a satisfactory one. The CSS colors are still extremely limited. E.g. the distance between neighbors like &#34;dark cyan&#34; and &#34;darkslategray&#34; is huge."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good reminder that in CSS, darkgray is a light gray and gray is a dark gray. Also presumably up is down and wet is dry."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; While our log analysis, conducted from March 5 through March 8, confirmed that this was a rare issue, it could not rule out the possibility that a session had been incorrectly returned but then never used. This was not a risk we were willing to take, given the potential impact of even one of these incorrectly returned sessions being used.It is funny how they make it seem like they are super cautious. When in fact they had no other choice than do it when you rephrase the problem as &#34; there were maybe some people who got the admin right of the github account of some of our customers&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well that&#39;s embarrassing. Passing a mutable dictionary—containing callbacks that could be closed over heaven-even-knows-what, no less!—between threads? And it&#39;s re-used between requests?They are lucky this wasn&#39;t much, much worse.Why does the error reporting service need to call the web thread back anyway?Yet another case where immutable-everything would have prevented this hairball from accreting in the first place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; One such performance improvement involved moving the logic to check a user’s enabled features into a background thread that refreshed on an interval rather than checking their enablement while the request was being processed.This type of thing is why PHP&#39;s shared-nothing model is vastly undervalued IMO.Does PHP have the ability to use threads if you really need it? Yes.Are they generally a PITA to use? Yes.Is this a problem for the vast, vast, vast majority of projects? Not in the slightest.Having a separate invocation of the runtime for each request is a feature, not a failing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a clever use of fuse/sshfs and chroots to allow you to run programs on remote computers. However, for many workloads, isn&#39;t the network I/O going to outweigh the benefits of remote CPU cycles?I really think this is a clever hack, but I&#39;m not sure how useful it is. Is it really good for the transcoding example? I could see that being good if the remote machine has a better GPU, but I&#39;m struggling to see how this could work for other use-cases. Maybe compiling (which was one of the main use-cases behind Sun&#39;s SGE)?I do most of my work on HPC clusters, so moving compute out to remote nodes is something I&#39;m very interested in... and I&#39;d love to learn more about what kinds of workflows the authors had in mind."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried an openMOSIX cluster back in the day when it was fashionable. Cluster-Knoppix could transform a bunch of old pc&#39;s in an instant SSI cluster with almost zero configuration needed. Though I know it is not the most efficient way, I miss the simplicity of it.A shell script that simply launches a new process on the most idle node of a network would be enough to get back some of that experience. Live migration would be even better, almost perfect for that. Hope some day I can easily build a bewolf cluster out of my ARM SBC&#39;s with an experience similar to the old days of Cluster-Knoppix."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"the problem with wanting to write biographies of failures is the same problem with publishing negative results in science: there are too many failures, and too many ways to fail. It&#39;s like entropy - there are so many ways to do something wrong that it&#39;s not very efficient to learn how to do something by enumerating all the ways you cannot do it. Much rarer is success, which is why it&#39;s more worth the time to study. Maybe this is a controversial opinion.Maybe adjacent failures are worth study - studies of people who very nearly succeeded compared to someone who did, where subtle differences ended up being significant. These kinds of things can create &#34;what to watch out for&#34; kinds of guides.In addition - what is failure? Was Nikola Tesla a failure? He died broke... but he still invented AC generators..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Henry Petroski has written several excellent essays and books about engineering failures, why it is inherent in engineering pursuits that there will be failures, why it is important to learn the right lessons from these failures, and why each new generation will forget past lessons.Start with: &#34;To Engineer Is Human: The Role of Failure in Successful Design&#34; (1985)"</p>

I&#39;ve found that 9 times out of 10 successful people follow the same advice and believe the same things as unsuccessful people (at least they SAY they do).

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thank you for licensing this under a proper open source license. Out of curiosity, how would you feel about a company selling this as a service? It&#39;s obviously legal per the license, but I&#39;m wondering what your perspective is. If you encourage it, do you have any plans for how to ensure everybody are happy and turns a profit from it?I have grown cynical over the years with these kinds of open source challengers as it seems to be a playbook these days to bait and switch, going from a) freely license a competitor to b) build a large user base to c) switch license to consolidate power over the software, make money and slowly kill it.Of course what&#39;s once open source will always stay that way, but if you&#39;re large enough when you branch, your engineering resources alone might be enough to turn people off the OSS fork."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Love it. This (your commercial product) will go in an MVP I&#39;m building. I&#39;ve been using Intercom, which seems like the best option, but it&#39;s just so damn expensive for an MVP and that top tier price is not met by their medium tier product imo.tbh I&#39;d pay even for the first agent (perhaps a free trial would have sufficed), but the Hacker tier does make it a certainty I&#39;ll trial it.Something most tool providers don&#39;t seem to get is that when I&#39;m first building something I&#39;m extremely price sensitive, but once I&#39;ve got going I don&#39;t really care, like a tax if you take X% of my profit but you make my life easier and make it easier to grow that profit, who cares? That&#39;s fine compared to rinsing me when I&#39;m not making any revenue (as with intercom). And if your product is any good, there&#39;s no way I&#39;m going to switch once I get some traction,  as the cost of any tool is ~ zero compared to the cost of employees."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want to share my own reactions to the name change since this is a really interesting topic. For context, I&#39;m an African American, so many of my ancestors were slaves.  - The first time it occurred to me that &#34;master&#34; in this context could offend anyone was when GitHub changed the name (and broke my workflow).
  - My immediate reaction was, &#34;this change is by white people for white people,&#34; where &#34;white&#34; means anyone who isn&#39;t black.
  - My next reaction was, &#34;they may be changing the name for the wrong reasons, but the change is brilliant.&#34;

Let me explain a little more. Whether motivated purely by virtue signaling or by more genuine intentions, changing the name doesn&#39;t fix any of the problems that black people face. The article explains this well.What&#39;s powerful about this name change is that it pushes us to alter a habit, in my case one embedded deeply in my fingers, something that I do every day without realizing that I&#39;m doing it. Thus it is a useful reminder of the implicit bias that contributes to the lack of diversity in tech. Never mind that the old name was harmless, the change brings repeated awareness to an important topic, and it reaches a the developer community in a targeted way.So, next time you are annoyed that you have to fix a script or you accidentally type master when you needed to type main, please just take a deep breath, change the name, and remember to reflect upon whether you have are subconscious habits or biases that work against diversity in tech."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very pleased that Audacity is still actively developed. I said it before but I think this can&#39;t be overstated:Audacity may had some quirks over the years but it&#39;s still one of the most (if not the most) accessible tool for audio editing by non-professionals with an adequate feature set. It&#39;s used by community radio stations all over the world since it&#39;s easy to teach and cross-platform while being free."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fantastic. Audacity keeps it simple and does it well, if there was ever a hall of fame of applications, Audacity deserves a spot. Heck, if I were to distribute any kind of &#34;creative suite&#34;, I would always include Audacity, no matter what operating system I was targeting. It is a near essential tool for working with audio, daily, or every now and then.The genius of the application is that it does not try to be more than a waveform editor. Oftentimes, no matter if you are new to audio production or a veteran audio technician, you just need to edit some sound, and Audacity lets you get it done in a easy enough way for newbies, and in a complex enough way for veterans.Maintainers of projects like these should carry themselves with pride. Projects that stand the test of time and continue to deliver exactly what you needed is what makes the IT-world go around."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m pretty sure all of the songs I recorded in high school are gone forever, since I only backed up the Audacity files and not the entire folder. Perhaps this is for the best, but either way I&#39;m glad future emo teens will have an easier time preserving their work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well done! This looks impressive and really useful. I’ve been looking for a lightweight sprite / spark lib for a while. Clients always, for some reason, are very impressed by little charts in a table row, doing this witha normal size chart lib kills page performance. I was literally including very basic html indicators in a presentation today and client where really impressed! This really solves that issue!And even more. Really great that you van manipulate the elements as css. Most chart libs I’ve dealt with makes non-trivial customization impossible.I’ll probably be building this in as Lowdefy blocks[1].Just curious, did you consider just branding it as sparks.css / sprites.css or something? Going the spark / sprite route just sets the expectations a lot lower imo. Although congrats, you are really close to fully functional charts here! Really interested to see how far this can go.[1] - https://lowdefy.com"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cool!
I&#39;ll have to take the opportunity to mention my own charts.css[0]. It got some interest on HN last year [1] and I unfortunately dropped the ball and didn&#39;t make any revisions based on the good feedback I got. As people pointed out, I tried to give it a &#34;cute&#34; name using unicode which unfortunately makes it harder to search for.This version (OP&#39;s) is way more polished and almost certainly more widely useful. But mine had the features of (a) being generated from markdown and (b) defaulting to a list presentation of the data under different styles so the data remained accessible.Having more charting options that don&#39;t require javascript to do simple things is a good thing.[0] https://rbitr.github.io/ChartS.css/

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What&#39;s also not being said here is that ~99% of apps on Google Play don&#39;t make money this way either.Due to a combination of Android user&#39;s reluctance to spend money on apps at all and the rampant piracy that Android&#39;s open model makes trivially easy, most developers only way to make money is through in-app advertising, which this change obviously makes no difference to.Google Play is mostly a pyramid scheme. Developer&#39;s can only make money from showing ads and at the same time can only get downloads if they place ads on other people&#39;s apps. And Google just happens to own all the mobile ad companies.This 15% cut ends up &#34;costing&#34; Google virtually nothing.And as for Google &#34;helping developers build sustainable businesses&#34;, the only times they&#39;ve ever reached out to me were to offer me the opportunity to have someone help me spend thousands of dollars a month on mobile ads. Never, for example, to actually take down all the scam apps that use my app&#39;s name, icon and screenshots."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Worth remembering that as good as it is that Google is reducing it&#39;s abusive taxation on third party developers, the primary reason they&#39;re doing this is to try to quiet the majority of developers asking for stronger government regulations against this taxation without actually reducing their profit much, since the large companies which bring in the majority of revenue still have to pay full price.Basically, they&#39;re hoping that this will stop some app developers from demanding the right to use third party payment processors, which would likely be used many of the larger &gt;$1 million revenue publishers.The Android Police article about this cites an example from iOS, that &#34;On Apple&#39;s App Store, the 98% of developers who qualified for a lower revenue share rate were responsible for less than 5% of Apple&#39;s total collected revenue&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Further evidence that developer pressure and legal pressure on smartphone platforms work, that they aren&#39;t a waste of time.Prolonged campaigns for better terms can make a tangible difference, and we should be encouraged by this result to advocate for even better terms. It turns out that when they have real pressure, it is possible for Google and Apple to come up with better terms.Keep in mind that the reason Google is being sued for antitrust isn&#39;t because it was taking 30% -- it&#39;s because it forced manufactures not to install or bundle any 3rd party stores by threatening to remove access to the Play store if any competing storefronts were enabled by default on consumer devices. So this doesn&#39;t change the original complaint, but it&#39;s still a very big win for smaller developers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"EGA Monkey Island is similarly beautiful.I feel EGA forced artists to work within the limitations of the available color palette, and good artists created awesome stuff (like shown in this case). Once they had VGA, some artists rushed to use every color gradient they could get away with, and this ruined their art till they got the hang of it.Something similar happened with the transition from pixel art to 3D games -- games were 3D because they had to, whether necessary or not. And many suffered from it. (Arguably, many still do!)Of course, I hold the extremist opinion that even some CGA (4 colors!) games were beautiful in their own way. I don&#39;t think more is always better, a lesson that seems to be lost on some game developers..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yeah. I never played this game, but the EGA scenes feel evocative and the VGA ones don&#39;t. Similar to the Loom discussion the other day.Mostly it feels like the EGA artist was better at dramatic lighting. For example, in the EGA version of the dead templar, the neck area is pure black for a reason: it makes the skull, the focal point of the image, stand out more. But in the VGA version they decided to paint something there, so the image became less focused."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of rose colored glasses here.Yes, looking back on the EGA graphics, there is definitely a level of skill and stylization that I took for granted at the time and have a certain nostalgia for, but when the VGA versions of these games came out they were all mind-blowing and you just kind of had to be there - no one was selecting the EGA option if they had a VGA card.I remember the VGA version of Indiana Jones in particular being awesome in VGA, on a CRT, live in motion."</p>

One worries all these new mechanical muscles (cars etc) will make horses unnecessary. The other horse reminds him that everything so far has made their lives easier - remember all that farm work? Remember running coast-to-coast delivering mail? Remember riding into battle? All terrible! These new city jobs are pretty cushy, and with so many humans in the cities there will be more jobs for horses than ever. Even if this car thingy takes off, he might say, there will be new jobs for horses we can&#39;t imagine.&gt; But you know what happened. There are still working horses, but nothing like before. The horse population peaked in 1915 - from that point on it was nothing but down.&gt; There&#39;s no law of economics that says that better technology makes more better jobs for horses. It sounds shockingly dumb to even say that out loud. But swap horses for humans and suddenly people think it sounds about right.&#34;Humans need not apply&#34; - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the next five years, computer programs that can think will read legal documents and give medical advice.Aside from the other points, taking &#34;AI&#34; as it exists in it&#39;s present form (deep neural networks and related) as specifically the bringer of unlimited wealth certainly puffs up the various &#34;AI companies&#34; notably OpenAI (It should be noted that OpenAI&#39;s most famous product, GPT-3, can generate strings that sound a lot like legal or medical advice but it so far &#34;demonstrates non-understanding on a regular basis&#34;. Don&#39;t follow it&#39;s advice to kill yourself, for example).It really should be said that deep learning, in particular, is still just one technology that&#39;s very good at some things, kind of impressive but not functional at other things, and just unable to do other things (actual understanding of biology, for example, seems well beyond them). I don&#39;t think this situation has changed since deep learning began it&#39;s hype cycle (which isn&#39;t to say it&#39;s &#34;nothing&#34;, it just doesn&#39;t seem like to bring us &#34;everything&#34;, a scenario the article literally sketches).Automation has proceeded apace, automation in general has brought us enough resources right now to give minimal comfort to most people in the planet (as people have noted).But automation has generally succeeded in situations where everything is controlled - ie, factories. Self-driving cars are forever five years away given the 5% or 1% or whatever level of unpredictable variable involved. Progress on robots that can interact well with either humans or &#34;the messy real world&#34; even in very limited terms has been painfully slow and I expect this to continue."</p>

At my level, nothing I do affects the stock price, and most Googlers feel this way.Sure, I want Google to do well, and I want America to do well too. Both of them doing well benefits me. But it doesn&#39;t really encourage me to do something different day-to-day."</p>

I also believe that assets in the mature developed reserve currency countries will underperform the Asian (including Chinese) emerging countries’ markets.&#34;It&#39;s not his avuncular advice.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Trying to speculate on the commercial bond market is exceedingly difficult and risky. Even the experts often take a beating. But using certain sectors of the bond market as a savings and retirement mechanism can be quite effective. Consider US tax-free municipal bonds (munies). They are safe, with defaults at a miniscule percentage of corporate bonds. And many are backed with third party insurance against defaults. Their returns are multiples of US Treasuries, CDs, money markets and savings accounts. And all distributions are tax exempt with the exception of any capital gains. Not very exciting. Sort of like watching grass grow. But it grows and grows. My own investments in this area are with: https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/overview/...edit: And by investing in munies you&#39;re also investing in US infrastructure. Munies fund all that stuff. Bridges, fire stations, schools, roads, water treatment plants, ports, electrical grids, etc, etc, etc. Might even make you feel like a good citizen..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Along with this, vertical scaling is severely underrated. You can do a lot and possibly everything ever for your company with vertical scaling. It would apply to 99% of the companies or even more.Edit:
Since people are confused, here is how StackOverflow handles of all of its web operations. If SO can run with this, so can your 0.33 req/minute app which is mostly doomed for failure. I am only half joking.StackOverflow architecture, current load (it will surprise you): https://stackexchange.com/performanceEverytime you go to SO, it hits one of these 9 web servers and all data on SO sits on those 2 massive SQL servers. That&#39;s pretty amazing.I want to be clear though, Horizontal scaling has a place in companies that has a team of corporate lawyers. Big. And in many many other scenarios for ETL and backend microservices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author is not lying. I&#39;ve been learning docker and it is certainly nice to pull and docker-compose up for local dev, but there is a lot to learn when you factor in orchestrators. And when I mean learn, I mean actually learning the nuts and bolts of a Dockerfile and not copy/pasting shit from the internet. While it&#39;s all helpful, its certainly not needed for the project we have at work, nor the &#34;microservices&#34; that our lead thinks we need even though they aren&#39;t even microservices. All we&#39;ve done is split our application into seperate mini applications that don&#39;t talk to eachother at all, essentially 4 web services. Great! Sigh.So why am I learning all this instead of just programming? Programming is what I really want to do all day, just writing code and thinking through software architecture.

(&#34;go test&#34; doesn&#39;t mean that you have 0 bugs)- Are you really sure that everything works exactly the same on different versions of GoLang? (Hey, a new guy in your company just installed unreleased Go 1.17, build on his notebook and pushed to production)?- That VM with systemd died at 1am. No customers for you until 7am (when you wake up)BTW. I am not saying that you should do Docker or CICD. The thing which I am saying that when you cut out from your process too much, you are increasing risks. (As an example, you didn&#39;t remove unit tests part. Based on &#34;Anything that doesn’t directly serve that goal is a complication&#34; you probably should have. However, you decided that it would be way too much risk)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Technically, what&#39;s going on here?&#34;CAID&#34; isn&#39;t a public iOS technology, and the article doesn&#39;t say what it means.Some googling returns: https://mmachina.cn/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MMA%E4%B8%AD%...Apparently it means &#34;CAA Advertising Id&#34;, where &#34;CAA&#34; appears to be the &#34;Creative Artists Agency&#34;, some sort of Chinese advertising group. (edit: wrong organization, it&#39;s actually &#34;Chinese Anonymization ID&#34;, not a group.  the group behind it is https://trackingio.com/)Searching &#34;CAA Advertising Id&#34; yields more Chinese PDFs.From what I can tell here, &#34;CAID&#34; is a partnership between Chinese industry and Chinese government to track users across apps for better tracking.The issue here does not seem to be that they&#39;ve bypassed a technical restriction, but that the developers of major apps are using a shared identifier that Apple doesn&#39;t like.In the US, the analogy would be if apps had tracking SDKs in them, that fingerprinted users across apps, in order to better target them for advertisements, and then the US government can pick up that data and do whatever they&#39;d like with it.The strange part to me, is that this actually is the situation today in the US.I don&#39;t want to shill for China, but why is this a story?  This has been a US industry since at least Doubleclick was invented.edit:It&#39;s a story because they&#39;re using the iOS keychain API to persist and share the tracking identifier.  As far as I know, this is a new technique in the wild, but has been theoretically possible since iOS launched.  It&#39;s only now being seen as necessary because of the iOS14 privacy changes.It&#39;s curious that American ad companies seem to understand Apple&#39;s intent and are opting not to risk their business by expanding their SDKs to use keychain sharing techniques, even though they&#39;re surely aware you can do this.  Chinese ad companies seem ok with risking their clients apps being banned on the app store.Apple can mitigate this by giving users control of the data and sharing related to keychain services."</p>

This was a quantum leap beyond Mapquest&#39;s page reload and reset with cumbersome arrow buttons.  This was a paradigm shift that let me explore a geography better than any book atlas.  I gave away all my atlases+ MS Window Media Player&#39;s ability to cleanly accelerate playback to 2x,3x,4x of audiobooks and tutorial videos for slow speakers.  MS Windows 7 had this long before Youtube&#39;s player had a 2x playback option.+ SQLite library : more than 10x improvement since I came from old school of writing custom formats for persisting data.  No more dumping memory structs to disk or writing b-trees in C Language from scratch.+ C++ STL in late 1990s.  Instantly reduced need to write custom data structures like linked-lists or in-house string libraries for common tasks+ VMware in 2000s : more than 10x productivity enhancement because I can play with malware in a virtual software sandbox instead of tediously re-imaging harddrives of air-gapped real physical machines+ Google Chrome in 2008 : 10x quality-of-life since misbehaving websites crashing don&#39;t bring down all the other tabs in my browsing session like Firefox/Opera.I probably have more than a hundred examples.  Some software tech 10x improvements are more diffused.  Reddit+HN websites are a much better use of my time than USENET newsgroups.  Youtube with recordings of tech conference presentations I can watch at 2x+ is a better used of my time than physically traveling to the site."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here are a few that I did not see listed by others:1. Automatic device discovery and driver installation (e.g., with USB devices (also USB device categories, etc.)). Instead of trying to find a driver, things just worked.2. Automatic updates.  Keeping everything updated, largely, fell into the background.3. Graphical integrated development environments (IDEs) for software development.  I realize editors can be contentious, but tab completion of variable names, automatic identification of methods within scope, syntax highlighting, easily dropping breakpoints, etc. are, in my experience, wonderful improvements on productivity.4. What you see is what you get (WYSIWYG) text / image editors.  Thankfully, I did not spend much time in the prior era, but it was, at times, maddening to get something to format correctly.5. Ad blockers / reader modes. Again, I know these can be contentious, but, for me, these reformatting services are sometimes the only way to make some websites practically readable.I strongly second:-The rise of memory-managed languages (e.g., JAVA, C#, etc) with pretty robust default library sets, especially for string manipulation, graphics, and network operations.-Moving map software, especially for mobile GPS mapping.-Spreadsheet software.-Being able to easily search for answers to fairly technical programming problems, compiler errors, etc. along with better access to online documentation."</p>

Instead, their marketing keeps on comparing apples to oranges and just keeps on playing the privacy angle, which is intellectually dishonest because DDG and Google have completely different goals.Boy do I hope for some real competition in the search engine market. Brave and Neeva can&#39;t launch soon enough.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I guess the majority of people on HN already know this more or less.

Even on rooted phones it hard to remove google services that god know send so many requests containing whatnot to the eeee addresses. Just install no-root firewall and you will be amazed the amount of pending requests that accumulate in 1 hour.2) Google search: I guess I can manage with DDG but when it&#39;s not that straight forward search, subconciosuly I&#39;m still thinking that let&#39;s just do a quick google search to see if i&#39;m not missing anything. And often I find better results. While adblocks makes sure I filter most of the crap.3) Gmail: Yes there are alternatives but switching emails is hard. It&#39;s a big commitment for most people to switch a 10 year old gmail address. And it still works great at filtering spam and whatnot.And same for maps, youtube and all their services.They really have a big leverage on everyone.Quiting facebook and instagram was child&#39;s play in comparison.

I&#39;m not even sure this directive is binding. As the mayor (who did not particularly support the measure) pointed out, it&#39;s not like this was a high priority to begin with.A proper decriminalization or perhaps even legalization would have passed, but DC citizens lack the same rights over their own local laws that any other American living in a state would enjoy.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing that always seems to be missing from these videos (in general, because there are many of them) is step 0: how do you go about acquiring the land and the permission to build a log cabin on this land? I can&#39;t imagine that there&#39;s many countries in the world where there is no build code or other legislation regarding how or where buildings can be built. The last thing I&#39;d want to do is spend an entire year building something that I would then be legally obliged to tear down.If you&#39;re felling a large amount of trees in a forest, at the bare minimum you need the blessing of the land owner (if that isn&#39;t you). Most likely, you&#39;ll also need in addition to this a permit to fell trees to begin with, because land owners in most countries aren&#39;t free to simply fell any amount of trees they wish just because they own the land.It&#39;s obviously an impressive feat to build a log cabin from scratch, but since this step is so often completely omitted, I have to ask myself whether this is because it&#39;s considered too boring, or because there are people out there who think that as long as you go far enough into the woods, you can do whatever you want because no one will notice."</p>

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_ProennekeRichard Louis Proenneke (/ˈprɛnəkiː/; May 4, 1916 – April 20, 2003) was an American self-educated naturalist, conservationist, writer, and wildlife photographer who, from the age of about 53, lived alone for nearly thirty years (1969–1999) in the mountains of Alaska in a log cabin that he constructed by hand near the shore of Twin Lakes. Proenneke hunted, fished, raised and gathered his own food, and also had supplies flown in occasionally. He documented his activities in journals and on film, and also recorded valuable meteorological and natural data.[1][2] The journals and film were later used by others to write books and produce documentaries about his time in the wilderness."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another argument against the &#34;going dark&#34; claim is that before smartphones and the internet, the only conversations the FBI could monitor was through phonelines and mail. These were known to be easily monitored and I doubt there was much more criminal activity happening through those then than now.I would argue that the conversations that have gone online are the interactions that were previously happening in-person (at least in term of criminal activity), to which the FBI didn&#39;t have access before.There is something Orwellian with the idea that there shouldn&#39;t be a word that can be pronounced in the country that the government cannot record and listen to after the fact. The limits of what is legal or not have always moved (see homosexuality, drug and alcohol consumption, etc). So a 100% enforcement of the law is counter-intuitively undesirable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I dont understand why the US people still trust these agencies. FBI, CIA, NSA have all shown to act against the democracy in many cases. If they could be trusted, they could be trusted with a backdoor. Since they cannot be trusted, the backdoor only makes them a more dangerous enemy of the people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article&#39;s title is a little misleading, but I agree with their overarching message.Law enforcement should never be given the easy way out in terms of breaking encryption. Asking for backdoors to be installed in every device is extremely lazy police work. I&#39;m sure there are other ways of breaking encryption like the rubber-hose technique (of course with valid arrest warrant).Arguing that law enforcement should stop attacking encryption because it jeopardises privacy seems a little naive to me. What about criminals that profit from creating spyware? In fact, allowing law enforcement to actively research new ways to break encryption can be productive for improving security in the long run. Stop using weak passwords people."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very interesting, these kinds of articles are (to me) some of the best content we get on here.I&#39;m no expert in any of the languages used except maybe C, at least I&#39;m quick to form opinions about C code. In C, I&#39;m not so sure that there is a well-established &#34;idiomatic&#34; concept, since C is not so tightly bound to a community as more modern languages. At least that&#39;s my feeling.That said, I was shocked to see that the example code did heap-allocations to store integers. Single integers, one per allocation, per &#34;counting bucket&#34;. I would store the count in the data pointer without a second thought, I just &#34;can&#39;t&#34; make 4/8-byte heap allocations and still sleep at night. Especially after all the concern about processing the input in large blocks for performance! Casting an integer to/from a void pointer should be pretty safe according to my gut feel. If that turns out to be false, I would dump the libc&#39;s hash API altogether, since it makes me do heap allocations to store single integers.I tried making the change locally, and the time taken (as measured with the OP&#39;s benchmarking program) dropped from 0.11 to 0.10 on my system (a Dell laptop running an Intel i5-7300). That&#39;s at least something."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is definitely the most interesting part of the article for me:Incidentally, this problem set the scene for a wizard duel between two computer scientists several decades ago. In 1986, Jon Bentley asked Donald Knuth to show off “literate programming” with a solution to this problem, and he came up with an exquisite, ten-page Knuthian masterpiece. Then Doug McIlroy (the inventor of Unix pipelines) replied with a one-liner Unix shell version using tr, sort, and uniq.http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2011/12/more-shell-less-egg..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Knuth-McIlroy comes up a lot.  Previous discussion [1].  For this example I can make a very similar Nim program [2] run almost exactly the same speed as `wc -w`, yet the optimized C program runs 1.2x faster not 1.15x slower than `wc -w` - a 1.4x discrepancy - bigger than many ratios in the table.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"All of the people on this list are &#34;software engineers&#34; in the sense that they have some rudimentary education in the field. Almost none of them could get a job as a software engineer at their own company, if they had to, because they would be completely unqualified. And I&#39;m not looking down my nose at anyone: I have an undergraduate degree in CS, but I got it 16 years ago and then went to law school, and there is not a serious place on earth that would let me touch their codebase. But if I started a really valuable company tomorrow (maybe I should), I would code as a software engineer on this list.I mean, come at it from the other direction: Why are there so many software engineers who are not successful CEOs? My God, they have the secrets of for loops, S-expressions, they know about vim---and yet they aren&#39;t running Pfizer? Why not?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, talk about assuming correlation implies causation.I think the obvious lesson here is when society becomes reoriented around a new field (in this case software), people with experience in that field are going to do well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What this seems to show is that CEOs in a particular sector often have expertise in that sector. And that Tech is currently the most highly valued sector as measured by market capitalisation. To find evidence of Software Engineers being the best CEOs overall you&#39;d really need to find examples of them running non-tech firms successfully or examples of non-Software Engineers running tech firms poorly."</p>

Surprised this isn&#39;t enforced in the other countries, it costs next to nothing to implement and is just an additional step in the account migration process.I&#39;d love to see companies allow for opt in additional security measures, like banks or telco&#39;s calling me - having a verbal password to confirm things, that level of security seems to only be available to VIPs."</p>

The only way you can incentivize companies to stop using it as security theater is to shift liability so any losses incurred by SMS jacking is automatically the liability of the company using SMS, just as nowadays any credit card fraud is borne by the company that is not using the EMV chip to secure a transaction."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I use this feature. On a large monitor, Firefox wastes quite a lot of space with the default layout. To be honest, I wish there was an option to make it more compact than the &#34;compact&#34; layout. There used to be an XUL extension to do this, before XUL was killed off.Seems like every time I see coverage about Firefox, it&#39;s Mozilla removing or crippling some feature I care about.Why bother using FF at this point? Most sites don&#39;t work as well, and Mozilla seems actively hostile to my use case. If I&#39;m going to use a browser that is hostile to me, I may as well get better website compatibility out of the bargain.Not surprised their market share keeps shrinking. At this point, what&#39;s the sell?Edit 1: worth noting, there is a lower-down comment thread[0] with relevant links - Mozilla does not care if you like this feature.0 - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26464973"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t get it.  The wording of the bugzilla specifically says&gt;  The &#34;Compact&#34; density is a feature of the &#34;Customize toolbar&#34; view which is currently fairly hard to discover, and we assume gets low engagement.So not only do they not have telemetry for that, they aren&#39;t even attempting to make it more discoverable to test if there&#39;s a correlation between &#34;hard to discover&#34; and &#34;low engagement&#34;?I would use this but never knew this could be changed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think Mozilla has a clear vision of what they want to achieve. They&#39;ve been randomly removing features, or even plain butchering their  products (eg the recent Firefox mobile update) for several years, and all they probably achieved is to lose more and more users.Yet with their tiny market share they aren&#39;t exactly in a position to lose users."</p>

It is without a doubt the best source of this information and the app being unavailable significantly affects the day to day lives of a significant portion of the South African population who use it to plan around these power outages.While the app also has a &#34;chat&#34; feature, it&#39;s really tangental to the primary purpose of the app and I expect that most users of the app, like myself, don&#39;t use that feature at all and only care about knowing when they will be without electricity.In case you&#39;re wondering why they hell we have load shedding, it&#39;s because Eskom is grossly incompetent. Their incompetence is hugely exacerbated by nepitism and corruption where government has historically appointed people to Eskom management positions solely as &#34;favours&#34;, rather than on qualification for the job."</p>

VSLAM systems usually have a (kind of bipartite) factor graph with vertices/variables that are either keyframes or ‘good’ features, with edges/factors between features and the frames that see them and between adjacent frames; each of these edges are the factors in the graph. This structure results in very large but sparse graphs, and there are factor graph optimization libraries that take advantage of this sparsity (e.g. g2o or GTSAM.) These libraries also use specialized optimization techniques for some of the nonlinear manifolds (e.g. SO(3)) that arise in SLAM problems."</p>

But the 501Y.V2 (B.1.351) and 501Y.V3 (P1) lineages have the mutation within the conserved region for coronaviruses near the spike protein cleavage site. These show massively (1000x) decreased monoclonal antibody binding for original genetic sequence designs. It&#39;s better for the mRNA vaccine produced human-body-made antibodies which show only 5-10x reduction in binding.But antibody binding isn&#39;t the full story and there may be T-cell stuff helping too. The data seems to indicate updated spike protein designs will be needed but if there&#39;s other stuff going on we don&#39;t know about old spike vaccines could still work. I can&#39;t say it will definitely help because the vaccine rollout is so slow and air travel is so fast that this negative pressure will probably provoke more variants as long as host numbers remain high.ref: &#34;Antibody Resistance of SARS-CoV-2 Variants B.1.351 and B.1.1.7&#34; [pdf] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03398-2_reference... https://i.imgur.com/8co1IoL.jpg &#34;SARS-CoV-2 VoC B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 neutralization evasion&#34; table.https://covariants.org/variants/S.501Y.V2 https://covariants.org/variants/S.501Y.V3"</p>

Instead, it seems to be attempting to prevent death.I&#39;ve always argued that preventing spread would as a byproduct prevent death, but I&#39;m obviously not studied in the field.Put shortly, I would have vaccinated college kids and working age folks first.  They are not likely to die from it, but are far more likely to spread it than elderly and severely diseased folks."</p>

But my friends and I noticed the changes around 2015. Less sunflower stars and star fish. After some red tide events, the abalone die offs were crazy. Coves that used to have abs stacked on top of each other were almost empty. Finding a 9” abalone became a chore. The thinner kelp forests meant less fish, less life. It’s been difficult to watch first hand.

The problem with this appears to be that sea otters aren’t so interested in the skinny, starved urchins occupying the most barren areas, reports Anuradha Varanasi for Inverse. A separate study published this week in the journal the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests the otters do eat urchins but that they prefer the more well-fed residents of the coast’s remaining kelp forests to the so-called “zombie urchins” clinging to life in the denuded barrens.[0] - https://oregonwild.org/about/blog/lost-sea-otters-oregon-par..."</p>

    This reimplementation is based on my reversing of every version of the audio system module that I carried for the past 10 months.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In terms of single-player games, the figure is more like 85%. You can probably get an additional 5% to work with various levels of tweaking, but compatibility is remarkably good these days. Many games perform better on Linux than they do on Windows (Borderlands, Overwatch), while others give you a chance to have a flawless experience with games that are pretty busted on modern Windows (Diablo 2, Fallout: New Vegas). As another commenter mentioned, the big issue is with anti-cheat: any game implementing EAC will outright not work, full stop. That makes it about a 50/50 chance that multiplayer titles will work on Linux, with some unfortunate casualties like Rainbow Six Siege and Halo MCC&#39;s online multiplayer.With that being said, I truly and honestly believe Linux is the way to go if you&#39;re not into multiplayer. Valve&#39;s commitment to Linux is nothing short of herculean, and it&#39;s heartwarming to see them give back to the open source community in such a remarkable way. If it weren&#39;t for Proton (and DXVK), I&#39;d still be using Windows on my main computer, which made development hell. Now, I feel comfortable moving to a system where I can enjoy Overwatch, Titanfall and Team Fortress on a regular basis without dual-booting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know it&#39;s not the topic here so apologies for the digression, but the Mac compatibility on this list is somewhat misleading. Games like TF2 don&#39;t actually work on the Mac any longer unless you stay on or downgrade to Mojave. And even then, the performance and bugginess leaves much to be desired.If you&#39;re using this article at all to make decisions around a Mac for gaming, dive a little deeper to make sure the game you want to play works on Catalina+ (generally requires a full 64 bit port).Back to the actual topic: I had no idea Proton got this good. That&#39;s quite an achievement for Linux gaming. What&#39;s the state of modern GPU support?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was really annoyed when Rocket League dropped native support for Linux, but it turned out it runs much better on my potato under Proton. My only concern now is that they&#39;ll add anti-cheat to it (even though there&#39;s there no real need for it) and Linux will become flagged. The fact that they moved the game to only be available to new players via the Epic client has me worried they&#39;re moving in that direction."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;But the biggest potential is in ability to fearlessly parallelize majority of Rust code, even when the equivalent C code would be too risky to parallelize. In this aspect Rust is a much more mature language than C.&#34;Yes. Today, I integrated two parts of a 3D graphics program. One refreshes the screen and lets you move the viewpoint around. The other loads new objects into the scene. Until today, all the objects were loaded, then the graphics window went live. Today, I made those operations run in parallel, so the window comes up with just the sky and ground, and over the next few seconds, the scene loads, visibly, without reducing the frame rate.This took about 10 lines of code changes in Rust. It worked the first time it compiled."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; C libraries typically return opaque pointers to their data structures, to hide implementation details and ensure there&#39;s only one copy of each instance of the struct. This costs heap allocations and pointer indirections. Rust&#39;s built-in privacy, unique ownership rules, and coding conventions let libraries expose their objects by valueThe primary reason c libraries do this is not for safety, but to maintain ABI compatibility.  Rust eschews dynamic linking, which is why it doesn&#39;t bother.  Common lisp, for instance, does the same thing as c, for similar reasons: the layout of structures may change, and existing code in the image has to be able to deal with it.&gt; Rust by default can inline functions from the standard library, dependencies, and other compilation units. In C I&#39;m sometimes reluctant to split files or use libraries, because it affects inliningThis is again because c is conventionally dynamically linked, and rust statically linked.  If you use LTO, cross-module inlining will happen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;Clever&#34; memory use is frowned upon in Rust. In C, anything goes. For example, in C I&#39;d be tempted to reuse a buffer allocated for one purpose for another purpose later (a technique known as HEARTBLEED).This made me laugh"</p>

Here are just a FEW of the &#34;features&#34; Airtable charges $24/user/mo for:- Reliable 1-5 hours a month of downtime. There are months where it&#39;s literally 1 nine of uptime. Their status page was actually down for a while (I think they forgot to renew it?)- Simple and obvious bugs in the official API clients have not been fixed for years (for example, Promises in the official JS library throw the string `[object Object]` for all exceptions.)- The API has no way to query the structure of a table, you have to infer it from the first few records. (The auto-generated API documentation is actually wrong if you don&#39;t have a fully-filled-in row somewhere in the first few rows.)- You can&#39;t modify a table configuration by API... except you can _sometimes_ by adding a parameter which is documented to try to convert dates, but actually modifies field definitions for a number of fields. Documentation for which fields is entirely in scattered forum posts from users.- Booleans in the API are `true` or `undefined`. Seriously.This is all /barely/ worth it because Google Docs doesn&#39;t work when you need a large structured database with many collaborators. But man is it bad software."</p>

I have one client with 12 people that want to collaborate on the base by posting comments. I can&#39;t justify $288 a month just to keep the comments for all time.I contacted Airtable about this and was told the &#34;Enterprise Plan&#34; would be a perfect fit.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m one of the maintainers of one of the implementations of eth2 live today (https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm) and can help offer more context on this. Ethereum proof of stake has been live since December 1st and it currently secures over 6 billion USD worth of value https://beaconcha.in/. Currently, this is a chain that lives in parallel to the proof of work chain we know as Ethereum today. The idea is that over this coming year, the entire state of Ethereum will be &#34;merged&#34; into this new chain that uses proof of stake consensus via a docking process. &#34;Escalating the eth2 merge&#34; means there is more expedited work from researchers and developers when it comes to performing this critical decision. Since eth2 consensus is already live and running correctly with a large set of validators, miners cannot censor this new chain and therefore cannot really stop the merge."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regardless of the current issues with the updates, gas prices, different opinions on the community, devs vs miners vs users...Am I the only one who thinks people underestimate Ethereum and its EVM invention? In 2013 this guy (who I think is a visionary) wrote a document with a proposal that led to the creation of a world-wide turing-complete distributed computer. And still, people are just starting to realize its potential. This month a layer-2 solution called optimism will launch a virtual machine called OVM (optimism vm) on top of ethereum smart contracts that can solve most of the current scalability issues (and there are other solutions being tested in parallel: zkrollups...). We are also starting to realize the potential of Dex and Defi (distributed exchanges and finance), DAOs (distributed organizations), NFT (non-fungible tokens) and a bunch of things more that 7 years after are appearing out of thin air. So even if Ethereum wasn&#39;t updated at all (although, we probably all agree that PoW is not environmental friendly and should be replaced with a better alternative: PoS) it could still thrive in the long term thanks to its most fundamental design choices (turing-complete...). I am truly amazed by this technology and Vitalik. I wish I knew a little bit more of the underlying fundamentals. What do you think?"</p>

The whole point of blockchains is that the incentives are supposed to be aligned between miners and users. If that isn&#39;t the case here, it sounds like a problem."</p>

And say that intersected with `(DI|NS|TH|OM)*` on the `H`, you could then place a `T` from the second clue because of what you learned from the first clue.It could just be that I&#39;m missing something or not as good at regex as I thought, and please let me know if that&#39;s the case.

And that’s only if their PoC built on your new and untrusted database ever makes it to production. And then it’s probably your cheapest tier. Don’t be selling to paupers!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Developers love building developer tools, often for free. So while there is massive demand, the supply vastly outstrips it.This is key, and plays out over and over again in different forms. There are no points for difficulty, only supply and demand. PG puts this well [1]:&gt; That&#39;s the essence of a startup: having brilliant people do work that&#39;s beneath them. Big companies try to hire the right person for the job. Startups win because they don&#39;t—because they take people so smart that they would in a big company be doing &#34;research,&#34; and set them to work instead on problems of the most immediate and mundane sort. Think Einstein designing refrigerators.[1] http://www.paulgraham.com/bronze.html"</p>

The major one for us has been their maintenance window every Thursday from 2:00-3:00pm Pacific Time. Usually there&#39;s no outage, but sometimes there is. There&#39;s no warning - it&#39;s just down sometimes during that window. So, if uptime is important for your data, consider the cost of also implementing a fallback solution to cover your production use during those maintenance windows. https://www.backblaze.com/scheduled-maintenance.html"</p>

After seeing too much graphical glitches and weird behavior, specially because Alacritty (my favorite terminal) did not have any window decoration (I read through the whole issue on Gnome&#39;s issue tracker for server side decoration and got a little disappointed), I stopped using it on my work PC. But still I&#39;m using it on my laptop. I haven&#39;t had any issues there, but I just use my laptop for some web surfing and zoom. 
Screen capture is a hassle too. I was trying to capture only a part of my screen and had to do an hour worth of research to finally decide to just switch to X.org and get the job done. 
It&#39;s great that Flameshot is now supporting Wayland, and it&#39;s great that it is trying to support all the common protocols."</p>

It&#39;s like a self destroyable notification that can be read only once. Why? For the instance if I share some confident information with someone that I know is going to open very soon, then once he/she opens the message it will be destroyed, so that if somebody accesses either my or my friend&#39;s machine, it will be impossible to read the secret message. Another aspect is that if my friend will try open the secret message, and it will show that message doesn&#39;t exist / was destoryed - then we know that message was compromised."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is the biggest takeaway for me:&gt; We saw this dynamic metastasize in the wake of George Floyd’s murder, when well-intentioned claims of “silence is violence” (recalling the powerful 1987 ACT-UP “Silence = Death” campaign) spiraled into calling out individuals with even a small following who hadn’t come forward with a timely public statement of solidarity or remorse. Yet public posts were subject to popular scrutiny and judged based on sincerity, originality, and tone. Not surprisingly, many people defaulted to posting a somber plain black square. But this generated criticism of its own by clogging the feed with an informational blackout during a moment when community resource sharing was critically important. Amid a chaotic time, the platform functioned exactly as designed: amplification of emotions, uptick in user interaction, growth in platform engagement and data cultivation. Cha-ching, the platform cashes in.In other words, any large movement or discussion on &#34;clearnet&#34; spaces gets subverted by the algorithms and profit motive of the platform they live on.However, where I disagree with the author is considering mainstream &#34;dark forest&#34; platforms like reddit or 4chan to be countercultural. In fact, I&#39;d argue that mainstream social media can never be countercultural. While there may be no &#34;algorithm&#34; controlling the narrative you see on 4chan (or a straightforward and ostensibly fair one on a site like reddit), the content you see (and by extension, the narrative) is shaped by profit motive: From well-compensated marketing teams, to hordes of self-interested proselytizers (see: bitcoin), to propaganda teams looking to influence public opinion, mainstream dark forest sites simply shift the balance of power from the platform itself to the most motivated and well-funded members of the platform"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Still reading the article, but this is an interesting blurb if nothing else:&#34;To be truly countercultural today, in a time of tech hegemony, one has to, above all, betray the platform, which may come in the form of betraying or divesting from your public online self.&#34;I hadn&#39;t thought of boycotting much of popular online space as being counter-cultural. It&#39;s an interesting thought."</p>

Like if all you want to do is dehumanize those guys so you can happily insult / hurt them without hurting your conscience, go ahead, that&#39;s choice.. you have different goals.. but remember that instinct that wants you to scream at this-this-this type of person is a confrontational approach that deep down falls in the pattern of, eliminating the other tribe.. if you choose to do something about it and what you do is your responsibility and problem.I just think the solution should lie in :

It worked for centuries to help maintain systems of inequality.It worked for centuries to maintain familial control and enforce sexual monoculture in many countries. Information control works so well, it prevents people from even understanding themselves or what they really want in the face of ideologically imposed values.We are steeped in a culture of Hollywood telling us what the lessons of history are about. One of the off repeated &#34;hopeful&#34; messages we are fed is that you can&#39;t kill an idea but my reading of history has led me to the other conclusion entirely. That controlling the conversation, its constraints and determining the status quo are profoundly powerful tools."</p>

SQLite already ships with a fairly large suite of JSON tools, which are optional to compile into the library, so there&#39;s precedent.Datetimes are of those things which is incredibly annoying to get right, and really belongs inside the database. RFC3339 timestamps are already well designed, since if you stick to UTC (and if you don&#39;t store timezone data separately you deserve those problems), lexical order is temporal order, but queries which would be rendered in English as &#34;return all accounts where last payment is ninety days prior to `now`&#34; isn&#39;t really possible with string comparisons.Also, with the JSON library, you can use a check constraint to fail if a string isn&#39;t valid JSON, another affordance I would love to have for datetimes.Grateful for what we just got, though!

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting read, especially as someone poking w/ writing a parser in zig for fun :)One area of improvement worth mentioning in this area is that currently zig errors cannot be tagged with extra information, which tends to be important for surfacing things like line numbers in parsing errors. There was a proposal[0] to improve this and it&#39;s not the end of the world for me anyways (as a workaround, I&#39;m toying with returning error tokens similar to what treesitter does)On a different note, there&#39;s another cool zig thing I found recently that is mildly related to parsing: a common thing in parsers is mapping a parsed string to some pre-specified token type (e.g. the string `&#34;if&#34;` maps to an enum value `.if` or some such so you can later pattern match tokens efficiently). The normal way to avoid O(n) linear search over the keyword space is to use a hashmap (naively, one would use a runtime std.StringHashMap in zig). But I found an article from Andrew[0] about a comptime hashmap where a perfect hashing strategy is computed at comptime since we already know the search space ahead of time! Really neat stuff.[0] https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/2647[1] https://andrewkelley.me/post/string-matching-comptime-perfec..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I absolutely love parser combinators, and years ago I did a huge rewrite of my compiler compiler so that it&#39;d have the easiest possible parser combinators: simple string concatenation. grammarA + grammarB = grammarC. You can play with that here (https://jtree.treenotation.org/designer/). You still need to make a line change or two (good design after all, requires some integration), but it just works. Haven&#39;t seen anything beat it and not sure if that&#39;s possible. (Note: I do apologize for the crappy UX, and it&#39;s high on the priority list to give the app a refresh)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A modern circuit simulator, that has a fully featured programable API, that can be run from a real modern programming language, would be a dream.
Every simulator i have used has been pretty limited in that way, or at least those features were not well advertized.
Even the insanely expensive ones.
I mean the most expensive ones (like $100K liscense type deals, like Cadence) are if anything even less modern from a user interaction perspective.My first academic paper 
(https://www.oxinabox.net/publications/White2015PsoTransistor...) was based on doing a search over parameters for the transistors being used in a circuit.
The way that whole thing work was by string mangling the netlist file to update the parameters.
Triggering the simulator on the commandline.
Getting it to output a CSV of the signals.
Parsing that CSV, and detecting edges and then measuring timing that way.
Then throwing it at a particle swarm optimizer to fine a new one.
That sucks from a user experience.
It&#39;s a super cool way to  solve problems though.
that would be so easy with a real API.Further, with julia being a differnetiable programming language, rather than having to use a particular swarm optimizer to search, I could have been differentiating it, and using some sophisticated gradient descent like LBGFS etc.I hope that some of the general tools like this will be an outcome of this project."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems very promising to me
One big part of circuit simulation is solving differential equations.
That&#39;s the whole inducer, resistor, capacitor thing.
Julia has hands down the best toolkit for differential equation solving.
Most circuit simulators today are going to be using old methods invented in the 60&#39;s-80&#39;s.
Neglecting the state of the art developments.Someone made a blog post recently comparing the time to simulate with LTSpice vs writng and solving the system in Julia
https://klaff.github.io/LTSvDEQ_1.jl.html
this is a very simple circuit, and they still got a 100x speed up.
Sure that is neglecting the time it takes to actually extract the differnetial equetion from the circuit.
But from what i hear that kind of thing is something this DARPA project will be working on.
And sure LTSpice isn&#39;t state of the art.
But still I find this indicative and promising."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have opinions about writing. So does Mr. Graham.What our opinions have in common is that they are not falsifiable. Unless we validate our conjectures with empirical evidence, we&#39;re really just sharing our taste.&#34;Oh no,&#34; you may say, &#34;I have tested it, and when I write a longer essay, my retweets and upvotes decline.&#34; Very well, but the plural of anecdote is not &#39;data.&#39;Somewhere else on the Internet, there is someone with poetic, dense writing. When they simplify it, their audience dries up.Writers and audiences find each other. If you try to measure the effect of your writing using only an audience that has selected your writing voluntarily, you are not measuring your effectiveness, you are measuring the degree to which your writing pleases people who already like your writing.Absent a properly constructed empirical approach, we might as well be discussing hemlines and necktie widths."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For grins I pasted PG&#39;s text into the demo readability tool at &lt;https://app.readable.com/text/?demo&gt;.&#39;Write Simply&#39; received an overall grade of &#39;A&#39;, and a very-approachable Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 5.9. It&#39;s said to be readable by 100% of the literate general public, which is only 85% of the full general public.But, out of the 507 words and 38 sentences, 4 sentences were flagged as &#34;very long&#34; (over 30 syllables) and 15 as &#34;long&#34; (over 20 syllables).Two &#39;hard words&#39; – over 12 letters or over 4 syllables – were flagged, somewhat ironically: &#34;unnecessarily intellectual&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When something feels easy to read, it&#39;s not just a matter of using simple words. To maximize scanability, you need to use a mix of long and short words, and also mix long and short sentences, until you achieve a kind of &#34;flow&#34;. Famously, Dovlatov&#39;s prose (in Russian) avoids having words that start with the same letter in the same sentence, which is unnoticeable to the reader but makes the words just fly off the page.Another trick I&#39;ve found is making sure each word has unambiguous function. Here&#39;s some examples from other comments:I had this impression recently while reading the Akbarnama, which is a sort of court-approved biography of the Mughal Emperor Akbar, written by his Grand Vizier -- Was the Emperor written, or was it the biography?There are some cases in which your work demands a certain level of precision -- It could&#39;ve continued like &#34;in which your work demands are excessive&#34;, so you don&#39;t know if &#34;demands&#34; is a noun or a verb until you read on.That &#34;simple&#34; writing lasts longer is disproved by many works of literature that have made their way to us through history -- It could&#39;ve continued like &#34;that simple writing is not so simple&#34;, so you don&#39;t know if &#34;that&#34; is a conjunction or determiner until you read on.These are small things, but somehow the more I notice them, the clearer my writing becomes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some of these recipes seem decent if you&#39;re already somewhat experienced and have developed cook&#39;s intuition. Otherwise they&#39;re way too vague. For instance, the chicken parm recipe:- There should be a photo of how to slice the chicken breast. Saying &#34;through their width&#34; isn&#39;t good enough. I had to explain what &#34;lengthwise&#34; was once because my friend cut all the vegetables the exact opposite of it.- Pound with what? A lot of people will come up with very bad answers to this question.- How much flour? How much egg? I&#39;ll bet that plenty of beginners will use a tablespoon of flour or a singular egg- Ditto with oil. Beginners do not know how much oil is necessary to fry stuff- How high heat? You probably want to turn down the heat after the oil starts smoking.- Is there a single mention of adding salt? Sounds like a pretty bland recipeI don&#39;t mean to be too harsh but recipes are hard. There&#39;s a reason why professional recipe developers have developed certain standards like measurements, terms (folding batter, shimmering oil, etc.), and development procedures (cross testing)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Am I the only one who thinks that this concept is perfectly good, and all the things the site doesn&#39;t have are just great further development of the idea?What&#39;s wrong with a &#34;wikipedia for recipes&#34;? I would LOVE that.All the complaints about the quality of the recipes or the lack of more in-depth explaination of each one, some kind of  voting/reputation system for the recipes and for the submitters and the voters, Yes those are all good ideas to make the db more useful than just a db.But you have to start somewhere. How is the core idea here of a public cookbook not fundamentally awesome? I mean hello... GIT. Recipes that are living documents that can be honed over time, complete with viewable history of what changes have been made so you can decide if you agree with them. Branches and forks for all the hundred variations on any given thing. Revisions by better experts than the original submitter of some recipe.So, today on day one it doesn&#39;t already have the benefit of years of contributions and incremental improvements and revisions, Quelle Suprise!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The info about salt is plain wrong. Kosher salt is used for curing meat and as a mainly decorative addition to baking, you don&#39;t need to use it for cooking, it doesn&#39;t dissolve noticably slower in liquids. In fact when most recipes specify a volumetric measurement of salt they mean table salt and if you were to use kosher or sea salt you would be under seasoning due the reduced volume, nothing to do with how quickly it dissolves.You should definitely not be using large grain salt in baking for this reason, unless it is to decorate a finished product.Iodine deficiencies were and are very, very real. They&#39;re also on the rise due to food deserts and rising poverty. Iodised salt largely eliminated iodine deficiencies so people with poor knowledge of the history think they just went away. Most processed food does not contained iodised salt, so table salt is an essential source or iodine for a great many people around the world.Idosing salt was and is one of the greatest public health success stories of the 20th century, do not talk about it like some conspiracy by government."</p>

You just want to fucking buy things, not deal with shipping incompetence, you know?This reminds me of a time I was traveling and had to cancel a lost credit card. I told the card company that I was not at home,was definitely outside of the country, not going to be home, definitely staying at an address that was not the home address listed on the account, wanted the card to be sent to _me_ and not my _home_, gave them my foreign delivery address 5 times over as many weeks, got 5 separate promises that the card was definitely going to reach me at my outside-of-the-country-and-not-at-home location in just a few business days, and the card never showed up. So I just gave up. And then, when I finally went home there were 5 goddamn cards in my mail slot.Honestly this reason alone makes Apple&#39;s purely digital credit card my favorite. Need a new card number? Just push a button. No incompetent shipping divisions with 5 hops and as many business days between you and your ability to buy things when your card number is breached."</p>

Only when I buy something in the USA for example.Some years back I moved to a different city. About a year later I wanted to make a purchase with my credit card. I found out it had expired. I rang the bank and asked for a new one. They promised to send it to me. It never arrived. Rang again, got the same promise, and still no card. When I called them the third time, the employee found out my old address was still in their database. Turns out the credit card department had a different client database then the debit card department (who had my new address).To change my address, I had to log in to their site. They weren&#39;t allowed to change it on the phone. As soon I tried to log in, I noticed I forgot my password. When I clicked &#39;reset password&#39;, there was a new surprise: they send the new password by snail mail.... to the old address of course!So I had to go in person to the house I used to live in and explain the situation.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"At this stage, these threads are getting kind of boring, it&#39;s clear that almost all manufacturers are in a race to the bottom in terms of cost - and now the only way that they can compete on price is by bundling adverts into your internet connected set.All talk of &#34;voting with your wallet&#34; doesn&#39;t work when there are literally no &#34;smart&#34; consumer sets that can compete on features and are without adverts.If you really wish to have your smart TV connected to the internet - I&#39;ve listed some of the adservers that you can block at : https://factory-reset.com/wiki/Smart_TV_Adverts - however this is also going to be a tiresome game, as manufacturers will just seek to find more creative ways to serve adverts.The reality is though, if you want to avoid this behaviour - buy the set that has the screen that you want and only connect it to the internet if you wish to do a software update. Only software update if your set has a bug that the advertised firmware actually fixes, as newer updates tend to add more &#34;features&#34; - adverts, slower apps etc etc. Use something like and AppleTV or a Roku device connected via HDMI if you really need smart features - but be aware even the likes of Roku / Nvidia Shield / FireTV will at some point in the future also be serving you adverts.I&#39;ve also heard that some sets are trying to find open wifi networks - if you are really that worried, cut the traces on the wifi card inside the set and hope that manufacturers don&#39;t start to use ethernet over HDMI."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Back in the late 90s, I implemented the first systematic monitoring of WalMart Store&#39;s global network, including all of the store routers, hubs (not switches yet!) and 900mhz access points.
Did you know that WalMart had some stores in Indonesia? They did until 1998.So when https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_1998_riots_of_Indonesia started happening, we heard some harrowing stories of US employees being abducted, among other things.Around that same time, the equipment in the Jakarta store started sending high temperature alerts prior to going offline. Our NOC wasn&#39;t able to reach anyone in the store.The alerts were quite accurate: that was one of the many buildings that had been burned down in the riots. I guess it&#39;s slightly surprising that electrical power to the equipment in question lasted long enough to allow temperature alerting. Most of our stores back then used satellite for their permanent network connection, so it&#39;s possible telcom died prior to the fire reaching the UPC office.In a couple of prominent places in the home office, there were large cutouts of all of the countries WalMart was in at the time up on the walls. A couple of weeks after this event, the Indonesia one was taken down over the weekend and the others re-arranged."</p>

So, let&#39;s use this post to talk about Disaster Recovery Plans!Mine: I have 5 servers at OVH (not at SBG) and they all back up to Amazon S3 or Backblaze B2, and I also have a dedicated server (also OVH/Kimsufi) that gets the backups.

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26406989">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A bigger problem in my opinion is that Rust has chosen to follow the poll-based model (you can say that it was effectively designed around epoll), while the completion-based one (e.g. io-uring and IOCP) with high probability will be the way of doing async in future (especially in the light of Spectre and Meltdown).Instead of carefully weighing advantages and disadvantages of both models, the decision was effectively made on the ground of &#34;we want to ship async support as soon as possible&#34; [1]. Unfortunately, because of this rush, Rust got stuck with a poll-based model with a whole bunch of problems without a clear solution in sight (async drop anyone?). And instead of a proper solution for self-referencing structs (yes, a really hard problem), we did end up with the hack-ish Pin solution, which has already caused a number of problems since stabilization and now may block enabling of noalias by default [2].Many believe that Rust async story was unnecessarily rushed. While it may have helped to increase Rust adoption in the mid term, I believe it will cause serious issues in the longer term.[1]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/62149#issuecomment-...
[2]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/63818"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not totally sure what the author is asking for, apart from refcounting and heap allocations that happen behind your back. In my experience async Rust is heavily characterised by tasks (Futures) which own their data. They have to - when you spawn it, you&#39;re offloading ownership of its state to an executor that will keep it alive for some period of time that is out of the spawning code&#39;s control. That means all data/state brought in at spawn time must be enclosed by move closures and/or shared references backed by an owned type (Arc) rather than &amp; or &amp;mut.If you want to, nothing is stopping you emulating a higher-level language - wrap all your data in Arc&lt;_&gt; or Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;_&gt;&gt; and store all your functions as trait objects like Box&lt;dyn Fn(...)&gt;. You pay for extra heap allocations and indirection, but avoid specifying generics that spread up your type hierarchy, and no longer need to play by the borrow checker&#39;s rules.What Rust gives us is the option to _not_ pay all the costs I mentioned in the last paragraph, which is pretty cool if you&#39;re prepared to code for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like to joke that the best way to encounter the ugliest parts of Rust is to implement an HTTP router. Hours and days of boxing and pinning, Futures transformations, no async fn in traits, closures not being real first class citizens, T: Send + Sync + &#39;static, etc.I call this The Dispatch Tax. Because any time you want more flexibility than the preferred static dispatch via generics can give you - oh, so you just want to store all these async fn(HttpRequest) -&gt; Result&lt;HttpResponse&gt;, right? - you immediately start feeling the inconvenience and bulkiness of dynamic dispatch. It&#39;s like Rust is punishing you for using it. And with async/await taking this to a new level altogether, because you are immediately forced to understand how async funcs are transformed into ones that return Futures, how Futures are transformed into anon state machine structs; how closures are also transformed to anon structs. It&#39;s like there&#39;s no type system anymore, only structs.That&#39;s one of the reasons, I think, why Go has won the Control Plane. Sure, projects like K8s, Docker, the whole HashiCorp suite are old news. But it&#39;s interesting and telling that even solid Rust shops like PingCAP are using Go for their control plane. It seems to me that there&#39;s some fundamental connection between flexibility of convenient dynamic dispatch and control plane tasks. And of course having the default runtime and building blocks like net and http in the standard library is a huge win.That said, after almost three months of daily Rust it does get better. To the point when you can actually feel that some intuition and genuine understanding is there, and you can finally work on your problems instead of fighting with the language. I just wish that the initial learning curve wasn&#39;t so high."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really think that Windows 2000-era Windows Forms had the user experience nailed perfectly.  It wasn&#39;t the prettiest UI paradigm ever, but it was the most functional and easiest to teach.  Nothing was omitted, and the user was shown everything they needed to see in order to get a complete idea of the state of the application.I don&#39;t think that efforts to hide UI elements that aren&#39;t in use is going to prove to be a good idea when we look back at today from the future.Here&#39;s a good rule, in my mind: Don&#39;t hide UI elements from the user.  End of rule.  I do not care if it looks better without whatever UI element.  The toolbox in my garage would look better if I could only see the tools I needed at the time I need them, and I would return that toolbox (or never buy it in the first place) because it is constantly lying to me about the state of the toolbox, which is absolutely insulting position for a toolbox designer to adopt."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I have a really hard time believing anyone would chose this as opposed to some design lead at Apple pushing a weird personal preference for tidyness on their entire user baseMaybe I don&#39;t understand completely what he is referring to, but on mobile I certainly prefer having a bit more space than a always visible scrollbar. It is usually clear enough that there is more to see below the fold.Scrollbars used to be sometimes useful to get a sense of how much content there is. But everyone using infinite scroll broke that, not apple."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An interesting output of this is, if you keep scrollbars visible, you&#39;ll find that a lot of websites end up with weird extra scrollbars on random elements.What often causes this is some HTML element overflowing by one pixel, but no one saw it during the QA process because all the webdevs were using Macs, which have invisible scrollbars by default. I always enable visible scrollbars on my dev computers specifically so I can catch problems like this."</p>

I once had an excruciatingly awkward interview at a company on an industrial estate in the middle of nowhereland with no train station nearby that took me bloody ages to get to… which was actually going well until they asked me about my long experience with Exchange 2000. I had no experience with Exchange 2000, so I told them, and watched their faces drop.That was specifically why they wanted to speak to me. The recruiter had inserted it onto the copy of the CV he sent to them. I&#39;m surprised I&#39;m not still doing time for murder.What I&#39;m not surprised about though is why they do it. I&#39;ve been to plenty of interviews where my CV hasn&#39;t been given more than a glance. At moments like those I feel a deep sense of pessimism. The whole recruitment process seems broken from end to end and has been for a while."</p>

As it happened, at this hedge fund there worked a former Soviet master or grandmaster ranked player. And so, whenever interviewing any candidate who claimed great proficiency with chess on their resume, at the end of the interview they&#39;d take the candidate to go play the master."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This would benefit the Northeast quite a lot.Assume that your average adult works 9-5, and your average school child is in school 8-3. Broad strokes, these are the two groups to focus on. I know most adults commute earlier than 9, and most students are up earlier than 8, but it&#39;s safe to say that most Americans are up-and-at-&#39;em from 8-5.On the shortest day of the year in Boston, sunrise is at 7:10am and sunset is at 4:14PM. Including civil twilight (&#34;it&#39;s still kind of daytime&#34;) extends it to 6:38am to 4:46PM.Even on the shortest day of the year, if you wake up even before 7 you&#39;re waking up in daylight. But, sunset is super early. Every working adult is commuting home in actual nighttime.Shift that forward 1 hour, and it gets light at 7:30AM and gets dark at 5:45PM. While slightly darker for students in the morning, it&#39;s immensely better for working adults, who at least get some daylight in the evenings, and not actual nighttime before 5PM."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first few articles I could find on this topic neglected to identify the senators co-sponsoring the bill.  Here&#39;s a list from boston.cbslocal.com:* Roy Blunt (R-MO)* Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS)* James Lankford (R-OK)* Ed Markey (D-MA)* Marco Rubio (R-FL)* Rick Scott (R-FL)* Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI)* Ron Wyden (D-OR)Wikipedia has some history on similar, short-lived efforts in the past:&gt; Seasonal observation of DST was first enacted in the US during World Wars I and II, as an attempt conserve fuel. The practice was unpopular and promptly repealed after each war; however, lobbyists from the petroleum industry lobbied to restore DST, as they had noticed it actually increased fuel consumption.&gt; Permanent DST in the US was briefly enacted by President Nixon in 1974, in response to the 1973 oil crisis. The proposal was initially supported by an estimated 79% of the public; that support dropped to 42% after its first winter, owing to the harshness of dark winter mornings that permanent DST creates. An estimated six school children were also killed by motorists due to the new law.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_time_observation_in_...On the eastern edge of the enormous Eastern time zone, I&#39;m sympathetic to permanent DST, but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s a good idea nationwide.  I would probably be in favor of the proposed Atlantic time zone, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"DST has become my favorite &#34;holiday&#34; as an adult. Seasonal depression evaporates when I can see the sun after I finish working for the day. I can go work in my yard, or wash my car after work instead of having to cram it in the middle of the day. I feel more motivated to go do other things in the evening instead of feeling like its time for bed at 5pm."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fun stuff I read since his passing yesterday in the Dutch newspapers.Although he had indeed humility about his contribution to the cassette tape and the CD, he also was frustrated what Sony did in this department. He wanted the CD to be 11,5 cm instead of 12 cm and was disappointed Sony sold the first CD and invented the concept of a walkman instead of Philips.His opinion about cassette tapes and vinyl having a revival because of the analog experience?&#34;I am not a psychologist, but that music experience is of course all nonsense. Nothing can match the sound of the CD. It is absolutely noise and rumble free. That never worked with tape. But who am I to say what&#39;s better, I&#39;m over ninety and have old ears. I have made a lot of record players and I know that the distortion with vinyl is much higher. But some people call it &#34;warm audio.&#34; I think people mostly hear what they want to hear. But there are always madmen who want to look back to the past. There is always a market for that.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s fascinating that someone, within their lifetime, can invent something, watch it become a household item in the entire world and then fade so far into obscurity that new generations only find out about it from encyclopedias."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The cassette tape really is an astounding invention, or I guess a great packaging and convenience improvement, compared to existing tape formats.A revolution in music portability, distribution (both licensed and DIY), home recording, you name it. All kicked off by &#34;little boys who had fun playing&#34;.Tape trading is still big in certain circles, especially within the punk and black metal milieus. Some albums, EPs and demos get their only physical releases ever on limited edition cassette tapes, both because it is inexpensive, easy to DIY and fits the lo-fi aesthetics.Where vinyl has a strong presence among audiophiles (for various mostly imagined reasons) and was always a format for those with money to spend, the humble cassette tape was the format of choice for the youth, the working class and people on the go, and it still carries that down-to-earth appeal today.I know at least for me growing up in the 80s and 90s in a family with just enough money to get by, hand-me-down cassette tapes were how I experienced music, not to mention how we experimented with recording our voices and playing them back at different speeds, and learned what happened when you play the same bit of tape over and over again because it had a really funny bit on it. Getting my first CD and CD player was exotic and felt like science fiction in comparison to the trusty old cassette tape.I keep a drawer of a few old and obsolete physical formats that meant something special to me. My cassette tapes of Deep Purple In Rock, Machine Head, Sgt. Pepper&#39;s, and The Triumph of Death are there, next to the 3.5&#34; floppy disks and Minidiscs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Absolutely worth it, however I&#39;d offer a few short tips:1. Try to stay in one place for a few months, minimum. If you can stay a year or two, do that. Jumping from city to city every week seems exciting at first, but it quickly makes everywhere feel the same.2. To quote Lao Tzu, when your work is done, forget it. If you work remotely, actively disconnect at the end of the day. It&#39;s too easy to be constantly plugged into the English-speaking media world and ignore what&#39;s right in front of you.3. Try to blend in and adopt local clothing, culture, foods, etc. Read books by local authors, watch local films. A bit obvious, maybe, but I&#39;ve met many people who insisted on only eating Western food, reading Harry Potter, and watching Netflix while abroad. At that point, why even bother traveling?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I quit my job and went travelling I used this framework:1. Go via land. You see everything in between all the places you should see as a tourist. You immerse yourself in how a place actually feels. You meet people who aren’t just trying to extract money from you. I cycled, because I like cycling, but any form of transport works.2. My algorithm was something like “Go east. Stay somewhere if it’s interesting, until you get bored. Continue going east.” I didn’t have a fixed itinerary, but I did have some framework.That was the basis of it, I think. I cycled from London to Italy, stopped for a while in Italy, cycled on to Greece, then fell in love (with the place and somebody in particular). I met some of my best friends, worked on side projects, volunteered for charities, and ended up staying there for several months. I skipped forward to India on a plane, cycled across India, then returned back to Greece.My partner in Greece wanted to visit the Middle East and Central Asia, but she wasn’t quite as excited about cycling through the desert as I was, so we bought a van and drove — to Central Asia, and everything in between.My framework worked extraordinarily well. If I have one regret, I think it was not making an effort to interact with more people. You do that a lot more naturally when travelling by land, but you still need to put in effort to make it happen.For example, I was up late in a bar in an Italian village, and met one of the locals. It was a long cycle ride back to the place I was staying so he offered me his spare room. Turns out he lived with his parents and the next day his elderly Italian mother cooked us pasta for lunch. Possibly one of the best meals of my life.I wish I had done more of that. Just hanging out in bars and making friends. And not tourist bars — real bars. Knowing the local language better would probably help."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Did not quit my job, but instead went full remote in 2018 (age 55 at the time).Still doing it, but the pandemic forced me to stay in one country for just about a year now.In that year I put down roots, got long term visas and maybe will spend another few years there while we see how things shape out this and next year.But ya, 2-3 months minimum in a place is what you need, with just a small backpack.Make local friends.Don&#39;t hang around or go out with other tourists or expats. This is the kiss of death.Make it a rule to eat only the food of the city or the country that you find yourself in.Learn a few words of the language &#34;hello&#34;, &#34;thank you&#34;, &#34;bathroom&#34;, &#34;stop&#34;, etc.Don&#39;t think people are less than you. They&#39;re not. They want the same things as you.As an introvert, being forced to make friends with people who speak another language and look the opposite of me (black guy in Asia), was exactly the ticket.Well recommended to do it.The main thing I would say - is have a mission when you travel. Seeing the sights and drinking the bars and mingling with other tourists and shtupping the local girls is fun, but not a mission.You will get bored after some time of doing that.Have some particular work or meaning to each day to keep you grounded, and you can do the moving around for a super-long time.You will find that you&#39;ll set some schedules for work, play and discoveries - regardless of where you are.Just don&#39;t quit your job. Instead go remote (even if you have savings). Ok?"</p>

Our customers are mid- to large-size companies so they do not play reviews but lawyers if our service wasn&#39;t of highest quality :) My personal preference would be to prevent 3rd party companies like google from publishing reviews if the business owner doesn&#39;t want them.Anyway - no customer gave us any review on google and our website is full of recommendation letters. But at some point google started nagging our employees to put reviews since they visited our office.Guess what happened. We got our first review from an employee we were not happy with and planned to gracefully close our cooperation with.This is against Google policy. So we complained. We had to spend significant time to get to a real person at Google and get this removed.After a year similar situation happened. I thought ok - this should be easy the second time. No way - this time all the emails we knew did not respond, we could not reach anybody. We flagged the review several times. We could not do anything about that.It is like a person can just put a shit on your office wall and you could not clean it. And shit owner - Google doesn&#39;t care.We were forced to play by the rules and we bought 50 reviews to paint our wall. The company that provided this service was a Google partner. They explained that 80-90% of reviews of everything is written for money.And the best thing - once we started getting our reviews, the flagged reviews were finally removed. Seems like AI decided the we are a good company.Do you think we did something wrong? Immoral? Or just played business on a not leveled field?And to summarize. I do not care about reviews. And we have money to fight back with lawyers or PR. But it is sad that some businesses don&#39;t have this option and somebody (Google) can harm them through reviews they did not ask for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An interesting thing about paid reviews - you can prove that the reviews are fake, but you usually can&#39;t prove that the business itself actually paid for those reviews. In a hypothetical world where companies with fake reviews are regularly discovered and lambasted in public, it&#39;s easy to imagine a sinister metagame where unscrupulous small businesses can buy bad good reviews (i.e. 5-star reviews that are obviously fake) for their competitors to make them seem sketchy. The folks selling the fake reviews certainly don&#39;t care who&#39;s paying. There&#39;s no obvious solution to me for that potential problem aside from stopping fake reviews before they&#39;re posted (which feels like the kind of thing that&#39;s much harder than it sounds); thankfully it doesn&#39;t appear to be a very common thing yet."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why do giant companies do so many hilariously dumb things?As organizational complexity increases, design debt and responsibility becomes diffused among larger and larger groups of people. Leading to the bizarre situation where no individual has power or responsibility over anything specifically.Any individual interface element might have taken input from as many as 100+ different people over many years, each with competing interests and goals (no, I&#39;m not joking). Combine this with the precedents and decisions made on projects in the past (design debt), and you end up with stupid outcomes like this.As a multiple FAANG alumni, I&#39;ve seen this firsthand hundreds of times.I think it&#39;s cute that people think IC designers or engineers have the power to make any real decisions inside large organizations.What&#39;s more likely, is these stupid icons were part of some design system somebody created 7 years ago (have to stay consistent of course!). The circular floating buttons were a precedent somebody set 5 years ago on a completely different product (god forbid it feels &#34;off-brand&#34;). The colors were set 6 years ago on some project where this kind of application was never thought of.And finally, the order &amp; placement of the icons was changed 15 times by some PM, then the PM&#39;s boss, then the accessibility guys, then the brand team, the brand team&#39;s boss, then the director of marketing, etc. etc. The tie breaking vote going to whoever is perceived as having more soft power inside the org at the time.Hence, the inevitable outcome of big company stupidity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just had an idea that might explain why this happens.Firstly, I&#39;ve observed a phenomenon when I talk to a programmer about a problem I want to solve. They might get excited, learn a bit of the problem domain and then go off and build something that kind of solves part of my problem. But then I&#39;m stuck in a endless cycle of explaining the rest of the problem, to someone who isn&#39;t really interested, then waiting for a new iteration and then evaluating how it doesn&#39;t completely the solve the problem until the programmer gets bored and goes off to find something new and exciting to do with computers. Programming the computerwas always the end for them. They don&#39;t actually care about the problem. I care about the problem. So for me computers are a tool to solve my problem. I might as well write the program myself because it&#39;s less work to become a mediocre programmer than to intimately understand the problem.My theory is that something like this happens in interface design. There are  designers who love to create beautiful designs, and we love that, but beauty is the end of it for them. They don&#39;t actually care about the problem that the program (website, app, whatever) is supposed to solve. If they were stuck in a job filling out forms all day they would quickly learn the lesson to put the reset button out of the way. If they were intimately familiar with the problem, the better design would be obvious. And so it is that people with no &#34;design skills&#34; can point out the obvious mistakes of the designers.It&#39;s also true that good design is hard. Starting with a blank sheet and creating something, let alone something good, is daunting. Perhaps the hardest part is having the humility to admit, &#34;I don&#39;t understand the problem sufficiently&#34; and the empathy to care about the problem enough to learn it well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Phoenix is practically built with this idea in mind.My startup is built out of a single phoenix monolith. Only external dependency is postgres.Despite this, I&#39;ve managed to completely avoid all the typical scaling issues of a monolith. Need a service or background worker? I juts make a Genserver or Oban worker and mount it in the supervision tree. The Beam takes care of maintaining the process, pubsub to said service and error handling in the event of a crash.I&#39;m basicly getting all the best advantages of a monolith* one codebase to navigate, our team is TINY
* all functionality is in librariesAnd all the advantages of microservices without the associated costs. (orchestration, management etc)* bottleneck use cases can live on their own nodes* publish subscribe to dispatch background jobs* services that each focus on doing one thing really wellWe&#39;ve accomplished this all through just libraries and a little bit of configuration. At no point so far have we had to..* setup a message broker (phoenix pubsub has been fine for us. we can send messages between different processes on the server and to the clients themselves over channels)* setup external clusters for background workers. (Oban was drop in and jsut works. I&#39;m able to add a new worker without having to tell devops anything. the supervision tree allocates the memory for the process and takes care of fault tolerance for me. That leaves me to focus on solving the business problems)* setup a second github repo. Its a monorepo and at out scale, its fine. We have one library for communicating to the database that every system just uses.Eventually we&#39;ll probably have to start rethinking and building out separate services. But I&#39;m happy that we&#39;re already able to get some of teh benefits of a microservice architecture while sticking to what makes monoliths great for mvps. It will be awhile before we need to think about scaling out web service. It just works. Leaves me more time to work on tuning out database to keep up!"</p>

It&#39;s like saying, &#34;If you have to get somewhere, running is better than walking.&#34; Sure, in the case of a race or escaping a predator, running is probably the best option. But what if you want to take in the sights or you can&#39;t sweat in your clothes? Running would be a bad choice, even though it&#39;s faster. There are just too many variables in the real world to make any sort of blanket statement about which approach is &#34;better.&#34;"</p>

Many randomized algorithms have a &#34;with high probability&#34; guarantee, which for linear systems might look like:    for any ε &gt; 0 and 0 &lt; δ &lt; 1, using poly(dimension, #nonzeros, condition, 1/ε, 1/δ) floating-point operations, our algorithm finds a solution having less than ε error with probability 1 - δ.

However, that is not the kind of guarantee stated in Theorem 1.1 in the paper.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a great opportunity to not just reimplement the GNU coreutils but to actually rethink them. The way I install a Linux system these days and then immediately download ripgrep or fd reminds me of how the first thing I used to do on a Solaris system was install bash and the GNU coreutils. There&#39;s a rich history of doing this - BSD Unix started as a bunch of utilities and patches to the AT&amp;T version, it only became a freestanding distro with its own kernel later on. And the GNU coreutils go way back before the Linux kernel - you just installed them on a commercial Unix to make it more usable. In both cases they went beyond just drop-in replacements and started adding lots of new features and flags. Things have been pretty static for a long time so it&#39;s good to see some innovations coming."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People are all talking about how it&#39;s useful for quick stuff with datasets, but it goes far beyond that. It&#39;s useful for quick anything you might want a small database for. Imagination is the limit.For example, if any of you play D&amp;D online, you might be familiar with dndbeyond&#39;s character sheets. They&#39;re a fantastic way to onboard new players who might not have the inclination to spend hours with the rule books before they even start playing. It does all the calculations for you and gives you some buttons like &#34;roll athletics&#34; and doesn&#39;t let you add more spells than your character can have with their stats.I recently persuaded some friends to give FATE a try and built analogous push-button character sheets with google sheets [0]. It was quick and simple. With conditional formatting, you highlight bad states (rules say you can&#39;t have more of X than Y!). With the script editor, you can add full on buttons for dice rolls and other state changes with whatever logic you want (anything you can code up!). Checkboxes are obvious but super useful. And the transparency of the calculations is helpful for teaching people the system (this stat is &#34;min(A4, B1+C5)&#34;).Without google sheets, it would be a serious endeavor to build a stateful, database backed, live collaborative GUI that can be added to and customized on the fly by my users. With google sheets, it was a quick fun afternoon hack. Excel/google sheets is an amazing piece of technology.[0] Screenshot of the &#34;app&#34;: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imh/public_images/main/Scr..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hadn&#39;t used Excel in years and now that I do, there&#39;s some things about it that drive me nuts:- It forgets what you&#39;ve copied to clipboard. Copy something. Insert another row so that there&#39;s space for it. Paste. Nothing happens. Huh? It lost my copy. It does this for a large number of operations and it drives me crazy. I&#39;ve never seen any other program do this.- You can&#39;t open two spreadsheets of the same name. This is because spreadsheet formulas can refer to cells in other tables. But I don&#39;t use that feature - can&#39;t I just open the second spreadsheet with a warning that this feature won&#39;t apply to it?- (This one applies to too many pieces of Microsoft technology.) You can&#39;t use common keyboard shortcuts properly. Ctrl-backspace deletes a word in any useful text box. Not in formula editing in excel. And ctrl+delete deletes the rest of the line instead of just the next word. Why?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Excel, and more importantly, the spreadsheet is the best way to build intuition for a dataset, hands down. The alternatives, especially when it comes to Python and the default pandas output in a Jupyter Notebook are horrendous.Where Excel falls short, is data size limitations + auditability. Putting more than 1M rows of data into Excel is not possible, and once you get into the low 100K&#39;s, it becomes almost unbearable. And handing off an Excel workbooks to a colleague is handing them hours of cell dependency tracing. On the other hand, data size + auditability are the super powers of Python data analysis.I&#39;ve been building a Python package, Mito (https://trymito.io/), its an interactive spreadsheet that automatically converts your spreadsheet analysis to the equivalent pandas code. You can write spreadsheet formulas, merge datasets, create pivot tables, etc. And because its implemented in Python, you can manipulate datasets with 10M rows of data with no problem. Our goal is to bring the intuitiveness of Excel data manipulation to Pandas."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This work (I think) worked with the mosquitos 30cm away with a servo scanning Pi Camera (1080p) and a 1W laser.To work in the real world - cover a whole room or terrace - presumably a much higher resolution camera (or much faster scanning system) would be required.  Even a 1W laser is dangerous to eyesight, if it was being fired at targets mingling with people.The system could be mounted on small drones that would patrol larger areas - but the idea of robotic drones armed with lasers roaming around is beginning to sound worse than the mosquitos."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a nice little firestarter.I&#39;ve had this idea many years ago and my solution to that problem was to use two or more lasers of lower power that all shoot at the same point in 3 dimensional space. If you guess wrong then at least you won&#39;t set your house on fire (or blind someone)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can do this with sound.   A hybrid system even better.I built tech ~10 years ago to track quiet, sound emitting objects in real time to sub CM resolution using microphone arrays.  And in one demo I even had a laser pointer mounted on a 2 axis.... &#34;swinging thingie&#34; (sorry, I&#39;m not a mech-E) which would constantly stay pointed on the loudest object in the room, as it moved.  Fun stuff.  Creepy even.Shame I never found a use or a buyer for the tech. :/EDIT:  I bet an improved hybrid one would use sound to get within the right 1-2cm, with a zoom camera mounted on the pan/tilt apparatus to get it even more accurate."</p>
