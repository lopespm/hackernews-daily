It&#39;s like a bad sci-fi pulp story.Given their investment and research, I wonder if they should open it all up (even if contradictory to short-term gains in ad revenue) so it has a chance to grow? Federate it a bit more than they are comfortable with, to at least give it a chance. I could see this flubbing out hard otherwise.I&#39;m personally keen on the AR/VR space (surrounded by headsets here), but the early adopters are so polarized about Facebook/Oculus&#39;s involvement. I don&#39;t know if a rebrand (is this really that?) would be enough for the tech crowd to forget and move on."</p>

Now a 2021 &#34;One More Thing&#34; is the announcement of a company rebrand to avoid government regulation."</p>

I loved starting with a blank sheet of paper and applying various photographic methods to bring the image to life.&gt;I found that building websites was similarly satisfying. For example, click the &#34;Reveal Image&#34; button to watch an image fade in to the blank canvas!I think a lot about why I went into computer science and this is the same conclusion I came to. There&#39;s something really cool about starting with a blank page and coding in elements that appear one by one and adapting the code to be what you want. Maybe there&#39;s other ways to do it but programming seemed to be the most powerful.Just to be clear, it was video games, not photography that kinda nudged me into programming, but same idea with a blank canvas and having control of it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"All of this talk about supply chain issues are totally missing the point in my opinion. So many articles (and tweet chains I guess) have been written about supply chain issues, yet every one of them seems to ignore the elephant in the room which is demand for goods vs services. Over the course of the pandemic there was a staggering re-balancing of consumer spending [0] from services to goods, to which supply chains have not caught up.If the spending doesn&#39;t re-balance again as restrictions are lifted this is not a temporary supply chain issue caused by just-in-time methodology, it&#39;s just the new normal.[0] https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=19&amp;step=2#reqid...EDIT: That link is broken, should have been this https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=19&amp;step=3&amp;isuri..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at a company who made products on contract, but the contract stipulated the vendor we had to use to get the raw materials. The raw materials were just aluminum castings, but they were a custom shape specifically for this customer of ours. They could only be used for this one product.I noticed that the inventory levels of our vendor were dropping, but we weren&#39;t buying. Meaning our customer was ordering the same product from a competitor.I proposed that we spend the money to buy the rest of the material at the vendor. Basically denying our competitor the materials and forcing either them to come to us or the customer dropping the order and reordering through us. This would have been a risk because that&#39;s about a year supply of proprietary castings that we can&#39;t use for anything else, but I really thought it was a worthwhile opportunity. But it went against lean principles so we didn&#39;t do it.Fast forward 6 months and our competitor basically did the same thing to us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe the claim is completely defensible and ultimately correct.A) This was a multi-factoral event certainly but all of these other factor are &#34;immediate causes&#34; which can themselves be traced to absolute maximum return on equity as a more final cause.B) No doubt &#34;hard to restart&#34; process are were involved. But the world relies on single-source, hard to restart, large scale production of many things today because these produce the highest returns for those who invest in them and the lowest prices for those who buy from them. And both kinds of actors have been willing to just stop producing rather than doing something that might be costly to keep production going (and they decided they didn&#39;t want backup before this for the same reason).C) Supply lines that stretch around world exist as a combination of economies of scale and &#34;labor market arbitrage&#34; and both these are driven by return, even though &#34;labor market arbitrage&#34; doesn&#39;t increase efficiency or robustness.D) Chip manufactures put money into &#34;up-date&#34; chip processes, notably leaving the sorts of chips actually used in cars woah fully under-invested and generally many sorts of lack of robustness can be traced down to money flowing only to the normally profitable. Shutting down production isn&#39;t necessarily that bad for a company - they don&#39;t wages and they can start back up once things stabilize. It&#39;s much less disastrous than making a bunch of stuff and not being able to sell it. Clearly, that thinking is guiding a lot of decisions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been testing one for a couple weeks, and a quick rundown on it: it has a quad-core A53, same CPU/SoC core as the Pi 3, with 512 MB of RAM.This means it can run 64-bit Pi OS, but it is memory-limited and even some of the benchmarks I ran needed extra swap space to complete. But for anything that does run in the 512 MB of LPDDR2 RAM, it is at least twice as fast as the Zero/Zero W, and sometimes 3-8x faster, depending on how things handle threading (4 cores is better than 1!).My biggest concern is overheating—even at the base 1 GHz clock, it will start to throttle after a few minutes in a case with no airflow or heat sink. You can overclock to 1.2, 1.4, or even in some cases 1.5 GHz, but it starts throttling a lot more quickly unless you have really good cooling."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been running one of these for a few months too and was excited when I saw an ARMv7 CPU. In the open source and container world, many projects have stopped supporting the Zero and RPi1 due to its lack of RAM and slow CPU speed. Even running &#34;go build&#34; can take multiple seconds on a simple program. Starting Node.js was also fairly slow.The RPi zero shines for Python scripts that access hardware - for sensors and camera projects that are low power and cheap to make. It was actually perfect for the GrowLab project that we did over the summer with 20 others from the community https://growlab.dev - sensor data and camera images were aggregated to a more powerful RPi3/4 and then either uploaded to a static GitHub Pages site, fed into InfluxDB to create beautiful charts with Grafana.The new Zero 2 means that I can start to run ARMv7 or even ARM64 containers on the zero again, but with the limit of 512GB of RAM. The launch blog post explains why this couldn&#39;t be made higher.The first thing I tried out was not K3s, which I knew already suffers on a Raspberry Pi 3, but faasd. Faasd is OpenFaaS but built for pure containerd, no multi-node networking and no Kubernetes. It works fairly well for a few functions, even with NATS and Prometheus being deployed as part of the stack.So whilst you&#39;re not going to be building K3s clusters with these, they can run containers - with Docker, containerd, nerdctl and even as a full application stack with faasd.Where this gets more interesting for me, is hosting small applications, integrations or APIs. Perhaps with Ingress via a tunnel that can penetrate NAT/firewalls like Inlets, Argo or Ngrok.I&#39;ve ordered one of the release models to see how it performs. Look out for a blog post from me soon."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Many good points. I&#39;d like to add a common open secret that I believe is wrong: 1 upvote = 1 karma point.This might be true internally and initially, before any ant-spam, anti-upvote-ring detection takes place. Effectively, from a user point of view it is not - at least for me.When I look at the points one of my submissions get and compare my increase in overall karma it is very roughly 50% most of the time.   Needless to say that I never participated in things that would be considered unethically (voting-ring etc.). Also not a complaint at all, just an observation that goes against what is often written in &#34;about HN&#34; type posts (but not OP).EDIT:1. My observation is from more than a year ago, so things might well have changed.2. As lordnacho points out below this seems to be true only for stories. Regardless why it happens, awarding stories with less points than comments makes a lot of sense to me. After all posting a suitable story is much less effort than writing a decent comment."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is great news!  This is a wonderful project, and the fact that it wasn&#39;t accessible from Germany made me profoundly sad and angry.I hope the responsible copyright lawyers have a hard time sleeping because of this and consider changing their line of work.  If you are blocking people from reading books in the public domain, it is a good indication that you are one of the bad guys.Even worse, they only blocked people from Germany that didn&#39;t know how to use a VPN.  German courts really don&#39;t get how the internet works."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want state here on fact, the &#34;copyright&#34; is an rather new  anglon-saxon invention and was only later imported to Germany[1]. Interestingly, the era of the &#34;land of poets and thinkers&#34; and the economic rise of Germany was boosted by the fact - that there were no copyrights laws which hindered. Authors had to publish good and more work.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright#BackgroundQuote from WikipediaPrinting brought profound social changes. The rise in literacy across Europe led to a dramatic increase in the demand for reading matter. Prices of reprints were low, so publications could be bought by poorer people, creating a mass audience. In German language markets before the advent of copyright, technical materials, like popular fiction, were inexpensive and widely available; it has been suggested this contributed to Germany&#39;s industrial and economic success. After copyright law became established (in 1710 in England and Scotland, and in the 1840s in German-speaking areas) the low-price mass market vanished, and fewer, more expensive editions were published; distribution of scientific and technical information was greatly reduced.And from the history arctileHeinrich Heine, in a 1854 letter to his publisher, complains: &#34;Due to the tremendously high prices you have established, I will hardly see a second edition of the book anytime soon. But you must set lower prices, dear Campe, for otherwise I really don&#39;t see why I was so lenient with my material interests.&#34;It is not okay to claim other works as yours, publish private material or just don&#39;t give you a fair share upon your work. Probably we should have opted for another approach than &#34;copyright&#34; or &#34;patents&#34;. Luckily the US at least got &#34;Fair Use&#34; and maybe the idea of a &#34;Culture Flatrate&#34; from Germany is also a good idea."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m curious as to what changed PGLAF&#39;s mind. Blocking those specific works was all that the court ordered 3 years ago. Blocking everything was PGLAF&#39;s own decision based on perceived risk of further lawsuits about other works. Nothing has really changed to decrease that risk. The plaintiffs may have agreed that those are the only works they own that were in violation, and won&#39;t sue about anything else, but any other German who hold the copyright to works are still valid there but not the US still could."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; There was a rule in the Port of Los Angeles saying you could only stack shipping containers two containers high.This is incorrect.
There was a zoning rule which affected truck yards in Long Beach and Los Angeles. Truck yards. Not the port itself.As stated in the linked tweets actually.But if you don&#39;t believe that you can just google an image of the Port of Los Angeles from let&#39;s say 2019 and count how high the container piles go. Here is a randomly selected image from 2019 where 5 high piles can be clearly counted: https://www.joc.com/sites/default/files/field_feature_image/...Accuracy is important. I&#39;m not an expert on logistics, or zoning laws. But how could I trust the article&#39;s author when they clearly unable to parse their own sources?&gt; Normally one would settle this by changing prices, but for various reasons we won’t get into price mechanisms aren’t working properly to fix supply shortages.It&#39;s nice that the article is not going into that. Instead it hammers on that politicians regulate where and how many containers can you plop down. That is not the real issue.If you are moving containers into an area, and you are not moving an equal amount out then you are going to run out of space to store the containers. It is that simple. You can tweak rules to make a bit more space, for example by stacking them higher in the truck yards. But the real question is: why are the people who own these containers incentivised to move them back to where they want them to be filled?  If you solve that the problem solves itself. If you can&#39;t solve that piles of containers will fill up what little more space you won by tweaking. So the very point the article decides to &#34;not go into&#34; is the only one worth going into."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Someone correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but my understanding is that the &#39;stacking rule&#39; meant that people with more empties than they could stack 2 high on their property were &#34;storing&#34; empties on trailer chassis that carry one container.As I understood it, by letting them stack empties higher, it freed up trailers to be used by trucks to go get containers out of the port. When that happens the port then wants empties to put back on the ship (or full if they are going somewhere) and then the ship can continue on.So the &#34;win&#34; here was that more trailers would be available to take full containers from ships and that would move things along."</p>

I&#39;m all about space-saving while still having a full-power PC.It&#39;s a niche, boutique market but there are some really interesting cases. My personal favourite is the Louqe Ghost S1 [1]. I&#39;ve built one PC with this (the Mk II). I bought a Mk III case but couldn&#39;t source a GPU so ended up just buying a CyberpowerPC prebuilt (which is actually a pretty nice PC, to be fair).They&#39;re not cheap and they&#39;re kind of annoying to buy. Louqe in particular has had huge distribution problems in the US (through Amazon&#39;s logistics service).Another popular one is the Dan A4 [2]. It&#39;s smaller. I personally prefer the Ghost for having better airflow, being more modular and being able to expand the case with &#34;top hats&#34;. This allows you to add a 240mm AIO and bottom fans for some pretty darn good cooling and airflow.Anyway, I&#39;m always excited to see entrants in this market.[1]: https://www.louqe.com/ghost-s1/[2]: https://www.dan-cases.com/dana4.php"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love &#39;no frills&#39; PC cases, but to me, this case has frills. The bright orange, the rounded corners and all the cutouts.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A lot of comments seem focused on the incentives to apple and what&#39;s motivating the change. All fair questions. To me, though, it feels like just a radically different approach this year.2016 macbook felt like leadership got in a room and said &#34;okay, let&#39;s make a list of all the sexy things we can think of that would make the macbook unique&#34;. This netted things like thin-beyond-practicality, touchbar, removing all the ports, etc.2021 macbook feels like leadership got in a room and said &#34;okay, let&#39;s make a list of all the top things everybody is complaining about most.&#34; And they just fixed everything (well, most things) on that list one-by-one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"AFAIK, replacing the battery on the previous generation meant replacing the top part of the body, to which the battery was glued. That included replacing the keyboard and the touchpad (not 100% sure if the old keyboard and touchpad could have been kept; maybe they were replaced just because of the damage done to them by the expanding batteries). At the same time, the previous generation had battery problems and keyboard problems (as pointed out in sub-comments), which meant many were replaced for free even out of warranty (as it happened to me due to faulty battery).I suspect someone at Apple realized how much would have been saved if only the battery was not glued to the case.Edit: mentioned the keyboard problem, which would result in replacing the battery too it seems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I still remember when you didn&#39;t even have to open up the &#34;MBP&#34; and could replace the battery directly from the bottom.  Even had green led indicator to show how much charge it had directly on the battery case."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ve never understood the value proposition for Copilot.In terms of difficulty, writing code is maybe on average a two out of ten.On average, maintaining code you wrote recently is probably a three out of ten in terms of difficulty, and maintaining code somebody else wrote or code from a long time ago probably rises to around a five out of ten.Debugging misbehaving code is probably a seven out of ten or higher.GitHub Copilot is optimising the part of the process that was already the easiest, and makes the other parts harder because it moves you from the “I wrote this” path to the “somebody else wrote this” path.Even during the initial write, it changes the writing process from programming (which is easy) to understanding somebody else’s code to ensure that it’s right before accepting the suggestion (which is much less easy).  I just don’t understand how this is a net time/energy savings?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Copilot is crazy. The other day, I was writing a Python function that would call a Wikipedia API. I pulled from the internet an example of a GET request, and pasted it as a comment in my code.  # sample call: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&amp;format=json&amp;list=geosearch&amp;gscoord=37.7891838%7C-122.4033522&amp;gsradius=10000&amp;gslimit=100

Then I defined a variable,  base_url = &#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?&#34;

Then, like magic, Copilot suggested all the remaining keys that would go in the query params. It even knew which params were to be kept as-is, and which ones would come from my previous code:  action = &#34;query&#34;  # action=query
  format = &#34;json&#34;  # or xml
  lat = str(latitude.value)  # 37.7891838
  lon = str(longitude.value)  # -122.4033522
  gscoord = lat + &#34;%7C&#34; + lon
  ...
  api_path = base_url + &#34;action=&#34; + action + &#34;&amp;format=&#34; + format + ... + &#34;&amp;gscoord=&#34; + gscoord

As a guy who gets easily distracted while programming, Copilot saves me a lot of time and keeps me engaged with my work. I can only imagine what it&#39;ll look like 10 years from now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been using this for weeks and it blooooows my mind. It comes up with crazy recommendations, just yesterday I wrote this big ass logic to do something, then I wanted to move that code to a function so I wrote the function name and I kid you not copilot suggested a one-liner that worked…  the thing is so useful and I’m not writing simple code (writing cryptographic code). And when it’s not doing that at the very least it provides auto-completion to lists where a counter has to increase and things like that. It’s just baffling, I don’t think I’m that directly impacted by AI, or at least this is the first time where I’m like “wow, AI really is changing the world RIGHT NOW”. Half-joking: can’t wait for it to just write my code.Also if this feature would be paid tomorrow, I think I would pay for it. It’s really noticeable when I don’t have copilot enabled now.Oh and, autocompletion doesn’t work with markdown files because of markdown plugins I think? But this is another level of insanity: when I’m writing english it figures a lot of the sentences I want to write. Makes me question if I’m just a deterministic individual with no choice."</p>

Doctors and agricultural workers are the obvious standouts, but I see a few more too.Us programmers stick together. Quite a high rate of marrying within the community. Lawyers show a similarly high number.A criticism of the study, is that it does not normalize by how many of these professions are in the general population. So, it appears as though software analysts don&#39;t like intermarrying. However, the truth is that there simply aren&#39;t enough of them around, they are simply more likely to run into software engineers, so that&#39;s whom they marry most.IE.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting. Usually my critique for products like this is something along the lines of &#34;great, but how are you going to access your data from the internet?&#34; Typically the answer to that is you need some sort of tunneling service like ngrok to get around port forwarding, CGNAT, firewalls, etc. I maintain a list of solutions here[0]. The problem with most of these services is that they&#39;re targeted at developers and aren&#39;t something the average user should have to mess with.In this case, the PiBox is being offered by KubeSail[1], a company which specializes in services like tunneling (they&#39;re already on the list mentioned above). It will be very interesting to see if they can bundle it in such a way that people don&#39;t have to worry about how the tunneling works. Extra points if they make it easy for users to buy/use their own domains.[0]: https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling[1]: https://kubesail.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m looking for something like this, but cheaper and for 3.5&#34; drives. USD$250, plus shipping to Australia puts that just too high for what it offers.I own Synology NASs, but adding an expander for that is expensive. (AUD$800)The ODroid-HC4 looks promising, but their &#39;toaster&#39; case design for it is awful, leaving the drives exposed and unable to put two atop each other.Ideally what I&#39;d like is:- 1-2x 3.5&#34; SATA drives- Gbit NIC- Enough grunt to run some kind of clustered filesystem (gluster, ceph, whatever)The idea being that I could start a cluster with say 3x of these devices, and then as my storage needs grow - add more.They don&#39;t need to have stellar IO, but enough to keep up with plex."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently did something like this myself with an RPi 4 and an external drive over USB to replace Google Photos (with PhotoPrism). For tunneling (and custom domain) I used cloudflared which works surprisingly well: https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared. I wrote about it here: https://domh.dev/blog/replacing-google-photos-with-photopris...That being said, I love that someone is working on making this stuff easier to do, it was finicky to get it setup myself. I would be backing it if I hadn&#39;t just done it already.I wish Kubesail all the best and I hope they succeed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As others have said, there are more cost effective options than just getting your attorney to do a patent search for you. There are definitely plenty of companies that will do it for you for far less. But the quality is... variable, to say the least.As a point of shameless self-promotion, I&#39;m the founder of a company seeking to improve the patent system, starting with prior art search [1][2]. We&#39;re not one of those companies that will do it for you for less. Instead, we empower you to do it yourself, then have your attorney go deeper if needed. The idea being that you don&#39;t need to be a patent expert or lawyer to do it; anyone with knowledge of their technical area can search effectively.  Plus we&#39;ve got some collaboration features so when you&#39;re ready to hand off to your $500/hr attorney, you can. And not just hand off -- collaborate.If a patent troll is shaking you down, reach out to us and we&#39;ll do you a generous deal, no strings attached. We very much do not like patent trolls.[1] https://www.amplified.ai/[2] https://www.amplified.ai/en/blog/22062020/introducing-amplif..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hooray for him.Patent trolls have a business model, which he&#39;s disrupted:1) buy a patent, the broader and better-tested the better2) start threatening the easy marks; the ones who roll over and write you a check right away.  Their trick is to ask for a settlement small enough to say &#34;hey, it&#39;ll cost you more than that for attorney&#39;s fees!&#34;

3) use that money to threaten the harder targets: the ones who will fight back. Those people get asked for much larger sums.4) maybe actually go to trial with a very big target, one that&#39;ll get dinged for a 9-figure judgment if the troll wins. In the Eastern District of Texas, juries tend to do that.Researching the validity of a patent does not require $400/hour attorneys. Anyone with a basic knowledge of patent law and computer science can do it. (And no, I&#39;m not advertising for myself. I&#39;m retired.) Do you think those expensive attorneys do it themselves? It is to laugh -- they assign it to a junior who knows technology."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Every time a company settles it just funds the trolls to wreak more havoc. This is especially true for companies larger than $100 million in revenue. I’m looking at you Texas Instruments, VIA Technologies, Renesas, ASUS, Caterpillar, Nuvision International, and Netgear, just to name a few of the companies that have dealt with Jason Nguyen’s Altair Logix. When you roll over and pay the trolls it hurts smaller companies terribly.I wonder if those companies consider this a &#34;feature&#34;?"</p>

Their magical orb device sends a biometric hash to their network.Here&#39;s my take on it: You can possibly replace their biometric device with a random hash generator.* If it works, it means the currency is not fairly distributed, but anyone sending valid hashes to their network is issued tokens, irrespective of whether the eyeballs described by those hashes exist. This is called a Sybil attack.* If it doesn&#39;t work, it means there is some secret or centralized check that the network performs, which means the currency is not open.This is why we still use proof-of-work in spite of its energy expense: it is simple to understand, it can not be faked, and it can be openly verified.So, do not support this biometric-gathering enterprise."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As I understand it, the distribution mechanism of Worldcoin is not part of the protocol. The protocol does not know anything about eyes.So the distribution seems completely centralized. A central authority distributes the coins however they wish.Today they might use a process involving eye scans. Or maybe not. There is no way to check. Tomorrow they might change their approach however they like. And we would have no way of knowing.The issue that seems to be overlooked is that there is no way to look at a hash and decide if it was created via scanning an eye. The hash is signed via some key that - according to the makers of WC - sits in an eye scanning device which behaves a certain way. But we have no way of checking that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; It’s also worth noting that end-to-end encryption is necessarily broken as messages to (and from) WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram pass across the bridge(s). The bridge(s) operates in Element’s trusted EMS environment, with no content scanning or datamining, but currently bridged conversations are not stored end-to-end encrypted in Matrix (they will be in the future).As a Signal user, I kind of don&#39;t want this to take off. I like knowing that when I message someone on Signal, it&#39;s for their eyes only. It feels like this service starts fragmenting some of the privacy guarantees of the bridged providers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Back in the day before the rise of Facebook, there was an open source service that combined all the popular messaging protocols - MSN, AoL, IRC, etc.It was called Pidgin[0], and it never got particularly big.I see the same thing here. While it&#39;s interesting, I&#39;m failing to see what the use case is. What&#39;s the niche that needs this solved in a big way?[0] https://www.pidgin.im/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is nicely timed.Brief history: when Hangouts was going away and Google Chat coming in, I pitched Matrix to my friends as a better alternative that didn&#39;t require unique phone numbers, awkward desktop limitations, and a better federated future. We stuck with Google Chat because inertia and networks suck that way.I revisited the instance I had setup and got the mautrix-googlechat bridge working. It&#39;s pretty nice but one friend lamented that he did not have the technical skills to self-host such a thing. And here comes this announcement! Sadly, there is a major hurdle: neither Google Chat nor SMS/GVoice are listed here and those are the major protocols that my social group uses.At the same time, my social group is conservative in adopting new core technologies and wary of cloud lock-in for critical roles (Google being both an unfortunate anchor and precipitator of that). I&#39;m not sure adding those protocols would tip the balance."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just upgraded to Monterey on my Macbook Pro 2018 15-inch and after rebooting, all of the USB-C ports stopped working, including the power adapter. I spent some time on the phone with Apple Support trying to figure out how to fix it. After about an hour and a half there was about 18% battery left before I started to panic and figure out how I was going to back everything up.After panicking, the 3rd Apple Support Representative and I endeavoured to try and reset the System Management Controller (SMC) [1] once again. At this point I had realised that the first few times that I tried this with a previous support representative would not have worked, as I was holding shift on the left-hand side of the keyboard (the previous support representative did not specify) and not the right-hand side as outlined in the support article for Macs with the T2 chip.Good luck!1. https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201295"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I haven’t seen this anywhere when I’ve looked, so I’ll ask here on the slim chance maybe they really added something I badly want and somebody knows…Is there any application forced sandboxing feature yet?Something users can control to forcibly stop bad behavior from certain “must have” apps. Chrome, for example, has been caught doing entire drive scans on Windows, and I’m not sure I entirely trust Zoom either. So I’d like to lock down what they can access in terms of files, paths, devices and so on and be fully confident that even if my employer demands I run some software installer provided by their “partners” that it hasn’t installed some creepy daemon and configured launchd to keep it running after I kill the app or even kill -9 the process.Yes we can use VMs for this, but Mac laptops aren’t generally beefy machines, so that’s not an optimal solution.There used to be sandbox_exec, but I’ve heard they removed it entirely from this version. We’re now supposed to get things from the (cr)App Store, which guarantees the app will only have entitlements that Apple approves. But vendors are abandoning the App Store in droves for many good reasons, and after recent events I don’t totally trust Apple to prevent malicious use piggybacking on top of a legit entitlement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SharePlay to Mac (I tested audio) is utterly broken. Shockingly so. I just tried it again, and my music isn&#39;t paused, yet is stuck at 0:02. Pausing and unpausing it, and the song starts ticking, 0:03, 0:04, and so on, but you can&#39;t hear any audio. Pause it again. It goes back to 0:02. Now try this with AirPods connected to your Mac. Connect your iPhone&#39;s Apple Music to AirPlay to Mac. The YouTube video you had playing on your Mac gets paused, for no reason. But at least you hear your iPhone&#39;s audio on your Mac. Now pickup your iPhone. Your AirPods have now switched to your iPhone, that&#39;s still AirPlaying to Mac. You can&#39;t hear your music anymore. You reconnect the AirPods to your Mac. You can hear your iPhone music for a few minutes. Suddenly you can&#39;t hear anything. Pick up your phone, the volume slider in the Music app went all the way to the left. You can&#39;t move the volume slider to the right, like it&#39;s frozen; but the song is still playing. You go to Control Center, and finally manage to increase the volume. A minute later, the volume goes to zero again. If you were hoping to compensate for Spotify Connect not being on Apple Music, you&#39;ll be disappointed.Also, Safari has a bug that ignores your setting to not reopen non-private windows, and reopens them anyway, so if that&#39;s important to you, you may want to temporarily switch to another browser.And yes, it still has the &#34;occasionally laggy trackpad cursor&#34; bug on M1 for me.But other than that, it seems quite a bit faster than Big Sur, and so far (past 2 weeks), very stable on the core stuff."</p>

Our personal data is being used as knowledge against us - as power against us. It is used to make us do things we otherwise would not do: to buy a certain product or to vote a certain way.As companies share more information with governments, they are able to learn more and more about their citizens. Take Facebook, a company that Laura Poitras described as &#39;a gift to intelligence agencies&#39;[1]. Facebook allows governments to arrest people planning to participate in protests before they have even begun. This is just the tip of the iceberg.Our privacy is eroding. As a society, we are beginning to accept this lack of privacy as normal: and this is extremely dangerous. Privacy provides a place for us to be ourselves, to express ourselves in new ways without fear of being watched by preying eyes. If we lose privacy then we lose this ability to experiment, and, more importantly, we lose our power.[0]https://aeon.co/essays/privacy-matters-because-it-empowers-u...[1]https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/10/23..."</p>

It is deeply connected with ownership and agency. Holding on to a private piece of the information universe is what underpins also all civic and commercial activity.It is not clear why we still just talk about privacy instead of actually doing something meaningful about it [0].

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So glad to see PouchDB included. We use it and have generally had a great experience! We use it with CouchDB on the backend, and Couch seems like a fantastic way to go for use cases involving syncing data between devices with an offline mode and syncing between clients. It was built from the ground up with replication in mind.Biggest bummer of CouchDB? If you’re not hosting it yourself, there’s only one major player in the market that I know of: IBM Cloudant. They contribute much to Apache CouchDB though, and hosting it yourself doesn’t seem too difficult, especially for small, simple use cases.Anyone else using CouchDB?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Last write wins is not a strategy for conflict resolution, it&#39;s a surrender.So I&#39;m glad to hear something else apart from Pouch actually handles it. Anyone familiar with rxdb and can chime in on how they do it?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not directly related to the post (which is focused on which database to host for your app), but I&#39;m writing desktop apps (think DAWs) in C++ and Rust (not JS), and want to synchronize settings through a Dropbox or Google Drive (so I don&#39;t have to host my own cloud sync servers). What&#39;s a good library or schema to achieve this?Personally I usually don&#39;t have multiple instances of the same app open on multiple machines, but other people might open the same or different files on their desktop and laptop.- Not all settings should be synchronized (don&#39;t include machine-specific &#34;recent files&#34; paths).- How should settings be stored locally (if I may have multiple instances of my app open on a single machine)? Registry (Windows-only)? INI with atomic saving (requires care and locking to prevent multiple instances from trampling or racing with each other)? SQLite?IMO Stylus is a pretty good implementation of offline-first cloud settings sync over Dropbox/etc. It&#39;s currently based around one JSON file per CSS file (Dropbox/Apps/Stylus - Userstyles Manager/docs/uuid.json), and what appears to be a transaction log (Dropbox/Apps/Stylus - Userstyles Manager/changes/number.json). Cloud sync has been 100% reliable in my experience, though I do notice temporary file lock errors when switching between different machines in my dual-boot setup (but sync seems to be eventually consistent nonetheless).uBlock Origin is worse. Instead of merging settings, it expects the user to upload and download the entire settings blob at once (and pulling an old blob can erase changes you&#39;ve made locally). And in the past it&#39;s entirely failed to sync because the blob was too big to upload to Mozilla&#39;s servers. (Right now it &#34;works&#34; but takes several minutes for one computer to see a config uploaded from another computer.)"</p>

Quantity: 2
Ingredient: Scallions
Preparation: Finely Chopped

I know if I can&#39;t find scallions, I can replace it with garlic and onions.3. Variants. Often I have the same core recipe in my recipe book with just different variants. Meringue cookies with different flavors. 90% of the recipe is all the same, but it&#39;s duplicated a dozen times for a dozen specific flavor add-ins.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My experience is, # of engineers is directly related to # of product people, which is in turn related to quantity (not quality) of ideas that the founders/leaders are desperate to try out.Higher quantity of ideas == More engineers. Higher quality of ideas == Fewer engineers.WhatsApp success is not about what WhatsApp did, it&#39;s about everything they didn&#39;t do. No desktop, no browser (until after reaaaaaaallly long), no account creation (your phone number is enough, thanks), no hidden ad engine, no hundreds of stupid features that product people stuff down in the name of experimentation.There are some leaders who want anything and everything: Throw 100 darts in the wall. Leave what sticks (don&#39;t touch or nurture it). Go back to throwing 100 more. The other guy does that? We want that too. Mobile? Yes. Desktop? Yes. Browser? Yes. Different affiliate channels? Yes. Custom features for B2B partners? Yes. Merchandizing? Yes. Build a mini Ad engine? Yes. Multi user profile management systems? Yes. Yes, yes, yes, every requirement is a go.The crucial difference is: What happens when you have a restricted pool of people, but insist on doing 100s of things? Some leaders simply treat this as an &#34;org structure&#34; problem, not a problem of focus. They slice and dice the org until the 30 people become split into teams of 2-3 with a manager for each, running into coordination hell on each step – just so that more quantity of features can be seen on paper.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m honestly not that surprised about the size. In my experience, efficiency and the number of engineers have not necessarily correlated.For example, I used to work for a company with about 500 employees (relatively large by German standards) and now work for a competing company in the same industry with less than 150 employees. The core engineering team only consists of a dozen engineers.The output is noticeably larger. The number of new features and especially the stability is significantly better. It is noticeable that due to the small team, each project has one or two &#34;heroes&#34;. They are responsible for most of the commits and know the system inside out.These &#34;heroes&#34; have been working on the same or similar systems for over 30 years in some cases and have experienced a lot in their careers. As such, they can bring experience and advice that is just out of reach for others.Given the choice, I would always prefer a small team over a large team."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I looked at it this way. The thing most engineers, hero&#39;s or not, want to work on is new projects and to build products customers enjoy. The last thing they want to work on is maintenance. In my last personally owned company, small as we were, the engineering team and I documented how things worked as part of what we did every day. We found that by having the inner workings documented so that anyone in the team could effect a repair or update a piece of code freed us to work on new products and services. Just having the system continually documented freed our minds and kept us mostly happy (everyone has a challenge from time to time) and productive.The documentation, not that it really matters, was done in a MoinMoin wiki. It was written by engineers, for engineers. We didn&#39;t stop marketing or sales or anyone else from reading it, but the target audience was the engineering and operation staff thus no one had to over-explain the vocabulary of our architecture."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here. I&#39;m surprised to see my hobby project on Hacker News.I know this kind of stuff spark the ``it&#39;s meaningless to rewrite everything (especially Linux) in Rust&#39;&#39; debate. I agree 100% that rewriting Linux in Rust (or your favorite language) is just a waste of time and such a project won&#39;t live long.That said, what I&#39;d say here is that it&#39;s fun. Really fun. Implementing ABI compatibility requires you to understand under the hood of the kernel. You can learn how printf(3) works. You can learn what happens before main().Especially, in Rust, it&#39;s inspiring to explore ways to write a kernel safely and expressively. One of my favorite part is the implementation of read system call [1].Lastly, You can try this OS on SSH. Hope you enjoy :)    ssh root@kerla-demo.seiya.me

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just to clarify goals of the project:&#34;I completely agree that rewriting existing large, feature-rich, and robust operating system kernels is not a good idea. However, a question came to my mind: what are the pros and cons of writing a practical UNIX-like OS kernel in Rust from scratch? How does it look like? This is why I started this project.&#34;[1][1] https://seiya.me/writing-linux-clone-in-rust"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Rewriting the Linux kernel in rust would be a rehash of why we ended up with Linux in the first place: rewriting an older OS from scratch.I would love to see a solid implementation of a real micro kernel based OS based on a message passing core in Rust to become a viable alternative to the now 50 year old Unix architecture. This would give us a possibility of some real progress on the security and process scheduling front, both of which are severely lacking in the Unix model."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For C++ many standard library functions can&#39;t be implemented in standard C++. And it not only shows some very obvious compiler built-ins in the library, but the library can depend on behavior guaranteed by the compiler which is otherwise undefined by the standard. Therefore it&#39;s not always wise to learn techniques from the standard library, as it can depend on implementation defined behavior, and this dependence can be subtle too.Not too long ago it was impossible to implement std::vector in standard C++, as constructing objects next to each other formally did not create an array. Therefore pointer arithmetic on the resulting pointers were undefined behavior, as pointer arithmetic is only defined within an array.This was fixed by the array being implicitly created in certain circumstances."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My advice would be: to learn a new language, simply start writing some non-trivial projects in it (a few thousand lines of code or so). In some languages (like Python), the standard library is the actually important feature, in other languages (like C), it&#39;s better to mostly ignore the stdlib. Example: I started learning Zig by writing a Pacman clone (https://github.com/floooh/pacman.zig) and a home computer emulator (https://github.com/floooh/kc85.zig), the Pacman clone doesn&#39;t use any Zig stdlib features at all, and the emulator only minimally for memory allocation, parsing command line args and loading data from files.Zig&#39;s stdlib is much more useful than C&#39;s, but it&#39;s still entirely possible to write useful programs without it and instead focus on learning Zig&#39;s language features first.But on the other extreme, the whole reason why I learned Python was its &#34;batteries included&#34; standard library."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; To learn a new language, read its standard libraryTo learn a new language, read its standard libraryYes, but also no.The standard library is often more complex and uses more advanced features then you often need for most projects. I.e. collections in std are supper general purpose, but if you need to write a collection it&#39;s normally specific to the purpose you need it for.I.e. std is the &#34;most&#34; general purpose library you normally find so even if it&#39;s written with &#34;KISS&#34; in mind it&#39;s still often not so simple.Then it sometimes uses unstable language features you normally can&#39;t use (as it&#39;s often made &#34;in sync&#34; with the language) and/or optimizations which in most other cases would count as &#34;pre-mature&#34; optimizations.Through without a question you can learn a lot there, you just should be aware of the points above."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was at Lambda when they announced the switch from 9 to 6 months and the elimination of paid team leaders. The feedback was universally negative. In a channel for open student discussion, Austen Allred deleted a poll from Slack because of how lopsided the reaction was. He explained the deletion by saying the poll was &#34;misleading.&#34;Students then got a survey &#34;explaining&#34; why the change was actually a good thing by asking questions such as &#34;Do you understand why companies value mentoring experience?&#34; Not just failing to reveal the truth (these were cost-cutting measures), but not even taking the effort to come up with a convincing lie.It was destabilizing: Austen&#39;s twitter account would read ambitious, hyperoptimistic; meanwhile, drastic changes would be made within the program with vague rationales (&#34;after speaking with hiring managers, we&#39;ve made these changes...&#34;), and probing further simply got deflections or gaslighting surveys.There were a ton of good people in the program, and I learned a lot there. But fundamentally there needs to be trust between institution and student when you&#39;re asking people to make this level of time and financial commitment. And at no point did I feel like Lambda at its top level prioritized student wellbeing over PR, costs, or metrics to be sold to investors."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It isn&#39;t just Lambda School. I mentor for [insert large coding bootcamp here] and I will say things have been going badly across the board for more than 50% of students. They recently had to cut a lot of staff, and completion rates seem to hover around only 50-60% when you take into account all the students they remove from this calculation when they withdraw for &#34;personal reasons&#34;. The employment numbers I don&#39;t have as much insight into but I have definitely had students who I don&#39;t think will get hired easily, and students reach out via LinkedIn 6th months later still looking for a job and wondering if they can work for me.That said, two of our best junior devs (at Arist YC S20) are Lambda School and Ironclad grads respectively, and neither of them had any background in programming and went right from bootcamp into their current positions. So it definitely works for some people.One thing I&#39;ve tried to emphasize with my mentees is the need to go beyond the curriculum (because it simply doesn&#39;t cover enough) and do personal projects. I always tell them the narrative about how back in the early 00s, the only resources available were things like w3schools.com, documentation, and the occasional dubiously accurate blog entry. I was able to learn almost everything I learned not for the sake of learning it but because I wanted to build X or Y. Bootcamps will teach you a vertical slice of some skills that are relevant in [current year], but they do not do a very good job of getting you started on a lifelong process of self-learning and side projects, which is the only way you get anywhere in this industry. Plus the only way to stand out when you went to a bootcamp anyway is having a very exceptional github profile with open source contributions that demonstrates you actually have an interest and do things beyond what is required by the bootcamp."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really wish we had less kneejerk cliche-recycling (eg &#34;don&#39;t be evil&#34; comments) commenters here just looking for confirmation bias because this is a difficult issue.First, kids use sites and apps when they&#39;re below the ToS age (usually 18 or sometimes 13, at least in the US). How are you meant to know that as a service provider? Don&#39;t get me wrong: it doesn&#39;t excuse you from doing due diligence. There&#39;s such a thing as wanton disregard for the truth. But we all know under 18s use IG, Snapchat, Tinder, etc. I&#39;m not sure fining a company billions of dollars and putting executives in jail is the outcome anyone really wants if a 17 year old uses Tinder.Second, what is personal information, exactly? It&#39;s not as obvious as you might think to the point where lawyers who work for these companies can&#39;t agree among themselves. There are obvious things (eg IP addresses, dates of birth, SSNs, addresses, names). But what about media? Photos, videos and sound files may all contain PII, technically.Third, some will say &#34;well don&#39;t store anything&#34;. Well, if a photo contains PII (which it can) then you can&#39;t operate a photo-sharing service at all for risk of storing PII of children. Also, this ignores legal obligations. If the Feds show up with a warrant about a particular user&#39;s actions then the argument &#34;we log/store nothing&#34; won&#39;t get you as far as you think.So I&#39;m not saying Google didn&#39;t do wrong here but knowing the complexities I am sympathetic to the idea of resisting broad legislative overreach as you can end up with bad laws that do just that.And if we&#39;re going to start singling out tech giants for lobbying Congress, my question is why them in particular? We currently have a Senate that is essentially beholden to the personal interests of one unelected rich guy: Charles Koch. Koch lobbies against health care, taxes on the rich and infrastructure in the Senate. Around the country, he has been instrumental in defeating public transit and many other initiatives in many cities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; A week before the meeting, the Federal Trade Commission announced that it was considering making changes to its interpretation of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, which prohibits companies from collecting information about kids under the age of 13 without parental permission.How would that work in practice? A lot of us here operate websites. Your website gets a request. How are you supposed to tell the age of the person that request came from? Maybe Google / Facebook have enough data to identify the person and their age, but ironically, they would have to collect information about them to determine that it&#39;s a person they shouldn&#39;t collect information about.Certainly no child in the history of the Internet has ever lied to a website when asked their age."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;We have been successful in slowing down and delaying the [ePrivacy Regulation] process and have been working behind the scenes hand in hand with the other companies,&#34; the complaint quoted Google executives as saying in a memo ahead of the meeting. The August meeting could &#34;find areas of alignment and narrow gaps in our positions and priorities on child privacy and safety.&#34;This sounds like a starting point for further investigation.Perhaps the litigation will reveal more about what is going on inside Big Tech."</p>

That is, over 99% of the bugs reported by Linux gamers also affected players in other platforms. Moreover (quoting from the OP):&gt; The report quality [from Linux users] is stellar. I mean we have all seen bug reports like: “it crashes for me after a few hours”. Do you know what a developer can do with such a report? Feel sorry at best. You can’t really fix any bug unless you can replicate it, see it with your own eyes, peek inside and finally see that it’s fixed. And with bug reports from Linux players is just something else. You get all the software/os versions, all the logs, you get core dumps and you get replication steps. Sometimes I got with the player over discord and we quickly iterated a few versions with progressive fixes to isolate the problem.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yep we find a variant of this with our python open source data science users who normal businesses would hate:- Across all Python envs (Jupyter, streamlit/plotly, flask/Django, ...), they report way more bugs, and often from our free tiers, which sounds low ROI.. but our community caught all but ~2 significant bugs we fixed this year that our internal automated testing missed and would have otherwise gone to our Enterprise and gov users . They are happy to exchange a tiny bit of GPU or viz burps for new features faster, as long as we are responsive to their reports! That also pushed us to a better dev cadence which wouldn&#39;t have worked for our Enterprise users. More subtle, we have more confidence for deploying wider features/APIs which would otherwise be too underused + risky for the same reason.- they are often doing innovative new things with our stack, which originally meant feature requests for non-repeatable sales.. but ended up stretching our flexibility into wider applicability, and they can clearly tell us areas to advance the visual, analytic, etc sides of our R&amp;D and package it up for the rest of their internal analysts. Almost like a multiplier for conversations with our more operationally focused no-code/low-code users, and helps us see around the corner for them in the AI+API+customization sides!- most of our technical partnership discussions now go through our OSS client repos. Rather than PowerPoints with BD people that don&#39;t have staff to do things, a product dev or sales engineer/architect or devrel blogger will think, &#34;oh our customers would benefit from better interactive visuals on our data, let me whip something up quick with that package&#34; and we help them take it from there- open source data users like PyData developers and data scientists, compared to say the # of SMBs out there or general enterprise employees, is small and almost by definition doesn&#39;t pay for most software... but they end up being attached to projects that do, and influence much of their organization that definitely does!"</p>

The Linux users there are decidedly less technical, but still doing it themselves.What I got for &#34;bug reports&#34; was mostly terrible, few details/logs/etc.  And a weird entitlement thing where people had really high support expectations over something that was open source and free. Even a few expletive-laden emails.  I did receive a few really helpful reports, pull-requests, and thank you emails...but they were very much the exception."</p>

Google throttles the load time of non-AMP ads by giving them artificial one-second delays in order to give Google AMP a “nice comparative boost.” Throttling non-AMP ads slows down header bidding, which Google then uses to denigrate header bidding for being too slow. “Header Bidding can often increase latency of web pages and create security flaws when executed incorrectly,” Google falsely claimed.

For example, quoting from the document:&#34;Google likes to claim that it will “never sell your personal information to anyone,” with Google CEO Sundar Pichai deceptively claiming that such a policy is “unequivocal.” But Google leverages  intimate  user  data  and  personal  information  to  broker  billions  of  daily  online  ad  impressions between publishers and advertisers that target individual users based almost entirely on  their  personal  information. Internal documents  confirm  that  Google  knows  its  users  are  deceived by its misrepresentations, even as it reaps billions from ads that use personal data to target those  users.  In  Orwellian  terms,  it’s  a  beautiful  thing  for  Google,  the  destruction  of  words  like “sell” and “personal.”&#34;Or:&#34;Google presents a public image of caring about privacy, but behind the scenes Google coordinates  closely  with  the  Big  Tech  companies  to  lobby  the  government  to  delay  or  destroy  measures that would actually protect users’ privacy. Of course, effective competition is concerned with both price and quality, and the fact that Google coordinates with its competitors on the   quality metric of privacy—one might call it privacy fixing—underscores Google’s selective promotion of privacy concerns only when doing so facilitates its efforts to exclude competition.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is my favorite quote:&gt; First, Google started to leverage its ownership of the largest web  browser,  Chrome,  to  track  and  target  publishers’  audiences  in  order  to  sell  Google’s advertising inventory. To make this happen, Google first introduced the ability for users to log into the Chrome browser. Then, Google began to steer users into doing this by using deceptive and coercive tactics. For example, Google started to automatically log users into Chrome if they logged into any Google service (e.g., Gmail or YouTube). In this way, Google took the users that choose not  to log into Chrome and  logged  them  in anyways.  If  a  user  tried  to  log out of Chrome  in response, Google punished them by kicking them out of a Google product they were in the process of using (e.g., Gmail or YouTube). On top this, through another deceptive pattern, Google got these users to give the Chrome browser permission to track them across the open web and on independent publisher sites like The Dallas Morning News. These users also had to give Google permission to use this new Chrome tracking data to sell Google’s own ad space, permitting Google to use Chrome to circumvent reliance on cookie-tracking technology."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article mentions Process Explorer. Since Sysinternals were bought by Microsoft many years ago and the tools are distributed directly via Microsoft, such tools are unlikely to have an issue being signed.A brief history of the process for those not following it. Originally for kernel-mode drivers, you needed a code signing certificate cross signed by Microsoft&#39;s root. This means that the certificate follows a chain up to a standard CA _and also_ one Microsoft use to approve that CA to issue kernel-mode certificates. It was not sufficient to have a certificate capable of signing code, even with MS&#39; OIDs for that.Then, around Windows 10 I think, Microsoft announced that one would need to acquire an EV certificate. You would then be required to submit the driver package via sysdev.microsoft.com and after spending time in Ballmer&#39;s Brewery, it would come out signed by Microsoft.It was technically possible to use the old mechanism at this stage too, provided the end user did not have UEFI secure boot enabled. IF secure boot were enabled, the kernel would: a) if the driver was signed pre-Win10, accept it, b) if it was signed post win-10 RTM date and by Microsoft, accept otherwise reject.Thus the only mechanism to realistically get your driver working on all Windows out of the box is to submit via sysdev. You can&#39;t realistically ask users to disable secure boot, even if this is entirely possible on all x86 motherboards.Finally, the cross signed roots expire soon and I think some already have. Microsoft have decided that this mechanism will now be retired, and all drivers must be signed via sysdev from now on. You still require an EV certificate as well, to sign the package.This is a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, Microsoft have repeatedly signed the shim maintained by redhat in order to allow Linux distributions to boot directly on secure boot-enabled hardware (UEFI binaries also go through this process and always have). Microsoft have their keys in the default keychain because they bothered to be involved in the process, unlike linux companies like Redhat. So on the one hand, they&#39;re being quite friendly to open source.On the other hand, the push to EV certs rules out individual developers like myself[1]. I could register a company but... that entails effort and expense for a hobby project. And now hobbyist projects like this run the risk of being rejected by MS.I mostly believe this is an attempt to reduce the number of code signing cert leaks that result in people writing malware, and lock down the Windows kernel a bit more, but still. It is a shame.[1] This is because most CAs won&#39;t issue EV certificates to individuals, even if those individuals happen to have detailed knowledge of cryptography and all the pkcs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An immensly powerful and useful tool. Can&#39;t live without it. Hopefully the situation resolves soon.What is it with MS these past few months? It&#39;s like they&#39;re trying to throw away the little community goodwill they managed to build up over the years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Keep in mind this has happened because people agreed that they can&#39;t (normally) run code not singed by someone else (Microsoft) on their own system for “security” reasons. Well, it was not security, it actually was a way to keep keys to themselves, and hold the user system as a hostage. And it has been explained many times by many people.If you care about software freedoms, even just a tiny bit, you wouldn&#39;t touch “Microsoft open source”, and you wouldn&#39;t be happy about your friends using any of it, like you wouldn&#39;t be happy about seeing them with a heroin syringe. That is going to explode spectacularly one day."</p>

The problem is both sides of the aisle have are irreparably entangled with big tech and cannot be trusted to prosecute not just fine them a paltry some that is insufficient to correct their behavior.

In Google’s words, the Jedi program &#39;generates suboptimal yields for publishers and serious risks of negative media coverage if exposed externally.&#39;&#34;...&#34;For example, Google and Facebook have integrated their software development kits (SDKs) so that Google can pass Facebook data for user ID cookie matching,&#34; the amended complaint says. &#34;They also coordinated with each other to harm publishers through the adoption of Unified Pricing rules…&#34;"</p>

If you aren&#39;t profitable you should ask yourself, &#34;Why don&#39;t other people find value in what I&#39;m producing?&#34; Additionally, we view profitability as a mechanism for allowing us to keep working on the ambitious ideas that we care about.In part because of the people who are attracted to his companies, and his particularly strong influence on company culture compared to most founders, I think his companies have a pretty healthy (thought not perfect) perspective on profitability in the grand scheme of things."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am a big fan of RSS one of the reasons (alluded to by this article) is the type of content that tends to get exposed via RSS.Frequently the type of content that gets syndicated via RSS is long form and non-commercial.It turns out that these two properties produce a pretty good signal to noise ratio which filters out precisely the kind of trash that has ruined the web over the last decade or two (long form content at least has the possibility of teaching you something or presenting an idea with some kind of rigor; and since RSS isn&#39;t great at monetization, the worst offenders in media tend to deprioritize it).Of course RSS is a very imprecise filter, but it&#39;s basically the antithesis of a Twitter or Facebook feed, where everything is short form and you tend to see whatever serves the platform&#39;s commercial interests (i.e. their definition of engagement).This matters to me because at a certain point I realized -- I have basically never read anything short form on social media which enriched me in a meaningful way.I have learned a lot from studies, reference works, long form analysis, and books -- basically all the quality knowledge I possess has come from one of these sources.At best social media has given me occasional links to these things (scattered among an ocean of junk information).It&#39;s mostly because of how RSS originated with blogs I guess, and who was involved in designing it. But for whatever reason it has been far more valuable to me than any other form of content syndication online."</p>

Amazing job, Ryan, and thank you Robert Garcia for being a man to take one on the chin (for this solution not coming from your team) and for then doing the right thing. I am seriously impressed by not seeing any NIH (not invented here) behavior here.But why stop there? Ryan suggested 5 courses of actions, and made it clear that we need to act on all of them at the same time. So far only the first of those 5 steps have been acted on. The rest of the steps are likely either bad or the people needed to act on them are doing that NIH bullshit (which I can understand to some extent given how much negativity is being directed at Robert Garcia). But negativity or not, if those are good suggestions, we need to act on them. Would love to hear any thoughts on how to mobilize support for quickly validating/invalidating those suggestions, and then acting accordingly.If it&#39;s possible to cancel brands and individuals, it should be possible to do the same with politicians as well. I hope it doesn&#39;t turn out that we care more about certain individuals&#39; views than the prevention of a nationwide and potentially even global crisis [1].[1] From Ryan&#39;s tweet:&gt; I can&#39;t stress enough how bad it is for the world economy if the ports don&#39;t work. Every company selling physical goods bought or sold internationally will fail. The circulatory system our globalized economy depends has collapsed.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m generally weary of MS having too much influence over open source with Github and VSCode, particularly due to their history.My creep alarm went off a bit when I recently started a project to test the waters with TypeScript.  I was asking on a forum how to deal with native JS dependencies without types, and he answer I got was &#34;Are you using VSCode?  It will just find the community maintained type packages for you&#34;.It seems to me that VSCode&#39;s &#34;just click the button to solve my problem&#34; style of UX makes it very easy for developers to become reliant on proprietary workflows without even realizing it.  If one were to pursue an EEE strategy, this would not be a bad way to start."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think Microsofts&#39; long-term plan is to get most developers to use cloud-based coding environments, which is not unlikely given that software stacks become more complex to the point where setting up a local development environment is really hard. Once they achieve that they&#39;re in a very good position to sell their own cloud services by making the integration into the development workflow really smooth.So their acquisition of Github and the large effort invested in VSCode as well as privileging their own software stack over competing solutions makes perfect sense, business wise. It probably won&#39;t be good for free software though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Microsoft promising `dotnet watch` for a while and then dropping that certainly doesn&#39;t help with the already pretty damaged view of Microsoft not caring about open source developers. Here is the gist of the situation from Microsoft&#39;s point of view:&gt; Throughout the last year we’ve been working to enable the best possible Hot Reload experience in Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6. Part of our goal was to also explore making this feature available to customers through a variety of mechanisms such as bringing the full power of Hot Reload to as many .NET and C++ developers as possible when running through Visual Studio 2022 debugger, supporting Hot Reload when running .NET 6 apps without the debugger, and the very basic Hot Reload support we added to the .NET SDK tools through dotnet watch.&gt; As we reflect on what was accomplished, and what is still in front of us, the backlog continues to grow. This includes many high value scenarios that will benefit the broadest number of developers, including focus areas such as .NET MAUI, Blazor, adding support more types of edits, more optimized experience when working with XAML apps, and much more.&gt; With these considerations, we’ve decided that starting with the upcoming .NET 6 GA release, we will enable Hot Reload functionality only through Visual Studio 2022 so we can focus on providing the best experiences to the most users. We’ll also continue to pursue adding Hot Reload to Visual Studio for Mac in a future release.So, first they wanted &#34;bringing the full power of Hot Reload to as many .NET and C++ developers as possible&#34; but now they shifted to &#34;focus on providing the best experiences to the most users&#34;.Best part of this whole thing is the pull request which was opened (https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/22217) but &#34; locked and limited conversation to collaborators&#34; straight after opening it as Microsoft anticipated the backlash but still went ahead with the change.Seems they still have a lot to learn before they can indeed be trusted."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a common technique in embedded products, but I should point out that it&#39;s not useful for general purpose Raspberry Pi work.The author disables several important kernel features to boot faster, including network support and USB support. Obviously, if you plan to use network or USB then it&#39;s not an option to disable those. You can disable some of the other debugging features and little extras for a slight boost, but it&#39;s going to be negligible (&lt;1s, in my experience).The biggest change comes from removing the init system entirely and replacing it with the user-facing app. This is the fastest way to get your app started, but now you&#39;re responsible for doing everything that was previously handled by the init system. The author can do this because they don&#39;t have any network, timekeeping, or other system functions normally handled by the init system. They only needs to mount filesystems, which is easy to replicate inside of the app.Anyone planning to ship a Raspberry Pi based product should read this article carefully as a great starting point. Anyone who wants to use their Raspberry Pi for general purpose use or even with network connectivity or USB devices will be disappointed if they try these techniques. Great article, but it&#39;s a narrow use case."</p>

I am building a CNC router in my spare time and I ended up using a raspberry pi 3 since I want to cram in a ton of features and esp32s and stm32s are simply not cutting it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; allowing for a randomly discovered shrink wrapped headset twenty years from now to be able to update to the final software version, long after over-the-air update servers have been shut down.This resonates so much with me. Each time I setup a new device that requires an Internet connection, I think about how we can enjoy booting 30 years old retro computers and how the next generation will not be able to do the same because of locked down hardware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Massive props to John Carmack! We also need laws to protect consumers when they don’t have an enlightened champion on their side.Part of the reason I buy Apple devices is because Apple is unlikely to get acquired or go out of business for the foreseeable future. I wish there were viable alternatives. Android devices are not an option for me, as they are more likely to be abandoned and/or contain Google/manufacturer/carrier malware, and I need to use banking and work apps.In that same vein, I have a preorder for a Framework Laptop because, at least for actual computers, I have the option of not splurging on a non-upgradeable, non-customizable Apple device.We really shouldn’t have to wait for Librarian of Congress-granted exemptions, which can be rescinded at any time and are meaningless with locked-down devices anyway."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is tangential, but I really wish that their would be legislation, valid retroactively, to enable old unsupported devices to still be utilized. I think this goes somewhat beyond right to repair?Take for example digital backs for medium format cameras - these things are built in low numbers, with high end FPGAs and camera sensors, with JTAG interfaces ready to go and everything - but then forgotten about a few years later. Why not enforce the creation of some document on how one would build their own OS for it? Or how the bus from the sensor ADCs works? This all existed at one point internally, but now is lost, and most of this backs will slowly die and go to waste, even though they could easily be repurposed or repaired."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Magit is such an unbelievably good piece of software. If you haven&#39;t used it, please at least take a look. It seems like &#34;just a GUI for git&#34;, but that&#39;s missing the point — many operations suddenly become frictionless, so your entire workflow changes.I regularly do things like &#34;stash some of my changes, switch branch, cherry pick a commit, switch branch, do an interactive rebase reordering commits and dropping one, pop one of my stashes&#34;, and they become routine, so working with code becomes a fluent experience, rather than fighting with your tools.I would say that Magit and structural editing using Paredit are the two most important technologies that make programming great."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Magit is an exceptionally well made interface to Git. Yes, it’s built on top of Emacs, and that might stop many from even looking into it. - I am glad I made a deep dive into Emacs last year, and although I stopped using it as an IDE (VS Code is just too good), I still come back to it because of Magit (and macros, general text editing and org-mode). Yes, I have an interface for Git in VS Code as well, but it‘s very rudimentary compared to Magit, and it’s limited to the narrow left bar. And to give an example: Making „micro commits“ by staging various lines of changes is super easy in Magit, but I still haven‘t found out how to select several disconnected lines for staging in VS Code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Magit is insanely ergonomic. Like how easy is it to selectively stage portions of files in the git CLI? In magit it is usually just a few keystrokes.I wish magit-forge [0] had more features though - like I cannot create new labels from it.Please consider donating [1] to the developer if it has made your life any easier.[0] https://github.com/magit/forge[1] https://magit.vc/donate/"</p>

Then they threatened my wife and I gave up my password to stop them from hurting her.The password was suppressed by the court, but they let the police use it anyway because one of the officers (with no formal computer qualifications) testified he could have broken 2048-bit AES encryption without the password. And worse case he said he would unsolder the chips off the circuit board and put them onto another board and that would fix it. The judge allowed the testimony and believed it.Make sure you always use a password on your devices though.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; this case turns on one of the most fundamental protections in our constitutional system: an accused person’s ability to exercise his Fifth Amendment rights without having his silence used against him.A very interesting tidbit I learned here on HN a couple years back — the Supreme Court ruled in 1992 that you have to declare out loud an intent to invoke your Fifth Amendment rights, if you haven’t been formally arrested yet. Literal “silence” may be acceptable after being Mirandized, but not necessarily before.https://harronlaw.com/blog/miranda-rights-texas/https://www.oyez.org/cases/2012/12-246“Question: Does the Fifth Amendment&#39;s Self-Incrimination Clause protects a defendant&#39;s refusal to answer questions asked by law enforcement before he has been arrested or read his Miranda rights?”No, by 5-4 vote."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sortof off topic question.  I&#39;ve never owned a smart phone but might get one soon assuming I can find a decent one that will run grapheneOS.Is there an app that can be given permission to intercept the unlock code and upon receiving the panic/under duress code, discretely put the phone into a &#34;parental controls&#34; configuration that sandboxes all your data and only presents the storage you want the law enforcement children to see?  Some cops use a USB device that pulls all the data from the phone.  Is there a way to sandbox that data so they only get the data from approved apps and the forensics USB device does not know any better?  i.e. not denied data, but rather can only see what you want it to see.  Or should this be a feature request to the alternate phone operating systems developers?Maybe this duress code should also activate a timer.  If the all-clear code is not entered in a user-defined period of time, the phone wipes all user data in the background resetting it to a brand new phone.  Or maybe wipe the data for specified applications to not appear to destroy evidence?  Maybe also send network notifications(s) to specific in case of mission compromise destinations?[Edit] Feature request update.  This duress system should also log all the data that was added or planted after the duress code was entered, to log people planting evidence.  Upload encrypted manifest,timestamps and checksums to remote site in  the event law enforcement tamper with evidence."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The world wide web is only 28 years old.We&#39;ve had computers for 76 years at this point.We&#39;re discussing this topic in modern English, but if you look back 500 years William Shakespeare wouldn&#39;t be born for another couple of generations: vocabulary and grammar have changed a lot since then, and if you look back a further 500 years (to 1021AD) the &#34;English&#34; spoken in those days was a lot closer to Frisian than anything we&#39;d understand.To get the big picture of what 500 years means ... the oldest surviving writing is roughly 5500 years old. We&#39;ve had agriculture for roughly 11,000 years. And you&#39;re asking for a personal legacy to be legible and usable after surviving a span of time 10% as vast as the existence of writing itself?Think archival grade materials and ink, then add translations into Mandarin, Arabic, and Spanish -- there&#39;s a much better chance of it being readable if you have more than one language. Then maybe add a dictionary, just in case words have fallen out of use. Make multiple copies and distribute them around the world, including tectonically stable desiccated regions that are currently lightly- or un-inhabited and likely to remain so: the criteria for deep disposal nuclear waste repositories are applicable (minus the &#34;deep&#34;) bit, so Yucca Flats would do, or the Atacama Desert or the McMurdo dry valleys in Antarctica."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Other comments have given ways to physically archive the webpage. Continually hosting it is a much trickier endeavor. Beyond just keeping the servers up, technologies will shift such that eventually html webpages, servers that talk using tcp/ip, datacenters that connect via fiber cables, etc will all be deprecated.That said, if we have a very liberal definition of the word &#34;website&#34; to include any successor technologies where a device can be used to request a document, given an identifier, that looks recognizably like your webpage, this is doable. What you really need is an institution that you can trust to keep existing and to keep the necessary upkeep of your website as part of its mission.The main institutions I can think of that have lasted for 500 years unbroken are churches and elite universities.  If you were able to convince the Pope to decree that the church should keep hosting your webpage in perpetuity, that would likely work, but persuading him of that sounds very challenging.  That said, universities are used to accepting gifts with sometimes eccentric strings attached.  The gift will probably need to be large; but I imagine a $1B donation to Harvard under a condition that they continue to host and update the page as needed would likely work. Getting that sort of money is quite hard, but tbh probably easier than coming with a way of guaranteeing that your direct descendents keep the webpage up."</p>

We planned to fly the camera between two big buildings in a major street. Because of security and insurance problems we used it in a little street. We used two cables and a small cart with eight wheels and a fork underneath where the camera was placed at the [end] of a handheld move. The secret of how we attached the camera to the cart was a magnet, part of which was in the cart and part of which was built on the camera. From the window the camera moved out about 100 feet.&#34;[1]The camera was an Éclair CM3 Camiflex, which is a beautiful little camera first built in 1945. There are still some for sale.[2][1] https://ascmag.com/articles/flashback-soy-cuba[2] http://www.visualproducts.com/storeProductDetail02.asp?produ..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Soy Cuba contains lush and gorgeous B&amp;W cinematography. The film opens up with the camera flying over the waters of Cuba; the reflection of the water is glistening in a way unlike other films. I believe they used an X-ray film strip to achieve this shot.Mikhail Kalatozov has included another impressive shot at the end of his previous work, &#34;The Cranes Are Flying.&#34; (Palme d&#39;Or at Cannes 1958) The camera follows the protagonist, then gets seamlessly lifted up by a crane to depict the entire street parading.While Soviet-era films does not have much exposure in the English-speaking world, there are so many gems, critically and technically. The filmmakers were acutely aware of great filming techniques.Also check out:Walking the Streets of Moscow (1964)
- B-roll scenery contains another lush reflection of the Moscow watersIvan the Terrible (1944/1958)
- Eisenstein is an ardent practitioner of the montage, and prefers to static camera shots. However, his compositions are very imaginative, and there is no shot you want to miss. His film also briefly experiments with color, and he exploits colored lighting to emphasize the characters&#39; psyche.Anything by Andrei Tarkovsky
- Tarkovsky is indisputably a master of Russian cinema after Eisenstein. He often shoots in nature, but no director shoots with such rich texture of the mud. His long shots emphasizes the bleakness inherent in the Russian psyche.The Ascent (1977)
- Set in WWII, the film shows the resistance escaping the Nazis covered in snow and panting in the cold. Great snow photography.Hard to Be a God (2013)
- A sci-fi story on the immigration of humans to a different planet, the colonizers inhabit the inhospitable environment. Like Tarkovsky, the slow dragging in the mud conveys the dreary lives.These are recommendations I came up off the top of my head relating to cinematography, but there are definitely many more to appreciate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Personal anecdote: This was the first film I ever projected in 35mm. Our university theater obtained a print from the national film archive of Venezuela; it was a copy of the 1995 restoration. Incredibly striking, lush visuals, and partially responsible for my continued personal and professional interest in screening archival film. Six years later, I still remember the joy of projecting this exact sequence. I&#39;m glad the film survives."</p>

Not every game needs to or should be Stardew Valley, of course, but there&#39;s not enough Stardew Valleys out there.Few of us are as talented as Eric is, but I wish more of us tried a little harder to create what we wish existed, and not fall into the trap of what&#39;s popular.

Oh well.So unless you really need it for some critical reason where you know your users aren&#39;t going to do their regular patterns of going through one of the general engines, close the ticket as out of scope and go home early.Don&#39;t bother implementing hard to do and expensive to maintain features that nobody will use. It&#39;ll become more headache than fun real quick."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A problem close to my heart. Good search is certainly still too difficult to pull off for small teams, and this was one of my motivations for building and open sourcing Typesense[1].Most people think of search and immediately think of large data sets, but the problems that plague smaller datasets are equally interesting. It&#39;s less about performance and more about relevance. For e.g. searching across multiple fields for a compound query like &#34;taylor swift style&#34;, requires breaking the query into segments (taylor swift | style) before searching for the appropriate fields. There are also a class of problems that traditional search engines that rely on BM25 or TF-IDF for ranking cannot reliably solve (e.g. searching on small texts like titles) where you have to consider distance between matching words (which TF-IDF and BM25 miss). Lastly, there is also personalization which is almost always left as an exercise to the reader :)[1]: https://github.com/typesense/typesense"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The simplest advice to engineers would be to not think elastic search as some black box that will solve all of your search problems. In fact, if you&#39;ve never implemented search before it&#39;s the last tool you need. Postgres full text search is all you need. The most important thing in search is to surface relevant results and no one can quantify relevancy. It&#39;s as unquantifiable as it gets in technology. You need to understand what results are relevant for your users and find a metric that would work to rank accordingly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So does this functional SQL just get &#34;transpiled&#34; into analytical SQL? If so, where does &#34;transpilation&#34; occur, in the client, intercepted before hitting the query engine, etc? Or has the query engine itself been modified to handle functional SQL?If the query engine itself has been modified, are there any performance gains or losses?This is a pretty interesting and compelling idea. I do wonder if the functional SQL approach might entice developers to write very bad/expensive/ineffective queries. Then again, nothing is stopping developers from doing the same with analytical SQL."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is immediately useful. The number of awkwardly nested subqueries that I write because I don&#39;t have this kind of functionality in BigQuery is a huge bummer.I am curious, how many Haskell programmers do you all have? And more seriously, do you have any plans to help provide this functionality to non-Postgres SQLs, or at least help those trying to take inspiration from it?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Database researcher here.This is really cool! I wonder what was the initial drive for this new feature?Is this meant to be a &#34;short-cut&#34; to express complicated SQL queries, or is this meant to adding new semantics beyond SQL? While I like the idea of custom data types with dataflow-like syntax, implementing a whole new query processing engine for the new data type seems like a lot of engineering work. Also you now have to handle many edge cases such as very very large time series -- I wonder if you have efficient lookup mechanisms on timevectors yet, and various timestamp and value types. If all these new syntax can actually be expressed using SQL, however complex, I think a &#34;lazier&#34; approach is to write a &#34;translator&#34; that rewrites the new syntax into good old SQLs or add a translator at planning stage. This way you can take advantage of Postgres&#39; optimizer and let it do the rest of heavy lifting.Kusto has a similar data type &#34;series&#34; that is also created from aggregating over some columns (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/q...)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"An especially novel aspect of this lawsuit, quoting the press release:&gt; This approach makes it the first legal case that focuses on the rights of individual consumers as third-party beneficiaries of the GPL.&gt; “That’s what makes this litigation unique and historic in terms of defending consumer rights,” says Karen M. Sandler, the organization’s executive director.In the past, GPL enforcement has been a cause of action brought by the copyright holder. This suit is on behalf of users, as beneficiaries of the GPL. If this suit is successful, it&#39;ll no longer be necessary to prove sufficient standing as a copyright holder of GPLed code in order to enforce the license; it&#39;ll suffice to show that you&#39;re a user who wishes to make use of the rights provided under the license."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks to be a major change in the legal strategy behind GPL. In the past the focus has been on copyright claims by copyright holders, but as recent cases has shown in Germany and France, those has faced some rather strange setbacks. Germany don&#39;t seem to want to recognize copyright holders that only contributed a part of a larger work, which is basically all copyright holders for larger FOSS projects. In France they seems to define GPL as being under contract law and not under copyright law.In this new case, the SFC is arguing a case in the context of third-party beneficiary which is under contract law and not copyright law. It seems like a bit of an long-shot, but if won it could mean a major change in interpreting GPL as a contract rather than a copyright license. I would guess that it also would change their strategy in other countries if won."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Long time lurker here, first time poster. I got pulled into the rabbit hole of building guitars at home during the covid lockdowns. My first build used traditional &#34;tonewoods&#34; (mahogany, ebony, rosewood etc.) and while purchasing materials for my second build, I stumbled upon bamboo boards on a German wood retailed shop.Compared the properties to the wood I wanted to use for parts of it (mainly the core/neck and fretboard) and decided to go for it.So the second build [1] is 40ish % bamboo with purpleheart veneers in between layers of bamboo and purpleheart/olive for the body. Next build will be around 80% bamboo. Trying to source some strand woven bamboo boards to try them out as fretboards as well, but for a part time builder like me, getting such small quantities of bamboo boards is rather hard.But yeah, fascinating material even outside of construction use. The boards I used for the guitar builds were nice to work with, easy to sand and finish (using wipe on poly).[1] https://i.imgur.com/fUyxd7n.jpg"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was interesting in light of an interview I was just listening to yesterday, a CBC podcast [1] talking about the benefits of mass timber (glued wood) for large highrise building construction.There were two guests on, both sounded like environmentalists, with the first one (Michael Green) saying that mass timber was&#34;currently the best tool we have to address climate impact and in the building materials for a large building&#34;while the second guest (John Talberth) was arguing:&#34;The idea that we can cut down our forests and turn them into two by fours and build our way to a stable climate is absurd, and it&#39;s just another one of these false narratives of big timber corporations are using to get us to buy more of their product and continue to subsidise their record profits&#34;,and Talberth advocated Bamboo, mentioning it multiple times as an alternative.  It kind of went back and forth a bit with Mr Green saying&#34;Bamboo, for instance, is not structurally a material that can actually satisfy the demand of three billion people that need a new home because it doesn&#39;t build large buildings&#34;and Mr Talberth saying&#34;Believe it or not, bamboo can actually be put together in the structurally with high structural integrity beams to make taller buildings&#34;It kind of left me wondering who was right... though Mr Green (an architect) sounded like someone with actual experience making buildings, where as the Mr Talberth (an economist) sounded like he might have been doing a bit of ill-informed wishful thinking about Bamboo.Seeing the process here gave me a bit more perspective on the discussion.   Given the labour involved and the fact that you are working with 20mm x 5mm cross-sections of bamboo, I can see how it would be extremely expensive to build a large building out of bamboo, and the $300 euro price tag on a sheet of plywood at the bottom of the page added more confirmation that it&#39;s not going to be a practical replacement for large-scale building.[1] https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-oct-20-2..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really neat article, love things like this on HN. I thought this was really interesting:&gt; A bamboo stem reaches its maximum height in just a few months and shall not grow taller or thicker over time. In the following 4 years the fibers will &#34;lignify&#34; and get their extraordinary mechanical properties in terms of hardness, strength, density.That seems pretty fascinating to me. Are there any other plants/trees that grow like that? I mean, from my naive knowledge, trees go wider with a new ring every year."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This has happened to me frequently at my current company. I get pulled into a meeting about something that I have no context on because it touches my area of expertise, and the discussions have apparently been stalling out.I brace myself to be the idiot. I&#39;m going to waste everyone&#39;s time asking questions that everyone knows the answer to, and I just got looped in, so everyone&#39;s going to feel like they need to walk through all the super-obvious stuff to satisfy the one guy who didn&#39;t do his homework.So I start asking questions, and slowly begin to realize that nobody in the room has any idea what they are talking about. That there are fundamental misunderstandings and misconceptions about existing systems. And, naturally, it turns out that the questions I have are questions that other people have.This has happened to me so often now that you would think the sinking feeling I get before I brace myself to look stupid would go away, but it never does."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was younger, I often met people who seemed kind of dim to me, at first, and later found the majority of them to be orders of magnitude brighter than me.
It was not hard to connect the dots, the reason they were so much brighter was (in part) exactly because of what made them initially seem dim.. They asked questions, honestly. Not the showoff kind of question you ask to show how much you know, but real, honest questions that not only showed how little they knew, but importantly, allowed them to actually learn and understand, rather than just nod and not get it.My intuition has changed from this, I find it that most times, when someone shows genuine interest and asks honest, revealing questions about some new topic, they often excel at many other things (and will likely on the new topic as well).I&#39;m adapting this myself, being honest, asking honestly, and sometimes looking really stupid (because, in that context, I am!), and I appreciate greatly both the wealth of information that allows me to access, and that almost anybody worth their salt recognizes this trait as well.Failing an interview due to looking stupid is probably a blessing in disguise, you don&#39;t want to be hired by people who can&#39;t see this, and you don&#39;t want to work next to people who&#39;s just pretending to understand, not learning because they can&#39;t afford to look stupid when they are (and thus stay stupid, and be much more inclined to try to pass blame to someone else, like you, who look stupid)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One way to prove that he truly doesn&#39;t mind looking stupid would be to list times when he risked looking stupid... and it turns out he actually was.It&#39;s happened to all of us though we dont like to admit it.I&#39;m sure it&#39;s happened to him too  and I looked but I didn&#39;t see any of those examples listed.Giving only examples of when people thought he was dumb and it turned out he wasn&#39;t... that&#39;s kind of just a roundabout way of humblebragging that you&#39;re an unrecognized genius.Sadly I think this undermines the point of the article which otherwise makes a good point."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The thing that burns out web developer is web development. The constant shift of technologies (just for the sake of it) and the nerfed (to oblivion) environment is hell. As a web developer, after you learn the basics (~5 years)  there is no feeling of where the &#34;up&#34; direction is. Everything feels like sidesteps. There is no feeling of permanence to your knowledge, unlike a lawyer or a doctor. The knowledge feels like water pouring into a full container - as much of it goes out, as it goes in.Switched to embedded systems 7 years ago to avoid the burnout. It is better, in my opinion. Funny enough, there is a natural barrier to entry that keeps most programmers away - You have to understand how computers work, how operating systems work and you have to be able to code in C/assembly. I have a lot of fun and actually picked up electronics as a hobby, which will help me better myself professionally. I think there is enough here to keep me entertained until I retire."</p>

Seeing your code repeat itself – when rhyming phrases start to pop up throughout – is a vital tool for building a theory about your app.Wow, this is the best explanation of how to apply DRY that I&#39;ve ever heard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice read. I&#39;ve been doing web dev for 15 years. What has got me burnt out now:-Spend most of my time dealing with tooling issues.-Increasingly complex demands. Even the simplest problems now seems to be multi layered with dozens of edge cases to be accounted for. It&#39;s seemingly impossible to get anything right. You can spend hours testing a responsive design on every browser, every viewport - send it to the client and you&#39;ll get after 5 minutes a list of 50 issues, half of them totally asinine.-Lack of respect/authority/autonomy. After 15 years I&#39;m considered a subordinate to a PM with 6 months experience and zero technical knowledge. This one can be improved a little by working remotely I think. But it just comes down to how management view or value different roles. We are a liability to them, something to be managed, coerced and controlled.-Oversaturated market, learntocode, let&#39;s be honest and say for 95% of companies, web devs are a commodity. I don&#39;t have an issue with people who are excited and want to learn coding, but the reality is the job market is over stuffed.-Leetcode interviews. I just don&#39;t have the energy, desire and sometimes specific knowledge to deal with these interviews. Its a straight no from me now, if i get contacted by a recruiter requesting I do one of these.I can see clearly that other people in non technical fields are getting paid better or the same as me and dealing with far far less work and far less stress.It&#39;s like there are two type of work category: &#34;reviewers&#34; and &#34;implementers&#34;. Reviewers are the stakeholders, they make all the demands and do none (or very little/superficial) of the actual work. Implementers, well we are the ones who do the heavy lifting and deal with all the real problems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel pg’s point is similar to musicians. As an example, Glenn Gould was a classical pianist and renowned Bach interpreter. He had awesome technical ability at the piano, and a fantastic memory. But lots of incredible pianists have these abilities. Go to any university or observe any competition and you’ll plainly see awesome talent. These qualities are analogous to “being smart”.However, what set Gould apart from his colleagues was his innovative and iconoclastic interpretations of well-known works with “standard” prescriptions. He had fundamentally different, but wholly consistent, ideas about musical interpretation, recording technology, presentation of music to audiences, and so on. He’s remembered as a pianist not because his fingers were quick and sensitive, but instead because he pushed boundaries in completely original ways.Leonard Bernstein—a noted conductor and pianist—quips about this when he conducted the Brahms Concerto in D minor, with Gould at the piano [1]. I recommend listening but I’ll copy his words (from [2]) for posterity.&gt; Don&#39;t be frightened. Mr. Gould is here. He will appear in a moment. I&#39;m not, um, as you know, in the habit of speaking on any concert except the Thursday night previews, but a curious situation has arisen, which merits, I think, a word or two. You are about to hear a rather, shall we say, unorthodox performance of the Brahms D Minor Concerto, a performance distinctly different from any I&#39;ve ever heard, or even dreamt of for that matter, in its remarkably broad tempi and its frequent departures from Brahms&#39; dynamic indications. I cannot say I am in total agreement with Mr. Gould&#39;s conception and this raises the interesting question: &#34;What am I doing conducting it?&#34; I&#39;m conducting it because Mr. Gould is so valid and serious an artist that I must take seriously anything he conceives in good faith and his conception is interesting enough so that I feel you should hear it, too.&gt; But the age old question still remains: &#34;In a concerto, who is the boss; the soloist or the conductor?&#34; The answer is, of course, sometimes one, sometimes the other, depending on the people involved. But almost always, the two manage to get together by persuasion or charm or even threats to achieve a unified performance. I have only once before in my life had to submit to a soloist&#39;s wholly new and incompatible concept and that was the last time I accompanied Mr. Gould. (The audience roared with laughter at this.) But, but this time the discrepancies between our views are so great that I feel I must make this small disclaimer. Then why, to repeat the question, am I conducting it? Why do I not make a minor scandal — get a substitute soloist, or let an assistant conduct? Because I am fascinated, glad to have the chance for a new look at this much-played work; Because, what&#39;s more, there are moments in Mr. Gould&#39;s performance that emerge with astonishing freshness and conviction. Thirdly, because we can all learn something from this extraordinary artist, who is a thinking performer, and finally because there is in music what Dimitri Mitropoulos used to call &#34;the sportive element&#34;, that factor of curiosity, adventure, experiment, and I can assure you that it has been an adventure this week collaborating with Mr. Gould on this Brahms concerto and it&#39;s in this spirit of adventure that we now present it to you.Because some took this as an attack on Gould, Bernstein followed up with the remark:&gt; Any discovery of Glenn&#39;s was welcomed by me because I worshiped the way he played: I admired his intellectual approach, his &#34;guts&#34; approach, his complete dedication to whatever he was doing.Anyway, it’s an interesting parallel in the arts world. Jacob Collier is a musician of today that has similar qualities of “being smart with good ideas”.[1] https://youtu.be/SvWPM783TOE[2] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Philharmonic_concer..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another way to frame this topic: intelligence doesn&#39;t always lead to impact, and impact is what matters.Example: I met a ton of trivia &#34;nerds&#34; through a friend a few years ago. They had all met at an Ivy League college, they were clearly &#34;smart&#34; in that they knew a lot of information and could follow a logical argument but somehow none of them were able to use their smarts for anything practical. They had jobs you didn&#39;t need to be that smart for, and their personal lives were sort of messy. I didn&#39;t really know what to make it them at the time, now I think they had the &#34;smarts&#34; but they didn&#39;t have the &#34;drive&#34; so their brains sort of did them no good.Another example: Plenty of people are constantly frustrated that they are misunderstood. &#34;I am so smart but I can&#39;t get anything done around here because everyone&#39;s an idiot.&#34; Some people go through their whole life believing this. Luckily I had a job that disabused me of this and taught me to communicate my ideas clearly and persuasively to others. But without that, without the ability to persuade people of your ideas, you might as well not have them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hamming (of Hamming codes) has a famous Bell Labs talk &#34;You and Your Research&#34;, describing how to have a large impact. It covers a lot of the same ground, but in more detail:https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.htmlA few points from it:You&#39;ve got to work on important problems.How about having lots of `brains?&#39; It sounds good. But great work is something else than mere brains.The people who do great work with less ability but who are committed to it, get more done that those who have great skill and dabble in it.The prepared mind sooner or later finds something important and does it. So yes, it is luck. The particular thing you do is luck, but that you do something is not.One of the characteristics you see, and many people have it including great scientists, is that usually when they were young they had independent thoughts and had the courage to pursue them."</p>

The economy is riddled through with people who do nothing, but get paid because structurally that’s who gets paid.Intuit is one of those companies. They produce a few real products, QuickBooks for businesses and Mint, but overwhelmingly their money comes from the fact that they charge rent on filling your taxes. They’re a parasite on our society.Fortunately the podcaster wasn’t talking about the US; their country was worse off than America in this area by far.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I served in the Georgia legislature during a portion of a similar story. Without a doubt, the calculations throughout the story were political not technical.In the Georgia version, the technical details of the exposed information in the Secretary of State&#39;s office were facepalmingly simple (misconfigured apache directives) yet the story dragged on politically for years.Quickly, a hired security researcher for a corporate client found all registered voters info and instructional pdfs with credentials for the elections system publicly indexed by google. They responsibly disclosed. The apache configuration was updated to &#34;use encryption&#34; (moved from http to https) but still left the info indexed by google over https vs. http.    Eventually, this information became public.The state attempted to prosecute the security researcher but found no state statutes they could use. They then used this incident as a base to create a bill to criminalize the security researcher&#39;s actions.As a state rep, I worked very hard to push back on a bad bill spawned by the incident that would&#39;ve criminalized responsible disclosure.Only due to bi-partisan efforts from technically versed people were we able to get the Governor at the time to veto the bill.https://www.snopes.com/ap/2017/06/15/researcher-finds-georgi...https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/comp..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find the article title kind of curious, given that it states Parson has &#34;doubled down&#34; which suggests that the video the article references is an active effort on Parson&#39;s part. It then goes on to state that the video was produced by a PAC Parson created but doesn&#39;t give direct input to. Comes off as unnecessarily inflammatory to me I suppose.Having said that, this situation in particular really tests my willingness to assume good faith on the part of the governor and his body of advisors. Is he legitimately without a single person close to him that could inform him of how misguided this line of aggression is, and how fortunate it was that the individual who identified the security problem acted in such a helpful manner? On top of that he assigned the Missouri State Highway Patrol to investigate, because given his perceived severity of the situation that&#39;s the best agency at his disposal? It all just seems bananas.I try not to assume that totally inane actions from elected officials are exclusively the result of political calculus, and I suppose I don&#39;t have any evidence to assume that&#39;s the case here either. But I&#39;m at a loss as to how this situation could blossom into something so ridiculous."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is pretty good overview. One fun tricks we would regularly do was move all the background audio off the disk and into GPU ram. We&#39;d stream just enough that we wouldn&#39;t saturate the bus but could get back 20-30mb of system memory.There was also that time we ran out of open file handles ahead of key demo at one of the tradeshows. I remember rewriting the whole audio streaming subsystem to piggyback on the seekfree texture loading system so that we could use the that single big file as a source for both streaming texture and audio data. Did that in 24 hours less than 2 days ahead of the show, fun times.[Edit]Another fun thing from that era was that almost no one other than the in-house Sony Studios used the SPUs well. X360 came out just ahead and had tooling that was miles ahead(PIX!) so everyone started from the X360. None of the workloads we&#39;re vectorized so it was absolutely brutal to get them to fit into the SPUs. For a long time a good chunk of that silicon was just idle. If you did start from the PS3 though because of the vectorized workloads you had insane cache coeheranch and usually ran better on the X360/PC as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was a fantastic read; thank you for sharing.I saw escorts for a couple of years.  It was often weird, when I just didn’t click with the woman, but I met a few really awesome people.There are other down sides to escorting.  One of the women I had seen a couple of times, was later murdered. They ended up catching the killer- another escort, I don’t know why.  It was hard to grieve; we were not real close; her family probably didn’t want clients showing up at the funeral or any other reminder like flowers.I ended up falling in love with one of the women I met and we dated for a while.  It was a serious emotional roller coaster being in love with someone who was having sex with other men until she was ready to “go exclusive”.  But in the end we got married after she retired.Now it’s ten years later. We have a son and are still happy as can be.If you’re thinking about seeing escorts, remember that since intimacy with other people is involved, there are often strong emotions as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a fantastic article: informative, well-written, thoughtful, human, and funny. And it’s especially interesting to see it posted here at HN, because while reading it I kept thinking there are some solid lessons here about entrepreneurship, sales, and product pricing that could certainly be applied to your average start-up SaaS.I mean, anchoring your price high, to better capture the businessman/enterprise market? And that this market also happens to be less likely to be time-suck jerks about little issues, or constantly asking for product changes/features? Literally better b̶a̶n̶g̶ ̶f̶o̶r̶ ̶y̶o̶u̶r̶ ̶buck for your bang.And it’s right out of the classic @patio11 essays, too. Charge more, indeed."</p>

Yeah I really don’t get why this stuff is illegal, even though I have no interest myself."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very cool stuff.I remember being at Build 2018 and asking the PM on the Live Share team if they had any plans to bring VS Code to the browser. Maybe do managed environments for labs and companies (what GitHub code spaces now is), would be great for education. Lots of students (especially non-CS nerds, like the physics kids with a CS requirement) find environment setup to be one of the hardest parts. He seemed to think I was a piece of shit for not ‘getting’ what Live Share was all about and how those other offerings (code spaces, running in the browser without install) were bad ideas not worth considering.I think the moral of the story is, if you’re a PM, don’t treat your most enthusiastic customers like shit. Or maybe do, because it won’t actually have business impact."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems really cool, and seems like it took a lot of man hours to put together.However, I&#39;m not sure who this is for. Downloading and installing an application is not a particularly big ask for the type of people who use VSCode. The browser version will always be a compromised experience, given the inherent limitations of browser applications. Even if it works 99% of the time, that 1% would add enough friction to make it more of a hassle then it&#39;s worth.The post gave some use cases involving hardware that can&#39;t easily run Desktop VSCode (e.g. iPads and Chromebooks). I just don&#39;t see that being much of a use case though, except in desperate circumstances where a more capable dev machine isn&#39;t available.If there are some use cases I&#39;m missing, I&#39;d love to hear about them! This is a pretty new concept, and I certainly don&#39;t know how everyone likes to code. But from my perspective, I struggle to see any situation where someone would choose to use this, and few situations where someone would have to."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ve been using Brave search for several months now. I switched the day that it was announced. The quality is fairly good, but I’m having troubling telling whether it’s just my own halo effect or if the initial quality that experienced has started to slip a little as it indexes more widely or something. At first I was impressed with how little spam ended up in top results, but lately exact queries for Python functions or prominent API functions have lots of spammy content above the actual documentation. Talking about sites that just republish GitHub issue threads, republished StackOverflow questions, w3schools-likes, etc.I’m still rooting for them, but in general
I continued to be baffled why such blatant spam can consistently make it into top results on Google, DDG and now Brave. I really wish a search engine would empower me to provide a URL ban list that gets applied server-side instead of filtering on the front end (if anything)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You know what, I welcome a new search provider, even if it&#39;s by a cryptocurrency company. I&#39;d rather see Qwant succeed, but their search is having trouble competing with even duckduckgo.What I don&#39;t see is where Brave gets its image search results from. After Microsoft blatantly started serving the CCP by blocking queries for &#34;tank man&#34;, which as far as I know they&#39;ve never actually apologised for, just explained it as &#34;a filter with more impact than expected&#34; or some BS like that, I found out that most &#34;competing&#34; search engines bought all of their image search from Microsoft, leading to the same kind of censorship on platforms such as duckduckgo.Brave says it&#39;s using &#34;third parties&#34; to generate the results but I can&#39;t easily see which third party that would be. If they are using Bing like all the others, I wouldn&#39;t trust their image search engine in the slightest.Personally, I&#39;ll just assume they are for now, because they don&#39;t seem to clarify this further anywhere else.From what I can tell, there are four image/video search providers in the world: Google, Bing, Yandex and Baidu. The rest all seem to license their results from one of the big four, mostly from Bing. When I need to pick from those four, I&#39;ll stick with Google; their censorship is relatively mild. I was hoping Brave Search would prove to be an alternative in this area, but that doesn&#39;t seem to be the case."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For non-technical searches, mostly stuff relating to news, politics, or Covid, Google is next to useless at this point due to their attempts to combat misinformation. Even their autocomplete functionality guides potential search queries in an entirely unorganic manner. For instance, something may be trending according to google, while simultaneously being blacklisted as an autocomplete option- if it has Any elements of wrongthink about it."</p>

Recent data from the Norse Greenlandic population, however, show no evidence of the last of these.Is it possible the Vikings were not in that location long enough for populations to mix?

I can&#39;t really see any other way to possibly stand out than to try to be radically genuine and sincere, even when that seems (as the author seemed to have thought!) that it is the &#34;less fancy&#34; or &#34;not the thing you are supposed to say.&#34; Quite literally anything else will be something they will have heard, at a minimum, dozens of other times."</p>

I embed it as a data URI and it&#39;s just four lines of (col-80 wrapped) base64 text, which seems reasonable to me.Haven&#39;t managed to get my headshot down to less than 10k without looking horrible no matter how much I tweaked the JPEG or WebP settings, and thought that was just a tad too big to embed. Maybe I need to find a different picture that compresses better.I got that 280k Discord favicon down to just 24K simply by opening it in GIMP and saving it again. I got it down to 12K by indexing it to 255 colours rather than using RGB (I can&#39;t tell the difference even at full size). You can probably make it even smaller if you tried, but that&#39;s diminishing returns. Still, I bet with 5 more minutes you can get it to ~5k or so.It&#39;s very easy; you just need to care. Does it matter? Well, when I used Slack I regularly spent a minute waiting for them to push their &gt;10M updates, so I&#39;d say that 250k here and 250k there etc. adds up and matters, giving real actual improvements to your customers.The Event Horizon Telescope having a huge favicon I can understand; probably just some astronomer who uploaded it in WordPress or something. Arguably a fault of the software for not dealing with that more sensibly, but these sort of oversights happen. A tech company making custom software for a living is quite frankly just embarrassing to the entire industry. It&#39;s a big fat &#34;fuck you&#34; to anyone from less developed areas with less-than-ideal internet connections."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The difference between the Apple “precomposed” and standard icons had to do with the gloss effect on icons on pre iOS 7 home screens.When adding a website/webapp to these earlier home screens, the OS would apply a gloss effect over the icon in order to match the aesthetic of the standard apps.
The precomposed icon was a way for the developer to stop the OS from applying this effect, such as if their logo already had a different gloss effect already applied (i.e “precomposed”) or other design where adding the glossy shine wouldn’t look right.
The standard icon allowed the OS to apply the gloss effect - which was a timesaver as Apple did tweak the gloss contour over the years: hence using a standard icon ensured that the website/webapp always matched the user’s OS version."</p>

Everything was backed up on backblaze, but the internet connections they had available was simply too unreliable to get the backup down. They contacted backblaze and for a price that was high (but not insane for a company) backblaze actually flew a guy with a physical hard drive to their location.Saved ~5 gigs from being canceled, and my friend has been a die hard backblaze evangelist ever since."</p>

I hope they do well, and I hope they don&#39;t change too much in the pursuit of a profit. Not being profitable in the SaaS business is not necessarily the scarlet letter that it is in other fields, so I&#39;m optimistic for their future.Also, congrats Backblaze!

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I believe the thing we often need to learn is the thing we&#39;re afraid of learning. We often (always?) have weaknesses that can/do jeopardize our strength and closing those weaknesses is crucial.The famous Scott Galloway (whom I had as a b-school professor) made this point like this: if you are a great guy, great father, great boss, etc, but once in a while you get violently drunk and hurt people in your life - THAT thing offsets everything else. You won&#39;t become better by &#34;doubling down&#34; on what you&#39;re already good at, but by fixing this flaw.Another case - I used to manage a C++ developer. If you gave him a tight spec, he&#39;d implement it perfectly. But the world we lived in required him to go talk to people to figure out what the real needs are, and he was bad at that. So his code always solved the wrong problem unless someone was helping him with this stuff.Every year, his own developmental goal was to go learn the next C++ standard. And that would have been useless because he was already a great C++ programmer. Going from 97th percentile to the 98th wouldn&#39;t matter. The much bigger bang for the buck would be figuring out how to go sit down with a sales rep and say &#34;OK, what&#39;s our client actually trying to do here?&#34;It sounds simple but I believe this held him back not just in work but in life. I happen to know that he didn&#39;t have great communication with his wife and kids either - solving this thing would make him so much better at all parts of his life.The thing is - we all have glaring things like this - obstacles in our own trajectory that if we fix, our existing strength would really shine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can relate to the “looking at data” as a skill bit, especially the part where he mentions that it’s not a skill most data scientists necessarily have. I have observed that too. (I’m one myself)Many data scientists like to jump into feature extraction and modeling the data with ML/DS tools because for us that’s the fun part. (we might look at some plots and summary statistics but we don’t dwell there for too long.) Few have the patience to just sit with the data for a week just to look at it, checking it against our intuition about the real world and the domain and basically just trying to put 2 and 2 together without models (except a mental model of the world) and just turning the data over in Tableau (or Excel). It’s actually not an easy skill to learn because it requires other meta skills. For one it requires an ability to match numbers to the real world — and for that you need experience and a good intuition of how the world works.My first manager was exceptionally good at doing this. I’ve noticed too that folks in senior management — at least competent ones — tended to be good at looking at data and picking out things too. I suspect this is actually a make or break ability to get to senior management at most companies.Data scientists, not so much. (Unless they worked in the field or came from the business side of things.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The bit about compilers reminds me of this quote about Feyman, but sorry of the inverse where you hold tricks in your head instead of problems.Richard Feynman was fond of giving the following advice on how to be a genius. You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say, &#39;How did he do it? He must be a genius!&#39;"</p>

New trends like AR would just accelerate the change due to the need to solve all day worn audio devices.On the hearing aids side, almost every hearing aid today acts as an always connected set of headphones for your mobile phone (and has been like that for years on iOS).Deregulating this could bring the tech industry innovation to hearing aids through natural progression of headphones technology.This trend would make hearing aids not just target hearing impaired people, but also individual with normal hearing. For example, features such as protecting your ears against a sudden loud noise, silencing a loud restaurant so you can have a quiet conversation or improving the audio of a soft speaker could be useful for everyone."</p>

Sadly, most people wait too long before trying a hearing aid, and give up because they hear too much noise.Imagine returning your eye glasses because you still see ugly people.I truly wish hearing aids were far cheaper, and that was a very hard part of my job and one of the reasons why I changed careers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are a number of healthcare areas in the US that have been protected by regulation, but it’s increasingly unclear if this is good for patients, consumers, or public health at large. The increasing sentiment seems to be probably not.Vision care is another area I’d expect to see more changes and disruption coming down the pipeline. Vision care is very important and advanced cases require special skills, but it’s also unclear why many routine checks couldn’t just be done by a family doctor.The US requires one to see a “doctor of optometry” to get a basic single vision prescription. That industry used to make its money turning around and selling you glasses from the same office but that whole industry has been turned upside down by online retailers like Warby Parker and such. Why the US can’t follow the models followed most elsewhere in the world is unclear, but it would remove a lot of extra steps and costs in getting a basic care of glasses. Ophthalmology (medical doctors) are still very much a thing but most countries don’t have this model of needed a “prescription” from an optometrist for a basic pair of single vision specs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just as important as recycling these batteries is making it possible for older EVs to have their batteries replaced years down the road with 3rd party batteries.In 2031, it should be possible to by a long-past-warranty 2021 EV, replace the battery pack (with one made from recycled EV batteries!), and have it just-work.   Just like you can replace the engine of a classic car today if you are so inclined.It should be possible because the electrical connection of the batteries to EV drivetrains are relatively simple - although I&#39;m sure that will take a lawsuit (like was launched against Nespresso to allow 3rd party coffee pods) for EV manufacturers to release the specs required for this to happen.It would be unfortunate if EV batteries were non-serviceable except by the manufacturer after they were out of warranty, like phones are today.   Instead, battery replacement would potentially allow the tertiary used EV market to flourish, and make them more accessible to people of modest means."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We need to design devices such as batteries for recycling and long life from the design phase of the products. Solid-state Lithium batteries will probably be easier to recycle due to no sandwiching. &#34;The immediate benefit of switching from a liquid to solid electrolyte is that the energy density of the battery can increase. This is because instead of requiring large separators between the liquid cells, solid state batteries only require very thin barriers to prevent a short circuit.&#34; This separator material complicates recycling in conventional Lithium ion batteries.Instead of assuming we have endless resources we should design all products to recyclable from the start design phase. This is to lessen global warming and environmental impact."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The team tested batteries with recycled NMC111 cathodes, the most common flavor of cathode containing a third each of nickel, manganese, and cobalt. The cathodes were made using a patented recycling technique that Battery Resources, a startup Wang co-founded, is now commercializing.That seems like a waste of cobalt.  I think modern cells are usually something more like NMC811 (80% nickel, 10% each of manganese and cobalt).  You could use the cobalt from the old cells to make more than three times as many new cells, though you&#39;d need a lot more nickel.I&#39;m hoping most mass-market EVs switch over to using lithium iron phosphate, which doesn&#39;t use nickel or cobalt.  Supposedly there are some major LFP patents expiring soon; maybe that&#39;ll increase the number of factories outside of China producing them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thanks Google. Think I’ll be buying this.I want as little to do with Google’s services as possible in my life, but they really deserve credits for making a modern usable smartphone that is reasonably open. There is just one single feature I will be buying this for - the 5 years of software updates. While good image processing is definitely a pro, all of these software you’re presenting features I really don’t give a damn about. Just give me a phone that is meant to last a little while - and allow me to run what I damn please. This looks to be like a continuation of the Pixel 5, which allows you run your own software like /e/OS and CalyxOS aside to just being a lot less of a walled garden on the stock ROM.The Android market is completely dire, and no vendor can be trusted to provide openness, reasonable taste or security updates. They sell you a phone, and once you’ve clicked buy they’ve already stopped caring. So last year I switched to an iPhone 12. I needed to vote with my wallet to get a phone that lasts. But although I get what’s appealing about iPhones and the walled garden, I started feeling claustrophobic. Feeling claustrophobic about what I can tailor about my browser, how easily I can run Game Boy games, what ads I can block, and Apple’s stated intents to actively incriminate you by scanning your photos on a personal device. I will continue to recommend those phones for most people (pending what they’re going to do with trying to incriminate you), but it’s not for me.Finally here’s a seemingly good Android phone with 5 years of support - from the only phone vendor outside of Apple who appears to give a damn about that aspect. Don’t get me wrong: 5 years is still too short in my view, and not as long as Apple provides support for on their stuff [1]. But the market needs change, and I’ll put money towards that.[1]: The iPhone 5S has just hit 8 years of _kernel_ security updates last month with iOS 12.5.5. One can dream on the Android side, but I’ll take 5 years in the current market."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate the trend that the &#34;pro&#34; versions of all these flagship phones need to be an XL Phablet monstrosity. Human hands haven&#39;t gotten any bigger. I have owned most of the Nexus &amp; Pixel phones throughout the years. After having the Nexus 6 as my daily driver for 2 years, I have always opted for the smaller option ever since.I would totally pay flagship prices for a regular ~5.5-6&#34; phone with flagship specs, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one. Make it 50% thicker if there are space/heat concerns, but making it wider and taller just makes it super difficult to use consistently with one hand. I also say this as somebody with larger-than-average hands!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google seems to have for some reason requested a very/overly broad embargo from reviewers which does not let them show any photos taken with the device or software features for now.MKBHD mentions this (and shows nothing from the phone really) @ https://youtu.be/roWxo6jWoYw?t=140
And Mrwhosetheboss said he refused to cover these phones due to the embargo.
The Tech Chap mentions he can&#39;t show anything apart from the home screen. Can&#39;t even swipe down to show notifications @ https://youtu.be/aLr7eCsY6Cg?t=191Wonder what made them think that that&#39;s a good idea. Especially because Android 12 is not exactly a secret."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve always felt like there were two types of frameworks. Both types make the first x% of work relatively easy, but then the two types differentiate based off of how easily it is to drop down and go custom.A framework with strong primitives makes it easy to create custom functionality that is still consistent with the framework&#39;s conventions. But a framework that relies too much on magic makes this much harder. It&#39;s like all of a sudden you&#39;re surrounded with old Mainers saying &#34;you can&#39;t get there from here&#34; while you desperately try to cobble some kind of solution using ancient lore documented once long ago in a forgotten scroll."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The hammer analogy breaks down from the get-go for me. The main distinguishing factor between a framework and a library is the classic &#34;you call a library, but a framework calls you.&#34;A better (but still imperfect) analogy might be buying a timber frame (with plan) versus home-rolling a stick frame from the ground up. With the planned timber frame house, the rough layout of the rooms and plumbing and such is somewhat predetermined, and as such it &#34;calls you&#34; in the sense that you&#39;re building out the amenities, but with the ground-up stick frame, you&#39;re explicitly making all the framing decisions too.Like all things, there are bad frameworks, but scoped appropriately (simply) they can be incredibly useful. Just like houses, it turns out there are many ways in which web services are similar to each other and can benefit from a common framing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is very interesting. Hindenburg is the real deal.One challenge may be that, like the Mafia, Tether keeps its inner circle and employs family members. They have ~15 employees for a 70 billion dollar operation.The CTO’s wife is a manager, and the CEO’s daughter works for an unnamed crypto family office, which may be related.Their counterparties in Chinese commercial paper may not know they are counterparties due to proxies.Still, the statements are out there. Zeke Faux from Bloomberg got a copy of their records somehow. They’ve had to give them to the New York Attorney General, and their accountants in the Cayman Islands, among others. And other counterparties may have bits and pieces.Someone may be tempted by this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It may be counterintuitive, but the best thing that could happen to Bitcoin would be for Tether to collapse in a cloud of dust. Tether is continually cited as a large risk factor to Bitcoin by people who have gotten past the &#34;it&#39;s not real money&#34; objection.But I think it&#39;s worth considering what happens if the collapse never comes. If government investigation, findings of wrongdoing, admission of lies, and punishment aren&#39;t enough to shake Tether users out of their trees, then what would, exactly?Ethereum allowed a claw-back of funds lost fair and square to a defective contract. Where is Ethereum now? Oh yeah, near an all-time high and a market cap approaching half a trillion dollars.What non-users don&#39;t get is the fanatical level of devotion by users. It waxes and wanes with the Bitcoin halving cycle, but always comes back stronger than before.If Tether did somehow implode and users left in droves, something else would come along to take its place and within a year or two and the entire Bitcoin ecosystem would come roaring back stronger than ever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As always, Matt Levine is shockingly informative:https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-10-07/matt-l...Key quote:1. You get a bunch of Bitcoins.2. You slice them into junior and senior claims.3. You sell the junior claims to people who want levered Bitcoin: people who want margin loans against their Bitcoins, etc., who want to gamble on Bitcoin without putting up too much cash.4. You sell the senior claims as stablecoins: “Even if Bitcoin drops by 50%,” you say, “these coins will still be worth $1, because they are backed by $2 worth of Bitcoin.”"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Since the article mentions it, the amount of carbonation in any given beverage actually varies by a lot. The traditional measurement of carbonation is in &#34;volumes&#34;, which is the amount of space the CO2 would take up at standard temperature and pressure (32F and 1 atm). Coca Cola is usually packaged at 3 volumes; if you took all the CO2 out of the soda it would occupy 3x the volume of the soda it came from.Alcoholic beverages on the other hand have a pretty wide range of regular carbonation levels. On your lower end you have stouts and Scottish ales at 1.9-2.1, and on the high end you get your dubbel and heffe weisen at 3-3.5 volumes. Champagne is regularly in the 4.5-6 range, which necessitates a different bottle and closure design to handle the 2-3x pressure it contains compared to beer.On a particularly dumb note, ciders are limited by law to 0.64g per 100ml, or 3.2 volumes. Above that level they cease being ciders and instead become a sparkling wine. This is very important because natural cider is taxed at $0.226 per gallon, while sparkling wine is taxed at $3.30 or $3.40 per gallon depending on how the carbonation is added. This is a difference of roughly 30 cents per standard bottle, or $1.79 per six pack; enough of a difference to make similar products more attractive on the market place shelf.https://www.ttb.gov/tax-audit/quick-reference-guide-to-wine-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Putting gaps in is also a useful trick to have up your sleeve if you&#39;re 3d printing internal threads.  If you print threads as continuous bodies, the filament on each layer is effectively a ring which is (because of thread geometry) less supported for part of its length. When it contracts slightly as it cools, it can pull the overhang section of the thread away from the body of the object, and you end up with loose filament strung across the gap.If you cut gaps along the thread, when it prints you&#39;re effectively building a lot of small separated ledges out from a side wall. You don&#39;t have that cooling/tensioning effect and there&#39;s nothing to pull the filament away from where it&#39;s laid down so you end up with a cleaner thread.That&#39;s as long as your retraction settings are well tuned, mind - continuous thread is one long extrusion with no retractions, whereas thread with gaps is potentially lots of islands, depending on how your slicer reacts to the geometry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My country&#39;s national library used to provide a service in the 70s/80s where you could send a letter or telegram with a question, any question, and they&#39;d do their best to answer it.My Mum was a big fan of it, I&#39;ve still got a copy of their telegram response to her question of &#34;Why don&#39;t we see birds flying overhead with a penis flopping around?&#34;The answer was simple.&#34;Most birds don&#39;t have penises. They press cloaca to cloaca. Birds that do have penises store them in their bodies when not mating. Please stop sending questions about penises&#34;...it wasn&#39;t her first animal penis question submitted, and I&#39;m assuming she&#39;d developed a reputation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great article.I was actually responsible for invalidating another maps-related patent from the 1990s, in Germany. I was in Patent Litigation and I also remember having a &#34;ART+COM&#34; folder in my email, but that&#39;s about all I can remember. I don&#39;t think the case was very active by 2014.Anyhow, there&#39;s something Avi said that I have to comment on:The test for patent-worthiness is: “would it be non-obvious to someone who is skilled in the art?” I’d been doing “stupid programmer tricks” like this since high school, as have many others in my field.If only it were so simple! You would think that &#34;hey, that&#39;s just a stupid programmer trick!&#34; would be enough to render something obvious, but you&#39;d be wrong. That&#39;s what my paper [1] is about.No, to call &#34;obvious&#34; the combination of references A and B, there usually has to be some &#34;teaching, suggestion, or motivation&#34; in the literature that it would be a good idea to combine A and B. There are nuances to this statement, in case anyone&#39;s feeling pedantic.[1] https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2399580"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A Jury in Delaware decided already that Google Earth doesn&#39;t violate the 1995 Art+Com patent. So the thing is settled.But the fact remains that Art+Com had a working system in 1994 and the Keyhole founders had learned about it working at Silicon Graphics.As it looks like there were multiple teams in the US working on something like or comparable to Terravision. Heck, I wrote a program in 1984 showing the world as a ball with the contours of the continents at the ZX Spectrum. I bet hundred&#39;s if not thousands of people did that as well, it is not that hard and requires only a little trigonometry.I have no further insights into the story, but folks here should at least respect that a small group of hackers and and artists build a working system a good decade before Google Earth was published. I have yet to see any demonstration or video that comes near to Art+Com&#39;s TerraVision in 1994. There are papers written at the same time, a DARPA project working for a single military installation and a lot of work done shortly after TerraVision had been publicly demonstrated, but so far I have yet to see a video from 1994 or before comparable to Art+Com&#39;s TerraVision."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This post is quite nice in naming the people who did all the improvements. During this time, I was at a company trying to fit browser tech into consumer electronics, so we had to build the technology to run on actual inexpensive and cheap systems. Which became a core unmentioned technology, now called AJAX. Several engineers went to keyhole right at the time of the Google purchase, and did very well. Also remember Earth did little for Google, it was all maps - which had no flying demo, it was just 2d (ish) and useful."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a front end developer, I am really happy to see resources like this.Developing for the browser is a real challenge. I think working with html / css /js has been a neglected skill for a long time - most software engineers look down on that type of work and its rarely covered in comp sci course work.Still, its good to see a lot of progress has been made, this book included.My only critique - why use python instead of node.js?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was interested to see that this uses the DukPy wrapper around Duktape for the JavaScript interpreter: https://browser.engineering/scripts.htmlThis made me start digging into whether this was considered a &#34;safe&#34; way of executing untrusted JavaScript in a sandbox.It&#39;s not completely clear to me if DukPy currently attempts safe evaluation - it&#39;s missing options for setting time or memory limits on executed code for example: https://github.com/amol-/dukpyThere&#39;s a QuickJS Python wrapper here which offers those limits: https://github.com/PetterS/quickjsI&#39;m pretty paranoid though any time it comes to security and dependencies written in C, so I&#39;d love to see a Python wrapper around a JavaScript engine that has safe sandbox execution as a key goal plus an extensive track record to back it up!"</p>
