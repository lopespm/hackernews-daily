								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am an IP litigator, and I have dealt with patent trolls repeatedly. I have taken these kinds of cases pro bono in the past for small companies (including through the EFF attorney referral list, https://www.eff.org/pages/legal-assistance), and I know that others have as well.There are definitely low-cost and pro bono (free) options out there for very small businesses. The EFF attorney referral list is a good place to start.I&#39;m also happy to talk it through with you if you&#39;d like more specific information - my contact information is here: https://shawkeller.com/attorneys/andrew-e-russell/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been through similar situations.  The &#34;find a lawyer&#34; comments are less than helpful, since you probably don&#39;t know where to begin and most lawyers will happily take your money without necessarily having an expedient path to resolution for a small one-person company.  So here&#39;s what you do:Write to each of your competitors, explain the situation and ask for a referral to their lawyers.  You&#39;d be surprised how many are more than willing to make a referral against a troll Also search around for any other attorneys who have filed against this troll and contact them as well.  They should all be willing to do an initial call for free.You are trying to find an attorney who has a successful blueprint for dealing with this particular troll, ideally this particular claim.  If the attorney is able to leverage their prior work or knowledge, your costs are greatly reduced.  Also, if the troll has unsuccessful experience with a particular attorney they may just give up.  Good luck!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You have to talk to a lawyer.  No one other than a IP attorney experienced in dealing with patent trolls will be able to give you accurate advice on this.Also you should add &#34;[ask HN]&#34; to the beginning of your post.edit: A good way to find a lawyer is to talk to good lawyers you have worked with in the past.  They will not be able to help you themself if they practice in a different area, but will likely have referrals for someone who does."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Damn, this is such a GREAT idea.
I&#39;ve messed up repos a few times, and it&#39;s never good.
It&#39;s always -- &#34;what&#39;s the magic want I have to wave now&#34;?The truth is, while we use git every day, most people really don&#39;t understand how it works.There I said it. And I&#39;m not ashamed.I don&#39;t really know how Git works. And I think I&#39;m not the only one.What does &#34;git reflog&#34; or &#34;git reset --hard ....&#34; do? What are the implications?We don&#39;t really know.I feel stupid. But hey, at least I&#39;m honest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m sorry, but how many bits of git&#39;s UI do we have to force users to manually replace before we realize that the entire problem is git&#39;s UI?Between the tone deaf responses here about &#34;using a GUI client is the problem,&#34; to the tone deaf responses of &#34;you just have to learn it&#39;s internal architecture,&#34; it should be obvious what the problem is. The problem is not just being able to undo a mistake (though that&#39;s certainly one of the problems). Git is an incredibly user-hostile experience, and someone needs to fix or replace it. Can we just say it out loud and stop pretending that the problem is the literally thousands of users who have problems using it?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"When the stock goes from 200 to 3500 in 10 years, and consistently goes up and to the right, you won’t find too many of the workers complaining no matter how bad the job conditions are. I have a friend up in Seattle who is suffering, to the point of being hospitalized for mental health issues, but refuses to leave.So HR and leadership believe that their system “works” but it’s really that their employees are willing to put up with straight up torture. They are deluded into thinking that their metrics and PIP plan work well because their best employees are staying but it’s really just the stock price.If the stock price starts to drop for whatever reason. All the best employees will leave in droves. That’s what I saw at Uber post IPO."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had joined Amazon as my first job out of school. I was super excited and would not mind working the long hours as the project was interesting. I enjoyed working with my team and manager. Just near the end of the year, my manager quit. The new manager ran my performance review and assessed that my performance didn’t meet expectations. I was not put on PIP. Instead, there would be a development plan that I had to complete. I was shocked and tried hard to not cry during my review. I had never been told earlier that there were any issues with my performance.This review crushed me. It destroyed my confidence in my programming abilities. To be fair, I had made some mistakes during my first year at Amazon - had fewer commits and SLOC compared to my teammates. Being on a work visa meant I could not quit immediately. I had to endure working there for almost a year before I got a new job.I took me quite some time to gain back my confidence. To this day, my time at Amazon makes me dread performance reviews."</p>

And as some uses are likely to be sketchy &#34;because terrorism/pornography&#34; is all the justification they will need."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a current Amazon employee I can confirm this is no longer the case or only applies to such a select few pieces of software that it doesn&#39;t actually mean what you think it does. The amount of day to day stuff that is relied upon that runs on greasemonkey scripts and web scraping is insane. API&#39;s for a ton of things don&#39;t exist or are have heavy gatekeeping. (eg. contact x to get onboarded to our API and they just ghost you). Of course you can get a high level leader to tell you to use a proper API in a mailing list email thread where you are trying to get help to solve a problem but they will not actually help you get working API access, all talk no action. A perfect example is there is this basic CRUD app that I rely upon and I see the current maintainer is working on all these feature requests, the problem for me is that the site has a ton of AJAX and takes like 20 mouse clicks to get retrieve basic information. So I  open a ticket / feature request just to get a basic REST API for the reads and they politely tell me I am an idiot and close the request. So much pointless work is created at Amazon from lack of API access."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How far does this principle scale? I&#39;ve heard of this strategy and thought &#34;that&#39;s kinda cool.&#34; Amazon is obviously successful in its domain, so it would be easy to assume some causality.And yet, there&#39;s another big tech company, fruit symbol I think, that has played the long game of continually fine tuning the interaction points to make the integration of their parts more than the whole. They get credit for attention to detail, leveraging their integration and their ability to move in ways they do because of their thorough integration across their whole hardware/software stack. They&#39;ve recently been in the press because of just how much they were able to tune their integration to the problem with their first desktop computing chip. Again, we credit their success with some causality due to this strategy, which (to me) is very different than the Amazon strategy.Is it because Amazon is a cloud company and Apple is a hardware company that they have these different approaches to product development and each enjoy success? Or at the end of the day, are these &#34;do it this way&#34; less responsible than we&#39;d like to believe?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at a company that read the Amazon memo virtually straight after it was published and decided to copy it. The CIO at the time predicated every system&#39;s teams&#39; bonus on it.No API, no bonus.What followed was 18mths of people building enterprise messaging systems and &#34;buses&#34; of various types. Hundreds of pages of documentation on APIs was prepared and released.I think 2 API&#39;s with maybe 40 methods actually went live.There were no bonusesMany people leftThe people who stayed were unhappyIt never happened, everyone quietly forgot about it after 18 mnths.The CIO stayed for another 3 or 4 years - he only left when a new CEO came in due to internal promotion. The new CEO used to run one of the P&amp;L&#39;s/business units and hated the CIO with a passion.So... it&#39;s not the API mandate that made the difference at Amazon."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think the biggest problem with Twitter is that we can’t determine a denominator. Twitter knows, but we don’t know.100 people tweeting about how this guy is bad might be indicative of a general consensus or might just be 100 people out of a billion Twitter users. People then interpret it as general consensus and pile on.We know the numerator but since we don’t know the denominator of people who didn’t comment, or disagree, or never saw, or don’t care. So we can’t figure out a ratio and many people assume the denominator is the numerator and the ratio is 1.“The world won’t do business with this guy, I better fire him” doesn’t make sense if it’s just a very small ratio as who cares if 100 people are upset and 1,000,000 customers don’t care.I wish Twitter had some ratio of who viewed vs who acted. Or had downvotes or something. Currently, people assuming that a few commenters is everyone is doing bad things.This coupled with there’s always someone or a small group who holds an opinion so putting too much weight into a few commenters is not smart. Yet frequently done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve fortunately never been cancelled (I don&#39;t think I even have enough of a footprint or visibility for that to happen).From everything I&#39;ve observed, the absolute worst thing you can do is apologize to the people attempting to cancel you. It&#39;s just pouring gasoline on the fire.These people will never say &#34;oh, you learned from your mistakes, I guess I&#39;ll back off&#34;. Most of them don&#39;t really care about the truth, they care about signaling. So an apology only vindicates them.As far as I can tell, the thing to always keep in mind is if you wait a few days these things always pass pretty quickly. The internet has a very short attention span. As long as you never give those people a confirmation that you did something you regret, you&#39;re much better off in the future.Of course you should privately apologize and make amends for things you&#39;ve done wrong; but those things are always more effective privately and personally done anyway."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Former AWS engineer here.I worked on a pretty critical product in AWS (big AWS service with lots of traffic) and I can safely say that it&#39;s totally up to your manager and pre-existing conditions which make up the job. My manager was great as a person but would always lack in my career-oriented goals (bigger projects, promotions, etc)But what really sucked for me was the pre-existing conditions. Our on-call was pretty bad (40-60 tickets a week) and there was very little investment being put in to improve it. We had a lot of little scripts here and there which would solve extremely specific situations but no focus was ever put on in building a general framework or trying to reduce the ticket count. This often led to engineers taking the day off after their on-call due to the load and honestly it made people quite grumpy. And upper management was always much more interested in feature delivery since the focus was always on promotions and the more you delivered the better it looked for your manager. So now you have engineers with such a terrible on-call load along with pressure to deliver new features and projects within the atrocious tight deadlines that would be set. It was, to be blunt, a shit show.Code quality was atrocious. We had one enormous Java method (&gt;1000 lines) which would take care of nearly every single request coming into our service... With only about 7-8 unit tests. It was so difficult to get even basic things done to the point where any ticket that needed to be done would take a minimum of 4-5 days regardless of complexity. And of course managers and senior engineers would estimate small tickets to take around 1-2 days and then be shocked when 2 days later it&#39;s not even close to being finished. I will give Amazon credit that they do grill design reviews pretty harshly so those are done well in general. But code reviewers didn&#39;t care about quality or best practice. If it works then ship it.I&#39;m just not 100% sure about the whole PIP scene. Our service was extremely critical and we were extremely understaffed. So I don&#39;t think it applied to anyone in our org but I know of other teams who would have no issues in taking in a fresh college grad, making them do work for 6-12 months and then just randomly putting them on PIP. Sad but I&#39;ve seen it happen a few times in my time there.I&#39;m glad I got the Amazon stamp on my resume and left. When I left, more than half my team and my manager quit around the same time too. It was definitely a wild experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I interviewed with Amazon and Facebook in the Spring/Summer of 2020. The difference was night and day. Amazon felt like I was part of a huge cattle herd. The recruiter contacted me and told me they needed to hire a bunch of people in my area. I was immediately given a course of study, link to common LeetCode questions and told I had a couple of weeks. That fine. I enjoy solving puzzles. Facebook felt VERY different. The recruiter had a conversation about career goals, told me how wonderful it is to work at FB, and then quizzed me on some basic CS concepts. The ensuing rounds for each got even more divergent. The Facebook interviewers constantly made me feel like my success was a &#34;win&#34; for them. It felt like a team! Amazon felt like they were waiting for me to screw up so they could disqualify me. In the end, I dropped out of Amazon because it felt disgusting. And I could tell, if this is how they bring me in, I can&#39;t see any reason why it&#39;ll magically get any better once I was &#34;in&#34;.My feeling on those who use LeetCode as some sort of indicator. Great. You&#39;ve found the people that do the brain-teaser puzzles at Cracker-Barrel. I&#39;m one of those people. Some of the best people I&#39;ve worked with, would fail those tests immediately... yet, they&#39;ve built scalable, performant enterprise software. I now see those tests as nothing more than a way to reduce the number of applicants."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at a company that hired several people out of Amazon. Amazon is a big company, so there is significant variation from team to team.However, several of the ex-Amazon employees were clearly scarred from their time working at Amazon. Whenever something went wrong (delays, outages, missed deadlines) one of them went so far as to spend hours or days preparing documents showing how it was actually someone else&#39;s fault, not his, because he thought it was necessary to avoid being fired. He said his experience at Amazon was basically one large game of &#34;not it&#34; whenever it came time to assign blame for the latest issue, and everyone had to become very good at blaming someone else. The worst was when he was actual at fault for something, because he would panic and scramble to distract from the issue he caused by raising concerns about everyone else around him. Easily the most toxic person I&#39;ve worked with in the past few years.On the other hand, I&#39;ve known other ex-Amazon people who said their work was nothing like this, so YMMV"</p>

In practice, using IIAB goes a little something like this:   1. find device (the more storage the better)
   2. install free software on device using IIAB scripts
   3. download free content (various content packs)
   4. deploy device anywhere in the world to enjoy
      all the FOSS and free content on local network

The IIAB scripts make installation and download setup fully automatable (battle-tested Ansible scripts https://github.com/iiab/iiab/tree/master/roles ), which is exciting because you can provision &#34;learning server&#34; devices very easily."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This really deserves more love.Who remembers Ken Thompson&#39;s &#34;Reflections on Trusting Trust&#34;?The norm today is auto-updating, pre-built software.This places a ton of trust in the publisher. Even for open-source, well-vetted software, we all collectively cross our fingers and hope that whoever is building these binaries and running the servers that disseminate them, is honest and good at security.So far this has mostly worked out due to altruism (for open source maintainers) and self interest (companies do not want to attack their own users). But the failure modes are very serious.I predict that everyone&#39;s imagination on this topic will expand once there&#39;s a big enough incident in the news. Say some package manager gets compromised, nobody finds out, and 6mo later every computer on earth running `postgres:latest` from docker hub gets ransomwared.There are only two ways around this:- Build from source. This will always be a deeply niche thing to do. It&#39;s slow, inconvenient, and inaccessible except to nerds.- Reproducible builds.Reproducible builds are way more important than is currently widely appreciated.I&#39;m grateful to the nixos team for being beating a trail thru the jungle here. Retrofitting reproducibility onto a big software project that grew without it, is hard work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a big deal. Congratulations to all involved.In Software, complexity naturally increases over time and dependencies and interactions between components become impossible to reason about. Eventually this complexity causes the Software to collapse under its own weight.Truly reproducible builds (such as NixOS and Nixpkgs) provides us with islands of &#34;determinism&#34; which can be taken as true invariants. This enables us to build more Systems and Software on top of deterministic foundations that can be reproduced by others.This reproducibility also enables powerful things like decentralized / distributed trust. Different third-parties can build the same software and compare the results. If they differ, it could indicate one of the sources has been compromised. See Trustix https://github.com/tweag/trustix"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t see a single comment doubting the value of reproducibility, so I&#39;ll be the resident skeptic :)I think build reproducibility is a cargo cult. The website says reproducibility can reduce the risk of developers being threatened or bribed to backdoor their software, but that is just ridiculous. Developers have a perfect method for making their own software malicious: bugdoors. A bugdoor (bug + backdoor) is a deliberately introduced &#34;vulnerability&#34; that the vendor can &#34;exploit&#34; when they want backdoor access. If the bug is ever discovered you simply issue a patch and say it was a mistake, it&#39;s perfectly deniable. It&#39;s not unusual for major vendors to patch critical vulnerabilities every month, there is zero penalty for doing this.The existence of bugdoors means you have to trust the vendor who provided the source code, there is no way around this.You have to trust the developer, but in theory, reproducible builds could be used to convince yourself their build server hasn&#39;t been hacked. This isn&#39;t really necessary or useful, you can already produce a trustworthy binary by just building the source code yourself. You still have to trust the vendor to keep hackers off everything else though!Okay, but building software is tedious, and for some reason you are particularly concerned about build servers being hacked. Perhaps you will nominate a dozen different organization that will all build the code, and make this a consensus system. If they all agree, then you can be sure enough the binaries were built with a trustworthy toolchain. A modest improvement in theory, but that introduces a whole bunch of new crazy problems.You can&#39;t just pick one or two consensus servers, because then an attacker can stop you getting updates by compromising any one of them. You will have to do something like choose a lot of servers, and only require 51% to agree.Now, imagine a contentious update like a adopting a cryptocurrency fork, or switching to systemd (haha). If the server operators rebel, they can effectively veto a change the vendor wants to make. Perhaps vendors will implement a killswitch that allows them to have the final say, or perhaps they operate all the consensus build servers themselves.The problem is now you&#39;ve either just replaced build servers with killswitches, or just replicated the same potentially-compromised buildserver.I wrote a blog post about this a while ago, although I should update it at some point.https://blog.cmpxchg8b.com/2020/07/you-dont-need-reproducibl..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think a lot of the replies in the thread so far have focused on tech (understandably, this is HN after all) but that&#39;s missing something obvious - the 4 day week would apply to everyone.In tech it&#39;s very likely someone going from 5 days to 4 days could still achieve the same amount of actual work. As other commenters have said, many tech workers don&#39;t do productive work all the time they&#39;re present. Retail workers, factory workers, people who fill in the holes in roads, telephone support people, etc aren&#39;t contending with pointless meetings and busy work though. They can&#39;t do 40 hours of work in 32 hours by removing some of the hours they&#39;re not really working. What they do doesn&#39;t compress like that.Consequently looking at this from the context of tech workers is far less interesting. The Japanese government isn&#39;t saying &#34;Let&#39;s get rid of pointless meetings and busy work!&#34; In tech removing the pointless nonsense isn&#39;t actually reducing the amount of real work people do. Instead, Japan is saying &#34;Our country is wealthy enough and advanced enough that our people can actually do less work.&#34; That&#39;s fascinating.If you see this as &#34;removing the wasteful time spent on things that aren&#39;t useful like meetinga&#34; then you&#39;ve missed the point. It is that, but it&#39;s much, much more than that too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s an open secret at least in the tech world that absolutely no one is putting in a productive 40 hours of work a week. This was true well before the pandemic and is more pronounced than ever now. Everyone needs to be &#34;present&#34; for 8 hours a day 5 days a week, but spends their time in pointless meetings, preparing documents and powerpoints that no one will read,  faux social/teambuilding events, hour long lunches, goofing off on the internet, all to maintain the pretense of office culture.Companies that shuffle things up to prioritize productivity over simply showing up will be set to succeed over the next generation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The social contract in Japan was that you’d give your life to your employer in exchange for a fair wage and stable employment until you retired. Neither of those things are true now. Wages are low and companies either ignore their legal obligations or hire people as contractors, who have less rights  than full time “employees”.Now, many people, especially women* and young people are finding that it’s possible to run a small business for 3-4 days a week and make more money than an entry or even mid-level full time office job.So, I think Japan finally enforcing rules against abusive behavior at the workplace and pushing for a 4-day week, if it really happens, is a reflection of where society is at right now.*Women have a low wage ceiling because they are expected to quit and have children at any time."</p>

So it can be hard or unnatural to express something like &#34;subgroup&#34;. I don&#39;t know if Lean fares better in that respect. Coq documentation is also IMHO almost impossible to understand unless you&#39;re already very deeply knowledgeable about the system.We will probably still need some more iterations, to get more user friendly assistants with better documentation and to get adequate teaching resources etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Things I have learned about SSDs:If you want to go fast &amp; save NAND lifetime, use append-only log structures.If you want to go even faster &amp; save even more NAND lifetime, batch your writes in software (i.e. some ring buffer with natural back-pressure mechanism) and then serialize them with a single writer into an append-only log structure. Many newer devices have something like this at the hardware level, but your block size is still a constraint when working in hardware. If you batch in software, you can hypothetically write multiple logical business transactions per block I/O. When you physical block size is 4k and your logical transactions are averaging 512b of data, you would be leaving a lot of throughput on the table.Going down 1 level of abstraction seems important if you want to extract the most performance from an SSD. Unsurprisingly, the above ideas also make ordinary magnetic disk drives more performant &amp; potentially last longer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This page tells me a lot about SSDs, but it doesn&#39;t tell me why I need to know these things.  It doesn&#39;t really give me any indication about how I should change my behavior if I know that I&#39;ll be running on SSD vs spinning disk.I&#39;ve always been told, &#34;just treat SSDs like slow, permanent memory&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My opinion is probably... not technically correct... until you have to deal with drive reliability and write guarantees, but I don&#39;t think programmers actually have to know anything about SSDs in the same way that developers had to know particular things about HDDs.This is out of pure speculation, but there had to be a period of time during the mass transition to SSDs that engineers said, OK, how do we get the hardware to be compatible with software that is, for the most part, expecting that hard disk drives are being used, and just behave like really fast HDDs.So, there&#39;s almost certainly some non-zero amount of code out there in the wild that is or was doing some very specific write optimized routine that one day was just performing 10 to 100 times faster, and maybe just because of the nature of software is still out there today doing that same routine.I don&#39;t know what that would look like, but my guess would be that it would have something to do with average sized write caches, and those caches look entirely different today or something.And today, there&#39;s probably some SSD specific code doing something out there now, too."</p>

There seemed to be an overwhelming amount of evidence over the last year that this repurposed drug is effective at treating Covid during a variety of stages (preventative, first positive test, ICU admittance, and even long haul). But since there hadn&#39;t been a randomized trial the drug had, not only been dismissed, but heavily censored over social media.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is obvious that we need better legislation to deal with all the new possibilities that technologies have opened.The installation of this app, even done with good intent, open a lot of questions on what should be possible or not to be done by government and corporations.When you get a device with pre-installed, uninstallable, or auto-installed apps. What are the rules?&gt; &#34;By enabling this service, you can be quickly notified if you’ve likely been exposed to the virus by another MassNotify user, allowing you to reduce risk to your loved ones, seek medical attention, and slow the spread in your community.&#34;In this case it seems that the same goal could have been better achieved by SMS that do not depend on the brand of your phone. The dependency on proprietary app stores and OSs seems a risk for the continuation of a free and reliable communications.The only thing that is impossible to achieve without an app is to allow the user to select contacts to whom send a notification. Corporations like Google, and Apple know the list of all your contacts. So, it seems that the intention of the app is to reduce friction and send notifications as easy and effortlessly as possible to avoid that procrastination causes people to delay the warning.But, instead of the silent install the government could have spend money in advertisement campaigns to assure a correct amount of installations. It costs money, but, people pay taxes so the government can engage on this type of initiative at a scale. This could have been a very good alternative, even if it means increasing the budged. Medical emergencies are worth the investing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fellow humans, there are alternatives! Your neck need not be under FAANG&#39;s boot! You don&#39;t even need to give up any functionality:CalyxOS: https://calyxos.org/
Privacy-respecting Android distribution that replaces Google spyware with MicroG, so you can have your cake and eat it too. Most everything will work as you&#39;re used to, but it does still talk to Google to make that happen.GrapheneOS: https://grapheneos.org/
Very much like Calyx, but extra-hardened and with no MicroG. No involvement with Google at all.LineageOS: https://lineageos.org/
The successor to CyanogenMod, will work with many different phones. More privacy and control than stock Android.There are also many others: Sailfish, Replicant, eHardware-wise: CalyxOS and GrapheneOS run best on Pixel 3, 3a, 3XL, 4, 4a, 4XL, 5. The path of least resistance is to get one of these phones and run CalyxOS (if there is an app you need to use that needs Google services like Firebase Cloud Messaging...note that many that can use FCM will run fine without), otherwise run GrapheneOS.You can also buy a Librem 5 https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/
If privacy and security and hacking are really important to you.Or a pinephone: https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Disclaimer: I work at Microsoft, but not on Windows (and I deal with a SaaS at MSFT). I am a FreeBSD committer and help maintain FreeBSD&#39;s GNOME packages and (very recently) the graphics drivers.The reason why Windows is full of UI inconsistencies is (largely) because of one thing: backwards compatibility.While backwards compatibility has it&#39;s perks, it also means having lots of old code in Windows that can&#39;t be touched very easily without breaking compatibility, And that means many old UI elements may stay, that&#39;s a side effect.While desktop Linux/BSD isn&#39;t exactly well known for it&#39;s UIs, I found GNOME 3/40 to be more consistent UI-wise than Windows 10, being a user of GNOME 3 on FreeBSD at home (which I am typing this comment from), and helping port GNOME 40, while (unsurprisingly) using Windows 10 at $DAYJOB.But then GNOME, KDE, Apple, et al. is more willing to break things than Windows is. They aren&#39;t as bound to legacy compatibility, so old UI elements can be shed easily."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the Run dialog and the folder properties menu and others that have been untouched since the early days. Their utility has been proven and so much muscle memory has been built up. I can not possibly imagine a revision that could be done to them that would have more benefits than simply leaving them be.All of the Fluent/Metro designs have made things markedly worse. For example, check out the Metro control panel widget for selecting a default program for a file extension. It&#39;s a list view with 5 file extensions visible at a time, with no search. That&#39;s what I think of when I hear about a Windows UI update, and I&#39;d love to be proven wrong."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This issue is way overblown here on HN.In day-to-day usage, I have rarely been annoyed by these &#34;inconsistencies&#34;.The best example to illustrate this article is: Installing a driver with the Windows XP layer. That&#39;s probably something that will only happen to people installing very old hardware with drivers from over 10 years ago. I consider that a backward compatibility win: It is great that it even works in Windows 10."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What a fascinating case. There are so many details in such a short articles that is each worth its own discussion!Let’s start with my personally theory that hopefully won’t color all of the conversation about the individual points. This guy pissed off some people and those people are using their petty power to make his life hell. It’s like the 10’s of thousands of people jaywalking without issue and then the homeless guy that gets arrested for jaw walking. We all know that’s not why he was arrested but the law is clear, he was breaking the law, and they enforced it. So the individual incident dots it’s I’s and crosses it’s t’s as long as you don’t bring up the dreaded ‘uneven enforcement’ issue which is at the heart of everything wrong with the law in America. I have no evidence for the theory but it makes sense with the multiple issues involving this guy mentioned in such a short article.Next interesting point. Is giving a speech about how to treat a broken bone considered ‘practicing medicine’? Who gets to decide the answer. Is a PHD candidate writing an exploration of the efficacy of the various methods for treating a migraine practicing medicine? What if he’s selling copies of his paper on the checkout counter at the drug store? I use medicine instead of engineering because I think it’s easier to discuss but the point should hold the same regardless of which licensed profession we are discussing.Shit I have to run but hope to return to this conversation to discuss the other fun questions raised."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Texas may do a lot of crazy things when it comes to state government, but one thing I think we definitely got right is the Texas Sunset Commission (https://www.sunset.texas.gov/). Basically, all boards set up by the state government are automatically abolished every 10 years I believe unless the state legislature passes a law to continue the board.  So every 10 years the Sunset Commission evaluates agencies/boards about to expire and gives recommendations on if they should be merged, eliminated, etc.The whole idea is to prevent these little long-running fiefdoms from continuing indefinitely, where board members just become more concerned about their own power than their stated purpose.People being people it&#39;s not perfect, but it does go a long way to cut down on this type of abuse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Of course it&#39;s corporate corruption of government that is driving this case.&#34;he is an engineer at heart and speaks up when he sees people make what he believes to be engineering mistakes. He has written letters to state and county governments and testified before a county commission. But Wayne’s troubles began when he when he agreed to help his son, Kyle, a North Carolina attorney, with a case about a piping system that allegedly flooded a few local homes&#34;If he were telling lies, he would be legally accountable to the individuals or companies that his lies harmed.  That would probably be an easy case to bring against him to stop him from telling lies.  But this approach of trying to silence him on grounds of not technically being an engineer shows plainly that he is telling enough truth that he wouldn&#39;t be accountable for lying and causing harm.Cases like this are probably common, although the methods of silencing vary from situation to situation.  While the US may not be as corrupt as many other countries, it still has a significant amount which ultimately harms the general public and certainly harms the few individuals that find themselves on the wrong side of a corrupt authority."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ve noticed that in the time since I was a kid, the focus of public school has shifted from about the 40th percentile student to the 5th percentile student. In my school, the entire focus of the operation was the decent student... the one who showed up, put in a decent effort, did at least three quarters of their homework. The school had tremendous resources for these kids to go to college, and the very best colleges for the very top students. There was honors, accelerated, standard, and remedial and the kids who were really trying would never be sent to remedial because that’s where the true losers were sent (in a different building) where they couldn’t disrupt anyone else’s learning. Nobody cared what happened to those kids including in many cases their own parents.Now in my kids school I see way too much focus on this segment, which is by its nature low ROI — the number of teacher years it takes to turn one of those kids into someone worthwhile is like 10x the amount it takes to turn an average bright kid into a future surgeon or researcher."</p>

Web sites should start as largely static HTML documents that you read, and then if they need to use JS then they should be required to ask permission to do so, the same way any other executable code is managed in any other computing environment.

I think about these special industrial monsters a lot when I read about semi fabs.In WW2 after examining the components from aircraft kills, german wing spars would often survive. It was discovered that Germany used unique forged alloy wing spars to achieve their excellent aircraft performance, perplexing allied engineers. These wing spars&#39; strength and weight is critical to the structural properties of modern air frames. Without them, jet air craft like the f-15 would have been impossible.Machining these advanced alloy parts proved difficult, expensive, error prone, and impossible to manufacture but a die forged alloy wing spar was stronger, lighter, cheaper and beyond the industrial capability of every allied nation. We did not have the metallurgical technology to create such a large forged alloy wing spar in 1945.After the war, the US and Soviets recovered designs for the extremely large press assemblies required for advanced air frames. In the 1950s, a huge national program was geared up to create absolutely massive Heavy Press machines. The Soviets had a massive 30,000lb press for these parts, and we created a couple of monstrous 50,000lb machines[1] that are still in operation today. These things are older than we are and still out there cranking out air frame parts today for modern air frames in 2021.Without this kind of national investment in this kind of unique manufacturing, we would be unable to fly without importing 747 parts from wherever they could be created.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_Press_Program

Then I remembered that I was at a famous boarding school for five years, the most miserable years of my life. Thirty years later I’m still coping with the aftereffects. I think of that place as a form of institutionalised child abuse, and frankly if someone pipebombed it, I would not shed a tear.One simple thing: it wasn’t authoritarian adults or teachers. If anything, they were AWOL. It was the students that really made each other’s life hell. Of course, we were teenagers. Much later, I stopped blaming the individuals and started blaming the institution.Here’s a tiny anecdote. One guy, who I think was genuinely evil, took psychology as a minor subject. As an experiment, he decided to drive another, younger, vulnerable pupil mad. Gaslighting him, messing with his head, that kind of stuff. And he succeeded!"</p>

Kids forced to sit in corners for days at a time, ambulances not being called for kids who had very seriously self-harmed, strip searches (administered by other kids), physical restraints... I could go on. The place had a cult-like atmosphere that was centered on the headmaster and his weird homegrown therapeutic method.I had nightmares for years afterwards and still haven’t fully come to grips with what happened there."</p>

You get lots of BAT and the marketing copy hypes it up immensely without mentioning, anywhere, that you need to provide your SSN and Driver&#39;s License to a third-party (Uphold) if you actually, you know, want to cash out.This seems particularly irritating because, let&#39;s say you set your browser to show you the max amount of ads for a while. You saved up for a few months, decided you had enough, tried to cash out only to discover that slap in your face that they never mentioned. Of course this benefits them, but the fact that the browser puts you in the situation of giving up your privacy to receive money is ridiculous for a &#34;privacy&#34; browser."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Amateur mistake, compared to my professional mistakes.I once wrote a bot that sent email within the company (100K+ employees). I kick-started the bot on a server remotely and only then discovered it&#39;s an endless loop. It required server admin rights to stop it, which I did not have.I couldn&#39;t immediately reach server admins so had to physically drive there. An hour or so later somebody helped me kill the process.The emails already sent could not be cleared out server-side, which meant that recipients had freezing email clients for over a week, unable to handle the volume, a typical 300K new emails per recipient. They had to Ctrl+A and Delete 100 emails, do this for the next 100, and so on, whilst not deleting real and useful emails.I pretty much destroyed email for those people.I don&#39;t just destroy things at scale though, also at home. Around the time we had our first home broadband internet connection, I set up a web server and just kept my PC running. Unknown to me, the web server software included an email server with open relay enabled by default.About 3 days later, my dad complained about the internet connection not working. The IPS detected the issue (millions of emails sent out via my home server) and gave us a red card, fully shutting us down, permanently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Aww I’m feeling bad for the poor engineer who is saying “crap” a thousand times now, or is blissfully unaware that their day is about to get much worse.Once during a system upgrade we ran some scripts and they triggered emails to about 8,000 people before we realized it (would’ve been 150k people otherwise). The next day was all about clean up, sending an apology email etc.My mother had visited the next day and asked why I wasn’t hanging out and my son (6 at the time) said, totally unphased, “oh he can’t come now because he’s saying sorry to 8,000 people”Hope you get through it!

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I joined, I was perplexed by this way of operating meetings. It surprised me greatly that people wouldn&#39;t want to read the doc at ahead, give it time for thinking and researching, and then come to the table feeling prepare to contribute to the best if your ability.Now, I understand and deeply appreciate this method. I believe it provides lots of benefits. It drives towards better docs that can be understood quickly by non-experts. When there are just a few minutes to review the doc, we don&#39;t have time to go digging for information on our own - the critical information must be provided in the material given. There will also be SMEs in the room who can clarify any shortcomings here. Because the audience of the docs is non-SMEs, it drives towards inclusion of other teams. From this, you get more diverse viewpoints, considerations, and experience. It also contributes towards cross-team awareness and education. It makes it much easier to participate as a contributor to the meeting while simultaneously less impactful when you don&#39;t. It let&#39;s us timebox our attention span - you won&#39;t accidentally spend hours rabbit-holing into a doc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazonion here. The purpose of doc writing is for the author to dump their ideas and convey the critical pieces of information. It lets the reader consume the information at their pace, and re-read even after the meeting. The document starts the conversation and let’s the reader understand the problem, why it’s important, what things we have or have not considered, what trade offs have been made, and how we arrived at the conclusion or solution.There are many, many things Amazon does not get right. The document writing culture is probably one of our not so secret, “secret weapons”.At many companies I worked at, we had a PowerPoint or presentation driven culture. And the purpose of those meetings is to listen to the presenter, at the presenters pace. The meeting becomes about the presenter and what they think is important, as opposed to being about the reader. In presentation driven meetings, the presenter talks and questions actually distract from the presentation - often times presenters will bluntly ask for questions to be saved to the end.My own team has a strong culture of getting engineers to write, and help them write well. It’s not about perfect English, but it is about touching on the key points and letting readers comment and ask questions.Meetings without documents often go completely off the rails - especially because if the kinds of problems we’re solving. Without focus, meetings delve into tangents and branches off of those tangents. To be fair - this still happens if the document hasn’t been adequately prepared, but often because you find the document owner hasn’t fully thought through the problem or fully did their homework."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having witnessed this through a flood of incoming ex-Amazon folks I agree that it brings so much more content and focus on a meeting. It is amazing. The silence, the reading, the staying on topic (apart from tangents that sometimes need to be brought up, but are vulnerable to being just dismissed with the power of The Document) all helps to get the attention and feedback you need.The thing is though, that while the article mentions briefly challenges with the writing, it does not shine light on the hours and hours or reviews, rewrites and re-reviews when preparing the document. The endless and often times pointless arguments and bad blood between people on how to write a sentence so that it would be &#34;correct&#34; and every word and number counts. Arguments if a given word should be &#34;benefit&#34; or &#34;impact&#34;. If the word should be &#34;system&#34; or &#34;solution&#34;. It does not feel productive and I am not sure if counting the hours spent would actually add up classical &#34;hours wasted&#34; in a typical 10 person &#34;pointless meeting&#34;. And also when usually a piece of writing has some soul of the writer, in these documents they end up being soulless, blank format robotic texts only aiming to convincing the reader to fund your project or sell your idea over others. And that leads to quite an Amazonian culture that is a subject of many different articles.I just felt there was something omitted by OP. So while it has benefits, it does have a cost associated."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Two interesting takeaways:&gt; This is the beautiful thing about having a company that isn&#39;t on the stock market. Imagine you have a company that goes slower and slower every quarter, and then you confront the shareholders with the statement, that the way to solve it, is to do absolutely no new features for a quarter or two, refactor the code, learn new methodologies etc. I doubt that the shareholders would allow that. Luckily, we don&#39;t have any shareholders, and we understand the vital importance of this investment in the long run. Not only in the project, but also in our skill and knowledge, so we do better next time.This is reassuring the notion of what I think actually matters, what the real essence is of developing a product, may that be a piece of art and entertainment (like here) or a productivity tool etc.There are creators and there are consumers. We split them up by developers, designers, domain experts and so on, but what matters is that all the other participants, especially those who can exert power traditionally are not part of the essence and if not being careful and responsible, can easily add complexity and limitations that are entirely accidental and can even be harmful.This reminds me of the agile manifesto, modern UX approaches and other processes that are driven by creators, but are often and very unfortunately being bent over backwards to fit into hierarchical power structures.&gt; TDD actually is the constant fast swithing between extending the tests and making them pass continously. So as you write tests, you write code to satisfy them basically at the same time. This allows you to instantly test what you write, and mainly use tests as specifiation of what the code should acctually do, which guides the thought process to make you think about where you are headed to, and to write code that is more structured and testable from the very beginning.The important notion here is that TDD is not about tests and correctness, but about development. It continuously checks assumptions and explores the surrounding code, state and data until a sufficient solution is found.If we squint a little we can see how closely related TDD with REPL Driven Development is. In essence it is the same thing and even has similar results, where the tests or REPL code can be left as an artifact for further, likely historical understanding.We know now that neither is sufficient for a high degree of correctness, but they are certainly useful for understanding and development."</p>

But I don&#39;t know many good programmers that truly stick to the dogma after the honeymoon period. It becomes just another tool in your toolset.Uncle bob is a salesman, not a &#34;craftsman&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I personally have problems with doors, and stuff that should be locked. I can never be sure I locked properly.Totally did backtrack unreasonable distances just to check if I had closed the door.It&#39;s all fine when it&#39;s my door. Worst case scenario, I get robbed.However it&#39;s more of a problem when it&#39;s someone else&#39;s door. Worst case scenario, they get robbed, and that&#39;s a different story. Or pets get out...Obviously I can&#39;t take the door on my front seat... So my solution is to take a picture of me trying to open the door, a kind of proof that it&#39;s closed.And, would you know it, it works!

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember a panel on a news program years ago where the one guest was a psychologist who was treating &#34;untreatable&#34; drug addicts by getting them &#34;hooked&#34; on running or weightlifting or martial arts.  They would stop drugs but would instead be doing martial arts for hours a day or running 20 miles every morning.  Then he would start treating the addiction personality and causes, but in many cases the patients would just stop coming and live three or more hours of every day in the gym.The other guests were various degrees of horrified.His patients went from literally living on the street as heroin addicts to doing 3 hour gym sessions and holding down a job; and his peers thought he shouldn&#39;t be allowed to practice.Recently I was reading a book on ADHD and the author was quite adamant that you could only be diagnosed with ADHD if your life was worse than  &#34;the norm&#34;.  In this view, if you have symptoms of ADHD but can, for instance, hold down a good job then by definition you don&#39;t have ADHD.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve read most of Scott&#39;s blog posts and he rarely mentions OCD and when he does it tends to be &#34;this is what I think people with OCD experience&#34; and not &#34;this is what my patients have told me&#34; which leads me to believe that he is not an expert in OCD.I have OCD and it&#39;s ruined my life in ways that are hard to articulate. Which is why I can point out two good reasons why what&#39;s being described might not be a good idea. First, giving into compulsions just legitimizes them and reinforces the patterns that are central to OCD and can ultimately make things worse. Secondly, OCD has a habit of changing how it manifests. Sure, maybe the woman is no longer bothered by the hairdryer, but what happens when it becomes changes to worrying if the oven is on? She&#39;ll be right back where she started.I doubt that the anecdote actually happened as described. It&#39;s way too contrived, simplistic and borders on &#34;Psychiatrists hate her! Cure your OCD with this one simple trick!&#34;. Realistically, OCD is incredibly insidious and if it were that simple to cure then nobody would have OCD. What&#39;s described is, at best, a short-term fix and half the psychiatrists likely knew that such things rarely stick.I&#39;ve had the same thing happen to me more times than I can count. I think I found the silver bullet, a way to permanently defeat my obsessive thoughts. If I&#39;m lucky then it&#39;ll last a week before my OCD comes back in full force. But the truth is that you cannot directly fight OCD, it&#39;s like squeezing dough. When you clamp down in one spot, it just squirts out somewhere else. There&#39;s a quote that I think describes it perfectly &#34;To hate me is to give me breath, to fight me is to give me strength&#34;. Fighting OCD or giving into its demands is just falling into its traps. You only truly win when you reach a point where you don&#39;t respond to it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I appeciate how Schmidhuber puts focus on non-US-centric history of Deep Learning and modern AI.He sometimes overdoes these. Even when something is not related to Deep Learning and modern AI. He tries to push very narrow and one-sided views without much room for nuance.For example- &#34;Turing used his (quite inefficient) model only to rephrase the results of Gödel and Church on the limits of computability.&#34;He is trying to say that Turing did nothing new, his work is a mere extension of Godel&#39;s (!), and he only accounted for practical computational reality. That is not true.He goes on further by saying, &#34;Later, however, the simplicity of these machines made them a convenient tool for theoretical studies of complexity.&#34; Like, Turing and Church&#39;s work was only good for that. I digress. I believe that Turing&#39;s work is more seminal and paved the way for modern general computers.Another bit here says &#34;The formal models of Gödel (1931-34), Church (1935), Turing (1936), and Post (1936) were theoretical pen &amp; paper constructs that cannot directly serve as a foundation for practical computers.&#34;It is putting the works of Turing, Post, Church, and Godel all together. Like they are the same. I see the logic as they are all impractical, but they are different levels of impractical. Putting them all under one bracket like that makes no sense.I respect Schmidhuber a lot, but some of his behaviour is borderline childish which are more pronounced in his claims about AI history. You should be skeptical about what he says (and what anyone says).Despite all this, I did not know many things written in this article. I learned a lot and had fun reading it.I first read about Zuse in Isaacson&#39;s Innovators book. Did not know that he used a high-level language for a chess program. Fascinating. He is very underrated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How can you leave out von Neumann from such a list?Also, I feel like Schmidhuber tends to be German-speaking-centric.And overall, acknowledging that this is his signature shtick and it&#39;s good to have a voice like this too, he does a lot of anachronistic reinterpretations of early discoveries in light of later results. It streamlines the story as if it was always headed towards the today, culling aspects that didn&#39;t pan out or magnifying aspects that were at the time more minor and not considered the central issue or angle."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve seen a lot of these children&#39;s books about technical topics. Is there any record of an actual child reading any of them? And, as children do with good books: reading them more than once? (Excluding children in the author&#39;s family.)I have read about 10 of these &#34;children&#39;s books about programming&#34; and while I enjoy them myself, I find that they lack most of the things that grab children&#39;s attention, such as repetition and visual-only sub-plots.This is not to criticize the use of an illustrated fable as a storytelling device for adults: They&#39;re great! It&#39;s just sad that we have to frame an illustrated fable as &#34;for children&#34; in order for it to be accepted. I think it says something about how content dictates and narrows the expected presentation format, sometimes to the detriment of clear communication."</p>

Officials have not said who put the language in the Senate budget document, only that they learned of it for the first time last week,&#34; the Akron Beacon Journal wrote on June 13.&#34;How did we end up with such a gross lack of accountability?

The slowest service tier delivers 300Mbps symmetrical speeds for $55/month. The municipal network has resulted in more businesses choosing to locate in Fairlawn, and at least 700 jobs can be directly attributed to the network. In recent subscriber surveys, 95 percent of respondents rated FairlawnGig&#39;s service as &#34;very good to excellent,&#34; with some customer testimonials referring to the network as &#34;a life saver&#34; throughout the pandemic.From the article.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I would caution against just jumping into this and trying to be a real ISP if your experience is in software development, sysadmin stuff, or something kind of tech industry adjacent but you&#39;ve never worked for an ISP in a NOC environment, as a junior network engineer or similar for somebody else&#39;s medium to large sized ISP. There&#39;s a lot of missteps that can be made without experience.In general I would recommend thinking of starting a small ISP as a depth and breadth of knowledge base you need to develop, similar to how an apprentice electrician is expected to work under some more senior/experienced persons in their field for a number of years before being able to operate independently.I do not want to discourage anyone but I&#39;ve seen a myriad of &#39;oh my god why did they do that&#39; small WISPs with anywhere from 50 to 1500 customers. Going down the wrong network architecture/topology/business plan path can be very costly later on if you&#39;re 100% learning as you go.Overall I think a site like this is a great idea, but the sheer scope of things that would need to be written down in a wiki-like format for everything to start your own ISP, and what systems/subsystems/technologies you will want to be familiar with, could fill thousands of pages if printed in book form. It&#39;s a gargantuan task to make a website that has everything needed to start an ISP from scratch, assuming the reader hasn&#39;t been involved in somebody else&#39;s ISP operations first."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I thought this was going to be a game reliving my experience as the System Administrator at our local dialup internet service back in the 1990s. I wasn&#39;t there at the start, but I ran the thing for 2 years, serving about 200 customers. I wrote the &#34;Internet Installation&#34; floppy disks that people used to install networking on Windows 3.1, and configured dialup icons on their desktop. I was the ONLY technical support they had.I learned that people don&#39;t use the same words we technical folks do, so if you get a support call and ask &#34;Have you installed anything?&#34; the answer they give is no, but, if you ask &#34;do you have any new programs or stuff&#34;, the answer will be yes.Why? - My theory is that they either didn&#39;t know what &#34;installing&#34; was (nobody opened up the computer to put something in), or they themselves didn&#39;t do it.You have to have a very strong ability to route around the person on the other end of the phones preconceptions of the world and get the right answers anyway.If you&#39;re going to be an ISP, you&#39;re going to be on call 24/7/365, and you&#39;re going to see weird shit. More than once we had to deal with people wanting to post adult content for money.... and this was back in the days of dialup.

If we think in terms of code points (Rust&#39;s native char type actually provides here a slightly different thing, a Unicode Scalar Value, which certain types of code point are not, but close enough) clearly a code point isn&#39;t made out of several code points, so we needed a different word.I like squiggle, if you&#39;re a text rendering engine you might want to use &#34;glyph&#34; although you might already need that word for something else.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I see a lot of people in the comments describe triplebyte as a “market leader” and discuss how good they are. I can’t believe how gullible everyone is especially on a startup forum. Let me spell it out to y’all, nobody pivots and changes their entire business model if they are crushing it. So the implication is that triplebyte are not crushing it. So, this probably has gone the same way as lots of other tech startups. They’ve raised a bunch of money spent it all on ads , distorted the market for a while (usually just the advertising market) and now are on the way out. No matter what fluff or spin they put on it, that’s what’s happening."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"By far the most exciting thing about this announcement is this feature: &#34;Detailed information on what a recruiter did with your application.&#34;I&#39;ve been wishing for something like this for years. Especially for early-career engineers or people from non-traditional backgrounds, this is insanely valuable because it helps you to know avoid wasting time on applications that will never go anywhere; avoid typing in your resume, line by line, into another form after already submitting your pdf. Avoid writing a cover letter to a job that&#39;s already been filled. Avoid applying to a posting that&#39;s really just out there for a company to &#34;gauge&#34; interest, not for filling a real role.If an application is rejected, fine. But getting a follow-up request 7 months after submitting a resume into a black hole is ridiculous, and I think any system that decreases the information asymmetry between the applicant and the employer that allows people to intelligently approach their career search is going to be tapping into something truly valuable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A benefit of Triplebyte to big enterprises not mentioned in Triplebyte’s discussion here: acting as engineering assessment proxy for engineering hiring managers stuck with pathologically risk averse enterprise HR departments.Often enterprise HR is paranoid of honestly evaluating anyone for anything, to the point that many HR teams tell one another and engineering hiring managers that it’s “illegal” to assess candidate abilities on the way in the door, at all.If you think about joining a dev team where no one checked if any candidate could FizzBuzz, you can imagine the workplace environment that can end up with.Triplebyte is able to provide engineering managers with a stack of pre-vetted resumes so an enterprise can interview by its lowest common denominator HR policies, while still having a prayer a team will at least be made of candidates who can code.The value of this to an enterprise stuck in this position is hard to overstate.Hopefully along with expanding the talent pool per this post, Triplebyte can figure out a way to get well paid for this ability to help land actual coders on actual dev teams despite enterprise HR.The need for this is huge.// I see a comment below from a Triplebyte PM about score matching: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27542621 … That would be slick: land candidates that genuinely raise the bar, but aren’t so far ahead as to be speaking a foreign language to the team.  Of course, this would require also assessing the target team, and oops, we’re right back up against that HR policy…"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a former felon, I&#39;ve learned first-hand the fallout from being named in crime stories. The AP has it right in that a lot of it isn&#39;t realized by readers or society.Upon being charged with crimes, I had to make my way through the court system. As a consequence of my actions, the courts punished me. Once I had showed that I was not a serial offender but instead someone who had moments of weakness, lost identity, and subsequently poor judgement, the courts let me go.Once I paid my debts to the court — figuratively and literally — I was free to live my life without the government watching over my shoulder or further being a burden to my future. My dealings with them had a fixed amount of time attached to it. Once that time limit expired, I was free.Society was far less kind, and hardly as forgiving.No, I&#39;m not talking about employment — I am and always have been very gainfully employed. No, I&#39;m not talking about renting an apartment, or getting a loan, or opening a bank account.I&#39;m talking about new acquaintances.As we have seen over the past 5 years, in the minds of many a website is a single source of truth. To a large number of people, simply having a website is enough to give confidence to the reader that what&#39;s written is an absolute and authoritative source. It is only correct, completely unbiased, and contains 100% factual sourcing.When there&#39;s a webpage with dirty laundry on it, it rarely gets updated to say &#34;later, Judge Judy found suspect to be of good character, and they&#39;ve since paid their debts to the court.&#34;No, it just has absolute worst moment on repeat, leaving out all the context and any depth that goes into a legal proceeding. It&#39;s entirely the worst part of a nightmare.I&#39;ve personally had a number of articles written in addition to a 15-second segment on the local evening news. Getting a call from a partner who is sobbing, &#34;my parents Googled you.&#34; is absolutely stomach-turning. Knowing my little sister had to go to school the day after the clip played next day was something I am more ashamed about than I can put into words. Thankfully she was too young for a cell phone and social media was still in its infancy.My partner very privy to my dirty laundry. When they first learned of it they were actually surprised. It didn&#39;t bother them though as they knew who I was as a person and that my days of making mistakes were behind me.Their parents were less understanding. They didn&#39;t know me like my partner did. They just saw a series of mugshots and some local news articles from mistakes I made as a young adult.It wasn&#39;t the first and it wasn&#39;t the last time it happened, either.I have always been transparent and forthcoming with mistakes I&#39;ve made. I&#39;m just as candid with friends as I am here on HN. Hell, my profile even says I&#39;m a former felon!One point does not make a pattern. Many minor crime stories are just a point. That point, on the internet, is a scar, and those who come across them out of curiosity, suspicion, or nosiness re-open the wound.Since my bad decisions, I&#39;ve had success in contacting the authors of the articles highlighting my worst-moment-kept-in-a-non-governmental-database asking if they&#39;d consider removing their article. I mentioned I had completed probation and was doing something with my life, and that the article was hurting me and my relationships with people. They obliged.Edit: This isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve mentioned I&#39;m a felon in a comment. I&#39;ve received a surprising number of emails over the years from other felons (or felons-to-be) asking &#34;how did you reintegrate into society?&#34; or &#34;do you have any advice?&#34;. If you&#39;re one of them and reading this, you&#39;re more than welcome drop me an email."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an interesting (and confounding) topic.On a corollary note, Austin recently experienced a mass shooting in a popular Downton area. 14 people were shot. One died. Another is paralyzed. The local paper of record explicitly declined to publish the description of the suspects as released by the police so as to not &#34;perpetuate stereotypes&#34;. The question I have is, what is the obligation to report the facts of a story, regardless of consequence? My belief is that reporting should report all the facts and let the chips fall where they may. But I also understand that reasonable people can disagree. (In this case, it seemed unreasonable to me as one shooter was still at large.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My interpretation of their intent is they will no longer name suspects in &#34;florida man&#34; style stories. Like, really, nobody needs to know that it was specifically 30 year old resident Pimble McGringleberry who lives on 1234 S Main St, nowheresville, arkansas was the lady who was throwing office chairs off the top of the target parking structure.The person is presumably dealing with the aftermath of whatever caused them to be in the news in the first place. There is no reason to give internet users a rope, or 6 lines by the hand of the person to hang them with.I think this is a positive move and hope to see more of it."</p>

I was between jobs with no insurance and few funds, so I asked what it cost. The doctor had someone in his office call the hospital and got a quote for $1,500. I got the MRI knowing only that.A month later I got a bill for $3,500. I drove out to the hospital (2 hours) to ask wtf. They didn&#39;t help at all, wouldn&#39;t budge.So I went home and wrote them a check for $1,500, marked as paid in full, with a cover letter explaining my side of it. It worked. They cashed the check and I never heard another word. I&#39;ve done further business there with no problem. It&#39;s well worth pushing back."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I did some research into this for my current employer and the challenges are pretty well laid out here: the penalties are minimal ($300 / day or $~110,000 per year), the data is kept in the invoice or billing systems, which are complex, and the hospitals do not want to share the truly groundbreaking data, which is the per-provider costs.In addition, when you Google for competitors you don&#39;t find a lot of them, but once you start looking at hospital websites you find that quite a few of them (about 50% of the ones I looked at) have at least a partial solution, often provided by their analytics company as an add-on or footnote.It does not appear there is a great market opportunity here unless the penalties increase (which the CMS has talked about vaguely, but hospitals are already asking for relief until after the pandemic)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My wife is trying to work on price transparency at her practice by offering bundled rates for the surgery she does. She has worked with all the various providers - anasthesia, pathology, the hospital etc to come up with a cash rate that she publishes on her website for the surgery. Most of the parties are very open to it but also extremely worried about outliers. Patients that end up costing 10x what was expected due to complications.
For her this is a minuscule risk, but in her negotiations it has been their main worry."</p>

It doesn&#39;t hit all the privacy targets that long-time personal VPN users might be looking for, and it doesn&#39;t get into the game of trying to circumvent region locked content*, but otherwise it&#39;s likely to be a solid privacy improvement for almost all users in a careful and deliberate way.I use a VPN for other reasons (downloading Ubuntu ISOs mostly) but I&#39;ll probably turn this on and leave it running on all my devices because of how transparent it appears to be. I trust Apple&#39;s onion-routing design more than I trust my VPN provider not to log things.* I&#39;m actually glad they don&#39;t try to get around region locks. I consume a lot of BBC content and live in the UK. I&#39;m constantly struggling with my VPNs (with UK endpoints) being blocked because others outside the UK could be using them. It would be nice if the BBC didn&#39;t block like this, but UK residents do typically pay for the content whereas those outside the UK are unable to."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been trying to point this out to people but YouTube personalities have a louder voice than anyone else so you end up with bad information.Props to Apple for offering an (albeit low entropy) onion router on their own infrastructure.  I can&#39;t imagine this is going to win them any friends in government circles but it&#39;s definitely a step in the right direction.I&#39;d also really like to see Apple come clean about the iCloud backup encryption debacle.  A lot of people are trusting it to be something it&#39;s not and it should really be clarified on-device what it is and is not before opting in."</p>

Which is something we came to accept and assume for interpreted languages (Python, Ruby, Node, etc.) but I&#39;m not yet ready to assume for shell scripts.So right when I was going to test Nushell, I discover there are also other shells like Elvish [0] and Oil which supports structured data [1].

The lines of poetry are created with a mix of artificial intelligence, machine learning and generative processes, providing thousands of possible combinations. As such, Wayfinder is an ever-changing, emergent artwork with infinite possibilities.The generated haikus seem natural.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m the author of #6 on the same list.  It&#39;s definitely interesting to see it has been used thousands of times on GitHub, and who knows how many more in proprietary code.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s buggy, but I now think it could definitely be improved.I think this shows an example of a big problem with StackOverflow compared to its initial vision.  I remember listening to Jeff and Joel&#39;s podcast, and hearing the vision of applying the Wikipedia model to tech Q&amp;A.  The idea was that answers would continue to improve over time.For the most part, they don&#39;t.  I&#39;m not quite sure if it&#39;s an issue of incentives or culture.  Probably some of both.  I think that having a person&#39;s name attached to their answer, along with a visible score really gives a sense of ownership.  As a result, other people don&#39;t feel enabled to come along and tweak the answer to improve it.Then, once an answer is listed at the top, it is given more opportunity for upvotes, so other improved answers don&#39;t seem to bubble up.  This is a larger issue with most websites that sort by ratings.  Generally they sort items based on the total number of votes, including hacker news itself.  Instead, to measure the quality of an item, we should look at the number of votes, divided by the number of views.  It may be tough to measure the number of views of an item, but we should be able to get a rough estimate based on the position on a page, for example.If the top comment on a HN discussion is getting 100 views in a minute and 10 upvotes, but the 10th comment down gets 20 views and 5 upvotes, the 10th comment is likely a better quality comment.  It should be sorted above the top ranked comment!  There would still need to be some smoothing and promotion of new comments to get them enough views to measure their quality as well.Such a policy on StackOverflow would also help newer, but better answers sort to the top."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; return String.format(&#34;%.1f %sB&#34;, bytes / Math.pow(unit, exp), pre);As a human, the first thing that I hate about this interpretation of &#34;human readable&#34; format is inconsistency in the number of significant digits. One digit after decimal separator is simply wrong, as when you jump from 999.9 MB to 1.0 GB you go from 4 significant digits to 2, instead it should be 1.000 GB, 10.00 GB and so on. This annoys me enormously when I upload things to Google Drive from Android phone and look at the number of data transferred as as soon it becomes bigger than 1 GB digits stop changing and I become anxious that it stopped the transfer and my Windows Phone nostalgia jumps over the roof (as WP was never infected with this problem by virtue of not using Java, and OneDrive on WP explicitly showed current connection speed, and frozen connection never caused any strange problems with uploaded files like it does on Google Drive on Android).As a human not from US, the second thing I hate here is lack of locale parameter to pass to formatter as decimal separator is different in different cultures, and in the world of cloud computing the locale of the machine where the code is run is often different from the one where the message is displayed.As a human from a culture using non latin alphabet, the third thing I hate here should be obvious for a reader."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"At the time when digital cellular was first designed, the main objective was to design sufficiently strong authentication to stem the rampant theft of service then occurring on the analog cellular systems. In the US this was estimated at roughly $2 billion/annum.Encrypting traffic for privacy purposes was less important. Prior analog cellular telephony systems were unencrypted, as were analog and digital wireline services. Thus, the privacy cryptography was intended to be strong enough to make it a little more inconvenient/expensive to eavesdrop on digital cellular than it was on analog cellular or wireline services without significantly impeding law enforcement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"All of the GSM algorithms were weak, and deliberately so. It is well known that the French wanted it that way, while the German side wanted a bit more safety on account of the ongoing Cold War. So compromises like the infamous A5 algorithm were created whose security was mainly based on the algorithm itself being kept a secret - the cardinal sin of cryptography."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a European, living in Europe, developing software. Lack of imagination is not our problem. It&#39;s so good that we supply our best talent to the US where it does extremely well revolutionizing AI, designing hardware for Apple, developing games, stream online music, etc. E.g. Amazon&#39;s CTO is Dutch. Basically the person that has been running AWS. The people and the education system are fine.Europe does have a few issues that make it unnecessarily hard to build successful startups here. People do start companies here but more often than not success is followed by US investment and before you know it the company is headquartered in the US. There are many reasons for that but a big one has to be that raising similar amounts of money in Europe is super hard. Investors drag their heels, founders have to take on more risk, etc.A second reason is simply that the US as a big homogeneous market is a nice one to tackle for European companies as well. And often that means having a (big) presence in the US. The EU is basically many markets unified by really complex rules, bureaucracy, etc. There is free traffic of people but companies have a harder time dealing with local variations in legislation, hurdles for billing and taxation (e.g. VAT), banking, bureaucracy, etc.That&#39;s much less of a thing in the US (though it is a bit of a thing there too between states). And that&#39;s before you consider language and cultural differences. Simply put, the same company in the EU will have a very hard time growing compared to doing that in the US. Being successful in the US market, means having the deep pockets to go international. Doing the same from a small country means you barely have enough to expand to another small country. Going international is hard work. Not something you do with your MVP. It&#39;s not very scalable either: you need to worry about cultural differences, bureaucracy, localization, understanding the local market, ramping up sales, marketing, etc. Especially with SAAS companies this is super expensive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I take offense at such massive overgeneralizations as &#34;Europe lacks imagination.&#34;What it lacks is freely flowing funding such that risky enterprises can be funded even if 1 out of ten or 1 out of hundred actually are successful. This kills business models which cannot show any profit whatsoever, and a large portion of the remainder are killed by data regulations forbidding &#34;alternate paths of monetization&#34; (to put it charitably.)Rather, a problem is that once a European project becomes successful enough, it soon becomes an American project, either by acquisition or by moving to where the investment money is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This problem will never get fixed. The author forgot to mention in depth the main reason why EU isn&#39;t even in the game: culture.In order to be innovative and compete, we need very flexible working laws, people with a big growth mindset, a less relaxing lifestyle and AMBITIOUS people.A lot of third world countries are years ahead of the whole EU continent in that aspect. I say this because I live in Europe for the quality of life, come from a third world country, and I see how kids and adults are spoiled here. Much of what they have was just given to them. At least for the strong countries in west EU, lifestyle is very relaxed and any ambitious is frowned upon, it is extremely demotivating, not to mention bureaucracy. Corporations and regulations will just drive your small company out of the market no matter what.I find for me more likely to save some money, move to my country and create my own business and sell in Europe. People here are too lazy to compete in the fast world we live in, there in my country there is so many skilled people, so little capital, here is the reverse. Good amount of capital and foreigners working in tech. For instance, I live in Berlin and almost all the &#34;working people&#34; from tech companies here are foreigners. Germans are generally the executives and/or management. It is quite rare to find a german software developer on Startups.I personally think(my opinion, not the ultimate truth)... that Europe is definitely a very interesting market for companies to come here and sell their stuff, but not to make it.Instead I think Europe should focus on its strengths, which is healthy market regulations, creating a good playing field for companies from above, rather on its weaknesses. It should also figure out a way to keep part of the profits inside the continent to benefits its inhabitants.More important than competing is to know where and when to compete."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My first job out of college was at a magazine. The two editors there were in their 70s and notorious for being bullies (although for what it&#39;s worth, one of them mellowed out after their editorial assistant committed suicide). There wasn&#39;t a day when I wasn&#39;t yelled at repeatedly, and the taint seeped down, with everybody lower down the rung yelling at anybody below them.  It was easily the most toxic environment that I&#39;ve ever experienced, and I&#39;ve worked in academia! People were breaking down in tears all the time. Ex editorial assistants would send in letters written in crayon from insane asylums. The funny thing was that instead of resenting their tormenters, most people adopted a very protective stance towards these editors, as if they were children. Sadly, the impression that I got was that a lot of other publications had similar problems--smart but extremely neurotic bosses who regularly demeaned their employees. This was in 2000, around the time when &#34;The Devil Wears Prada&#34; came out. The one upside was that it permanently scared me out of publishing, which turned out to be an excellent career choice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m very sorry to hear that Matthew Butterick had some bad experiences.  He&#39;s been a brilliant and energetic contributor to the Racket community.  Clearly, something went wrong.For what it&#39;s worth (looking at some of the comments from people not very familiar), my own experiences with Matthias Felleisen have been positive.  (I started contributing to what was then called PLT Scheme around 2000, have had lunch with him twice, and a few times over the years have had some mutually-candid conversations with him, about concerns affecting the project/community.)While I might describe Matthias as a freethinker and straight-talker, everything I&#39;m aware of that he&#39;s said or done in the two decades I&#39;ve been around seems to come from altruistic intentions.I know Matthias cares about the community.  (He was very welcoming when I started, and we&#39;ve discussed it over the years.)  I think he&#39;ll want to personally investigate and consider what happened that resulted in alienating Matthew B., and try to correct any problems that he can.This isn&#39;t just about Matthew B., but also about constantly seeing how we can be the best community for everyone.  That&#39;s not a solved problem, and I suggest it&#39;s best approached as an ongoing process of humility, honesty, and support -- everyone feeling safe to raise concerns/problems, and everyone feeling safe to examine how we can improve."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve followed Racket and the OP&#39;s work from a distance for some time.  This post rang bells for me, based on similar interactions with a few bad apples over about twenty years in the field of physics.I applaud the poster for the clear and measured language of his post,  for his bravery in calling out this kind of behavior, and for taking steps needed to remove himself from the situation. I hope the Racket community takes steps to eliminate the problem at the root."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really like the idea of this. Some thoughts:1. It&#39;s difficult for me to tell which spaces are open for play and which aren&#39;t -- the border is hard to parse. (Is that this cell&#39;s border, or the adjacent cell?) This isn&#39;t really an issue during placement, but it is an issue for signalling that a cell has been &#34;captured,&#34; which is hard for me to tell.2. Hexagon grid is absolutely the right call. :)3. The influence mechanic is very opaque: it&#39;s very hard for me to predict what will happen next, which makes me feel like I&#39;m playing a little &#34;intuitively,&#34; instead of planning out my moves with intention. Some way to see &#34;this is the current state and this will be the next state&#34; would help with that, but I think as long as influence is a continuous quantity it&#39;s going to be difficult to visualize and predict.4. Making the board itself hexagonal (ala Hexxagon) will give you an odd number of cells, preventing ties. Might also be nice to smooth out cell-strength discontinuities around the top and bottom edges.5. Balancing the first-player advantage by making the first move a &#34;weak stone&#34; was very confusing to me, because an adjacent move by player two will &#34;capture&#34; my initial stone with a single stone of theirs. I didn&#39;t understand this until I saw your comment about it here. I think the pie rule would work well in this game, but it&#39;s hard for me to reason about since edge moves are offensively weaker but defensively stronger... I&#39;m not sure how well it would shake out, if you haven&#39;t tried it already.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_rule"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi, a couple of comments.First, I understand you were trying to make an approachable presentation, but the rules as you presented them are incomplete (how does influence work? what is a &#34;threshold&#34;?), and I think for a board game that&#39;s a big mistake. What makes games like those cool is that rules work deterministically, even for games that involve randomness. Having to guess the rules is something I actively dislike.Second, have you considered a square board instead of an hexagonal one? Using Go terminology, it feels like the groups have too many liberties.Other than that, the game is pretty good. I feel it captures the attack/defense territory-based gameplay of Go perfectly.Have you tried to measure the first move advantage?edit: Wow this thing is a drug. Hard AI is deceptively good, I managed to tie a game 25-25 after several attempts, but you definitely can&#39;t afford to be sloppy if you want to stay afloat!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At the end of every turn, each tile influences its neighbors and imparts some of its color. Tiles with a dark border can no longer be selected.The rules are simple but it takes awhile to master. What is your best score against the Hard AI? I got 27 (me on green) – 23 (AI).Would you want to see some sort of match-making to play against others online?See demo gameplay or view the source code at https://github.com/jawslouis/Influence-Game"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s great to allow your kids to take risks, and we do this with our own as much as we can (they&#39;re 1 and 3, so &#34;within reason&#34; is still doing some heavy lifting. I pick ticks off of them now and then and patch up their share of bruises).But fundamentally, what I want most is to be somewhere my kids can ride bikes or walk alone to school, to friends, to the shop, etc. from the age of 7 or so. As best I can tell that pretty much means the Netherlands, parts of Denmark, or perhaps Japan (more for transit than cycling).Children can&#39;t drive, which means unless you&#39;re lucky enough to live very close to your friends, and ideally on the same side of the street, your home is effectively your prison in the US and Canada.And yes, I suppose you _can_ let your kid ride a bike to school alone in the US at 7, but you would be risking arrest, and death. It&#39;s often forgotten that drivers are, by far, the leading killers of children. Far more than people with guns. I was an avid cyclist in the US for the first 30 years of my life and I still have a bruised rib and too many memories of very, very close calls with death.NotJustBikes, who moved from Canadian suburbia to the Netherlands, explores this in more depth at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul_xzyCDT98"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the problem &#34;de-risking&#34; childhood is only an instance of the bigger problem of what Roger Scruton calls &#34;Risk De-aggregation&#34;. Risk Deaggregation is taking a single point of risk (and its associated metric), and optimizing to reduce that risk as if it exists in isolation from other risks. I.e. Risk occurs in aggregate, not as individual threats. Risk deaggregation happens everywhere from Climate Change policy, to Covid, to children.I think this type of risk deaggregation arises from the fact that in a sufficiently complicated space (climate, economy, children, etc) there are really only two heuristics:1) Ignore all but a manageable number of variables and optimize for them2) Recognize a larger number of necessary variable, acknowledge there is no optimal solution, and balance the trade offs between those variables. [0]Heuristic 1 is the easiest, requires no nuance, and seems the type of thing our political and media class love to latch onto. Heuristic 2 actually requires admitting you don&#39;t get everything you want, or at least the things you want will cost you something you dont.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve got five kids. The more I loosen up and let the kids take risks and learn for mistakes the better. The challenge is when the adults inject a ridiculous level of risk to something that should be a learning experience. For example, allowing police to arrest and charge a child for bad behavior at school (i.e. won&#39;t obey the teacher, outbursts - not for actually criminally violent behavior). Another is lifetime academic and other records. When risk is too high, learning stops and risk avoidance takes over."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"During my time as a research assistant / grad student there was a remarkable shift in the atmosphere. It started with massive layoffs of research staff, linked to the more general savings of our government.More esoteric professors were replaced with more efficient manuscript machines submitting manuscripts to more prestigious journals. Soon after the layoffs, the university&#39;s innovation and commercialization services became extremely active. Recurring events at lecture rooms where we were blasted on how our work is IP of the university, how the university takes only 50% cut if something works, how cool is it to be a researcher who commercializes ideas in comparison to being one those dusty farts in the science cave studying one protein or butterfly for their entire life.Being a believer and practitioner of open source, I once asked how does this all this apply to computational science. Basically all algorithms and tools should be passed through them to see if they have commercial potential - if no, we can go ahead. Found it appalling and interfering with my intellectual freedom, one of the many events that made me pursue life outside the academia."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wouldn&#39;t be the first time universities have acted like patent trolls. For example, you know the filament-style LED lightbulbs that are really popular these days? The University of California has been going after a bunch of retailers with patent lawsuits for selling them, complete with PR push about how it was their invention that had been stolen from them. I looked at what they&#39;d actually invented and patented at the time, and it was nothing like those filament LED lightbulbs - it was a old-fashioned resin-dome LED that replaced the metal anvil the die is usually mounted on with a TIR reflector, supposedly to improve efficiency. This was completely impractical, pointless and had no market value - the metal anvil is really useful both as mechanical support and a heatsink, you&#39;d almost certainly lose any possible efficiency gain that resulted from capturing more of the rear light output due to higher temperatures. However, they&#39;d worded their patent claims in such a broad way that they could cover nearly anything, and the university used this to file for patents that were actually similar to the LED filaments after they&#39;d already been invented by someone else and put on the market but backdated in validity to their original patent.This isn&#39;t just a software-related problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Grants from the NSF, etc. should only be granted on the condition that the research produced enters the public domain. Taxpayer dollars should not go towards producing research the public cannot benefit from without paying to license a patent or access a $100 journal article."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Starting conditions (where one was born, levels of wealth and opportunity there, one&#39;s parents&#39; education and jobs) are shockingly predictive about an individual&#39;s future. Hard work leading to social mobility has always been the exception, not the rule. Most will not beat the odds since if they did, those wouldn&#39;t BE the odds. A lot of us are just so deluded by survivorship bias borne of listening only to success stories, but it seems more and more people are seeing through the illusion. In my opinion, that&#39;s a good thing, as recognizing the true state of things is the first step to improving them, and this combination of consciousness and lived experience can prove to be potent immunization against bad faith actors who want to maintain the illusion of widespread social mobility."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Working hard but doing so for someone else can often not lead to significant gains.  Many services like Uber or InstaCart or even McDonalds or Amazon Warehouse or Walmart or Retail Sales or call center, you can work hard but there is no where to progress to.  Your rewards are capped.You need to find a way to work hard such that your rewards are not capped artificially.  Startups were you get equity.  Large companies where you can progress to high salaries if you are able to rise.  Starting your own business and being competent at it.  Working on commissions in an area where the commissions can be large -- true sales, or real estate.  Being a professional, e.g. doctor, accountant, lawyer, has traditionally had high wages and you often run your own business.You need to work hard in a way that has unlimited rewards, or at least high rewards possible, and that aligns with your aptitudes.You need to not work hard at a minimum wage job if you can get something better.And if you are stuck in a minimum wage job, maybe you can organize with your fellow employees to demand better wages and benefits?  This is also another way of working hard in order to get more for yourself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As trite as it sounds, &#34;Success = Hard Work + Opportunity&#34; is still the default equation that makes the most sense to me.And while people from all strata of life work very hard, opportunities are obviously and incredibly unequally distributed (and perhaps becoming more so?).If you were born middle-class in US/Canada 20 - 40 years ago, your access to opportunities to improve your station were/are immense. Layer on your ethnicity, if your parents were in a stable relationship, if you grew up in relative safety, if you had a decent education... hard not to think that your opportunities were 10x or 100x someone who had none of those things.But you also need to define &#34;success&#34;. To this crowd, is &#34;success&#34; merely &#34;leading a better life&#34;? I&#39;d argue most of us already have this as our default reality. I.e. the gradual reward for working hard via promotions and relative safety of career.I remember after my startup was acquired, a few people would say to me (well-meaning obviously) &#34;wow it&#39;s great your hard work paid off!&#34;. And I just said something like &#34;thanks, ya, lots of people work a lot harder than me but didn&#39;t get the same outcome - so there was a lot of luck involved too!&#34; etc. Even thinking of my own immigrant grandparents - what THEY did was HARD.I think about those exchanges often. Tech -- at this particular moment in history -- disproportionately rewards &#34;hard work&#34; (which many of us find fun anyways). Or perhaps better to say that Tech provides access to the right kind of opportunities that allow for a DEFAULT &#34;life gets better&#34;, with the possibilities of &#34;life suddenly gets 100x better&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m always super intrigued by the reMarkable 2, but I think it&#39;s because it paints an image of the type of person I think it&#39;d be cool to be, someone who can just write down notes and draw stuff with a really cool, slim device. Someone who carries around moleskines and uses them, instead of just buying so many of them in different shapes and leaving them in a drawer packed to the brim with notebooks.The problem keeps coming back to the fact that I&#39;m absolutely not the type of person who wants to carry that thing around everywhere and who likes or is good at hand writing or drawing. I realize I won&#39;t base all my life and processes around this one device that is also supposedly hard to get info off of easily into things like OneNote. If I was somewhere without a computer, then I wouldn&#39;t be carrying this big tablet on me. I&#39;ve bought enough tablets and laptops with writable screens and MS surfaces over the years to know that I still never drew or took notes with the pen, but I still keep buying them hoping I will.The thing is still so cool and I want it, but maybe I&#39;ll wait for version 3 or 4 and extra disposable income that will go to waste on it!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bought a Remarkable 2 a month or two ago because I wanted a cool hackable e-ink Linux computer. But instead I immediately started using it as an e-book and document reader and note-taking pad, and nothing else. And, so far at least, that&#39;s perfect.The screen is beautiful (a bit gray, but the black is really black so the contrast is still good), the device is thin and reasonably light, I only have to charge it once a week or so, and there are absolutely no distractions. I have even rediscovered the visceral pleasantness of writing by hand.I especially like that it&#39;s *not* running Android (which I dislike more with each release). The biggest drawbacks, to me, are the fragile pen nibs and the inability to just SCP a PDF or EPUB to the device and have it work (their sync software works but isn&#39;t great)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bought the Onyx Boox Note Air some months ago, and I must say that I&#39;m really happy with it. Screen refresh is good, there&#39;s almost no ghosting in default mode, and refresh rates are acceptable.There are only two downsides about it: The vendor does not respect FOSS and does not publish the sources for their modified Linux kernel, and the device constantly phones home to China. However, the device can be rooted easily [1], and you can install a firewall to stop the preloaded apps from phoning home (verified it with Wireshark).[1]: https://blog.tho.ms/hacks/2021/03/27/hacking-onyx-boox-note-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great example of why Google FLoC is not incentive-compatible with consumers nor business owners.  Amazon (like Facebook) has a monopoly on ad targeting on their target properties—- properties they own.  Google FLoC is Google’s attempt to (further) monopolize their target properties—- the web at large, which Google does NOT own.  Google does NOT pay to service the traffic they generate.  Google does NOT pay to fulfill consumer orders.  Google wants you to think they’re acting in your best interests with FLoC.  Maybe if Google offered more free GCloud credits and subsidized conversions they generate, that would be a different story. (Maybe Google could start by paying Wikipedia for some of the traffic they generate).  But Sundar wants you to think FLoC is about privacy, because Sundar has said time and time again that Google has lost people’s trust."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, the bias in this article is unbelievably blatant:&#34;[Amazon is] preventing Google’s tracking system FLoC — or Federated Learning of Cohorts — from gathering valuable data reflecting the products people research in Amazon’s vast e-commerce universe&#34;Compare with, e.g.:&#34;Amazon is taking steps to protect its user&#39;s privacy by blocking Google&#39;s heavy-handed overreach in leveraging its Chrome browser to spy on user&#39;s personal shopping habits and sell that information to other retailers&#34;.(Note: I&#39;m not saying my rewrite is unbiased.  It&#39;s not.  It&#39;s just biased in a different direction to highlight the contrast.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To me this editor gets it right in the sense that we don’t need to get rid of code as the “nocode” movement is trying. Instead we need to make coding more enjoyable and figure out ways to make it more interactive.One specific thing Utopia addresses to me is the need for the code and the actual thing to be treated more as one single interactable component and not two separate things.Instead we&#39;re treating the thing as a one-way compile step. There&#39;s no way to sync the DevTools in-memory changes we make to the DOM with the actual code.The fact that Utopia allows the two things to be treated as one is a huge step towards making webdev more enjoyable.And they’re following good steps… SwiftUI’s editor is very similar in this regard. Using the code as the main thing but having all kinds of interactable components around it that make writing code simpler with cool visual autocomplete widgets &amp; visual aids.Before with direct DOM changes building something like this was impossible but now with the React paradigm is seems natural to have this sync between code and visuals.Kudos to the team for pulling this off."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Product designer here. I just spent the past few hours fine-tuning some visual details in our Figma component library. Now I need to file tickets for each change and work with our frontend developers to make sure the updated Figma details get properly mapped over to React.I&#39;ve grown numb to the friction, but I think this Utopia demo just reset my pain tolerance. Going back to manually mapping designs from Figma mocks to React components feels so dated. Almost like those PSD2HTML websites of the early 2000s.The market absolutely needs a product like this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After five minutes of playing with it and failing to find it... where is the panel of components to drag and drop into the tree? Seems like the most basic functionality in an editor like this. Something that VB had in 1993. This should be something that is obvious and visible on a first glance.Another issue I have with the UI is that a lot of elements are greyed out even though they remain interactive. The convention is that UI elements that are greyed out are not interactive due to the current state of the application (wrong mode, unmatched requisites etc). This application seems to violate that and I&#39;m still baffled as to what greying out of UI elements means in in this app. If they aren&#39;t disabled why are they greyed out?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can’t help but see some kind of special interest or agenda whenever I hear a news story now. You have to ask why they chose to report this, why they slant things one way or another with their choice of wording and emphasis. What is the aspect of this story that is too politically incorrect or unfashionable to be included?I have never researched a topic deeply and found that the media had been covering that topic accurately, ever. The harsh truth is that generally speaking the news is almost completely useless. You might as well just never watch it.I think the very final nail in the coffin was the leaked recordings of the CNN technical director basically admitting what everyone pretty much already knew. That they spread misinformation deliberately, only give interviews to subject experts who they know will say what CNN prefers them to say and ultimately design everything they put on the screen to get hooks inside your limbic system and keep your eyes glued. The main tool they use to do this is the emotion of fear, and it was for this reason and no other that they created a COVID death counter. And every single one of those points is explicitly, literally and plainly stated on video by a very senior employee of CNN for all to see. so I’m afraid that I can’t be brushed aside as a Russian bot. It’s right there on YouTube.And what about all the other media companies? This CNN leak, which is maybe the very embodiment of a scoop, was not on the front page of any major newspaper or news website. It was not elaborated on. It was basically not reported."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anyone else burnt out from the outrage cycle in recent times?I don’t know if it’s selfish but I just don’t have the energy anymore to care about what bad thing person X or company Y did this week.My current philosophy is to treat news/Reddit/social media like email in the old days.That is: log on to a desktop computer once a week and read the highlights. It is not accessible except through the desktop computer.The funny thing is this approach is completely opposite the “stories” trend in social media. It makes you really aware of the FOMO-by-design pattern these days."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like this post has a lot of hindsight bias in it. People are going to get things wrong sometimes. I think there&#39;s a lot of things to legit criticize mainstream media for, but not having 100% accurate crystal ball isn&#39;t one of them.If the thesis of this piece is that newswriters sometimes get things wrong, or sometimes write sensationalized things, all i can say is, no duh."</p>

Every time I turn on location, then open Google Maps, Maps prompts me to turn on the &#34;enhanced experience&#34;.

The approach take was: instruct pupils to draw a house on paper, using only straight lines; teach them briefly what a coordinate system is (assigning numeric addresses - pairs of numbers - to points), which they haven&#39;t had in their maths curriculum at that stage, but which they easily picked up; translate the paper-based house into a sequence of PyTurtle Python commands."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The landing page contains logos for clubhouse, discord, and shippo, which are presumably companies use the service. Does anyone find those usages to be unnecessarily intrusive? Maybe it&#39;s just me, but a chat app or shipping site asking me for a drivers license scan + selfie would make me never want to use the service again. It&#39;s appalling how this sort of stuff is getting normalized, eg. google asking for id scans for age verification."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Smart. Banks haven&#39;t been allowed to monetize their KYC data, but this new non-bank class of payments companies have this opportunity. Interac has been trying to do this for many years.Some years ago I worked on a system let banks do identity assertions with proofs via SAML attributes instead of sharing customer PII. It is now a federation of banks in wide use for govt services in Canada. The use cases were really limited because the federation partners were too conservative to extend the identity services to relying party consumer applications real people actually wanted to use, and institutional sales cycles meant product feedback was glacial, so it has existed for over a decade in this relative backwater of gov-tech. I think identity companies have mostly failed to get traction because of a terminal lack of consumer sexiness, whereas Stripe has the jelly.Other companies in the identity space have been working on protocols and platforms, but none of them had a user base to extend an identity federation services into, which means they have never been able to make a real or viable product, just interesting techs. An internet payment provider with young consumer traction getting into identity is a Very Big Deal.It&#39;s going to position Stripe to knock out a lot of retail banks who can&#39;t offer similar services. Imo, this could make them bigger than Apple."</p>

Expressing intent to resign, and actually resigning are completely different things. (edit: to clarify, I mean changing jobs specifically in the context of making inroads toward the retire early portion of their goal. Changing jobs to increase compensation is as strong as ever)Real Translation: Covid has made people miserable in their jobs. The only way people can keep going is idle fantasies about a nondescript future date where this suffering ends.&gt; Workers have had more than a year to reconsider work-life balance or career pathsIMO, over the last year, people have only dived deeper into their delusions and relative sense of privilege.

I mean it was never cold, but right now seems to be insane.If the work-from-home thing has given you thoughts about what you like, now is the time to go. I see very few firms insisting on onsite work though, having interviewed with quite a few over the last few weeks. Even guys that I know would rather have people in the office and would pay them very well are feeling forced to let people work from home at least a couple of days.Salary wise it seems like it&#39;s breaking upwards too, though of course all I have is my own offers and the word of some recruiters. There&#39;s also just a lot of firms out there who are happy to create roles for people they like, or discuss new ventures with new people.Also, don&#39;t forget if you&#39;re going to look, absolutely everyone is interviewing remotely. You can sit at home at interviews all day until you find the job for you, something you might not be able to once more firms go back in the office."</p>

I didn&#39;t realy even try with how insane the market is especially if you are specialzed in the current hotness.Moreso, the rise of fully remote role has opened up our ideas about our current living situation. The real estate market in our city is shattered and broken. So we will also move 60 miles south to a different city... before the pandemic I was remote and missed the office. Post pandemic... fuck the office and 1+ hour commutes purely because the city, state, and country have mismanaged infrastructure for 20 years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This appears to actually go significantly beyond enforced password disclosure.  From the text ( http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Gen_Scheme_of_AGS_(Powers)_Bil... ), on Head 16 (p 28):- An officer can use these requirements on anyone who &#34;appears to him or her to have access&#34;.  They don&#39;t appear to need any evidence beyond that.  The person does not need to be a suspect or, it appears, the subject of a warrant, just a person present at the location subject to the search warrant.- It applies not just to access to information on the device, but information &#34;which can be accessed by the use of that computer&#34;, and thus presumably includes information that is on other machine, or potentially not even in Ireland or the EU.- It allows officers to freely operate computers on site during a search (this seems like horrible forensic practice?), and use passwords found on the site to try to access any information accessible from the computer.- It does not just include disclosing passwords.  It includes &#34;any password or encryption key&#34;, and anything &#34;to otherwise enable [the officer] to examine the information accessible by the computer&#34;.- It even appears that it allows officers to compel people not just to disclose passwords but to actually operate the device for them so as to enable information access, and &#34;to produce the information in a form in which it can be removed&#34;.- It is not clear to me that there is any restriction on the scope of information, so long as it is in some way accessible.- Head 17 appears to allow even legally (or otherwise) privileged information to be seized, so long as &#34;the confidentiality of the material can be maintained pending the determination by the court of the issue as to whether the material is privileged material&#34;.Combining these powers would seem to be able to result in ridiculous situations, for example, forcing a person to take data from a US server using an SSH key on their laptop, potentially violating US law by doing so, and for the person to do all the work necessary to do this themselves."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interestingly, such a law does nothing against proper criminals. People that know they have incriminating evidence will either not carry it on their phones or uses some form of steganography to hide it perfectly. In the worst case, they will have some form of wipe-me passphrase that cleans the device before unlocking.Normal people, on the other hand, do not have these kind of (mental, time) resources. They will be forced to unlock their phones and something incriminating (for instance regarding &#34;hate speech&#34; or &#34;intellectual property rights&#34; or just &#34;traffic violations&#34;) will be found. I consider this approach one step more in the direction of keeping every citizen an on-demand criminal. There are so many, sometimes incomprehensible, laws nowadays that pretty much everyone is not compliant."</p>

If you appear to the police officer to have access or passwords, and don&#39;t give it to them, they can charge you with obstruction and jail you for up to 5 years!So if you can&#39;t prove that you don&#39;t have the password, you&#39;re in a bit of trouble!-------------------------------------16 (1).(e).(v) to require any person at that place who appears to him or her to have access to or to have under his power or control the information held in any such computer or which can be accessed by the use of that computer—(I) to give  to  him  or  her  any  password  or  encryption  key  necessary  to operate it,(II) to otherwise enable him or her to examine the information accessible by the computer in a form in which the information is visible and legible,(III) to produce the information in a form in which it can be removed and in which it is, or can be made, visible and legible67 (2).(d) A person who fails to comply with a requirement under Head 9 (1), (2) or (3), or Head 16 (1). is guilty of an offence and is liable—(i)  on  summary  conviction,  to  a  class  A  fine  or  imprisonment  for  a  term  not exceeding 12 months or both, or(ii) on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding €30,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both"</p>

Which programs work for me? Or, I have {goal} and n days per week, what should I do? The programs would be populated with exercises from the DB, programs could be exported, etc.3. As much ELI5 info as possible - the barrier to exercise for a lot of people (myself included despite my experience) can be not knowing wtf something is, or why to do it, and generally what the benefits are.4. Treat warmups like any exercise - a critical part of the routine. Include lots of warm up exercises, whether it&#39;s something you make quantifiable progress with or not. Everything from skipping rope and light jogging to dead bugs. Include these as part of program generation.Maybe something does this, but my favourite tracker (Strong) doesn&#39;t cover all of it and I&#39;d switch in an instant if something did.

If that&#39;s 3 sets of 5 reps, fine. Do that. If you can get yourself to consistently do more than that over time, you&#39;ll benefit from the increase in volume.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Narrower tires, necessarily inflated to a high pressure, are actually inefficient on a bumpy surface.A tire&#39;s job is to absorb surface defects in the road, and that is not only for comfort, but rolling efficiency.The extreme example of this occurs off-road. Off-road vehicles benefit from wider tires that are inflated to a lower pressure. If you have an off-road vehicle, it behooves you to take some of the air out of the tires when you go off-road.25mm road bike tires basically require a polished velodrome; real roads consist of pitted, eroded and cracked asphalt.If your bike is vibrating from the crappy road, you&#39;re probably not going as fast as you could be. Letting some of the air out for a more efficient, smoother ride is risky, if the tires a narrow; you risk snakebite flats and damage to the rim.For commuting in run-down city with aging infrastructure, you want at at least 38 mm tires. 40 mm is a nice round number. You can vary the pressure for the kinds of roads you&#39;re riding on with a lot of margin, and can take it quite low for dirt roads.I&#39;ve commuted around town with pressures as low as 45 psi in the back, 35 in the front, in 45 mm tires.I have story in relation to that. One time I was riding along NW Marine Drive in Vancouver, from UBC down to Spanish Banks. I came down from the hill and then along the flats there were some Spandex-clad road cyclists ahead of me. I pulled up to them and we were neck and neck. There was road work going on up ahead and the pavement had been scraped, leaving it horribly bumpy. I stood on the pedals and just cranked right through it, hardly slowing down. I saw in the mirror mounted on my eyeglasses that road bike guys dropped off as if a sniper had taken them out.What is the use of narrow tires? It&#39;s just fashion, like stiletto heels."</p>

I see all sorts of lamentations about various things in the world changing and becoming less magical. But as far as I&#39;m aware, I could still go and argue about bands in chatrooms. I could talk to other writers and dream about my future best-selling novels. I could go read random opinions about any subject and get into an exhilarating flamewar about it.I don&#39;t want to do any of those things. I&#39;m in my 40s and I have 3 kids. The internet 15-year-old me experienced was magical because _I_ was a blank slate. Every new friendship was thrilling, every new skill opened up infinite horizons, every nook and cranny felt like somewhere I could belong. But life moves on. I&#39;m more than half-way through my career, perhaps not the one I was expecting. I didn&#39;t marry the girl I met on IRC. I don&#39;t have strong opinions about Radiohead anymore. I find people, however delightful and kooky they are, quite tiring having got to know 10,000 of them at this point.I know all this is true because my kids love the internet and find their place in it with all the joy I used to.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From my perspective, I was in SWE at Apple for over a decade, their documentation started going downhill as iOS development ramped up. By the time they got to the yearly release cycle for macOS and iOS documentation was an afterthought. Most was generated with doxygen from inline docstrings.The reason I think the quality and quantity dropped was the internal schedules barely (or don&#39;t) leave enough time for the engineering work so there&#39;s very little time available for high level documentation. Internally tons of &#34;documentation&#34; existed as Radar comments or exchanges on internal mailing lists. Maybe a group&#39;s wiki had some crystallized documentation or high level architectural descriptions but good luck accessing it from outside that org. My favorite was some discussion about overall design or architecture that got the &#34;let&#39;s take this offline&#34; where all the helpful details ended up shared in an in-person meeting.The internal secrecy and rapid development pace made it really difficult to get good overviews of technologies internally. I really sympathize with outside developers trying to cobble together an understanding of something where the documentation sucks or is missing.The DocC tooling isn&#39;t going to be anymore effective than doxygen or other auto generated documentation without good architectural documentation. A function definition is nice but knowing you need to decombulate a frobnob before snizzlizing or that decombulation can only safely be done on the main thread is often more important. I can read a function signature but I can&#39;t necessarily know all the keys that go into some configuration NSDict passed into it.I hope the situation improves if the DocC tooling lowers the friction for writing documentation. It sucks having to mix a WWDC presentation, sample code, and iffy docs into a semblance of usable architectural documentation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This speaks to me. I’m not deeply involved in the iOS development world but I do a lot of webview-adjacent stuff so I keep a close eye on the WKWebView documentation.It’s a mess. Case in point: introduced in the new beta: loadSimulatedRequest:https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview/3...What does it do? Don’t know. I can make a few informed guesses from the name but I’m not sure if it’s maybe a performance measurement tool, or just a way of loading faked data. There is no documentation. To the best of my knowledge it isn’t covered in any talks either."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Isn&#39;t the real time most software documentation started going down hill was as the internet became the primary way of distributing and updating software?When software distribution was tied to hardware mediums, it froze snapshots in time, and the documentation thereof could be snapshotted with it (to varying levels of success). Even needed to be.But once it all became primarily net based, it meant the software was always fluid, in motion. Imagine the tech writer approaching a developer now days:&#34;Explain how this works to me&#34;&#34;Ok, right now, it works like this, but we&#39;re working on a revised version for next year...&#34;&#34;Sigh. Ok, explain that to me too.&#34;&#34;You bet, but make sure and check back with me before you publish, because some things might change yet.&#34;It&#39;s an irony, that the original dream of &#34;the web&#34;, a distributed documentation system, is rendered ever instantly out dated in the realm of software because of the distribution models it eventually enabled. Unintended side effects I guess.As a side anecdote, consider man pages for venerable established Unix commands. Now consider the man pages for newer Unix utilities. IME, the newer features are often under documented and require going to code portals to get detailed/up to date answers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Rust has an interesting, and somewhat difficult, memory model.First, there&#39;s the single ownership tree. Single ownership is checked by the borrow checker. You can have only one mutable reference to a data object at a time, and that&#39;s also checked by the borrow checker. If you can stay within that model, if the program compiles, it will probably work at the data access level.But then there are all the escape hatches.There&#39;s &#34;Rc&#34;, which is reference counting for read-only use. This works fine for immutable objects, but not for mutable ones.There&#39;s &#34;Cell&#34; and &#34;RefCell&#34;. These allow multiple ownership, and only one mutable access at a time. Request mutable access via two routes and you get a panic, or an error if you use try_borrow();
The static analysis of the borrow checker is not able to figure out when you&#39;re headed for trouble via this route.There&#39;s &#34;Arc&#34; and &#34;Mutex&#34;, which allows access across thread boundaries. Request access via two routes in the same thread, and you deadlock.Designing the data structures for something tightly coupled with concurrency, like a window manager or a game, is difficult."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, I&#39;m surprised I never ran across this excellent essay before.I also liked the use of the term &#34;memory model&#34; in this case to mean conceptual model, because the metaphors and affordances of a language are what give (or restrict) its expressive power and the level of abstraction you can bring to bear.  A mixed blessing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Memory model&#34; has yet a third meaning, referring to interference between operations in multiple CPU cores, and mediated by variously-shared parts of cache systems of varying complexity.Here, complexity of the memory model is traded off against complexity of the primitives to manage the interference, (compare-and-set, load-locked/store conditional, etc.) and with the complexity of the cache system.Java&#39;s original memory model, perhaps the first formally specified, turned out to be unimplementable on common actual machines. The next language to get a formal memory model was C++, followed shortly by C and then others.Real multicore machines have sorted themselves out into two models of cache coherency; one more forgiving represented by mainstream x86 and now Apple M1, relying on deeply complex cache designs, and the other by the remaining lottery survivors, non-Apple ARM, and Power. The various RISC-V implementations will probably straddle the divide, like ARM/ARM-M1.Java, C++, and C can with some discipine be coded to work transparently on either, but very often programs accidentally depend on the x86/Apple model, never having been tested beyond it. Rust, absent &#34;unsafe&#34;, is happy on either. The Linux kernel works on either, and once supported other more exotic variations."</p>

The BBC articles say that the wolbachia infection is passed on. Our reporting has been that male mosquitos infected with wolbachia that mate with females will not produce viable eggs, but otherwise, infected females will pass the wolbachia infection on.

They insist on not using other treatments outside clinical trials. The argument that running experiments would cost lives doesn&#39;t seem coherent.

The electric company can&#39;t cut off my power because I was using their electricity to discuss experimental medications, so why should Youtube be allowed to deny me access to the online public square for the same reason?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You really don&#39;t need anything fancy to implement a queue using SQL. You need a table with a primary id and a &#34;status&#34; field. An &#34;expired&#34; field can be used instead of the &#34;status&#34;. We used the latter because it allows easy retries.1. SELECT item_id WHERE expire = 0. If this is empty, no items are available.2. UPDATE SET expire = some_future_time WHERE item_id = $selected_item_id AND expire = 0. Then check whether UPDATE affected any rows. If it did, item_id is yours. If not, loop. If the database has a sane optimizer it&#39;ll note at most one document needs locking as the primary id is given.All this needs is a very weak property: document level atomic UPDATE which can return whether it changed anything. (How weak? MongoDB could do that in 2009.)Source code at https://git.drupalcode.org/project/drupal/-/blob/9.2.x/core/... (We cooked this up for Drupal in 2009 but I am reasonably sure we didn&#39;t invent anything new.)Of course, this is not the fastest job queue there is but it is quite often good enough."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think one of the biggest advantages of using Redis for job queing vs Postgres comes down to library support.For example Python has Celery and Ruby has Sidekiq. As far as I know there&#39;s no libraries in either language that has something as battle hardened with comparable features for background tasks using Postgres as a backend.There&#39;s a big difference between getting something to work in a demo (achievable by skimming PG&#39;s docs and rolling your own job queue) vs using something that has tens of thousands of hours of dev time and tons of real world usage.I&#39;m all for using PG for things like full text search when I can because it drastically reduces operation complexity if you can avoid needing to run Elasticsearch, but Redis on the other hand is a swiss army knife of awesome. It&#39;s often used for caching or as a session back-end so you probably have it as part of your stack already. It&#39;s also really easy to run, uses almost no resources and is in the same tier as nginx in terms of how crazy efficient it is and how reliable it is. I don&#39;t see not using Redis for a job queue as that big of a win."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Redis to me is the magic solution to solve so many complex multiple process syncing issues, a global lock, rate limiter, uniqueness with a set, stasher of all the temporary things… no migration, quick solution to complex problems- streams of events to organize pending tasks, etc… to me it’s all about the temporal / temporary state my application needs to keep track in order to work in a multiuser - multiprocess and multi service environment… just a different tool for a different job then what I would use a database for… but really it’s computer science, to each is their own"</p>

It has pretty low system requirements, and takes advantage of VR to create a virtual hotas (It is much more effective than you would expect). The physics simulation is, to my understanding, very good. And everything described in this article is present in the game to be played around with.VTOL VR taught me about &#34;Radar Notching&#34;. The article briefly mentions how radar can actively detect the doppler shift of targets. If you think about it, the doppler shift of the ground would be neutral, right? Or roughly the speed of the aircraft. So lets say you&#39;ve been locked on by a fighter at high altitude and they&#39;ve fired a radar seeker at you. Your backdrop is the ground, it can pick you out because you&#39;re moving so fast. So what you do is bank your aircraft to fly at a 90 degree angle to the oncoming missile. Now your doppler shift is the same as the ground and you blend in, the radar filters out the ground because of it&#39;s expected speed, which is now the relative speed you are moving. You get &#34;notched out&#34;, and the missile will lose track."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Becoming more religious has helped me identify religious tendencies in the secular world. Ideology doesn’t imply supernatural deities, and some worldly phenomenon can be elevated to a supernatural level.  Secular belief contains rituals, origin stories, deities, saints, priesthood, blasphemy, vice &amp; virtue just as religion does.One aspect of religion I appreciate is that these aspects are well codified and debated – i.e. much more explicit.In the secular world these aspects exist but they are implicit, making them difficult to debate and attack.Few people understand that most religions e.g. Judaism and Christianity have an apologetic discipline – a deliberate arm open to debate.The secular world would benefit from adopting more formal definitions of their belief system. I think that would reduce the conflict and neurosis that comes from engaging a nebulous system.If you believe you are not religious, it just means that you don’t have the cognitive tools to recognize the secular ideology that you have adopted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want to point out that this is incorrect:&gt; It’s rare to hear someone accused of being un-Swedish or un-British—but un-American is a common slur, slung by both left and right against the other. Being called un-American is like being called “un-Christian” or “un-Islamic,” a charge akin to heresy.In fact to be unswedish is not just a common idiom it’s a positive one. It’s when you don’t show the typical negative Swedishness. You aren’t “accused” of it, you are congratulated.“-I went to say hello to all the neighbors in my building. -What a nice and unswedish thing to do!”"</p>

We are a nation of believers. If only Americans could begin believing in politics less fervently, realizing instead that life is elsewhere. But this would come at a cost—because to believe in politics also means believing we can, and probably should, be better&#34;I think the author is part of a group of largely public intellectuals in the US who have subscribed to the theory of &#34;religion is the opium of the people, but that&#39;s a good thing&#34;.Yes, the loss of religion does away with a glue that in some sense kept a sort of false peace intact. Injustices can no longer be explained away with metaphysical explanations, superficial alliances under the banner of faith cannot be maintained. The people who stand to lose from this are the kind of people who write these op-eds. People who benefit from delaying conflict. The people who stand to benefit from the loss of religion are the people who need some justice in this world, not in the next one."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve got two nephews aged 34 and 32 who still live at home and play video games all the time and rarely leave their rooms. Neither has ever had a job that lasted more than a month or so. Neither ever learned to drive even though they live in a town with little or no public transit. They haven&#39;t had any education beyond high school. They seem wholly unprepared to navigate life without their parents. It&#39;s a slow motion tragedy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What are the things that motivates them, and what do they themselves want to do in life?I ask this because much of the undertone in the article and in this thread is about the failure of meeting the gender role expectations that are put on young men. Do they have a job and a car? Have they studied hard so they can get a good job in order to support a wife and kid?Culture in the last several decades have hammered down on the negative aspects of stereotyping. A person who is 35 has gone through a life time of TV, movie and politics that on repeat has talked about the negative of gender roles for women, while the expectations on men has remained fairly unchanged. I do not find it strange at all if an increasing portion of men under this culture has rejected the role put on them.Which goes back to the original question I started with. What motivates them and what do they want to do with their life? If we want to avoid the slow motion tragedy, maybe the way forward is to help them answer those question in the absent of imposed gender roles."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article suggests that you should not play too aggressive and not take continents too early (maximizing Reinforcing Feedback), because other players will then unite against you (Balancing Feedback).However, this article fails to understand that in Risk, most players are not willing to unite. In fact, if player A and player B decide to unite against me and player A had his turn and stopped me, player B is highly likely to backstab player A and then emerge as the winner.I&#39;ve found that playing very aggressively, and really get as many continents as possible within the first few turns, is the best way to win the game. I always win if I can get 2-3 continents in the first few turns, and if I fail then the game is usually won by whomever did manage to do just that.Being a turtle or &#34;mongolian horde&#34; as we call it can be interesting, but your only viable strategy is to wait for an opening while everyone else stockpiles their continental forces. If you wait too long, you&#39;re just an annoyance to the other players, but you don&#39;t actually have a good chance to win."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In our gaming group, we decided Risk just isn&#39;t that good of a game. It&#39;s old and clunky and extremely long, there are 100 other better board games now. Our main plays have been Dominion, DnD, Gloomhaven, Wingspan, and Crokinole, all of which we greatly prefer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What a clickbait article. I’m really disappointed. The premise is interesting: win every time using a  new strategy. Then, discussion about the concept and preview of the “systems thinking” mentality. Not too bad (although the bathtub example was a pretty weak way to advocate for systems thinking, maybe that’s just me but it seems even in that example to be an overly reductive and not terribly insightful method of thought, but it was enough to entertain the next section). However, during the discussion of the strategy everything falls apart. “Let the other players fight each other. Win the game every time by not participating and hoping to inconspicuously amass an incredible army such that you can take over half the board and then turn the tide in your favor in one fell swoop.” If this fails the suggestion is then to play the meta game and beg for pity. Not a single piece of data to back up the claim that this strategy wins every time. In my experience it doesn’t. It also happens to be the strategy that most every player headquartered around Russia-Asia ends up playing because you simply cant control that part of the board early on. No “systems thinking required”. The author also claims hoarding cards is “safe” and wont trigger other players to consider you a threat to the balance of the system. Well, that’s just naive either on part of the author or requires other players to be pretty green to not account for the risk card factor. In reality, another player also using systems thinking would immediately identify you as a threat because they would be tracking unit quantity flow in and out for the players on the board and using that to inform their understanding of what constitutes a threat. I think that’s the disappointment kinda summed up: this strategy doesn&#39;t work in a game where everyone uses it because it depends on your opponents not paying attention rather than you making strategic moves to win the game. The author does not sufficiently incorporate all the complexities of the game and people to yield a solved game."</p>

It’s entirely unsurprising that academics raise academics, doctors doctors, Olympians Olympians, teachers teachers, etc.It’s equally unsurprising that the ambitious children of highly educated and prosperous families themselves pursue such a similar path and achieve similar outcomes.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Copyright 1991. This was probably making the rounds of homeschooling circles I hung out in.We tend to do a sucky job of teaching math to kids. A lot of elementary school teachers are women who were encouraged to go into early education because they weren&#39;t doing so well in math and this is very much gender bias.My ex husband wasn&#39;t good at math. No one told him he should spend his days teaching little kids because of it. He was a career soldier and he just got tutored in college (by me) for his math classes. He was just expected to work at it if it didn&#39;t come naturally and he did.So we just culturally pass around this idea that math is scary and little kids can&#39;t learn it rather than going &#34;Well, adults just need to up their game and, by god, explain it better.&#34;My oldest was math phobic by the time I pulled him out of school to homeschool. My one and only goal for math was to get him over his phobia.He loves physics. I hate calculus. Calculus makes sense to him and he has read calculus books for fun.I was good at explaining the math to him and he learned lots of solid math concepts even though he likely has dyscalculia and isn&#39;t good at crunching the numbers. But I got the concepts through to him and that&#39;s more important.He&#39;s what gets called &#34;calculator dependent&#34; in some circles."</p>

Adding fractions, conceptualizing fractions to graphs, graphing functions... and that&#39;s just the first part!Most 7-year olds can barely conceptualize fractions. First/second grade math curriculums are centered around basic multiplication, shape recognition and counting.7-year olds aside, I don&#39;t even think most of the high-schooler freshmen I&#39;ve taught would be able to grasp this content."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know how I feel about this.  I&#39;ve always been good at math, and was one of five kids (out of class of 120) that took Calculus as a senior in high school in the early 1990&#39;s.  To even take Calculus as a senior, you had to have taken four years of math in the previous three years.  I was even the HS Math Champion&#34; for my state.However, when I took Calculus in High School, it was taught similarly to this.  Lots and lots and lots of math foundations, infinite series, areas under curves, and I was able to trudge through it but I didn&#39;t really grasp what it all meant or why I was doing it.  Finally, about 2/3 of the way through the year, I was working on a problem and had an &#34;oh, shit, this is just about how things are changing&#34;.  It was a Eureka moment, and entirely based on such a simple statement that was never brought up in lectures or our crusty 1960&#39;s texbook."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oil pipelines do one thing - transport oil. Not water, not milk, not corn syrup. Just oil.Rail can transport anything. Containers, tankers, even rocket booster segments.Yes, we&#39;re absolutely taking a short term hit, but investing in general purpose infrastructure that can be adapted for new technology and demands is a good thing. The continental rail network started off with coal powered steam trains, then diesel, now diesel-electric and even some pure electric locomotives. Maybe this century it will evolve past fossil fuels as well.So yes, cancel the pipeline, but in its place invest in the safety and reliability of rail networks."</p>
