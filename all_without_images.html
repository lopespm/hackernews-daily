								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I agree with most of the points raised by the author but as a Venezuelan Bitcoin is a godsend. If you live abroad and want to send remittances to your friends and family it can be pretty easy in a normal country , with wire transfers,western union and so on. If your family lives in Venezuela your options are extremely more limited.These are some of the options Venezuelans have had to use:1. Ask the money to be sent to Colombia with WU and then travel hundreds of kms to get  what usually amounts to a few hundred dollars at most.2. Use Zelle, send dollars in the US, and receive Bolivares in Venezuela. But for that you need to have an US bank account, and find a person you can trust also with an US bank account and plenty of highly volatile Bolivares in Venezuela willing to make the exchange.3. Use paypal, same as above with way higher commissions and the risk that paypal (and the other person) will fuck you.4. Buy Amazon gift cards and use the same schema above, be exposed to scams and high commisions fees.Trading bitcoins in say localbitcoins.com, you have a very liquid market and somewhat secure transactions (Bitcoins are not liberated until you check the money is in the Venezuela account). There are risks of course, especially because of BTC volatility but at least is a fast,convenient,widespread option. I wish something like that, only more stable and with less of that Tulip-craze whiff BTC has."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bought my smartphone from Hong Kong, in part because I wanted a specific variant that would be more likely to work with open-source ROM&#39;s.The seller initially requested payment via Transferwise, who sought crazy amounts of personal information and bullied me into a privacy-hostile customer agreement.  Days went by and they still hadn&#39;t activated my account.Growing frustrated, I convinced the seller to accept Bitcoin, which was comparatively instant.  The phone arrived a few days later, meanwhile the Transferwise morons still had their heads up their arses with no movement and no good explanation.  I&#39;m not a financial risk; I&#39;m a good little citizen with no red flags.  Reading between the lines my sense was their staff were overloaded or their onboarding system was simply broken.Bitcoin was incredibly helpful for me that day, and my favorite feature about the phone is the way I paid.  In addition to a great story, I&#39;ve got to admit there was something liberating and empowering about giving what felt like a big middle finger to the slow, decrepit, old-fashioned institution who couldn&#39;t even deliver on their core business proposition.  Like saying &#34;screw you, I don&#39;t need you and your crappy service anymore, come back when you can compete on merits&#34;.Whatever else you criticize about Bitcoin, it&#39;s still &#34;cash you can email&#34;, and even if that&#39;s all it ever amounts to I still find it a bloody useful innovation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There does seem to be a fundamental design issue in bitcoin and proof of work in general: Mining has economies of scale and therefore winner takes all mechanics leading to centralization.At that point the mechanism that ensures ledger integrity is the calculation that if the miner tampers with the ledger, that would destroy trust in the coin and hurt the miner in that way.But 1) that&#39;s exactly how conventional currencies work too and 2) it&#39;s actually an untested hypothesis. Who knows what would happen in a world where the economy runs on bitcoin and there&#39;s some &#34;good reason&#34; to deviate from the protocol."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I predict a rash of eventual FireEye, Cisco, and other vendor zero days in the near to mid future. If you are a nation state actor what better way to find zero days then to get the source code and find the bugs to exploit. This is the only thing that makes sense that would be worth the risk of attacking companies such as FireEye and Microsoft."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This means we do not rely on the secrecy of source code for the security of products, and our threat models assume that attackers have knowledge of source code. So viewing source code isn’t tied to elevation of riskI don&#39;t know how much of this is true. Wouldn&#39;t it be helpful for bad actors to understand how Windows defenses work looking at the code thereby increasing the risk?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Practically speaking, being a bad guy with access to Microsoft source code for a short time has very little impact or real-world relevance. They do thousands of updates a day, the build processes are lengthy and poorly documented, the overall direction of the code is subject to myriad political groups inside the company, and they&#39;re making massive improvements in multiple branches that will render that snapshot irrelevant within minutes.The &#34;best&#34; market for any such code would be... what... China? Other than the possibility of figuring out potential hacks who could make use of the code in in its sheer mass? By the time you figure out something clever your version of the code is hopelessly out of date."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a *nix sysadmin since before Google was a thing, I find articles like this frustrating and arguably dangerous.They lay out a set of &#34;rules&#34; the author has collated as a dogmatic doctrine that only a fool would not follow. But they provide no &#34;why&#34;, take absolutely no context in to account, and talk only about their perceived upsides.Anyone reading this should take each point as &#34;here&#39;s a possible thing you should go and research yourself&#34;, because there are consequences to most of these rules.I&#39;m not saying anything they&#39;ve written is wrong (though there is a lot of unsubstantiated opinion there), just that you should learn what any of these changes truly do before implementing them AND that your particular context is really important.Edit:There is a disclaimer at the top which mustn&#39;t be forgotten while reading.&gt; DISCLAIMER: Do not attempt to apply anything in this article if you do not know exactly what you are doing. This guide is focused purely on security and privacy, not performance, usability, or anything else.I do appreciate people putting work into producing this sort of content, but I think the article could be improved by phrasing the various steps as suggestions and perhaps linking out to more detailed documentation on the &#34;why&#34; elsewhere."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some omissions IMO: never let people SSH in with a password, and for the love of god, stop leaving private SSH keys on servers. Privat SSH keys should never leave your physical proximity. They should be on your laptop, or desktop, or your yubikey, but never on servers. Also SSH agent forwarding is the devil. Don&#39;t do it.Lots of really braindead advice in there too, like disabling RDRAND because there might be a backdoor.. come on.. even Linus knows that&#39;s obvious bullshit.[1][1] https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/09/11/rudest-man-in-li..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This list is cool, but I think it would be more useful with some quick notes on side effects. I think all but the most hardcore Linux lovers won&#39;t have enough breadth and depth to understand the full ramifications of many of these config changes.I&#39;m no Linux expert but even having used it for a fair number of years, I only have a shallow understanding of most of the things that are tweaked here, if I&#39;ve even heard of them at all. For example, it says &#34;kernel.kexec_load_disabled=1&#34;, and points out the threat which I can understand, but I don&#39;t know what that&#39;s used for in the first place. Perhaps it isn&#39;t really ever used for anything, but it&#39;d be nice to be told that, because my initial line of thinking is that these defaults must be defaults for a reason and that makes me hesitant to actually make any of the changes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In 2004 my brother and I developed a buttplug shaped like George W. Bush - we called it the Bushplug. Manufacturing was more expensive than we had expected but we sold about 100 of them - presumably as novelty gifts. Our price point was too high for a novelty gift and the nose was a little too pointy to be an enjoyable sex toy. We made our money back and had some fun with being featured on BoingBoing and Fleshbot. Someone tried to sue us. We sent the last of the Bushplugs to the Smithsonian&#39;s presidential museum. We made our investment back but didn&#39;t become buttplug millionaires."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In 2006/2007 I built HTMLButcher, a C++ desktop application to slice PSD/image website designs made by designers to HTML.
 In these years sites where made with tables, so for slicing a design I had to cut the images and fit then into borderless HTML tables.
I took 2 years to build it, and in this timeframe people started building sematic websites with CSS, and abandoning table-based designs.
I managed to sell 100 copies, for some reason 90% to India.
After some years without selling nothing, I open sourced it: https://github.com/RangelReale/htmlbutcher.
The good thing is that I REALLY learned C++ with this project, and this knowledge was the basis for my current company where I made a digitalsignage application in C++ that runs in some of the largest DOOH places in Brazil, in Windows, Linux and MAC (targets of HTMLButcher). So in the end it was a good investment!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I built a Tinder-like matchmaking app where users log in with their Facebook account and the app then auto-matches users by their FB likes. I thought taking the hassle out of swiping could give my app an edge over Tinder.It was working fine for a week or so before Facebook caught up and revoked my API keys (effectively killing the app). They didn&#39;t give any reason besides some vague recommendation to review their Terms of Service. A few months later at their F8 developer conference they announced they&#39;ll be launching their own matchmaking service which will work pretty the same way I built my app.Moral of the story: never trust big tech.P.S. I open sourced the app a few years ago: https://bitbucket.org/stonepillarstudios/workspace/projects/...
Feel free to fork &amp; revive."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The tweet mentions that you could &#39;just&#39; send an SWF file to someone and it played. Well, if anybody had to fix a computer, or hosted anything Flash-based during that era, then they would know that&#39;s bullshit. Sure maybe with the standalone Flash player it worked allright, but that&#39;s not how people really used Flash. Even in my experience, a single SWF running locally didn&#39;t always work across all versions of Flash player.Flash on the web only worked if you had Flash player plugin installed. Both browser and Flash updates themselves would break the Flash plugin constantly. That was across all browsers and platforms. Keeping plugins updated and reliable was a mess, for a long time there weren&#39;t even auto updates.Flash was a mess the whole time. Let&#39;s not pretend that it ever really &#34;just worked&#34; because it didn&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is true but it is a common misunderstanding imo. Nobody is arguing a tool like Flash shouldn’t exist; it should. People are arguing a runtime like Flash shouldn’t exist, and that HTML5 has all of the components that are needed to be that runtime and then some. A tool should give us what Flash did but with the HTML runtime.So why doesn’t that tool exist?Well... as far as I know it does. I’m pretty sure this is exactly what Adobe Animate is meant to be:https://www.adobe.com/products/animate.htmlSo why isn’t it causing a Flash-style revolution?In my opinion... Because of YouTube. Twitter. Etc.Before everyone had heaps of bandwidth, you needed to consume smaller files. A full 1080p video was unfathomable with the codecs, compute and network bandwidth available in the early 2000s. Swf files however were small and easy to distribute. The perfect storm occurred due to the structure of early internet, and communities like Newgrounds flourished.I honestly think Flash just got a bit stale. It stopped being new and exciting, and for animations video sites were probably going to win out anyways. For games, a lot of indie devs now target PCs and game consoles. Unity and Construct export to HTML5. People wanted to do more advanced things to the point where Flash itself started doing things like 3D rendering, at which point the appealing aspects of Flash started to make less sense anyways.Many seem to argue passionately, probably from an emotional place, that Flash was killed. Honestly, I just don’t agree. Flash was dying either way. Everyone just gradually decided to cut off the life support.The era it ushered in will be missed, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve come across a lot of similar sentiment from ex-Flash devs, who romanticise its heyday as a period of fertile creativity (true) and say that HTML5/JS/CSS/SVG is an inadequate replacement (false).In truth, the fundamental capabilities of the modern web platform matches and typically exceeds anything that was offered by Flash. What these people are really lamenting is the ease of authorship that Flash provided to non-technical users.Macromedia/Adobe provided a suite of powerful tools for authoring Flash animations and applications. There is no free equivalent available targeting HTML/JS. This is not a problem of capability in the platform technologies. It is because there is no economic incentive to make and give away such tools. What equivalents do exist in this sector cost money.When it comes to Flash, the old adage, &#34;if you&#39;re not paying for the product, you are the product&#34; holds true. The Flash authorship tools were free because 3rd party authors creating Flash content were assisting in the promulgation of a proprietary platform that was gradually replacing open web standards. Had they succeeded, Macromedia/Adobe would inevitably have looked to squeeze and monetise their domination of the web.Programmers are often accused of not understanding what Flash offered to artists. Maybe that&#39;s true, but I&#39;ve not encountered many artists who conversely understand the above."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To me, what sucks about JIRA (and would suck about any well-designed tool that replaces it) is not &#34;feature x&#34; but the entire JIRA mentality. All of it.It encourages micro-management. It encourages more and more process. It is the enemy of getting better at the DORA metrics, which requires streamlining process.tickets in JIRA are not the work itself, never was and never will be, it is a LARP of the work, but it gets taken for the central thing. This is an illusion.  Fixing a bug without filing a JIRA ticket is in itself progress. Moving a JIRA card without any other change is not. Yet the second is what&#39;s visible and therefor what&#39;s rewarded.Any problem gets solved with &#34;more JIRA &#34; which stops working when the remaining problems are caused by too much JIRA. And yet they keep trying, because it gives &#34;control&#34;. JIRA is a like metastatic tumour that will grow until it kills the host.In case the cancer metaphor didn&#39;t make it very clear, I don&#39;t like JIRA much. Yet if JIRA were to die today, the middle management who live by JIRA would replace it with something else equally bad, if not worse.Filling in missing features won&#39;t and can&#39;t fix that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a hundred small issues with Jira, but there&#39;s one huge one:  It&#39;s slow. Really, really slow.Atlassian seems to make a lot of money, so I guess they&#39;re optimising for something that matters to someone, but from my point of view I have a simple process for evaluating tools:1) Can I use it at all? 2) How many of the features I want does it have?I&#39;m pretty sure Jira would score great on the second question, but since it hard fails the first, I&#39;ll never know. And it&#39;s been slow for so many years now, I assume they have no interest or ability to fix it. And their slow drift towards cloud installs over letting people self host isn&#39;t helping them either since, embarrassingly, their cloud instances seem to be even slower.(Incidentally, there&#39;s a lot of competition in that space, but I&#39;ve been pretty happy with Clubhouse. I wouldn&#39;t mind a few more features, but it&#39;s good enough. More importantly, the UI is clean and snappy, and that hides a multitude of sins.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every bullet point says &#34;Missing...&#34;, but I feel like the main issue about Jira is that it has waaay to many features, and that it&#39;s super slow!The only bullet point I do agree with, is that Jira is missing an easy (or IMHO a minimalist / simple) interface. The tool is a mess, and the people using it are probably also using it in the wrong way, making the whole situation way worse.Don&#39;t get me wrong, I like Jira to some extent, but its performance and messy UI are really making my life harder rather than simpler."</p>

The buttons are clickable divs, not actual HTML buttons or even marked up with proper ARIA. I haven&#39;t yet ventured any further into the app.Given that the app is a WebAssembly development environment, my first guess was that it was built in WebAssembly itself, with a custom UI framework. But in fact, it&#39;s plain React, using its own home-grown components for basic things like buttons.It breaks my heart that when this project was started in 2017, some 20 years after web accessibility advocacy had started in earnest, the developer was still uninformed enough about accessibility that they would create a custom button component with no ARIA support. I suppose we could also blame the web platform for making it hard enough to customize the look of a standard button that the developer would reach for the div tag. What do we do about this?"</p>

We both tried hosting, but had same issue and couldn&#39;t play. I have to imagine that PS1 emulation would be worse?But as far as UX, it was incredibly easy get us both into a 2 player game, complete with chat, voice, and video feeds. Their buttons are mapped to keyboard inputs, so Windows users can get a gamepad working with a program like JoyToKey[1].[0] https://nes.party/[1] https://joytokey.net/en/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Slightly off topic:Something funny is happening in my native Belgium. Some people drop their fifth formal working day to become bicycle couriers, Uber drivers or whatnot in the &#34;sharing economy&#34;. The reason is taxation regimes.80% or 100% gross wage as a median income employee will hardly make any difference in net wage around there. A friend for example recently got a promotion from an entry level job (with tax discounts) to something more in line with her qualifications (without tax discounts). 600€ gross salary increase translated to 155€ net salary increase. All the rest got eaten by tax and social contributions increases.Belgium combines high formal job taxes combine with a low tax scheme meant to formalise &#34;sharing economy&#34; jobs. These enjoy super low 10% taxation up to 500€ per month. Many people actually do the math. They switch to 80% formal jobs hardly losing any income. Some actually increase their income by becoming pizza couriers or Uber drivers in their 20% time...UPDATED: corrected the net wage delta from 100 to 155€."</p>

I&#39;m kind of partial to this idea myself.But increasingly we seem a long way from achieving this. Amazon reviews have become such garbage, I&#39;ve fallen back to pretty much relying on name brands as my placeholder for product quality.There&#39;s still a lot to be said for established brands. Brands can afford widespread advertising because they have thriving businesses that generate lots of cash. Brands can get stocked in major retailers because you need decent products to make it through Walmart&#39;s buying process.These are signals that are harder to fake, and they&#39;re kind of the best we&#39;ve got right now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Skip the Amazon resellers and order direct from China on Alibaba. Their reputation system is less spammy than Amazon&#39;s.One of my areas to watch: solid state relays.Here we have yet another fake Fotek solid state relay on Amazon.[1] Note the &#34;Made in China&#34;.Here&#39;s the real thing.[2] Note the &#34;Taiwan made&#34; from the real Fotek. Costs a lot more.
That&#39;s because it will actually handle the rated current. The fakes are notorious for overheating and burning out. The real thing has overheat and surge protection, will shut off if it overheats, and can stand a big short term overload for motor starting or when a short is in the process of tripping the circuit breaker upstream.Here&#39;s a similar solid state relay from China, from the actual manufacturer.They actually provide a table which shows how much they
exaggerate the ratings. They&#39;re over-rated by 2X for
a resistive load, and 6x for an inductive load.
&#34;For a motor with rated current of 15A and the motor
is inductive load, the formula is 15A x 6 = 90A, so
you should choose to buy 100A solid state relay&#34;.For a little extra, you can have your own fake label. Minimum order 200 pcs.Here&#39;s a fake Fotek.[4] What&#39;s amusing is that this is the actual manufacturer in China selling the fakes. They&#39;re in Guangdong, and they&#39;re selling under their own name, but with a fake label. No shame.There are legit manufacturers in China selling solid state relays.[5] They put their own name on the product, show pictures of the inside their rather grubby factory, and have realistic numbers on their data sheets, along with pictures of UL certification documents. About 4x more expensive than the fakes. If you&#39;re in China and are building industrial equipment which needs these components, you need ones that won&#39;t fail and shut down a manufacturing line.Here&#39;s a teardown of a fake. [6] The fakes are just solid state switches with power ratings way beyond what their components are good for. UL warning notice about fake Fotek solid state relays.[7] UL issued that notice six years ago, and they&#39;re still on Amazon and eBay.[1] https://www.amazon.com/SSR-25-DC-AC-Solid-State-Relay/dp/B07...[2] https://www.fotek.com.tw/en-gb/product-category/143[3] https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/1PCS-SSR-10-DA-DC-Con...[4] https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/High-quality-SSR-25DA...[5] https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/SSR-S25DA-H-DC-TO-AC_...[6] https://youtu.be/DxEhxjvifyY[7] https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ul-warns-of-solid-s..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the biggest problems in science (in general) is that your reputation and therefore funding is highly tied to a particular subfield.  Everyone in a subfield knows each other and gives positive grant reviews and external tenure letters to other practitioners.  If you try to move on to new areas of research, your reputation and funding are gone.  The outcome is that areas of research interest become quasi-permanent, even when they are no longer interesting. I talk to the people today that still work in my specialty of nuclear physics (relativistic heavy ion physics) and I&#39;m shocked at how little intellectual progress has been made.  At the risk of offending people it&#39;s time to give up and declare victory, but the consequences would be dire (hundreds of professors all over the world without grants)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In computer science, researchers who had spent decades working on feature engineering for images got completely blown out of the water by deep learning.  All those decades of papers would never get another cite.  Everyone moved on.String theory doesn&#39;t actually do anything though, so there&#39;s no way to say it&#39;s better or worse than anything else.  It&#39;s like someone saying they&#39;re working on solving the halting problem or something and eventually they&#39;ll get there and they&#39;ve been working on it for 20 years without any code that actually works.  At some point, you just have to give up and do something else.  They keep getting grants to work on this stuff though for some reason.  Someone needs to interview the people who are giving out string theory grants and ask them why the heck they are still giving these people money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"1. Don&#39;t try too hard to make science funding more efficient / market lead or whatever - just fund more - double the science budget tomorrow And again every five years for a generation.  We are about to go through a societal refactoring with solar / electric / digital / climate change hitting at once.  Spending a few quid to help out the fundamentals won&#39;t hurt anyone.2. The above might upset people but string theory is a good example - partly yes people are held hostage by funding (much like it&#39;s hard to avoid being typecast as an actor).  But the solution to that is to fund lots more (experimental) movies, not to hope studio heads can pick better winners.I am perfectly happy for a slice of my tax dollar to go on someone thinking about Pram theory (#) for a decade simply because we have no idea whatsoever how to tackle the big ones in physics, so spray and pray is going to be a lot better than most other options.(#) Red Dwarf episode. worth watching episode just for this joke."</p>

In Switzerland a law that would have changed this was recently rejected. Hopefully another country makes the first step."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Recently, Apple&#39;s supplier, Wistron faced revolt after treating workers unfairly here in India. And India is not really the most shining example of protecting our workers from unfair and harsh working conditions. So, if such treatments don&#39;t fly here, I don&#39;t think they will fly anywhere else. The kind of labor expectation that these companies have after their stints in China is ethically incompatible with most other countries. So, I can&#39;t see the condition improving in the near future, companies will continue chasing profits at all cost and China will remain the most fertile ground to do that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Traditionally slavery was an alternative to death for the conquered.  I&#39;m morbidly curious what the effects of all Western corporations banning slave labor would be.  I doubt it would result in liberation.  Would working conditions for the slaves worsen when they worked for local, lower-margin factories instead?  I can&#39;t imagine them improving.I have little faith in legal remedies to liberate slaves.  Arming them seems the only long-term effective solution.  Otherwise the man with the gun will order the slave back to work the second the man in the wig isn&#39;t looking.  And the man in the wig will remain silent, to avoid revealing his impotence.Slave labor is inefficient, so perhaps the best way is to topple inefficient slave societies through full-spectrum competition, from military to economic.  This pressure incentivizes efficient human resource utilization.One thing&#39;s for sure:  Individual Westerner guilt over whether to buy the next iPhone will add zero value."</p>

With the latter two also not needing subzero temps."</p>

The faster they put that existing supply into people, the faster they are done.  They could be done with the pandemic by the end of January."</p>

Wikileaks does not concern itself with this phase. Yet, the CIA’s Pompeo is trying to paint a narrative that Wikileaks is doing this by labeling them a “non-state intelligence agency”, thereby justifying the CIA’s actions to attack Wikileaks.In brief:Narrative #1 - the CIA attacking an “Idealistic Free Information Publisher”.Narrative #2 - the CIA attacking a “Non-state Dark Intelligence Agency”The CIA is actively trying to create Narrative #2, which is a bit concerning."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m one of those people who is entirely bemused by violent videogames and films (I&#39;m sure there are plenty of people who would be bemused by my pastimes too). I&#39;m not trying to argue to stop anyone doing it, but I would really like to understand it better.Many video games are essentially simulators of things that we&#39;re prevented from doing in reality, because of the laws of nature or society. Whether that&#39;s dropping blocks into place, building a city, chasing and eating ghosts, flying a plane, performing magic spells, or engaging in physical violence.And there&#39;s a never-ending push to make experiences more photorealistic, to make simulator even better. From that I can only conclude that people want to get as close to the experience of perfoming the prevented act as possible.Chopping someone up is heavily frowned upon in real life, but perfectly acceptable to emulate in someone&#39;s living room. Somehow the simulation escapes the taboo. And that escape seems to be absolute: In the range of violent acts you could commit, from a gentle nudge to grisly murder, simulation of the most extreme extent is permitted.But if that&#39;s the case, why is the realistic simulation of some societal taboos (e.g. physical violence to the point of murder) mainstream, but others (e.g. sexual violence in any of its forms) not? They are both very serious offences, but somehow one gets a free pass to let anyone pretend to do it, but the other not.Is it a reflection on the ultimate limits of those taboos in the society that produces most of these games? Or is my logic broken somewhere?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of when I was at grad student in that area. It was really frustrating to read all of the studies from e.g. Anderson and Bushman asserting the links between violent media and aggression.These publications were headline-grabbing, but some of the study design was laughable. The whole state of affairs led me to leave the discipline (which led me to a career as a software engineer). I&#39;m glad that I did, because the reproducibility crisis hit hard within a few years of me deciding to do something else with my life.Some of the studies that I read made me think that there was a link between frustration (caused by e.g. undesirable outcomes in videogames, or performance issues like high latency) and aggression, but of course the researchers assumed it was the violence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s worse than I thought. They measure &#34;aggressive behavior&#34; based on a questionnaire.They look for a correlation between the &#34;class&#34; of gamer; literally &#34;people who play a lot at younger ages, drop, and then increase&#34;, &#34;people who play a moderate amount at younger ages, drop and then slightly increase&#34;, and &#34;people who play only a little bit at a young age but increase&#34; and report no correlation between those classes and the aggression assessment based on the questionnaire.I admire the fact that they didn&#39;t do more work to p-hack their way into a correlation; they went with one methodology and showed that it didn&#39;t produce a correlation, and reported that. But even though I agree with the article&#39;s conclusion, I don&#39;t think the data support it in any meaningful way."</p>

I think the issue is that they&#39;re aggressively smoothing the motion since mechanical systems don&#39;t have the ability to accelerate &amp; jerk as fast as biological systems. Cheap mocap animation has the same problem because the frame rate of the capture system is too low.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked at a company that heavily used the maps API in 2018. The 1,400% price hike really was an eye opener. It wasn&#39;t just the money involved, which was large, but the fact that it came so suddenly and with so much magnitude.Google&#39;s choice to bump these prices made me realize that they could do the same thing with their compute cloud pricing or other APIs, again with little notice. That, in turn, led to the realization that we needed to remove our reliance on Google&#39;s entire stack, and quickly, or we&#39;d be in a terrible bargaining position later.This one choice by the maps team likely cost Google significantly in the medium to long term, if any other companies realized the same things we did."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really want to use Apple Maps full time on my iPhone, just because of how much clutter Google Maps has accumulated on the screen.If anything tells me Google is losing the ability to innovate it&#39;s the newly added pill buttons for pre-set searches and branded POIs on the map. I remember when this was added to MapQuest circa 2010, and was the transition from trying to have an excellent mapping experience to just adding revenue focused features.Google is still operating from an extremely strong position, by nature of having nearly infinite budget and owning their mapping and search dataset. It&#39;s concerning that the iOS app seems to be suffering from the same issues that preceded the gradual downfall of MapQuest from a product perspective."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great article, but I think the conclusion about Google Maps languishing because it’s a low margin product is wrong.While Google Maps as a distinct product has a bottom and top line I think the author underestimates the value that the underlying places data has for Google’s core search product.The local place data is _massivley_ important to search. I don’t see any foreseeable way Google let’s the product that generates it languish. It’s far too strategic for them. Not to mention the amount of brand value maps has for them as an ecosystem.My view is that as Google’s Maps advantage dwindles, they’ll do more and more strategic acquisitions of places data sources. Tying more data into their closed ecosystem. Whether the new tech anti-trust landscape in the US and EU allows this is another question."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In-person social organizations.Social isolation is probably the biggest cause of unhappiness in advanced countries. Having a strong social network has lots of advantages including providing better romantic and career opportunities, as well as improving physical and psychological health.Humans have a long history of dishing out lots of money to be parts of strong communities too--country clubs and fraternities have high fees. Church goers regularly give up 10% of their (gross) income to be part of that group. Cult members might even hand over ALL of their possessions to join.The camaraderie and experiences that go along with being part of a strong, long lived community tends to be the thing people value most in life. Yet finding those communities has become increasingly difficult in the modern era. People move away to different cities, or just don&#39;t run into the same set of people everyday. With the rise of remote work, social disconnection is only going to rise. I think there&#39;s a lot of room to create new social organizations with pretty minimal technology, and make a pretty profit from doing so. Humans are still human--they want those connections--they mostly just need an introduction."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Premium-feeling laptops that aren&#39;t Apple machines.Yes yes, I get the economical barriers. I&#39;m past caring. It is so incredibly frustrating to look outside the Apple ecosystem and feel like the entire PC industry is content to sell the bare minimum of quality (outside of Gamer hardware, which looks obscene - but I get that it&#39;s subjective).It&#39;s a horrible business idea on the numbers and nobody would do this, but if some lunatic out there wants to blow the money, build and sell a laptop at whatever price point you want that:- Supports CoreBoot- Isn&#39;t a rebranded Clevo shell and has close enough fit and finish to a recent MacBook. Read: No. Plastic. Case.- If there is ever the phrase &#34;panel lottery&#34; uttered about your machine, you&#39;ve messed up.- No logos, or throw them on the underside like Purism.- The screen has to be relatively close to the MacBook in brightness + viewing angles. Give me an option for a glossy screen.- Trackpad must be glass. You won&#39;t get close to the MBP trackpad on the first or second pass, but try.- Go for some crazier vertical integration ala the M1. I don&#39;t care if it blocks upgrading certain parts, since I consider the industry to move fast enough that I won&#39;t _want_ the machine anymore in 4-5 years.- There is no need for touch of any kind, nor the ability to flip the screen or anything. Just make a damn laptop.- Edit: high quality boutique feeling support. I don&#39;t need an Apple Store equivalent, but at least invest in this.I get why Apple can do all of the above. I would pay literally twice what I pay Apple for a competing product. Currently, every laptop that I try feels like stepping back a few years.The upcoming Purism Librem 14, in terms of images, feels like it could _feel_ close - but I&#39;m not impressed with their other products so I&#39;ll believe it when I see it. I remain shocked that System76 hasn&#39;t bothered with this.End my rant about this industry, I guess."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Standardized interchangeable packaging for consumer goods.Ever been to a book store in Japan? Practically every book is the same size. As a result, bookshelves also are designed to be the right size to optimally fit books. This allows people to fit more books in small homes. It makes books easier to transport in book-sized boxes and book-sized bags too. You can get perfectly-fitting reusable cloth covers to protect your library books.American bookstores are a war between publishers to stick out from the shelves as much as possible. There&#39;s not much that a bookshelf designer can do except guess and have adjustable, oversized shelving.That also describes the state of today&#39;s packaging. With more shopping happening online, the need for items to stand out on a shelf is lower, and the need for them to fit nicely in boxes is much higher.Nobody would force you to design your products to fit the closest available standard package size, but companies would tend to do so more often because of the efficiency gains. Logistics companies like Amazon or Fedex could offer incentives."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A bit off-topic but related to the intro in this readme..&gt; Why?
&gt; I&#39;m super bored in lockdown. Add a Raspberry Pi 400 and a few tiny displays...I feel like there are two distinct kinds of lockdown experience. One, you have kids, and you have absolutely no free time because now your kids are home and you&#39;re working from home. Two, you don&#39;t have kids, and you&#39;re super bored every day. Seems like not much in between."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is a weird spot in the display market that is painful as a embedded developer:Displays under 400x240 pixels, usually the gfx buffer can be managed in the ram of the MCU. Nothing fancy needed, can get decent framerate on SPI bus running at 16 MHz. Anything above this range gets super ugly: no good displays exist and if they do, they&#39;re expensive or outdated (800x480 resolution is basically impossible to obtain). Furthermore, driving this display requires crazy shit like multiple SPI channels (QSPI), or some neutered version of DSI protocol...impossible to find docs for and if they have docs, theyre in Chinese.Then there are ultra high resolution displays, for e.g. cell phone market or laptop screens. You&#39;re now looking an entirely different beast. MIPI/DSI hardware support is required and a bunch of NDAs, need dedicated GPU and a proper linux running.Ideal display tech would be 5&#34;inch diagonal, OLED (low power consumption), 800x480 (or similar) and can be run using ARM Cortex-M4 or similar microcontroler arch. That would open up opportunities for so many device categories that doesn&#39;t exist today. Imagine a VT100 terminal clone running on 8&#34; 1024x768 resolution screen with a cheap ESP32 + display driver chip. Or a slightly more beefy Cortex-M7 running zephyr/linux. So many things we could build."</p>

Fluorocarbons are basically magic when it comes to repelling water.Nordic skiing (and to a lesser extent, downhill skiing) have been going through a bit of a reckoning trying to remove them from competitions. Fluorowaxes are very effective for gliding quickly in wet conditions. The fact that they are melted during application makes them particularly pernicious.Fluorocarbons are also ubiquitous in water repelling in clothing. Some of the more expensive brands of outdoor wear have moved to shorter chain fluorocarbons, but they haven&#39;t eliminated their use. From Arcteryx: &#34;... non-PFC [water repellant] treatments... have fallen short of the level of performance and durability we deem imperative&#34;. It&#39;s likely less urgent with clothing, since these compounds are quite stable when left alone at normal temperatures."</p>

If you use offsets and you’re on page 10, and someone deletes an item on page 1, the whole list shifts and you can accidentally skip an item on page 11. Likewise if someone adds an item on page 1 and you’re on page 10, one of the page 10 items will also show up on page 11.Cursors elegantly sidestep these issues."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think that cursor should be used more with realtime data and more stable data like products in an e-commerce shop should use paginated queries.There&#39;s many UX benefits for paginated queries. It gives customer a clear overview of how many products there are and customer can also navigate faster to get a better understanding of what general prices are. If the table/list doesn&#39;t have good filters, customer can easily act out binary search to find what they are looking for in an ordered list of items.Same with highscores, forums threads and other similar things. Say you are browsing highscores and you want to see what scores are around 10000th position etc.As a user I find having only prev/next buttons a bit claustrophobic in this case. I think UX should trump whatever performance gains there are from it."</p>

Assuming everyone knew one of their grandparents, it&#39;s more like 40 interpersonal &#34;links&#34;.I honestly feel like if Europe didn&#39;t have the Early Middle Ages (~500-1000AD), we would feel pretty connected to all the history that happened before in the same way that we feel pretty connected to Copernicus developing Heliocentrism or Columbus arriving in the New World.I wonder whether civilizations with seemingly more continuous histories like China feel more connection to the rest of their history. India&#39;s history was sort of interrupted by Islamic invasions starting from the 1200s. The Middle East, despite its tremendously long history, experienced a significant shift in culture with the rise of Christianity and then Islam.If Chinese people don&#39;t feel that historical connection, on the other hand, it might mean that our disconnect with ancient history might more just be a product of Modernity and the rapid change of the last couple centuries."</p>

The &#34;ask a question&#34; and &#34;support this site&#34; buttons on my website are next to each other. I get 15 questions for every donation. About 30€ per 100 000 visitors, from 1-3 visitors. Those who email me with questions never donate. I&#39;m not complaining about any of this, just illustrating my point: you can&#39;t use gratitude as a metric for the value of your work.Critics, on the other hand, are disproportionately loud. As a community moderator, I learned that for every complainer, there are dozens of quietly happy users. You can only tell by the votes. No one will create a thread to say &#34;everything is fine, keep it up&#34;.If someone made your day easier, or if they created something good, take a minute to thank them. If they saved you a ton of work, consider a small donation. A lot of people are tirelessly, thanklessly creating things that benefit you. It costs nothing to acknowledge it. Never let a compliment go unused.In the last few years, I became better at expressing my gratitude to creators, maintainers, colleagues and friends."</p>

I was working on multiple mobile apps for a company, and they had a deep link setup that was incredibly basic: &lt;scheme&gt;://&lt;integer&gt;, which would take you to an article with a simple incrementing ID.  This deep link system “just worked” on iOS and Android; take the URL, grab the host, parse it as an int, grab that story ID. Windows Phone, however… the integers we were parsing out were totally wrong, returning incredibly old stories!Turned out that the host we were given by the frameworks from the URL was auto-converted to an IP in dotted-quad format, and then the int parser was just grabbing the last segment… which meant that we were always getting stories &lt;256, instead of the ~40000 range we were expecting."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My dad had a similar story about a bug report. This was back in the day when terminals still used paper rather than CRTs; actual teletypes. The bug report was something like &#34;if I print a page feed on such and such terminal model, it will catch fire.&#34;The bug report form (which was paper in those days) had a few of the usual checkboxes and fields to fill in, including one for &#34;is the problem reproducible?&#34; That box was checked. Someone had actually gone to the effort of standing by their terminal with a fire extinguisher, running the same command and putting out the fire when it caught fire again.It turns out the problem was in some software that emulated page feeds by doing repeated line feeds. Some overflow or underflow bug caused an integer to wrap around, so instead of advancing a few lines to the next page, it would try to advance thousands or millions of lines. This particular terminal model was a new, high speed one, so it would try to advance the paper really fast. It was using those perforated strips at the sides, with the pegs that went into the holes. The pegs and holes weren&#39;t perfectly aligned, so the pegs would sometimes clip the holes a bit, causing some bits of paper to shred and get kicked up as dust. Along with a spark, I don&#39;t recall if it was from the motor or just static buildup caused by the friction of the paper, and the paper dust would ignite, causing the terminal to catch fire.I just love the image of whoever submitted that bug report, seeing the &#34;is it reproducible&#34; checkbox on the form, and standing by the terminal with a fire extinguisher to put it out while doing the same thing to make sure the problem was reproducible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tell me if this is a bug...After driving a new car to work for 2 years, the traction control started kicking in on certain curves. I take a windy road to work and had never had traction control activate. When it kicked in, it pulsed the right front brake and slowed the car quickly, likely unnerving the guy tailgating me. This happened several times, both going to and from work. The road was perfectly dry, no snow or rain. Same turns at the same speed as always.The clues are was that my rear tires had worn and I replaced them a few days before. And, I drive a Tesla Model 3. It&#39;s a rear-wheel drive version and the front tires still had good tread so I didn&#39;t replace them.Why the right front tire?What I finally brained out, which you may have quickly realized, is that the diameters of the worn front and new rear tires were then slightly different. The front had a lower diameter than the rear and therefore turned at a slightly faster rate when driving.When I took a hard bank, the outside wheels also turned faster than the inside as they do in any turn. That increased the delta in spin rate the most between the outside worn front tire and the inside new rear tire. The traction control determined that the right front must be slipping and pulsed the brake on it.I replaced the front tires and everything went back to normal."</p>

I didn&#39;t come across any other images that reproduced the issue, only this one photo. The underlying bug was a buffer overrun of some sort, was fixed before shipping -- and the image became a part of the durable regression test suite for that department."</p>

[...]  The really clever bit is that although this replacement Ψ placates (calms) our immune system, it is accepted as a normal U by relevant parts of the cell.&#34;This sounds like a serious backdoor or attack vector to me - would there be any risk in introducing this Ψ, allowing some natural occuring permutations to turn wild or dangerous?"</p>

From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn&#39;t quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn&#39;t make up my mind which of the figs I would choose.

Instead of finishing college I joined the military after the stock market collapse in 2008/9. Impressions were left on me throughout my early life that I only came to know as an adult. My family got sick, I ruined the relationship that I&#39;d worked for, and at times I alienated people close to me out of my own sense of self-defense. I pushed myself to the brink repeatedly. My twenties were filled with stress, frustration, confusion, and at times anger. These things taught me acceptance and forgiveness of both myself and others. Looking back, I would not trade them for an easier or more prestigious life.When I came back from Afghanistan I had to scratch, claw, and climb a ladder without a degree thanks in much part to people who saw in me what I could only hoped to have seen in myself. I looked around me when I arrived and I saw Ivy League and top school graduates with multi-million dollar homes, Teslas, and their own literal fig trees in their back yards that complained about everything in life. I&#39;ve now had the opportunity to live in multiple cultures with varying degrees of prosperity. These things taught me to know my value but to have perspective on what I&#39;m really asking for.Here I am considering selling all my belongings, buying a truck and an RV to go embrace the new open road that is remote work. Life isn&#39;t about looking back. It isn&#39;t even about getting what you want. It&#39;s about navigating the road in front of you and making the best of the opportunities in front of you and for everyone around you.

I concur with that).The thing which bothers me is upbeat comments about living here and now and planting the seeds for future changes. It feels like current problems (and desire to wish them away via woulda/counda/shoulda) didn&#39;t happen entirely randomly. These problems are a result of systematic behavior/decision making.As an example, it&#39;s too easy to say to yourself, &#34;I will start doing sport tomorrow&#34;. However, you wake up tomorrow and notice that your day is so busy that you don&#39;t have time to do sport until 9pm and by that time you are exhausted and can&#39;t do sport. And you repeat the cycle saying, &#34;maybe tomorrow&#34;. You start teasing your day apart and find that to squeeze in sport won&#39;t require you just to add it, but also to kick something out. And that all the things you have the energy for in the day, you implicitly regarded as more important than sport. And as a result, you are stuck in the loop wishing to do something better but being limited by your other priorities.And frankly, this bothers me way more. The immutability of the past is normal. Being so set in your ways that you can&#39;t change the future - this is what scares the shit out of me."</p>

When the lawyers, regulators, law enforcement, and litigious people want to get you, you&#39;ll have to defend every edit back to beginning of time.&#34;Yes, we know what the final contract says, but based on your edit on January 7, 2003, at 5:21 pm and 0.210403 microseconds, your real intent was ...&#34;.  &#34;And then on June 12, 2006, you took out some words that have a bearing on this lawsuit -- obviously you were trying to cover things up.&#34;I was quite surprised to learn that during patent litigation for example, the history and changes made to your application do matter. I assumed that the final patent as issued is what matters and everything else is irrelevant. Well, lawyers have made it matter, and now things will be 10,000 times worse when they want to find something to argue.So great, now we have to worry about how someone might interpret every single edit rather than the final document."</p>

Are the bindings for other languages usable? Is it possible to have my frontend emit LLVM IR in a text format, similarly to how you can feed assembly language source code to an asssembler?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Walking in circles within the house and talking to myself out loud: I do this all the time, especially when I need to figure out a particularly hard problem (an algorithm to solve a particular issue, an architecture that handles my business needs etc).Last time I started a new project and worked on its architecture, I walked over 10km in a single day, according to my cellphone pedometer. In a tiny apartment! This trend lasted for a month, after which I sat down to actually implement this.I thought it was just me being autistic but it&#39;s interesting to know others do it as well :)I never worked in an office setting, but I can only imagine it would be extremely prejudicial to people like me and the author. Restraining us to a table would limit our output for the sole reason we would be unable to pace and think (no space and too much social pressure).Anecdata: sometimes I visit my parents and work from their place. I can&#39;t pace there because I don&#39;t feel comfortable doing so, and that alone is enough for me to not be able to tackle challenging problems there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To solve a problem, we need to be smarter than the problem - or the problem needs to be dumber than us.When vocalizing something, you&#39;re forced to constrict the blob of complexity you&#39;re carrying in your head into a linear narrative, which is by definition simpler. Now that you have simplified the problem you are more likely to get hold of it and solve it.This happens all the time - when I am solving a technical/logical problem, sometimes I feel like my wife thinks I am just staring blankly at the screen day-dreaming. So I get insecure and start to explain to her how hard the problem is, but because she&#39;s a physician I have to translate it into common language first, and 99% of the time I say &#34;never mind, got it&#34; before I have a chance to really bore her.Come to think of it, this may be how therapy works. You are forced to take all the &#34;mess&#34; that&#39;s in your head and narrate it to someone else, in the process getting much simpler perspective on it.Writing is the same way for me. For example, all the ideas in this post were in my head in some amorphous way, but now that I wrote them out they became neat little analogies I can use in the future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is partly why Rubber Duck Debugging[1] can sometimes work, especially if you&#39;re vocalising the steps. I&#39;ve often started typing a question on Stackoverflow when suddenly I solved the issue just by the act of verbalising the question as I type.I&#39;ve found this to also help when I&#39;m doing any sort of creative work or brainstorming, simply talking and explaining as if I&#39;m presenting to an audience helps me generate ideas. Never spoken out loud to myself in public though...[1]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"E Ink is a great example of how the patent system stifles innovation.One company developed a small, expensive, newspaper-quality electrophoretic display with a refresh rate so terrible it was only suitable for books, decided that that was good enough, and 15 years later every comment in this thread is looking forward to finally seeing some innovation in this space &#34;once the patents expire.&#34;That is some first class bullshit. We could have had large form, glossy brochure quality displays with video refresh rates by now, but nobody outside of China wanted to get anywhere near this patent minefield."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a 13.3-inch Dasung e-ink monitor, and use it daily for three to six hours (basically, whenever I use my PC). Some days ago the HDMI cable it came with broke, so before I had the opportunity to replace it, I had to switch back to an LED monitor for the time being. Well, surely anyone can already guess what happened... After just a couple of days, I came upon a long forgotten enemy: eye fatigue. Blurry vision, trouble focusing it, and a light headache.Like many others here, I wish the technology could have advanced faster and been made more accessible for everyone. Without the obstacles it still faces, I&#39;m sure we would already have color screens with a good refresh rate. C&#39;est la vie."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It looks like the breakthrough here is in making a large (bigger than e-reader-sized) e-paper display available as a self-contained, HDMI-compatible monitor instead of just a display assembly for OEMs and experienced DIYers.While I don’t expect this to also be a breakthrough in terms of pricing, hopefully it starts driving the volume that will eventually make this type of display more accessible."</p>

Some copy the questions and answers verbatim, some use machine translation to (crappily) translate them into my native language. Sometimes they even rank higher than the real StackOverflow.I really wish there was a non-hacky way to ban sites from Google search results.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One big reason why Pinterest ranks so highly, and why you are seeing different tld&#39;s in the results, is because they have a variety of tld&#39;s that they use and those tld&#39;s all have separate crawl budgets from each other. So Google crawls Pinterest about an order of magnitude more than most other sites.

Having Linux available makes it easier to port emulators and fb or console games.&gt; Most importantly, because I can.Good. All I can say is at least it is something different to what I keep seeing on HN. (React, Rust, Kubernetes, JAMstack, JavaScript, etc.)Probably present this somewhere in a conference (CCC, FOSDEM, etc). Who knows who could be looking at this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To be clear, this is a tech demo; we&#39;re long past the point where running anything useful on a system with graphics and 4MB (8MB with expansion) of RAM under Linux is reasonable. You can barely get the kernel itself that small. There&#39;s a reason why even cheapo consumer routers have at least 64MB of RAM.So it&#39;s for fun; you won&#39;t be able to run any existing &#34;normal&#34; Linux emulators and you&#39;d be better off porting stuff to run on bare metal than trying to squeeze it in under Linux on an N64. Cool project, fun, great that it&#39;s getting upstreamed... just keep in mind it&#39;s not really useful for end users for anything (unlike, say, Wii Linux, where with ~80MB of RAM you can actually get somewhere, though still with many limitations).OTOH, as other people have mentioned, it makes a good test case for N64 emulators. If they can run this, that&#39;s good validation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is, of course, cool. No doubt. I have an EverDrive 64 and I’ll probably test this out later today or tomorrow.I am skeptical that this would be the preferred way to port emulators or graphical games. You’re not getting a budget SGI workstation out of this, because the OS kernel itself is only a small part.The N64 is built around a chip called the Reality Control Processor, or RCP. This contains the RSP, stripped-down MIPS CPU core with a fixed-point SIMD vector unit, and the RDP, a rasterization engine that does simple trilinear texture interpolation and color blending. This is the hard part of programming the N64, and it’s not something that’s addressed by swapping out the OS kernel.There are… a number of major challenges you will still have to face if you want to make homebrew software for the N64, unless you are okay with just having something on the CPU and writing to the framebuffer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the original paper&gt;&gt; SrTiO3 is a suitable photocatalytic material for the assessment of this possibility. This compound is a well characterized photocatalyst with a bandgap energy of 3.2 eV (ref. 11–14), and its EQE for overall water splitting has been improved by up to 69% over the past years using various refinements.Here, we increased the EQE to its upper limit by constructing highly active HER and OER cocatalysts on SrTiO3:Al particles site-selectively. This was accomplished by using a stepwise photodeposition method instead of an impregnation process, which results in random dispersion of the cocatalysts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The abstract of the paper makes it sound good:&gt;Overall water splitting, evolving hydrogen and oxygen in a 2:1 stoichiometric ratio,  using particulate photocatalysts is a potential means of achieving scalable and economically viable solar hydrogen production. To obtain high solar energy conversion efficiency, the quantum efficiency of the photocatalytic reaction must be increased over a wide range of wavelengths and semiconductors with narrow bandgaps need to be designed. However, the quantum efficiency associated with overall water splitting using existing photocatalysts is typically lower than ten per cent1,2. Thus, whether a particulate photocatalyst can enable a quantum efficiency of 100 per cent for the greatly endergonic water-splitting reaction remains an open question. Here we demonstrate overall water splitting at an external quantum efficiency of up to 96 per cent at wavelengths between 350 and 360 nanometres, which is equivalent to an internal quantum efficiency of almost unity, using a modified aluminium-doped strontium titanate (SrTiO3:Al) photocatalyst3,4. By selectively photodepositing the cocatalysts Rh/Cr2O3 (ref. 5) and CoOOH (refs. 3,6) for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively, on different crystal facets of the semiconductor particles using anisotropic charge transport, the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions could be promoted separately. This enabled multiple consecutive forward charge transfers without backward charge transfer, reaching the upper limit of quantum efficiency for overall water splitting. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of overall water splitting free from charge recombination losses and introduces an ideal cocatalyst/photocatalyst structure for efficient water splitting.Not so sure about the fuelcellsworks article clickbaiting up the &#39;quantum&#39; bit when all it means is one photon splitting one H2O."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Illiad.  As the foundation of Western literature, it may have received the greatest amount of hype that it is possible to receive.I had attempted to read it and The Odyssey when I was much younger, in middle school, maybe too young, and failed miserably.  But as it is always with cultural touchstones, references to it are inescapable, and a few years ago, in my mid 50s I overcame the reluctance accumulated in the intervening time and set out to read the Samuel Butler prose translation of 1898.  Most of the translations I&#39;d previously approached were in verse, which is in some ways its own hill to climb when one is customarily a prose reader, so this seemed perfect.And so it was, and I was bowled over.  It was a mind bending experience for me the likes of which I experience much to infrequently as age and experience take their toll on the novelties of youth.  I can&#39;t say the last work I read I experienced as electrically.  For all the stiltedness of epic story telling, the personalities of Agamemnon, Achilles, Zeus, et al are both vivid and convincing; the violence of battle is  horrible, electric, and wierdly beautiful in a way that will resonate recognizably with fans Sam Peckinpaugh or Hong Kong action movies.  Though the characterizations are far more stereotyped, as befits the age in which it was produced, than modern readers are accustomed to, they still evince a polish that rises above conventional story telling into true literature.  Worth every ounce of effort you expend to summit this one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Wire.I&#39;d tried to watch it a few times, but only a few months ago actually got past the first two episodes. I think it helped that I quite quickly saw it as a morally ambiguous discussion of the institutional ineptitude of conservative western cultures in mitigating the effects of crime, rather than a typical &#39;good vs bad&#39; cop show.With that mindset, the possibly-underwhelming finale of S1 is much more effective, and the sudden pace-change in S2 is more meaningful."</p>

It taught me how someone who needs to invent a differential should think about the problem."</p>

The best and cheapest way to learn is use an app: Simply Piano(android+ios), Piano Marvel(ios), etc and connect it to an el cheapo midi keyboard.this allows you to spend the next 6 months learning without anyone getting disturbed..while the app gives you realtime feedback about which keys you are pressing.you wont miss the lack of a teacher...especially during the lockdown.dont buy an expensive piano. Dont buy books and methods. Learning this way is like playing a game...and arguably much better than Cyberpunk 2077 ;)"</p>

That team is only available by phone. That team has a 1 hour wait time during the hours that they are open. That team likes to hang up on you.  That team calls you back from numbers that cannot accept calls.  That team is not available by chat or email and every other department has no access in the tools to effectively cancel a service.I escalated to the crtc and opened a case. I got a call back from someone who was very good at apologising for this policy but was at the same time very clear that this was within their legal rights as a service provider.Super convenient that I can sign up to any service with one click though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am pretty sure Baremetrics wouldn&#39;t be able to do business in California with that policy.CA passed a law in 2018 requiring companies that allow people to signup online to also allow them to cancel online https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtm...&#34;In addition to the requirements of subdivision (b), a consumer who accepts an automatic renewal or continuous service offer online shall be allowed to terminate the automatic renewal or continuous service exclusively online&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I owe my career and livelihood to Ruby, Rails and the community. When I started learning programming I was overwhelmed because of c, c++ and JavaScript. Tried a bit of Python too. 
I thought I would never get a hold of any programming language ever. One day I tried this mysterious language from Japan(That&#39;s how I knew Ruby at the time) on tryruby.org. Ruby was breath of a fresh air. Code read like English. I was making small CLIs which required so much work in every other language. That was enough to get me hooked. Then I learned about Rails and never looked back.
Happy to see this language making new strides with this release. This is a thank you note to Matz and the community."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember when Rails first was released. I kept the source code for Ruby and for Rails handy, and it was sort-of possible to wrap my head around both. One of the most fun non-AI conferences that I ever went to was Merb Camp in San Diego where the Merb team announced merging with Rails.I have such good memories of the four or five years when Ruby was my main driver. Great job by Matz and core team with the 3.0 release.I have gone back to my 1980s roots and now once gain use Common Lisp as my main driver, except for deep learning where I need to use Python (tried Julia and Swift).I think Matz has it exactly right. As programmers it is important to be happy using a language. Life should be fun most of the time, and there is nothing wrong with trying to optimize life for maximum joy we bring to ourselves and other people.BTW, happy holidays!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been working as a developer for9 years. For most of that time I gravitated toward the DevOps/SRE/Platform niche because I care about quality, but the process of developing resilient, maintainable and clean code in all the languages I had used seriously (PHP, Python, JavaScript, C, Go) just didn’t work with my mind. I couldn’t wrap my head around it and make myself apply the discipline.A year ago I was dropped in as the lead on a large Ruby project. Suddenly everything clicked. Now all the reading I’ve done on domain driven design and TDD actually has meaning and I’ve written more solid code in a year than the rest of my career combined.And on top of that, while every corner of tech has its toxic personalities, the Ruby community is overwhelmingly friendly, welcoming and mature."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Too bad, maps.me was by far the best maps application for non city use, and ideal for hiking. Commendable initiative to bring it back in its original version!A few examples of why it was so great:Simple, non social bookmarks. As in: place a bookmark so you don&#39;t get lost while hiking, or when you find a nice spot you want to come back to later. Yep, a utility feature that doesn&#39;t somehow map to some stoopid business OKR in advertising. I am sure this is possible with Google maps or Apple maps somehow, but only after you&#39;ve created an account, logged in, and made sure you have the equivalent of a South Korean inner city internet connection.Also, easily downloadable maps that just stay on your phone. I am hiking, I don&#39;t have internet and need the map on my phone. 
I know Google Maps allows you to do that but it is tedious unlike maps.me, which is instant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is an existing f-droid version of Maps.me [1] and this looks like a separate effort.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One time when I was younger, in my late teens, I was walking through the city around 8pm. I suddenly felt rather cold, and went through the typical 15 seconds of internal grumbling. I then had an epiphany, and walked into a nearby department store to purchase a jacket. Somehow I&#39;d never even considered that as a possibility previously.As silly as it may seem, I use that singular point in time as the reference for when I commenced adulthood. I&#39;ve got no idea if others have similar experiences (I grew up very poor, so I was probably primed against the idea of spontaneously buying something to begin with), but the contents of this list seems to be very much in the same vein."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of an old video of Steve Jobs. His idea is simple, but it&#39;s really powerful. In short: the world is something you can change, not merely participate in.When you grow up, you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world, try not to bash into the walls too much, try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money.That’s a very limited life. Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact, and that is that everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.And the minute that you understand that you can poke life and actually something will, you know if you push in, something will pop out the other side, that you can change it, you can mold it. That’s maybe the most important thing. It’s to shake off this erroneous notion that life is there and you’re just gonna live in it, versus embrace it, change it, improve it, make your mark upon it.I think that’s very important and however, you learn that, once you learn it, you’ll want to change life and make it better, cause it’s kind of messed up, in a lot of ways. Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYfNvmF0Bqw"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An astonishing amount of this list amounts to “spend money”, so while these things may play well here I think it’s worth pointing out that a large majority of the population is not allowed to do those things because they can’t afford to."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; You are known as Azure BugOk, that’s cute.I would perhaps delay showing the funny name until at least one other machine is detected, it makes it feel like my name is being broadcast over the public Internet for anyone to connect to, and not just a LAN connection, the way it is.But worked perfectly for me to send a few photos back and forth.LAN connections seem like the perfect application for WebRTC not having to deal with TURN or STUN.It is a bit unnerving that there’s no permission request before being able to do network discovery on the LAN however.How is one machine finding the other? Central server matching the public IP used to then share their private IP? Or does WebRTC provide a discovery service?Edit: Ok, Looking at the server code [1] there is indeed a “room” per public IP and the server passes messages between peers in the same room.[1] - https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop/blob/master/server/in..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not really an AirDrop equivalent if it requires you to be on the same network. AirDrop is really useful when you&#39;re out and about somewhere and you want to send someone a file. In those cases there&#39;s possibly not a WiFi available or in the case of visitors to your home; only you are on the network, not your friend.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a UI/UX agency that focusses on B2B SaaS, I’ve always found Fantasy UIs fascinating. It’s the complete opposite of the simple &amp; clean interfaces clients ask us to design.I’ve spent some time thinking about why these Fantasy UIs are so fascinating despite the fact they seem not very user friendly.My conclusion was that fantasy Interfaces are very much like the early web. Lots of moving parts (dancing banana gifs) and you had to figure out the navigation on each website you visited. Today, everything looks and feels the same and we lost the creative spirit of interface building.Figuring out the interface might not be best practice. But at the same time, I remember sharing websites with friends purely based on how fun the navigation and overall controls were.We lost the Art of interface building and turned it into a complete science. There are arguments for both sides.My wish is that... Hopefully.. one day, someone will contact us with a project that allows us to build the first fantasy UI for a real-world SaaS product."</p>

I&#39;d expect them to spend time on more higher-level things, but seems here they either was involved with actually writing the driver, and/or are just the public face for the patch. Seems unusual though. Kudos if directors at Sony still get to write code, especially low-level code like this.Edit: Seems there is more details in a almost year old article on phoronix (https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Sony-HID...):&gt; Roderick Colenbrander of Sony who serves as their Directory of Hardware &amp; Systems Engineering, chimed in on the matter of adding this Gasia controller support (And, yes, this is the same Roderick Colenbrander who in his spare time serves as a Wine developer and if going back to the early 2000&#39;s was the NVClock NVIDIA overclocking tool developer as opposed to being some eager Sony employee):So seems Roderick is a true hacker!

I typed apt search ps4 but could not find something so I pressed some buttons and magicly the UI changed. It all just worked no setup no nothing. I also used the controller on windows 10 but you had to use the xbox driver with special software to map the controls to that driver. The fact that everything just worked on linux amazes me to this day."</p>

I&#39;d look through to see what I wanted to watch, circle some things and then watch. No spying what-so-ever.So, I like for example HN where AFAIK I&#39;m not tracked so much and I choose what I want from the top of the list.Conversely I mostly hate Amazon, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, Youtube, Twitter, Instagram, and all the ad services and any other service that uses some algorithm to decide what to put in my face.It&#39;s to the point that 3 out 4 time I&#39;ll open videos in private windows so they don&#39;t get added to my profile and used for recommendations.I don&#39;t mind going to a tech sight and seeing ads for tech or a car site and seeing ads for cars.

It allow a low integrity process to run code as a medium (aka normal) integrity process. The exploit runs `splwow64.exe` which explorer &#34;helpfully&#34; auto elevates to medium integrity. The exploit then tricks `splwow64.exe` into running arbitrary code.It does not grant admin privileges.In practice this vulnerability isn&#39;t that scary on its own. Sandboxes don&#39;t (or shouldn&#39;t) rely solely on this form of mandatory access control for their security.

Call your parents when you think of them, tell your friends when you love them.83. Compliment people more. Many people have trouble thinking of themselves as smart, or pretty, or kind, unless told by someone else. You can help them out.84. If somebody is undergoing group criticism, the tribal part in you will want to join in the fun of righteously destroying somebody. Resist this, you’ll only add ugliness to the world. And anyway, they’ve already learned the lesson they’re going to learn and it probably isn’t the lesson you want.85. Cultivate compassion for those less intelligent than you. Many people, through no fault of their own, can’t handle forms, scammers, or complex situations. Be kind to them because the world is not.86. Cultivate patience for difficult people. Communication is extremely complicated and involves getting both tone and complex ideas across. Many people can barely do either. Don’t punish them.87. Don’t punish people for trying. You teach them to not try with you. Punishing includes whining that it took them so long, that they did it badly, or that others have done it better.88. Remember that many people suffer invisibly, and some of the worst suffering is shame. Not everybody can make their pain legible.89. Don&#39;t punish people for admitting they were wrong, you make it harder for them to improve.90. In general, you will look for excuses to not be kind to people. Resist these."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;8. When buying things, time and money trade-off against each other. If you’re low on money, take more time to find deals. If you’re low on time, stop looking for great deals and just buy things quickly online.&#34;I&#39;m finding, as I&#39;ve gotten older, that almost every time I&#39;ve chosen money over time I&#39;ve made a bad decision.And I see this among my family and friends, too.  There&#39;s a mentality that emerges when exchanging time for money that somehow makes it so you waste your time and you end up spending almost or more money than you originally would have.I&#39;m known for saying, &#34;There is a professional person for that...  Let&#39;s get one,&#34; instead of trying to fix the water heater ourselves or get transport 2 tons of gravel.  Others in my family would have dragged the old trailer out of the barn.  Oh, it has a flat.  Fix that.  Oh, the trailer hitch doesn&#39;t fit the new truck, oh, get a new hitch (we&#39;ll use it someday again, surely).  Or get the old truck working, or the older truck working (cause they keep buying cheap used trucks that break down and sit on the property for eternity).  Then go get whatever, and deal with not knowing what they&#39;re doing.  Me, just get it delivered.  Maybe more money, waaaay less hassle.  In the saved time I&#39;ve polished up my CSS skills...Time really is the most precious resource you have.  Think hard before you trade it for anything else."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When it comes to buying things I find my satisfaction is much higher when I spend money to remove an irritant rather than get something completely new.Our home has a long run from the water heater to basically anywhere it is used (This is in the USA where storage heaters are typical).  When it died I had its location moved and got a model with a circulating system that loops around to the downstairs locations (kitchen/bathroom).  Now what took 20-30 seconds to get warm water is 2-3 seconds.  I spent a lot (for me) and it was worth it.I replaced the 2 DIN radio in my car with an android head unit.  Driving became much better with my personal audio selection rather than over the air radio (What&#39;s that?).  A few years later I upgraded the unit and reduced the start time from 20-ish seconds to 2 seconds.  Both changes removed irritants and noticeably improved my quality of life.Previously I would wonder if getting a new car, or bigger TV, or going to Hawaii would improve my life.  Now I am more inclined to seek out irritants and try to find ways of applying money or effort to reduce them.  I&#39;ll still make the occasional new/splurge purchase, most recently Ring video cameras - they&#39;re fun, but that comes second and I&#39;m happier for it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Okay this is a bit meta, but the whole cluster of &#34;everything old is new again&#34;, &#34;the pendulum of fashion has swung&#34;, &#34;nothing new under the sun&#34; takes is ignoring what tends to drive this sort of change: relative costs.The allure of xmlhttprequest was that over connections much slower than today, and with much less powerful desktop computers, a user didn&#39;t have to wait for the whole page to redownload and re-render (one can argue that focusing on better HTTP caching on the server and client might have been smarter) after every single user interaction. This was also much of the draw of using frames (which were also attractive for some front-end design use-cases later re-solved with CSS).As apps got more complex, clients got more compute, bandwidth grew, and as web audiences grew, offloadingl much of the page rendering to the client helped to both contain server-side costs and increase or maintain responsiveness to user interactions.Now, as desktop client performance improvement slows down (this isn&#39;t just the slowing of computer speeds, computers are also replaced less frequently), average bandwidth continues to grow, app complexity and sophistication continues to grow, but as server compute cost falls faster than audience size grows, shifting rendering to HTML back to the server and sending more verbose pre-rendered HTML fragments over the wire can make sense as a way of giving users a better experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve never seen one of these &#34;logic in html-attributes&#34; systems take error checking seriously. In stimulus they start to mention it in &#34;Designing For Resilience&#34; (though only for feature-checking), but in &#34;Working With External Resources&#34; where it uses calls network/IO bound calls they never mention how to handle errors or if the framework just leaves it up to you. Stimulus is also where you need to write your own js code, so I guess you could handle it yourself but in turbo when I skimmed the handbook I find no mentions of what/how to handle errors (or even what happens when turbo gets one), and when loading stuff over the network that is pretty much crucial.From the turbo handbook: &#34;An application visit always issues a network request. When the response arrives, Turbo Drive renders its HTML and completes the visit.&#34; Using the phrase &#34;When the response arrives&#34; begs the question of what happens if it doesn&#39;t arrive, or if it takes a minute for it to arrive, or if it arrives but with a faulty status code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As others have noted, seems reasonably similar to LiveView, Livewire and Blazor. I’m somewhat bullish on these approaches - server side rendered monoliths (Rails, Django, etc.) are SO productive, at least for the first few years of development, but lack of interactivity is a big issue, and this solves it well.However, another big issue is the dominance of mobile. More and more, you’ve got 2-3 frontends (web and cross-platform mobile, or explicitly
web, iOS and Android), and you want to power them all with the same backend. RESTful APIs serving up JSON works for all 3, as does GraphQL (not a fan, but many are). This however is totally web-specific - you’ll end up building REST APIs and mobile apps anyways, so the productivity gains end up way smaller, possibly even net negative. Mobile is a big part of why SPAs have dominated - you use the same backend and overall approach/architecture for web and mobile.I’d strongly consider this for a web-only product, but that’s becoming more and more rare."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another great win for the EFF. We shouldn&#39;t forget how much time and effort fighting this kind of thing takes, and we are very lucky to have an organization who&#39;s willing to put in the legwork from which all of us are huge beneficiaries. (Edit: just donated.)I guess it was implied by the article, but wasn&#39;t perfectly clear to me: does this mean that .org just stays with its current holders, ISOC? (Internet Society)As much as ICANN and Ethos Capital acted maliciously in this whole debacle, it&#39;s very possible that the most malicious actor of all was ISOC. In 2002 they were granted the management of a public good (the .org registry), with the idea that they&#39;d administrate it responsibly and fairly. In return, they were well compensated as they managed .org registrations over all these years, which is more or less a license to print money.However, it&#39;s obvious with this attempted sales that ISOC never considered themselves to be a higher-minded steward doing anything for the greater good. To them, .org was an asset to be pumped and dumped at the first, best offer that came along. They were well aware that Ethos had plans to turn .org into a major profit center with a captive audience of all existing .org holders, to the detriment of tens of thousands of non-profits (and many others) worldwide, and enthusiastically agreed to the plan anyway. It was money in their pocket, and the money was good.What would it take for the ICANN to claw back the .org registry and grant it to a more ethical caretaker? (CCOR for example [1].) It seems to me that &#34;easy come, easy go&#34; is a perfect ethos for this situation, and the ISOC shouldn&#39;t be allowed to take another dime from .org.---[1] https://www.ccor.org/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The reason you can’t buy a good webcam is the same reason you can’t buy a high quality monitor outside of LG’s unreliable apple collab.The lazy conglomerates who sell these peripherals often don’t actually produce the parts in them. They simply rebrand commodity cameras and IPS panels in a crap plastic housing and slap their logo on it.Then they give the product a hilariously user-hostile product name, like “PQS GRT46782-WT” as an extra f-you to the user.They don’t care about you because they have no ongoing relationship with you, and their executives mistakenly see their own products as commodities.Combine this with the fact that most home users don’t care about good quality or even know what it is, and you have the current situation.A friend once described the peripheral market as “Assholes selling crap to idiots.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you are looking here to improve your webcam because you started to do remote work, don&#39;t.First try to improve lighting and audio.Any camera will look bad in bad lighting. It is always better to first improve your lighting before you invest in a new camera. Use high CRI lightbulbs and ensure even source color temperature in your room (ie. all lightbulbs should be emitting same color temperature).Audio is also very important. It is processed by different parts of brain and we don&#39;t put so much attention to it but the quality will influence the other person, subconsciously. Also, audio is how the information is being passed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The real reason is buried in the article:You can’t buy a good webcam because the number of people willing to pay a lot of money for a high end webcam is very small.At the lower end, people are satisfied with their built in laptop parts or a cheap webcam that sits on top of their monitor.At the high end, people go down the rabbit hole of buying a do-everything mirrorless camera that they can use for so much more than just a webcam.A high end webcam would have to be cheap enough that the first group doesn’t mind spending a bit more, but not so expensive that the enthusiast target audience just decides to buy a full-featured mirror less camera instead.Granted, there is a lot of room for improvement in that budgetary middle ground, but how many people actually care? Common webcams actually perform decently when given proper lighting conditions. We’re not streaming high-bitrate 1080p H.265 on our 5-person Zoom calls. After compression and denoising the extra sharpness and low noise of a high end camera doesn’t add much benefit.Enthusiasts are a difficult group to market to because they have extremely high expectations. They’d also rather spend weeks scouring the Internet for the perfect deal on a used mirrorless camera than to spend a dollar more than necessary to buy a high-end webcam."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t really get these modern async APIs. In languages like Javascript I thought they only made sense because JS interpreters are (historically) single-threaded, so you really have no choice but async to express some concepts. Fine.But in Rust you can just spawn threads, share data through channels or mutexes, use OS-provided async IO primitives to poll file descriptors and do event-driven programming etc...I tried looking into Tokio a little while ago and I found that it led to some incredibly complicated, abstracted, hard to think about code for stuff I usually implement (IMO) much more simply with a basic event loop and non-blocking IO for instance.I&#39;m sure async can get the upper hand when you have a huge number of very small tasks running concurrently because that&#39;s generally where OS-driven parallelism tends to suffer but is it such a common scenario? That sounds like premature optimization in many situations IMO. Unless you actually think that async code is more expressive and easy to read and write than basic event loops, but then you must be a lot smarter than I am because I have to take an aspirin every time I need to dig into async-heavy code.I guess I&#39;m trying to understand if it&#39;s me who&#39;s missing something, or if it&#39;s web-oriented developers who are trying to bring their favourite type of proverbial hammer to system development."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who has criticized Rust for the small standard lib and lack of stability in the ecosystem I&#39;m very, very happy for this. This is one of the biggest milestones for Rust. Rust itself is great enough. The lack of a de facto async runtime and libs for your standard networking needs were a real barrier for non-enthusiasts environments. It will help its adoption in general purpose business apps, I guess and hope."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can someone explain to a non-rustacean what Tokio introduces that&#39;s not part of Rust? It looks like Rust provides the async/await semantics, so I&#39;m guessing this is an event loop and dispatching system?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Learn to answer the more ambiguous questionsThis is something I have never done before my most recent job search but it has been a huge help.  Previously all my interview prep was on tech and I pretty much winged it for the behavioral stuff since interview prep guides seem to always focus on the tech side.  Plus it always feels worse and more obvious when you struggle with or fail to properly answer the tech questions.What I did is I prepared 10 different stories about my career experience and then tagged them with a bunch of prompts.  For example I have a story about one project that had dual PMs that experienced a lot of scope creep and eventually fizzled on release.  I can now use that story to answer a broad range of questions from failure to various project management approaches.  Overall I now have prepared stories to answer probably 50-75 different questions immediately.Another benefit is that I have also told these stories multiple times in interviews now and I get better telling them each time. Even if the answer isn&#39;t 100% relevant, I feel more confident and likely come off better launching immediately into a detailed story about my experience rather than trying to awkwardly come up with an answer on the fly.  It is also easy to drop irrelevant parts or expand on specific details when the basic framework of the story is already something that feels natural.I will even have the document with all the prompts and story bullet points open whenever I am doing phone or remote interviews.  I could probably even create a cheat sheet to use for in person interviews since I usually would bring an executive style notepad with me anyway to interviews to jot down notes about the company.Maybe this is obvious advice, but I think I am relatively smart and never done it previously or even seen this approach recommend so I am guessing there are other people who could use this tip."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One additional tip on recruiters: have a cheat sheet ready (web page or public Google doc) that answers the basic questions they&#39;ll have for you and makes clear your expectations.Here&#39;s the info I ask them to provide:- Job Title and Salary- Job Description- Company Overview and Location- Steps in Hiring ProcessWhenever I&#39;m emailed by a recruiter, I politely thank them for reaching out, paste the link to the cheat sheet, and invite them to review it and write back if they still think I&#39;m a good match. It quickly separates the professionals from the wannabes. (You usually don&#39;t hear back from the wannabes.) The ones who do write back often thank me for it.I&#39;m pretty cynical when it comes to recruiters. So I find it interesting that 3 of my last 4 jobs have come through one."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It sounds like you own 40% of something fairly valuable and now that it&#39;s 11 months into your contract other founder who needed your help is getting greedy and trying to push you out before you are owed anything.You said it yourself, you&#39;ve grown hugely, you&#39;re dominating SEO since you joined, and built loads of products. This is your &#39;partner&#39; getting greedy after you&#39;ve done a lot of hard work. It wouldn&#39;t have happened without you. Don&#39;t undersell yourself.Your 40% is worth $400k based on that initial funding valuation, right? Assuming it&#39;s as successful as you seem to be implying, it is almost certainly worth more now.Everyone is telling you to roll over but seriously, fuck them. This other toxic guy is the one who should be getting pushed out, not you.The other investor ultimately has power in this situation, not you or him, so whoever convinces them that they are the person to go with gets the seat and gets to continue with the project.If he has a good relationship there you&#39;re probably fucked, but results matter... and if you can prove you&#39;ve done great stuff since joining and and have great plans for the future, he can be replaced.To be clear: this guy has decided to blow up the project so he can get a bigger share, if it all fails now he can only blame himself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Do NOT sell. keep 40% of nothing, matter of pride first and for all. Secondly, they are more than  likely bluffing. They don&#39;t want to put advertising that would generate 5k/mo means they are trying to make things look artificially worse so you leave and keep the rest for themselves.Don&#39;t fall for the 40% of nothing once you are close of making money. They just don&#39;t want to share the pie."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since you have a 1-year cliff and have only been there 11 months, sounds like as of today you have 0% equity. So the immediate question may be whether your co-founder can fire you.In 1 month, you&#39;ve vested 25% of your grant, or 10% of the company. So I would try to get to that mark to strengthen your negotiating position. Any references to 40% are red herrings at this point.Unless there&#39;s a specific buyback clause in your stakeholder agreement, they&#39;re under no obligation to buy you out at any time. (They may have the right to do so. That&#39;s not uncommon.)Of course, you&#39;re under no obligation to resign, either. So this is a negotiation.So the way I see it, you have a few options:1. You take your 10% and leave. You &#34;don&#39;t want any equity&#34;, but better something you don&#39;t want than nothing.2. You agree to a buyback, potentially at a discount to FMV. If you don&#39;t know what FMV is, it&#39;s hard to negotiate one way or another. It&#39;s v. likely not $1M. Sounds like this is a no-go.2B. You agree to a non-cash buyback, e.g., in IP. You spent 11 months building the tech: what if you took that with you?3. You flip the script and buy your co-founder out.In any case, your relationship is over. You might walk away with nothing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Recent discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25502764"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The case revolves around the question of whether XRP is a security or not. The SEC has given the definitive guidance on the topic, which is based on the Howey case:&gt; The U.S. Supreme Court&#39;s Howey case and subsequent case law have found that an &#34;investment contract&#34; exists when there is the investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others.[5]  The so-called &#34;Howey test&#34; applies to any contract, scheme, or transaction, regardless of whether it has any of the characteristics of typical securities.[6]  The focus of the Howey analysis is not only on the form and terms of the instrument itself (in this case, the digital asset) but also on the circumstances surrounding the digital asset and the manner in which it is offered, sold, or resold (which includes secondary market sales).  Therefore, issuers and other persons and entities engaged in the marketing, offer, sale, resale, or distribution of any digital asset will need to analyze the relevant transactions to determine if the federal securities laws apply.https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/framework-investment-contract-an...Ripple (as distinct from the XRP token it created), currently holds a large block of uncirculated XRP created at the beginning of the network. This network does away with mining in favor of the Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm:https://ripple.com/files/ripple_consensus_whitepaper.pdfThis protocol foregoes mining in favor of a system without proof-of-work. The tradeoff (or feature, depending on how you look at it) was that the distribution mechanism would involve Ripple itself giving away and selling XRP. This gave Ripple complete control of the money stock at the network&#39;s inception.This is very different from how Bitcoin currency distribution works."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Been following cryptocurrency for almost a decade now. I would generalize that XRP is an asset that is primarily purchased by speculators with sour grapes that they missed &lt;$1 Bitcoins, and hope to see the same sort of returns despite the significant differences in technology and organizational structure.I don&#39;t feel like there is much &#39;smart money&#39; investing in XRP, so I think increased regulatory oversight is probably beneficial here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One time when I was younger, in my late teens, I was walking through the city around 8pm. I suddenly felt rather cold, and went through the typical 15 seconds of internal grumbling. I then had an epiphany, and walked into a nearby department store to purchase a jacket. Somehow I&#39;d never even considered that as a possibility previously.As silly as it may seem, I use that singular point in time as the reference for when I commenced adulthood. I&#39;ve got no idea if others have similar experiences (I grew up very poor, so I was probably primed against the idea of spontaneously buying something to begin with), but the contents of this list seems to be very much in the same vein."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of an old video of Steve Jobs. His idea is simple, but it&#39;s really powerful. In short: the world is something you can change, not merely participate in.When you grow up, you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world, try not to bash into the walls too much, try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money.That’s a very limited life. Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact, and that is that everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.And the minute that you understand that you can poke life and actually something will, you know if you push in, something will pop out the other side, that you can change it, you can mold it. That’s maybe the most important thing. It’s to shake off this erroneous notion that life is there and you’re just gonna live in it, versus embrace it, change it, improve it, make your mark upon it.I think that’s very important and however, you learn that, once you learn it, you’ll want to change life and make it better, cause it’s kind of messed up, in a lot of ways. Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYfNvmF0Bqw"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An astonishing amount of this list amounts to “spend money”, so while these things may play well here I think it’s worth pointing out that a large majority of the population is not allowed to do those things because they can’t afford to."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Too bad, maps.me was by far the best maps application for non city use, and ideal for hiking. Commendable initiative to bring it back in its original version!A few examples of why it was so great:Simple, non social bookmarks. As in: place a bookmark so you don&#39;t get lost while hiking, or when you find a nice spot you want to come back to later. Yep, a utility feature that doesn&#39;t somehow map to some stoopid business OKR in advertising. I am sure this is possible with Google maps or Apple maps somehow, but only after you&#39;ve created an account, logged in, and made sure you have the equivalent of a South Korean inner city internet connection.Also, easily downloadable maps that just stay on your phone. I am hiking, I don&#39;t have internet and need the map on my phone. 
I know Google Maps allows you to do that but it is tedious unlike maps.me, which is instant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is an existing f-droid version of Maps.me [1] and this looks like a separate effort.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For me YouTube recommendations are not toxic, they are so amazing I some times wonder how comes the world around is not heaven when everybody has free access to this.That&#39;s because I always watch high-quality educational content and some beautiful comforting and inspiring music. So for me YouTube is a fountain of knowledge, visual and musical aesthetics etc. Every day I get inspiration, healthy kind of fun and learn something cool, useful and healthy.But people who watch stupid and destructive stuff (even once) are doomed because they are going to get the same and worse kind of content recommended over and over. This is a particularly underestimated social problem indeed.That&#39;s why I recommend to avoid signing-in into YouTube. Better watch anonymously so you can always clean the cookies and get out of the pit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know I&#39;m old but dang for some reason I really dislike recommendations from almost any company.For media I grew up in the 70s and had the TV Guide. I&#39;d look through to see what I wanted to watch, circle some things and then watch. No spying what-so-ever.So, I like for example HN where AFAIK I&#39;m not tracked so much and I choose what I want from the top of the list.Conversely I mostly hate Amazon, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, Youtube, Twitter, Instagram, and all the ad services and any other service that uses some algorithm to decide what to put in my face.It&#39;s to the point that 3 out 4 time I&#39;ll open videos in private windows so they don&#39;t get added to my profile and used for recommendations.I don&#39;t mind going to a tech sight and seeing ads for tech or a car site and seeing ads for cars. Do mind visiting an apartment listing site and then going around the net and having every other sight shove ads for apartments in my face."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you want a glimpse of the average person&#39;s youtube experience, open the site in incognito and go to the &#34;trending&#34; tab.It&#39;s a completely different site depending on what you initially search for when you start using it.The problem is, 80% of youtube userbase never really typed a search query for anything in the first place, and as a result the stuff they get recommended and watch is pure shit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Learn to answer the more ambiguous questionsThis is something I have never done before my most recent job search but it has been a huge help.  Previously all my interview prep was on tech and I pretty much winged it for the behavioral stuff since interview prep guides seem to always focus on the tech side.  Plus it always feels worse and more obvious when you struggle with or fail to properly answer the tech questions.What I did is I prepared 10 different stories about my career experience and then tagged them with a bunch of prompts.  For example I have a story about one project that had dual PMs that experienced a lot of scope creep and eventually fizzled on release.  I can now use that story to answer a broad range of questions from failure to various project management approaches.  Overall I now have prepared stories to answer probably 50-75 different questions immediately.Another benefit is that I have also told these stories multiple times in interviews now and I get better telling them each time. Even if the answer isn&#39;t 100% relevant, I feel more confident and likely come off better launching immediately into a detailed story about my experience rather than trying to awkwardly come up with an answer on the fly.  It is also easy to drop irrelevant parts or expand on specific details when the basic framework of the story is already something that feels natural.I will even have the document with all the prompts and story bullet points open whenever I am doing phone or remote interviews.  I could probably even create a cheat sheet to use for in person interviews since I usually would bring an executive style notepad with me anyway to interviews to jot down notes about the company.Maybe this is obvious advice, but I think I am relatively smart and never done it previously or even seen this approach recommend so I am guessing there are other people who could use this tip."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t really get these modern async APIs. In languages like Javascript I thought they only made sense because JS interpreters are (historically) single-threaded, so you really have no choice but async to express some concepts. Fine.But in Rust you can just spawn threads, share data through channels or mutexes, use OS-provided async IO primitives to poll file descriptors and do event-driven programming etc...I tried looking into Tokio a little while ago and I found that it led to some incredibly complicated, abstracted, hard to think about code for stuff I usually implement (IMO) much more simply with a basic event loop and non-blocking IO for instance.I&#39;m sure async can get the upper hand when you have a huge number of very small tasks running concurrently because that&#39;s generally where OS-driven parallelism tends to suffer but is it such a common scenario? That sounds like premature optimization in many situations IMO. Unless you actually think that async code is more expressive and easy to read and write than basic event loops, but then you must be a lot smarter than I am because I have to take an aspirin every time I need to dig into async-heavy code.I guess I&#39;m trying to understand if it&#39;s me who&#39;s missing something, or if it&#39;s web-oriented developers who are trying to bring their favourite type of proverbial hammer to system development."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who has criticized Rust for the small standard lib and lack of stability in the ecosystem I&#39;m very, very happy for this. This is one of the biggest milestones for Rust. Rust itself is great enough. The lack of a de facto async runtime and libs for your standard networking needs were a real barrier for non-enthusiasts environments. It will help its adoption in general purpose business apps, I guess and hope."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can someone explain to a non-rustacean what Tokio introduces that&#39;s not part of Rust? It looks like Rust provides the async/await semantics, so I&#39;m guessing this is an event loop and dispatching system?"</p>

It just really shows how low the bar is to get something published.  I could blow my nose on YouTube and make stock picks based on where the bugger lands and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if BBC Business picks up the breaking story.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"YC has historically had a big influence on improving financing terms for founders and reducing founder-hostile behavior by investors, by creating competition among investors for YC companies. Should YC maybe consider developing and enforcing a code of conduct addressing these issues, that might similarly improve the situation for start-up employees?They could maintain a public list of YC companies that abide by the code of conduct in order to encourage good behavior, and to help communicate to potential employees that they would get a “fair” option deal (as early investors, they would clearly have access to the terms of any financing deal).[EDIT: they could also maybe publish a list of investors who have committed to following the guidelines, and consider excluding VC firms from YC events if they won’t commit to those standards]Depending on how serious YC was about making a difference here, going against the code of conduct might even be grounds for exclusion from the YC community? My understanding is that YC has always focused on what’s best for the founders, even when they were the outsiders in silicon valley and at their own financial expense. Maybe now that YC is such an important player in the silicon valley ecosystem, they could use that power to maintain the health of that ecosystem in a way that few others could?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m facing a headache with some options I was granted for a startup back in 2013 for being an advisor. I didn&#39;t exercise the options at the time (hindsight is 20-20).The startup is doing well - it recently raised ~$300m at a ~$3b valuation, but my options expire in Dec 2023 and I&#39;m growing increasingly concerned that they won&#39;t have a liquidity event before then.If I exercise my options before then it will be taxed as income which could leave me owing &gt;$100k in taxes to the IRS - but if the company hasn&#39;t yet had a liquidity event then I can&#39;t sell the options to pay that.Seems like a ridiculous situation for early employees/advisors to be placed in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was lucky enough to cash out of a startup after 7 years and 3 or 4 rounds of funding (I had left by the time I got the payout) as a share buyback for one of the VC investors.I was diluted from 3.2% to about 1.3% but the value of the company had clearly risen so _at that point_ it was unimportant.However in my opinion the company&#39;s burn rate and lack of growth clearly meant a later exit (likely an acqui-hire IMO) would have seen dilution without an equivalent growth in value, not to mention the ever-increasing VC non-dilution shares accelerating that.I got majorly screwed on tax because the startup made no efforts to be efficient and were very chaotic in their arrangements for payout so that is definitely another important factor.Overall by winning the startup share lottery I made roughly $500k for 5 or so years working there and that was as employee #1 so the maths given the pay cut probably don&#39;t work out too well (perhaps break even if I&#39;d played the career game well).However of course I am hugely grateful it happened and I got to see a startup grow from 3 people to more than 10x that and learnt a lot, as well as changing my coding career direction substantially.I wouldn&#39;t recommend joining a startup as a non-founder other than for changing career or starting out. The trade-offs don&#39;t really make sense in most cases and you get a lot less say than you think you might (founders understandably want to control what is their baby) - never do it for the money.note: I posted a more detailed overview of what happened at https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25496667"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I only skimmed the paper past the abstract, but for what it is worth.The MOND favouring group is a fringe of the cosmology community. The vast majority feel that there is enough evidence to rule it out.I mostly mention this because I don&#39;t like that fact that popular science magazines (or at least their content that I see posted here!) has a bias towards &#34;new and possibly exciting&#34; or &#34;controversial&#34; research. Which I understand - revolution is more interesting that &#34;physicist reduces error bars by 50%. Big picture unchanged&#34;. But, if all you read is these articles, you will get a very skewed idea of what the consensus is.Just so there is no confusion, modified gravity as an explanation for Dark Energy is very possible, as an explanation for Dark Matter, the consensus is that it is ruled out.Edit: I clarified my point below but will do it here too so everyone see it. I don&#39;t have a problem with this paper, I&#39;m glad people are writing papers with alternate explanations to the consensus, that is how science is done. But, your conclusion from reading this article shouldn&#39;t be, &#34;ahh damn, I guess MOND is right and LCDM is wrong&#34; and I think that is how pop-sci articles tend to frame these things."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We in the US do an absolutely horrific job of recognizing and compensating for the externalities of our automotive culture. The criminalization of jaywalking is one major aspect, but also consider:1. The construction of highways through poor (read: minority) urban areas, causing mass respiratory disease and premature deaths[1].2. Allocation of free public space (car parking) to drivers, effectively subsidizing (disproportionately suburban) commuters at the expense of residents.3. A general culture of entitlement to the road among motorists, resulting in tens of thousands of pedestrian and cyclist injuries a year with virtually no legal (beyond costly civil) recourse.[1]: https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/29/nyregion/29asthma.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My first year of college, I was cited for jaywalking.  I was walking across a barren street in our small college town on my way to class, and there was a town cop standing against a wall of a nearby building waiting for an easy catch.I had fully crossed the street and was walking to a nearby building when I heard someone yell &#34;Hey&#34; behind me.I contemplated not even turning around, because I wanted to get to class on time, but I did ... and saw the officer standing on the other side.He didn&#39;t feel like coming to me, so he instructed me to re-cross the street back to him.&#34;Are you sure you want me to jaywalk back?&#34; I asked.  &#34;Isn&#39;t that dangerous?&#34;He rolled his eyes and gave me the ticket."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just want to point out how special interests can actually pretty insidiously change your viewpoint by making you think &#34;that&#39;s the way things have always been&#34;. It was relatively recently that I discovered that jaywalking, as a crime, was a distinctly American phenomenon, when in an HN discussion someone mentioned that British folk think the crime of jaywalking is insane (in the UK you can cross pretty much wherever you want as long as you&#39;re not impeding traffic). My initial reaction was &#34;Wait, that&#39;s nuts, of course jaywalking should not be allowed.&#34; I didn&#39;t even realize how the &#34;default&#34; of what I was used to in the US was basically just constructed by the auto industry for their benefit.Glad this is coming to light and hope more places get rid of jaywalking."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I spent some time at a university and got to field DMCA complaints.  Typically they&#39;d list the file getting shared and a timestamp (often without a timezone) and the university IP/port.  They never included their own IP address...Of course, the traffic was behind a firewall.  I had the logs but wasn&#39;t about to accuse / punish anyone when there were a bunch of potential students behind any given complaint, and without the other end of the connection I couldn&#39;t identify which one for certain.Funny thing is they refused to give their source IP because they didn&#39;t trust us to not leak it to whatever pirates to put on a blocklist.But of course, I had their source IP because I had the network traffic.  Were I in kahoots I&#39;d have just listed all 5 of the possible snitching peers to the badguys.Shady and incompetent then, same now I guess."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Prenda Law used a similar tactic when they uploaded films to pirate bay and then sued anyone who downloaded them.You can bet if Schneider loses the case, she&#39;ll be left holding the bag as Virgin Islands-based Pirate Monitor Ltd disappears.Creative folks who hire these law firms that specialize in pirate hunters or &#34;monitoring&#34; companies need to realize they have incentives to pirate your content to keep your business. And when you sue people off information they provided you, it&#39;s your name on the lawsuit. Sure you can try to sue the companies after you lose, but good luck with that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of something hilarious happening on Twitch that I recently learned from younger relatives.There are normal people on the game ‘Among Us’ playing copyrighted music into their mic, so that if a celebrity Twitch streamer gets too close to this individual there is a chance their account would get banned due to the DMCA.They are using DMCA as an in-game defensive aurora.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like the sentiment of this article. It&#39;s a great analogy.Might be a little off topic, but it reminds me how I am happy that the Go programming language and its philosophies gained popularity even though I don&#39;t use the language regularly. Watching Go talks made me appreciate simplicity and clarity.It made me accept that I don&#39;t always need to use every design pattern in the book. It made me think about the readers of my code, who might not always be experienced enough, or might not always have time to understand the brilliant architecture I came up with. I can have some repeated code sprinkled around in the codebase. I don&#39;t always need to have n+1 layers in my architecture where all the layers just call the next layer anyway. It might be better to use functions over a complicated hierarchy of classes. It made me appreciate simple tools and widely accepted conventions that result in codebases that feel familiar the second you dive in.Of course, go is not the only community where these ideas are prevalent, and it&#39;s good to know your design patterns and architecture, etc... Finding the balance is not always easy, but it&#39;s good to have a popular, successful &#34;counter force&#34; community."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; By &#34;functions&#34; here I mean &#34;pure functions&#34;.After programming for Clojure for quite a long time (~2 years), I fully share this sentiment. Using pure functions for business logic (and also using simple data structures instead of, say, classes and encapsulation) seems to generally makes the code more simple and maintainable in the long run.&gt; Of course the qualifier is &#34;mostly&#34;: this isn&#39;t a dogma. Writing a 100% functional system (&#34;going vegan&#34;, if you will) often requires you to jump through a bunch of extra hoops to get all the functionality you need.Also this. Sometimes going fully functional makes things much more difficult, so a little of &#34;impurity&#34; is also fine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This nugget stood out for me: &#34;In my experience most codebases have a pure functional subset, and I believe writing that subset in a pure-functional style is nearly always a win for the long-term health of the project.&#34;This is probably often true. In high level applications, the idea of classing or abstracting out your i/o from the core functionality is appealing from a security and reasoning  perspective, but not sure if serious developers think that way.Would you need to understand the rationale behind the codebase from a functional perspective, and even the economics of the business logic behind the features? It&#39;s kind of an architects view of &#34;this thing essentially reduces to a queue and if I optimize for this, I get more value.&#34;"</p>

It is like a constant stream of attack on freedom of speech by dictatorship and fascism 2.0 (better, stronger upgraded version, more sneaker and cunning).

Before you know it, we stand in line and exclaim &#39;Hail to Y&#39;.Sometimes, I think evil has a game called, attempts, if you try X number of times at the end something corrupt will pass.Interesting enough in the same week in Serbia they want to pass law that will &#34;Forbid people insulting high government official if that could cause deep emotional stress to their family members&#34;"</p>

Categorizing the re-transmission of someone else&#39;s imaginary property in the same bucket as committing murder.Looks like it&#39;s going to the Senate, poised to pass. There&#39;s not much else an average person can do than call in and object. I would encourage anyone in a position of power to enforce laws like this to say No. Do not implement systems to enable this. Make it as hard as possible for the copyright mafia to extort ordinary internet users. Civilly disobey.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The reason you can’t buy a good webcam is the same reason you can’t buy a high quality monitor outside of LG’s unreliable apple collab.The lazy conglomerates who sell these peripherals often don’t actually produce the parts in them. They simply rebrand commodity cameras and IPS panels in a crap plastic housing and slap their logo on it.Then they give the product a hilariously user-hostile product name, like “PQS GRT46782-WT” as an extra f-you to the user.They don’t care about you because they have no ongoing relationship with you, and their executives mistakenly see their own products as commodities.Combine this with the fact that most home users don’t care about good quality or even know what it is, and you have the current situation.A friend once described the peripheral market as “Assholes selling crap to idiots.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you are looking here to improve your webcam because you started to do remote work, don&#39;t.First try to improve lighting and audio.Any camera will look bad in bad lighting. It is always better to first improve your lighting before you invest in a new camera. Use high CRI lightbulbs and ensure even source color temperature in your room (ie. all lightbulbs should be emitting same color temperature).Audio is also very important. It is processed by different parts of brain and we don&#39;t put so much attention to it but the quality will influence the other person, subconsciously. Also, audio is how the information is being passed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The real reason is buried in the article:You can’t buy a good webcam because the number of people willing to pay a lot of money for a high end webcam is very small.At the lower end, people are satisfied with their built in laptop parts or a cheap webcam that sits on top of their monitor.At the high end, people go down the rabbit hole of buying a do-everything mirrorless camera that they can use for so much more than just a webcam.A high end webcam would have to be cheap enough that the first group doesn’t mind spending a bit more, but not so expensive that the enthusiast target audience just decides to buy a full-featured mirror less camera instead.Granted, there is a lot of room for improvement in that budgetary middle ground, but how many people actually care? Common webcams actually perform decently when given proper lighting conditions. We’re not streaming high-bitrate 1080p H.265 on our 5-person Zoom calls. After compression and denoising the extra sharpness and low noise of a high end camera doesn’t add much benefit.Enthusiasts are a difficult group to market to because they have extremely high expectations. They’d also rather spend weeks scouring the Internet for the perfect deal on a used mirrorless camera than to spend a dollar more than necessary to buy a high-end webcam."</p>

This was also much of the draw of using frames (which were also attractive for some front-end design use-cases later re-solved with CSS).As apps got more complex, clients got more compute, bandwidth grew, and as web audiences grew, offloadingl much of the page rendering to the client helped to both contain server-side costs and increase or maintain responsiveness to user interactions.Now, as desktop client performance improvement slows down (this isn&#39;t just the slowing of computer speeds, computers are also replaced less frequently), average bandwidth continues to grow, app complexity and sophistication continues to grow, but as server compute cost falls faster than audience size grows, shifting rendering to HTML back to the server and sending more verbose pre-rendered HTML fragments over the wire can make sense as a way of giving users a better experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve never seen one of these &#34;logic in html-attributes&#34; systems take error checking seriously. In stimulus they start to mention it in &#34;Designing For Resilience&#34; (though only for feature-checking), but in &#34;Working With External Resources&#34; where it uses calls network/IO bound calls they never mention how to handle errors or if the framework just leaves it up to you. Stimulus is also where you need to write your own js code, so I guess you could handle it yourself but in turbo when I skimmed the handbook I find no mentions of what/how to handle errors (or even what happens when turbo gets one), and when loading stuff over the network that is pretty much crucial.From the turbo handbook: &#34;An application visit always issues a network request. When the response arrives, Turbo Drive renders its HTML and completes the visit.&#34; Using the phrase &#34;When the response arrives&#34; begs the question of what happens if it doesn&#39;t arrive, or if it takes a minute for it to arrive, or if it arrives but with a faulty status code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As others have noted, seems reasonably similar to LiveView, Livewire and Blazor. I’m somewhat bullish on these approaches - server side rendered monoliths (Rails, Django, etc.) are SO productive, at least for the first few years of development, but lack of interactivity is a big issue, and this solves it well.However, another big issue is the dominance of mobile. More and more, you’ve got 2-3 frontends (web and cross-platform mobile, or explicitly
web, iOS and Android), and you want to power them all with the same backend. RESTful APIs serving up JSON works for all 3, as does GraphQL (not a fan, but many are). This however is totally web-specific - you’ll end up building REST APIs and mobile apps anyways, so the productivity gains end up way smaller, possibly even net negative. Mobile is a big part of why SPAs have dominated - you use the same backend and overall approach/architecture for web and mobile.I’d strongly consider this for a web-only product, but that’s becoming more and more rare."</p>
