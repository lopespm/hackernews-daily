								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Before my comment gets dismissed, I will disclaim I am a professional structural biologist that works in this field every day.These threads are always the same: lots of comments about protein folding, how amazing DeepMind is, how AlphaFold is a success story, how it has flipped an entire field on it&#39;s head, etc. The language from Google is so deceptive about what they&#39;ve actually done, I think it&#39;s actually intentionally disingenuous.At the end of the day, AlphaFold is amazing homology modeling. I love it, I think it&#39;s an awesome application of machine learning, and I use it frequently. But it&#39;s doing the same thing we&#39;ve been doing for 2 decades: pattern matching sequences of proteins with unknown structure to sequences of proteins with known structure, and about 2x as well as we used to be able to.That&#39;s extremely useful, but it&#39;s not knowledge of protein folding. It can&#39;t predict a fold de novo, it can&#39;t predict folds that haven&#39;t been seen (EDIT: this is maybe not strictly true, depending on how you slice it), it fails in a number of edge cases (remember, in biology, edge cases are everything) and again, I can&#39;t stress this enough, we have no new information on how proteins fold. We know all the information (most of at least) for a proteins final fold is in the sequence. But we don&#39;t know much about the in-between.I like AlphaFold, it&#39;s convenient and I use it (although for anything serious or anything interacting with anything else, I still need a real structure), but I feel as though it has been intentionally and deceptively oversold. There are 3-4 other deep learning projects I think have had a much greater impact on my field.EDIT: 
See below: 
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32265662 for information on predicting new folds."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got a 5th grader question about how proteins are used/represented graphically that I&#39;ve never been able to find a satisfying answer for.Basically, you see these 3D representations of specific proteins as a crumple of ribbons-- literally like someone ran multi-colored ribbons though scissors to make curls and dumped it on the floor (like a grade school craft project).So... I understand that proteins are huge organic molecules composed of thousands of atoms, right? Their special capabilities arise from their structure/shape. So basically the molecule contorts itself to a low energy state which could be very complex but which enables it to &#34;bind?&#34; to other molecules expressly because of this special shape and do the special things that proteins do-- that form the basis of living things. Hence the efforts, like Alphafold, to compute what these shapes are for any given protein molecule.But what does one &#34;do&#34; with such 3D shapes?They seem intractably complex. Are people just browsing these shapes and seeing patterns in them? What do the &#34;ribbons&#34; signify? Are they just some specific arrangement of C,H,O? Why are some ribbons different colors? Why are there also thread-like things instead of all ribbons?Also, is that what proteins would really look like if you could see at sub-optical wavelength resolutions? Are they really like that? I recall from school the equipartition theorem-- 1/2 KT of kinetic energy for each degree of freedom. These things obviously have many degrees of freedom. So wouldn&#39;t they be &#34;thrashing around&#34; like rag doll in a blender at room temperature? It seems strange to me that something like that could be so central to life, but it is.Just trying to get myself a cartoonish mental model of how these shapes are used! Anyone?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lawrence Lessig (Harvard law professor famous for fighting for sane copyright law) does a great presentation on the root cause of Americas problems. He also ran for president in 2016.It can be watched here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJy8vTu66tEThe short version is that to win primaries you need money. Money mainly comes from corporations and rich people. Taking money from corporations and rich people creates a relationship where you have some loyalty to them or they can punish you if you don&#39;t act how they want. Thus the primary corrupting force in America is pro-corruption campaign finance laws.The test for democracy is whether elected politicians pass legislation that the public at large wishes to be passed. Our very own Princeton did a study to answer this question.The key finding: “The preferences of the average American appear to have only a miniscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy.”[1]In a very real, non hyperbolic sense we are in a plutocracy where money rules. We are not a democracy due chiefly to our campaign finance laws.Here is a campaign that aims to work on this:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hear me out...  few people want to run for federal office already.  The pay isn&#39;t great and it&#39;s hard work.If the US was a company, there&#39;d be no question that we&#39;d need to pay our leadership much better to attract top talent.  We pay senators $170k a year to manage our country with a $20 trillion economy.So what we end up with is activists who crave power and elites from rich families for whom $170k a year is a rounding error.  Those families then use the power from being in office to enrich their families even more.One solution could be to double or triple pay for US representatives along with banning stock trading and things like &#34;speaking fees.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been collecting and sharing (@QuiverCongress on Twitter) data on stock trading by U.S. congressmen for the past couple years.While there is currently legislation that requires congressmen to disclose their financial dealings, enforcement around it is incredibly weak.Congressmen are supposed to disclose stock transactions within 45 days of when they are made, but in practice there are dozens of violations of this rule which result in hardly a slap on the wrist. I&#39;ve seen a couple cases of politicians conveniently waiting till after election cycles to disclose controversial trades.While I&#39;m generally pessimistic about the odds of congress voting to regulate itself, I&#39;m still hopeful that something comes from this push. There&#39;s certainly a lot of room for improvement."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Tried the cheeseburger recipe. Got the question: &#34;The best indicator of freshness for ground beef is:&#34;I chose &#34;(B) Smell.&#34; Because, you know, that&#39;s the answer (though I&#39;m not sure why I&#39;m starting out with a food safety question).I got a snotty response that I wouldn&#39;t be able to smell things that are in a sealed package, and I should always go by the manufacturing date printed on the package.No. You&#39;re wrong. And you&#39;re wrong about food safety, which is really not good. You go by smell, sliminess, color. The printed date is a nice guide but NOT what anyone should be using for food safety.And on top of that, your question doesn&#39;t say that you&#39;re not allowed to open the package (which... why? in what situation would you be staring at your package of ground beef and refuse to actually open it?) (Edit: Later on it&#39;s revealed that this is a quiz about shopping. So a bit of framing/context setting is missing.)Now I&#39;ve completed the food safety and &#34;do you know what lean meat is&#34; quiz, and I immediately go into another quiz about buying cheese. It wants me to say which cheese is hard and how to store cheese. What does this have to do with cooking a cheeseburger? I gave up.It&#39;s like you&#39;re trying to suck the life and enjoyment out of cooking. This is boring and nothing to do with what I want.It seems like a knowledge graph the way you&#39;ve done it is an anti-pattern of actual cooking. You&#39;re decomposing every recipe into its ingredients and then asking arbitrary questions about each one. Those questions have nothing to do with the final dish, or how the ingredients work together, or the choices you would make in making this specific dish. It&#39;s just &#34;oh, a burger has onion, here is a random question about the history of onions.&#34;What you need is something that shows how the ingredients interact. This is the opposite.EDIT: I don&#39;t mean to be TOO harsh here; I like your mission and the effort you&#39;ve put into this so far. I don&#39;t think a framework of focusing on ingredients in a vacuum, having people get quizzes wrong, and calling them &#34;Junior Chef&#34; is the way to do it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Please, please, please,  avoid status cuisines. It&#39;s going to be hard to do, because they make good PR. But you will be helping your users a lot more of you hold them off with a ten foot pole. What do I mean by a status cuisine? They are meals that are intended to show that the cook is a worthy person, rather than that the meal is practical, healthy, and good to eat. Here are some examples:The endurance cuisine: designed to show that the cook has time to spare, the endurance cuisine requires that no ingredient is pre-processed in any way. Grind your own grain, bake your own breadcrumbs, chop your own veg. Using grapes? You should have peeled them!The hair-shirt cuisine: you have to endure some discomfort if it&#39;s good for you, right? This cuisine specialises in sour tastes and unpleasant mouthfeel -  often using grains that our stone-age ancestors sensibly gave up for nicer ones.The gold plated cuisine: this one&#39;s obvious. Pricier ingredients must be better - or at least show how much the cook can spendThe obscurantist/connoisseur&#39;s cuisine: it can&#39;t be good if it&#39;s easy to find. The cook can only be good if they know exactly how many &#39;extras&#39; you need in your virgin olive oil, and what classification of wine you should put in your coq&#39;au&#39;vin.(Okay this is a bit tongue in cheek - but only a bit. I really do think a lot of recipes are unnecessarily onerous in some way)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve done a few quizzes on the app now, and I don&#39;t get it. The questions feel very contrived, like someone had a quota to fill so just put whatever looked plausible together. They are also _very_ culturally specific.Questions about eggs barely made sense to me being from the UK, with incorrect pack sizes, animal welfare terms, and completely missed our great standards body that makes it easy to know which eggs have met a reasonable quality bar. It&#39;s not that the info is globally applicable, it&#39;s that it&#39;s an awkward combination of wrong and useless depending on where you live. Starting another quiz about kitchen equipment it seems this is a pattern throughout.Cooking is deeply embedded into culture, tradition, region, climate, regulatory environment, retail infrastructure, and more. I don&#39;t think these quizzes will be able to overcome this without being fully localised per country.The recipes? Maybe they&#39;re better. I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m still 7 levels away from being able to know how to make scrambled eggs.Edit: when I opened the app the first time it asked me how experienced I am and I answered the 3rd out of 4 options, I know my way around a kitchen. The app just asked me to match pictures of eggs to how they have been cooked: fried, scrambled, etc. I&#39;m not sure I can survive this level of patronisation, it&#39;s honestly a bit insulting.Edit: &#34;what sort of pan should you cook eggs in&#34;... &#34;no not a wok, people don&#39;t have those at home&#34;. Ouch. At best that&#39;s incredibly sheltered for a food writer, and at worst it&#39;s practically racist."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Why is our society so incapable of providing a small box for people to store their valuables? Banks are trying to drop the concept almost entirely.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"After reading a long form interview with a FBI Whistleblower out of their Minneapolis counter-terror office (will link if I find it), working in another part of the govt myself in a previous life, and having some exposure to FBI tech recruiting and related programs, I am convinced large parts of the FBI are horribly inept at providing their core competencies in a changing world.They display the dangerous balance of huge scale and access with an inability to hire well outside of key roles (legal for people trending DoJ, special agents in flagpole jobs, etc)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One interesting and troubling aspect of this  that I read in other reporting is they asserted a lot of the cash seized was drug money on the basis of drug contamination, but the FBI has deposited at least some of the cash into trustee accounts at financial institutions so no longer has the physical cash to test, thereby making it impossible to test again and show that it was just, for example, trace cross contamination from the boxes rented by the cannabis dispensaries to store their cash. To me that seems like borderline destruction of evidence.I think the only reason this hasn&#39;t completely blown up in their face is they did manage to nab some shady characters, but the ends don&#39;t justify the means."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think that MS here is being used as a convenient scapegoat. This worry was never expressed at the time in significant terms. The FAT and SMB patents were much more of a worry than anything related to the desktop interface - only outright clones were being pursued.At the time, KDE, GNOME and Ubuntu developers alike, were simply drunk on popularity. Linux usage was in ascendancy, money was being thrown around, and the FOSS world was starting to attract young designers who saw it as a cheap way to build professional credibility. And then the iPhone happened and the whole UX world just went apeshit. The core teams really thought they had a shot at redesigning how people interact with computers, &#34;like Apple did with phones&#34;. Interaction targets moved from keyboard+mouse to touch screens, because &#34;convergence&#34; and the fact that the mobile sector was suddenly awash with cash.It&#39;s sad that people try to justify their missteps in this way. Microsoft was (and is) a terrible company and a constant threat to the FOSS ecosystem, but defining some of the biggest design choices of the Linux desktop only in antagonistic or reflective terms does a real disservice to those projects and the people who worked in them.If experience is the name we give our errors, refusing to accept errors were made means stating you&#39;ve learnt nothing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was the lead designer of Unity. Unity was not a response to patent concerns, but rather the manifestation of a convoluted OEM strategy involving exclusive distribution of distinct design features, and a write-once-run-anywhere dream of running Ubuntu on any device from netbooks to big screens to automobiles."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is news to me.  I remember that the Linux desktop seemed to be on the ascendancy back in 2006.  GNOME 2 and KDE 3 were very nice desktops; while they weren’t Mac OS X Tiger (which still holds up as an amazing desktop), they were solid contenders to Windows XP.  But then came GNOME 3 and KDE 4, which were major fumbles that set back the Linux desktop for years.If it’s true that GNOME’s radical direction beginning with version 3 is the result of threats from Microsoft to change its desktop to avoid influences from Windows, then that definitely changes my assessment of the era, and my distaste for Microsoft’s anti-competitive behavior only deepens (this is the same Microsoft that complained about Apple’s look-and-feel lawsuits)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is really nicely written; kudos to the author for compiling a great deal of information in a readable format.If I can be forgiven one nitpick: Poetry does not use a PEP 518-style[1] build configuration by default, which means that its use of `pyproject.toml` is slightly out of pace with the rest of the Python packaging ecosystem. That isn&#39;t to say that it isn&#39;t excellent, because it is! But you the standards have come a long way, and you can now use `pyproject.toml` with any build backend as long as you use the standard metadata.By way of example, here&#39;s a project that&#39;s completely PEP 517 and PEP 518 compatible without needing a setup.py or setup.cfg[2]. Everything goes through pyproject.toml.[1]: https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/[2]: https://github.com/trailofbits/pip-audit/blob/main/pyproject..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What a great article.We start with learning that we absolutely need this Poetry thing because… it&#39;s what everyone else uses. It&#39;s refreshing to see author who can skip usual badly argued justifications and just plain admin that he does not know shit and is just following rest of the herd.
Then we continue by &#34;solving&#34;  depependencies by usual way of ignoring them and just freezing whatever happens to be present.Then there is inevitable firing up of virtualenv, because that&#39;s just what you have to do when dealing  with messed up dependencies.Next one is new to me. Apparently, one does not just set up git hooks nowadays but use separate tool with declarative config. Because if you ever happen upon something not covered by the Tool, that would mean you are no longer part of the herd.Then we push our stuff straight to pypi, because of course our stuff can&#39;t possibly have any dependencies outside of python herd ecosystem. It&#39;s not like we knew our dependencies anyway.Then comes the fun part, pulling in tox, because when you have special tool to handle dependencies, what you just need is another tool with different environment and dependency model.Code quality section I will just skip over, seeing what pass for code quality these days makes me too sad.
What follows is setup of several proprietary projects that modern opensource seemingly can&#39;t exist without.
What is more interresting is &#34;tyding up&#34; by moving code from git root to subdir. Now, this is of course perfectly sensible thing to, but I wonder why is it called &#39;src&#39;? Maybe some herd memeber saw compiled language somewhere and picked it up without understanding difference between compiled binary and source code?Now don&#39;t take this as if I have problem with the article content in itself. No, as a primer to modern python packaging it&#39;s great. It&#39;s not authors fault that his work is so comprehensive it lays out bare all the idiosyncrasies, herd mentality, cargocultism and general laziness of python ecosystem these days. Or is it?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish people would just forget about pre-commit, this thing is especially useless in a setting where a CI/CD pipeline exists. It&#39;s not that hard to write a simple Makefile or shellscript to run linters on push.Pre-commit is one of the most annoying tools that have come into existence in recent years that everyone seems to be cargo-culting. It doesn&#39;t play well with editors since in order to find the actual binary path, you&#39;d have to open up a sqlite database to fish out the virtualenv pre-commit created. Pre-commit also increases maintenance burden, since its configuration is completely separate from your usual requirements-dev.txt/pyproject.toml/setup.cfg etc. If you have dev dependencies in one of these files because making your editors to find the pre-commit created binaries are hard, now you have to keep both versions in sync.I really don&#39;t see the point of any pre-commit hooks unless you are the one guy that doesn&#39;t use a modern CI/CD platform."</p>

Medium has something similar they called Snowflake - https://github.com/Medium/snowflake ... but note the disclaimer...&gt; Heads up: Medium isn’t using this tool anymore, but you’re welcome to!The problem with things like this is the typical engineering mindset, when shown a graphical or numerical analysis of their performance will zoom into analyse every detail and in the end it&#39;s just backed by the managers impressions and judgement.For similar reasons I have a strong opinion that engineers shouldn&#39;t be paid performance related bonuses, because no matter what happens, it&#39;s just going to upset them - the best case - maximum bonus - just equates to a &#34;meh&#34;. Better to pay a good base salary upfront ...Anyway use tools like this with caution IMO."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Tolkien on Tom in Letter 144:I might put it this way. The story is cast in terms of a good side, and a bad side, beauty against ruthless ugliness, tyranny against kingship, moderated freedom with consent against compulsion that has long lost any object save mere power, and so on; but both sides in some degree, conservative or destructive, want a measure of control. but if you have, as it were taken &#39;a vow of poverty&#39;, renounced control, and take your delight in things for themselves without reference to yourself, watching, observing, and to some extent knowing, then the question of the rights and wrongs of power and control might become utterly meaningless to you, and the means of power quite valueless. It is a natural pacifist view, which always arises in the mind when there is a war.The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien 144: To Naomi Mitchison. April 1954"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me, Tom Bombadil is the introduction of natural magic. He is nature, indicating to the reader that there is a source of magic beyond the elves, Wizards, and Sauron.There are many magical creatures in Middle-Earth without a described source, which to me makes the whole story feel more magic. The Ents probably being the chief example.Another important role of Tom’s is his introduction of magic and power outside of the “good vs evil” struggle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Possibly the least liked character in The Lord of the Rings. A childish figure so disliked by fans of the book that few object to his absence from all adaptations of the story.I&#39;ve been a fan of Tolkien for decades, and this doesn&#39;t match up with my experience at all...Tolkien fans seem to generally love Tom, and many were deeply disappointed that he wasn&#39;t in the movies (even though his exclusion makes perfect sense). Did I just run in different Tolkien circles than the author?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel some of the OP points. I was working on a profiling agent lately, and one of the issues was running it on multiple platforms (just the four big ones linux/mac-x86/arm) on FFI (because it&#39;ll be run directly from python/ruby/etc...) and preferably having the thing just work without having to install or configure any dependencies.Like OP I hit two walls: libunwind, and linking. For libunwind, I ended up downloading/compiling manually; and for linking there is auditwheel[1]. Although it is a Python tool, I did actually end up using it for Ruby (by creating a &#34;fake python package&#34;, and then copying the linked dependencies).It was at that time that I learned about linking for dynamic libraries, patchelf and there is really no single/established tool to do this. I thought there should be something but most people seem to install the dependencies with any certain software. I also found, the hard way, that you still have to deal with gcc/c when working with Rust. It does isolate you from many stuff, but for many things there is no work around.There is a performance hit to this strategy, however, since shared dynamic libraries will be used by all the running programs that need them; whereas my solution will run its own instance. It made me wonder if wasm will come up with something similar without affecting portability.Finally, the project is open source and you can browse the code here: https://github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope-rs[1]: https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nobody hates Facebook users more than Facebook, I guess. :-/I&#39;ve tried to type out several pithy comments, but the bottom line (to me) is that Facebook just doesn&#39;t respect its users or care about their needs.Can you imagine if brick-and-mortar businesses tried to do this? You go out for a Big Mac, but it&#39;s not on the menu anymore because Taco Bell had a few really good quarters, so McDonald&#39;s decided to pivot to tacos. Maybe you can still order the Big Mac if you know to ask for it, but most people won&#39;t, and they&#39;ll leave disappointed instead of getting what they wanted.Edit: To clarify, this example is contrived and the details are not the point. The point is that Facebook offered something to their users, spent years and billions of dollars making sure that as many people as possible got it from Facebook, and then decided to just yank the rug out from under all those people to chase the fairy tale of endless growth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s crazy to think the social media era may finally be ending. There’s really no viable platform anymore where you can just go passively keep up with what friends and acquaintances are doing. Everything is about feeding you content you didn’t ask for but may be targeted enough to catch your attention.And for what? To show you some ads here and there? To collect data that can be used to… sell more ads and products?Instagram was once my favorite app. There was a golden age before stories came a long where people just posted random pictures of what they were up to or what they were seeing. Things weren’t too memefied or political, unlike Facebook. Then photos got more and more glamorized and more about flexing and showing how much cooler and more awesome your life was. People started following themes and niches for their profile content rather than just posting random unorganized series of photos. Businesses and brands started getting built on the platform.Building an Instagram clone the way it used to be is fairly trivial these days. I could probably throw one together in a few months, but growing its popularity is practically impossible these days with such entrenched incumbents and no niches left to start a user base with.…unless perhaps… we build a social network on the blockchain"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know it sounds dumb but its hard to say we haven&#39;t moved closer to what only ~10 years ago we considered a &#34;playful exaggeration&#34; on the worst of humans and social media.In WallE, everyone is floating around in chairs having their content spoon-fed to them with a generous amount of ads mixed in.  If you&#39;ve ever scrolled or seen someone scroll, its kinda close.  Just mindlessly moving their thumb up and down, taking in content that will be forgotten within minutes.  Ask a tik tok user to tell you even 10% of the videos they saw within the last hour.  I&#39;d be surprised if they could.I hope its not too &#34;old man yelling at cloud&#34; because I do my 15 minutes of mindless instagram scrolling but I have a timer that locks the app and I usually only need 15 minutes, more just feels bleh.  Some of my family/friends &#34;brag&#34; about having 7+ hrs of &#34;tik tok time&#34; on their iphone stats.  Just crazy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love this.I have been a fan of SQLite for years, and it makes me genuinely happy to see other people have the same enthusiasm for the software.A couple of years ago, during a job search, I came across a couple of companies that I thought were a good match. I went through the interview process with all of them and, due to similarities in the interview process, we ended up talking about the same thing: databases. Oh the horror in the interviewers’ eyes whenever I mentioned SQLite. Experienced software engineers from The New York Times, for example, went as far as to mock my engineering choices in 3 out of 5 interviews, despite the success of the products my team built on top of SQLite.The experience made me feel awful and I stopped talking about SQLite for a couple of years. Instead, whenever someone asked a question about databases, I would answer with the PostgreSQL equivalent, knowing that the basic features are all the same.That is why, whenever I see projects like Litestream [1][2] used by excellent products like Tailscale [3], it brings me joy.A friend of SQLite is a friend of mine :-)[1] https://litestream.io[2] https://fly.io/blog/all-in-on-sqlite-litestream/[3] https://tailscale.com/blog/database-for-2022/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For people who enjoy this article I recommend reading the two-parter “How does SQLite work?” [1] [2] by Julia Evans. It too is an exploration into the inner workings but diving deeper into code.

I’m toying around with the idea of hacking something up, but it’ll likely stay in the dream realm until I have Heaps of Free Time on My Hands (tm).Looking into SQLite’s innards is a great source of inspiration.

We absolutely need to fund more semiconductor manufacturing. Losing that ability to China/Taiwan was just a terrible strategic mistake.The US hasn’t lost this battle (over semiconductors) just yet. While current manufacturing is indeed dominated by East Asian countries, the vast majority of research still happens in US universities. This legislation allocates more funding for that research, fantastic.Theres some political gamesmanship over some silly stock options of congresspeople… my response is, who gives a single shit.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fairly cynical comments on this thread, many trying to uphold American values like &#34;free market&#34;, &#34;protectionism is bad&#34;, &#34;what about the consumer&#34;, &#34;not from my tax money&#34;.I find those remarks pretty naive. Every major power block heavily subsidizes strategic industries, now and forever. It&#39;s in no way new or remarkable, nor does it violate some principle. Most of the above concepts are pure fiction.Semiconductors are not a &#34;free market&#34; in any ordinary sense. It costs tens of billions to enter the market and you&#39;ll buy an ASML machine, speaking of dependencies.It&#39;s pretty obvious that this is in response to geopolitical instability. Being geo locked and this not really being a free market at all justify the &#34;unusual&#34; decision.As is stands, food, energy, and yes...also semiconductors are foundational to a modern digital society. And they&#39;re interconnected, without semiconductors you won&#39;t have food either.If you want to know what happens when semiconductors dry up, watch modern Russia. Arguably it&#39;s hard to do because of all the propaganda, but pretty much every domestic industry is falling apart, and therefore society falls apart.Bottom line, don&#39;t be naive. Sure it sucks to give rich companies even more money but if that&#39;s what it takes, so be it. Also, rich is just one side of the coin, the other is that they spear-headed the information revolution."</p>

&#34;Finally, we need to talk federation. Does it make moving fast and breaking things more difficult? Yes, yes it does, and that can be a good thing.&#34;The other, super-underrated feature of federated systems is that antagonistic parties are willing to use them together. For example, the US military, Russian government, major international banks, Google, Facebook, etc ALL use email and happily exchange messages over SMTP. There&#39;s no centralized service you could get all these parties to agree to use (not even Signal).The result of this is that everyone has an email address, and that makes it the universal standard for business-to-business communication. I can loop in any number of parties on a single thread from all over the world and it just works.My startup Shortwave is trying to build a messaging future that is email. We&#39;re trying to evolve and upgrade email to have the look and feel and features of a product like Signal, but with all the universal, federated goodness of the global SMTP network. It&#39;s a long project -- federated systems evolve slowly! -- but it&#39;s the bright open future I think we need.

It&#39;s an RPG where your character kills monsters, picks up loot, and descends into the dungeon. If you die, that&#39;s it -- you can&#39;t just load a save; you have to start all over. It&#39;s legendarily unforgiving.In Nethack, most (all?) roles start with a pet, e.g. a puppy or a kitten. In the early game, your pet is often stronger than you; it follows you, fights monsters, etc. It&#39;s useful in many ways beyond fighting: it won&#39;t walk over a cursed item, it can &#34;fetch&#34; items from stores without angering the proprietor, and so on. Your pet gains experience and levels up (puppy -&gt; dog -&gt; large dog), and after a certain point you&#39;re prompted to give your pet a name.The message &#34;You have a sad feeling for a moment, then it passes&#34; is displayed when your pet dies while out of sight.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hidden gems like this were one of the great things about Everything2. For those who aren&#39;t familiar with it, E2 is structured vaguely like an encyclopedia, only instead of being a shared Wiki any user can write a whole separate article. Sometimes this was helpful for learning -- having three different explanations of what a tensor[1] is, for example. Sometimes it gave a mix of informational and personal content, such as the page on Mother&#39;s Day[2], which has one article on the history of the holiday and two about the authors&#39; attempts to cope with it despite losing or never having had a good relationship with their mothers. (Plus a summary of a Futurama episode by that name, because E2 was like that.)It also had an accidentally-fun feature in its hyperlinking system. Hyperlinks were intended to be used to be used for words that had their own articles, but you could link to any article, and when you hovered your mouse over the link the name of the target article would pop up. This could be used to make the closest thing I&#39;ve seen to an English equivalent of Japanese furigana puns. I&#39;m having trouble finding a good example right now, sadly.[1] https://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=tensor[2] https://everything2.com/title/Mother%2527s+day"</p>

She&#39;s healthy and it totally came out of left field. Then it spread to me. It was definitely humbling. I don&#39;t believe in living in fear, but it&#39;s funny how everything can change in an instant.I have to commend the title though:&gt; You have a sad feeling for a moment, then it passesComing to understand the ephemeral nature of emotions is what finally allowed me deal with them.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can provide both anecdotal and academic data:Because companies have imperfect reading on worker productivity, and are also trying to balance other priorities when determining pay, high output workers are consistently underpaid, called Wage Compression (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_compression)After getting a 2% raise in the last cycle, and knowing that my granted options were going to be worthless (a factor which is under-discussed in popular news articles), I decided that it was a particularly opportune time to jump. Like many, I was not particularly unhappy, so I had not been motivated to go through the effort for search process before.When I got an offer, my employer quickly matched it (suggesting that I really was worth that much to them) but burning a bridge with the contact you got me the new job was not worth  simply reaching parity in my current one, so they lost me. If they had preemptively gotten a few percentage points closer before I sunk effort into interviewing, I probably would not have started looking."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve had several chances to switch positions for considerably more than I make now (40-50% on my current six figures), each time I&#39;ve turned them down.I am happy and content where I am at, the job has good work life balance, it is for a good cause, and I make enough to provide comfortably for me and my family, this employer is also very stable so I don&#39;t have to worry about economic uncertainty.All in all I could make more money but I have found a level of contment and peace and it has allowed me to persue other hobbies outside of tech and serve in my local community.So maybe I am stupid and leaving money on the table, but I have found peace for now. For those who feel they need to make more I tell them congratulations that is awesome for you. But for now I am happy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really like reading about linguistic origins like that one. Makes me reflect on my irrational hatred towards reading &#34;could of&#34;, &#34;would of&#34; and the likes. I mean, I still get a seizure reading it, but I can only imagine some old dude yelling at the youngsters in the late 1800&#39;s like &#34;it&#39;s called &#39;and per se, and&#39;! Not ampersand! Jeez you all are the reason the english language is degrading!&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The letter I, for example, would be referred to with the phrase I per se, I, which means in Latin &#34;I by itself (is the word) I.&#34; When the 27th quasi-letter &amp; was referred to it was called &amp; per se, and, meaning &#34;&amp; by itself (is the word) and.&#34; That read as &#34;and per se and.&#34;This explanation is mixed up and confusing. It isn&#39;t &#34;I per se, I&#34; that is somehow &#34;by itself I&#34;, it is merely &#34;per se I&#34;. The reason you get another &#34;and&#34; in front was because it was at the end of the alphabet song: &#34;[and] [per se &amp;]&#34;.https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/ampersand&gt; Thus the end of the recitation would be: “X, Y, Z and per se and”. This last phrase eventually became ampersand, and the term was in common English usage by around 1837."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One summer I had a job in the Penn library improving the catalog data for their medieval Latin manuscripts. The abbreviations were wild. Here is a handbook of them (which includes &amp; = et and &amp;-bar = etiam): https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/213385262.pdf (pdf). I can see how being &#34;literate&#34; was tougher then than now.There were different handwriting styles, depending on the writing speed (inversely proportional to the quality and thus expense). For example the Codex Sinaiticus is gorgeous: https://www.codexsinaiticus.org/en/manuscript.aspx?book=26&amp;c... (That&#39;s a Greek example, not Latin---sorry, I&#39;m not much of a Latinist anymore.) I guess if you don&#39;t have mechanical type, you are very motivated to speed up writing. The books I looked at were pretty hasty.Almost everything I saw was a treatise on medicine and biology. They were all &#34;commentaries on Aristotle&#34;. I guess that&#39;s what you had to do to publish in those days.Besides the paleography, I had to trace the origin &amp; date of the paper used, which was possible from watermarks. We had two huge reference volumes giving known watermarks so you could narrow things down a lot---but often you didn&#39;t get an exact match. There was a whole symbology there too."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32240980">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So the way I&#39;m reading the post is Tesla swapped out a battery pack for a 60 with a 90 and enabled the 90. Tesla, years later, discovers that even though the hardware for a 90 was installed it should have been software limited to be a 60. (I&#39;m assuming that Tesla only made the owner pay the cost of the 60 battery swap even though they replaced it with a 90). They go and &#34;fix the glitch&#34; and set it back to the 60. Since the new owner bought it thinking it was a 90, because it was enabled to be a 90, presumably paid for it assuming this was the case and is now upset because they don&#39;t have what they thought they bought.Sounds like all around bad decisions. The previous owner shouldn&#39;t have sold it as a 90 or at least disclosed that, &#34;It&#39;s a 60 but Tesla swapped out the batter with a 90 and left it configured as a 90&#34;. Tesla, being notified, should have just enabled the 90 and made the customer happy. How exactly are people supposed to abuse this? Tesla put the 90 in there and they&#39;re the only ones who are going to be doing that. Presumably this cost them a fortune to do it in the first place. Why not get some good will out of it? &#34;Hey sorry about your battery. We only had a 90 so we threw that in there. Enjoy. Tell everyone you know about how awesome Tesla was about fixing the problem and remember that next time you go to buy your next car&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll spare the moral judgements against Tesla for this:The real moral of the story here is that if your business plan and practices is creating occasional weird issues and huge cognitive dissonance in your customers, it&#39;s the wrong business plan.  Also... the number of people this applies to is likely so low that Tesla really screwed up by not erring on the side of the customer.  (They didn&#39;t buy from Tesla, but they&#39;re still a customer buying servicing from them.)  If the bad publicity alone causes even a tiny fraction of the population to choose another manufacturer, the&#39;ve lost their $4,500 and then some.Harmony is a really underrated concept.  When things are harmonious, you don&#39;t have problems like this, and you can still make money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;I feel like this is more mundane on Tesla&#39;s part than many are making it out to be.
A mistake was made years ago. An employee recently discovered and &#34;fixed&#34; it. 
Terrible communication and customer service, but nefarious? Nah.&#34;At this point I feel like terrible communication and service is an intentional business strategy for some companies who found that by making support so baroque as to be inaccessible or just eliminating it entirely that they can slash costs accordingly. I do consider it to be nefarious in such cases."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is not a good article. At a technical level it&#39;s confused about a whole bunch of things:* SMM has been part of x86 for decades. The Secured Core requirements around SMM actually reduce its power.* The claimed requirement to remove the third party UEFI CA certificate from 2022 Secured Core PCs is entirely unrelated to Pluton (it&#39;s required regardless of whether Pluton is enabled or not, and even whether the CPU has Pluton or not)* Most of the description of Pluton is actually a description of a TPM. You don&#39;t need DICE for remote attestation. TPMs are already a hardware keystore.* System firmware is already being updated via Windows Update. The discussion about Pluton and Windows Update is around Pluton getting firmware updates that way (the existing story around firmware updates for TPMs is largely not good)* Existing TPM-based remote attestation already includes the secure boot stateThe short version: everything that the article is worried about being enabled by Pluton is already possible, and has been for years.But there&#39;s a meaningful point here. Remote attestation can certainly be used to restrict access to resources in ways that are incompatible with general purpose computing, or which reduce user choice. Remote attestation can also be used to give end users confidence that their machine is in a good state without constraining what they do with it. As a technology, remote attestation can be used in both good and bad ways. We do need to keep track of whether anyone is threatening to use it in bad ways and react appropriately.(But tbh remote attestation as an attack on general purpose computing isn&#39;t the really scary thing about widespread remote attestation. Remote attestation ties back to the TPM&#39;s endorsement key, an immutable cryptographic key certified by the TPM vendor at manufacturing time. The straightforward implementation of allowing arbitrary remote sites to trigger remote attestation would tie all of these accesses back to a single piece of hardware, and would be a privacy nightmare.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m completely missing how his example of a Word document that can only be opened by approved users on approved hardware within the corporation is supposed to be a bad thing.Honestly, that sounds pretty fantastic. I&#39;ve been using 3rd party tools/extensions to do this sort of thing in corporate and government environments for years, but having the attestation go all the way down to the hardware level is a big value-add, especially with so much ransomware/spyware/extortion/espionage going on these days.Can someone please explain to me how the author might see this level of security as a bad thing?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing I fear the most with this is &#34;proof that secure boot has never been disabled&#34;. This is just a way to brick your device from accessing services.What if you government&#39;s tax service requires such proof? Or bank? I cannot count how many machines I booted on Linux to rescue a hard drive, or image it, or wipe it, or just to install linux on them. All those devices, boom, paperweight for regular personal use.I hate it so much that Microsoft is alone in this. It&#39;s not because it&#39;s M$, it&#39;s because they&#39;re alone on it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have background here and can take a pretty good guess at what happened. You used a Brex card, which Google sees as a “privacy card.” These are often used by scammers trying to circumvent Google blocking their credit card account numbers.The solution here is to never use a hidden or “privacy” card number with Google, although of course Google will never tell you that or confirm or deny this. I only know this due to working with clients in this area.You can try removing that card and adding a regular hard card number and asking for a reinstatement again, but it may be too late for this account.Hopefully this helps folks reading this to not make the same mistake (although it’s incredibly frustrating that stuff like this has to be learned by trial and error or knowledge from those of us who have dealt with this previously.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have had nearly this exact experience, marketing a small SaaS.A sudden ads suspension arrived, with no explanation beyond &#34;suspicious payments&#34;. This from the same billing account used with GSuite, Domains, GCP; and from a business that was having no trouble running ads on FB, Twitter, and Reddit. &#34;How silly, but I&#39;m sure we can get it fixed&#34;.. I thought.Like OP I&#39;m also a Xoogler, so after two rounds of unsuccessful appeals through the front door (including updating my payment account to a hard card, providing articles of incorporation, and so on, to no avail), I figured it was time to call in my first ever favor. Surely one of my old-timer engineer buddies could thunk a ticket somewhere and maybe we&#39;d help them fix a bug in some automated system in the process.But the Google of 2022 is far different than the earlier days. It seems individual employees, even well-placed engineers, have incredibly and increasingly limited agency to fix things outside their immediate purview; a wiki about internal escalations for ads suspension stated they were no longer accepted, vaguely for reasons of &#34;compliance&#34;.On the bright side, the whole episode made me rethink and ultimately diversify our technology dependency on Google. I was naive not to do so more seriously and earlier."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It feels like every month or so there is another story like this about Google&#39;s customer support. For me it is one of the reasons I will *never* build on Google Cloud.Combine this with their propensity to randomly shut down services and also jack up the prices of things by some wild amount overnight with no warning or justification. (Google Maps API and Kubernetes control plane.)I would never consider risking all of my work on Google&#39;s reputation which is a shame because I&#39;m sure the services themselves work relatively well. It feels like everyone outside of google is widely aware of these issues but everyone inside is completely blind to them.Side Note: has anyone ever &#34;won&#34; an appeal with Google or does the system deny 100% of appeals?"</p>

You can get your code with fast Prime delivery, a tracking number, pay for it with your credit card, get a free replacement if it&#39;s lost in the mail...I love this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kind of surprised this hasn&#39;t been mentioned yet, but it&#39;s pretty commonplace to buy gift cards with cryptocurrencies.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I generally believe it to be possible, I am very curious about how Mullvad is storing its payment records to avoid time-based correlations.For gift cards it&#39;s more async, but given that payment processors keep records that can be correlated, if Mullvad isn&#39;t careful about timestamping, how it records crediting to accounts, or the like, it would be extremely easy to de-anonymize account relations IMO."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Helium isn&#39;t your typical crypto company.  Their vision is actually very lofty - build a distributed low data wireless network completely independent of phone providers and cable companies.And pay the people who own nodes a percentage of the $ earned thru the traffic flow of their node.The payment just uses crypto because the ecosystem is a nice fit.  Everybody knows what miners are and that they make money.The problem is that you need the entire network in place before people can build on it.  So they have been subsidizing the miners.  And it&#39;s a race of how much money can you raise and payout vs how much is a network like that is worth.And right now everybody has cellular and cable and fiber and no one really needs another system.  Most of the use cases (LOTS of sensor data) aren&#39;t really worth that much money.Personally, I think the government should subsidize something like this to allow it to get off the ground.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What really helped me understand and troubleshoot network communications at the socket level was the book by W. Richard Stevens[0]. I think this is because he starts with an introduction to TCP, and builds from there. Knowing TCP states and transitions is important to reading packet dumps, and in general debugging networking.Also, no matter what platform you&#39;re using, there is probably a socket implementation somewhere at the core. You&#39;re best off understanding how sockets work, then understanding how the platform you&#39;re working with uses sockets[1].Once I read the W. Richard Stevens book, I was able to read and understand RFCs for protocols like HTTP to know how things should work. Then you&#39;re better prepared to figure out if a behavior is due to your code, or an implementation of the protocol in your device, or the device on the other end of the network connection, or some intermediary device.[0] - http://www.kohala.com/start/unpv12e.html[1] - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winsock/porti..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the big issues with TCP is a lot of communication isn&#39;t well-suited to the stream model and is message-oriented, so yes, like the author says, you have to go implement ACKs. And then you want multiplexing, which streams also fail at. Before you know it, you built a worse version of HTTP2."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; How you handle a file no longer existing vs. a socket disconnection are not likely to be very similar. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get counter arguments to this,That&#39;s my cue! I think the &#34;everything is a file&#34; is somewhat misunderstood. I might even rephrase it as &#34;everything is a file descriptor&#34; first, but then if you need to give a name to it, or ACL that thing, that&#39;s what the file-system is for: that all the objects share a common hierarchy, and different things that need names can be put in say, the same directory. I.e., that there is one hierarchy, for pipes, devices, normal files, etc.I&#39;d argue that the stuff that &#34;is&#34; a file (named or anonymous) or a file descriptor is actually rather small, and most operations are going to require knowing what kind of file you have.E.g., in Linux, read()/write() behave differently when operating on, e.g., an eventfd, read() requires a buffer of at least 8 B.Heck, &#34;close&#34; might really be the only thing that makes sense, generically. (I&#39;d also argue that a (fallible¹) &#34;link&#34; call should be in that category, but alas, it isn&#39;t on Linux, and potentially unlink for similar reasons — i.e., give and remove names from a file. I think this is a design mistake personally, but Linux is what it is. What I think is a bigger mistake is having separate/isolated namespaces for separate types of objects. POSIX, and hence Linux, makes this error in a few spots.)But if you&#39;re just writing a TCP server, yeah, that probably doesn&#39;t matter.&gt; and that you should write your applications to treat these the same.But I wouldn&#39;t argue that. A socket likely is a socket for some very specific purpose (whatever the app is, most likely), and that specific purpose is going mean it will be treated as that.In OOP terms, just b/c something might have a base class doesn&#39;t mean we always treat it as only an instance of the base class. Sometimes the stuff on the derived class is very important to the function of the program, and that&#39;s fine.¹e.g., in the case of an anonymous normal file (an unlinked temp file, e.g., O_TMPFILE), attempting to link it on a different file-system would have to fail."</p>

I had been at the firm for a while, and they were nice enough, but didn&#39;t really have me down as someone who was going to contribute as anything other than a very junior engineer.We had a severe problem with a program&#39;s performance, and no one really had any idea why. And as it was clearly not a sophisticated project, I got assigned to figure something out.I used the then very new callgrind and the accompanying flamegraph, and discovered that we were passing very large bit arrays for register allocation by value. Very, very large. They had started small enough to fit in registers, but over time had grown so large that a function call to manipulate them effectively flushed the cache, and the rest of the code assumed these operations were cheap.Profiling tools at the time were quite primitive, and the application was a morass of shared libraries, weird dynamic allocations and JIT, and a bunch of other crap.Valgrind was able to get the profiles after failing with everything else I could try.The presentation I made on that discovery, and my proposed fixes (which eventually sped everything up greatly), finally earned the respect of my colleagues, and no phd wasn&#39;t a big deal after that. Later on, those colleagues who had left the company invited me to my next gig. And the one after that.So thanks!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish I hadn&#39;t read this article because now I know that I&#39;ve been mispronouncing Valgrind for nearly 20 years but I&#39;m not going to stop.(Kidding. Thanks for Valgrind! I still use it for assessing memory corruption vulnerabilities along with ASan.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I once submitted a bug fix for an obscure issue to valgrind. They asked for a test case, which I managed to provide, but I was a bit nervous as I couldn&#39;t immediately see how to fit in their test suite.The response from Julian Seward was so nice it set a permanently high bar for me when random people I don&#39;t know report bugs on my projects!We still run our entire testsuite under valgrind in CI. Amazing tool!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been a user of the Language Tool API as we&#39;re building (experimenting with?) a language learning app [1] and grammar correction is a key component. I really want to love it, and I&#39;m so appreciative of the open source version that has allowed us to get going, but it&#39;s just so... limited. I haven&#39;t really dug into the code, but I gather that it is very rules based and that seems destined to fail because so much of language is context sensitive.For example, it really can&#39;t determine in German if you&#39;re using the correct case or not for a particular verb. Or it can&#39;t really tell if you&#39;re using the right prepositions.Ultimately, we ended up building a grammar engine just for language learners using transformers [2] + a version of errant [3] we ported to be multilingual. It&#39;s not perfect, but after a couple weeks of development was more helpful than LT.1. https://squidgies.app2. e.g. this paper from Grammarly https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12592, but there are a bazillion others3. https://github.com/chrisjbryant/errant"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"    This periodic adjustment mainly benefits scientists and astronomers as it allows them to observe celestial bodies using UTC for most purposes

This is incorrect, dealing with leap seconds is a major problem in astronomy, requiring a data file or even recompile any time there is a new one announced.  Since they are only ever announced 6 months in advance, it creates a lot of logistical problems.Astronomy algorithms usually work in Barycentric Dynamic Time, or Terrestrial Time, or UT1.  In reality the whole invention of UTC is so that people don&#39;t have to deal with those systems on a daily basis.The process most astronomy programs go through is to get the UTC from the user, convert the Gregorian date to a Julian day number to get rid of the Gregorian Calendar altogether.  Then look up the number of leap seconds, add those to the JD to get International Atomic Time, then add 32.184 seconds to get Terrestrial Time.  If Barycentric Dynamic Time is needed, you must first compute the velocity of the Earth relative to the solar system barycenter (which itself requires TDB), then compute the relativistic effects of that motion on Terrestrial Time.  If you need UT1, these can only be obtained by observation from the International Earth Rotation Service, and required daily updates, and interpolation of values in between observations.So, as you can see, leap seconds do nothing to make an astronomer&#39;s life easier.  In fact, we jump through a lot of hoops to make the average person&#39;s life easier.  It sounds like Meta wants to change the definition of time for everyone just to make their programming a little easier.  I find the very premise just out right ridiculous.It&#39;s true that your average person will not be affected by the Sun setting a few seconds earlier.  But eventually it will build up enough error that it eventually has to be addressed, and Meta is just trying to make their problem someone else&#39;s problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everyone is treating this as some idiosyncratic proposal of Facebook&#39;s, but removing leap seconds is a mainstream position.  Representatives of the US, China, France, and a majority of other countries were in favor of this when it was discussed at the 2015 ITU meeting [1] though the UK and Russia&#39;s were not.  This has been under discussion since at least the 2003 ITU meeting in Turin.[1] https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.18855"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can&#39;t help but agree with 80% of this post but strongly disagree with the solution. This feels like a hack that punts the problems to the future.UTC has the leap second cause it&#39;s not &#34;real time&#34; and so now we&#39;re just gonna never sync up UTC to real time at all? How is that the solution? Either we deal with leap seconds or we need to implement something that can&#39;t go backwards and properly models time. Leap seconds seem much simpler...In the end we didn&#39;t get rid of SQL cause of SQL Injection. We fixed the frameworks and promoted the solutions. We may simply need to make a push for languages and etc to just properly support time and promote how to do things correctly. It honestly seems easier."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my experience on small teams that I&#39;ve been on - a key motivator for people is shipping products and features. The sooner and more frequently you can do this the more positive reinforcement there is for the entire team - not to mention reduced risk of something never making it to the target users.Teams that have figured out the optimal way to get product and features into the hands of users as quickly as possible are the happiest teams because it&#39;s evidence that they&#39;re working together efficiently to meet their shared goals."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is why when leading an engineering org I narrowed down to one metric:Committed to Completed RatioIt encourages completing things and only committing to what you can complete.It&#39;s legible, easy to understand by engineering, product, and management, pointless to game, and positively reinforces completion. It&#39;s quite difficult to accurately predict when a complete feature will ship, let alone a whole product. But, if one breaks down a feature into its legible constituent components and then commits to completing just what is within that (which also necessitates any required communication to arrive at understanding the requirements) then over time you can get quite good at predicting what you will be able to get done in a sprint and better at only committing to what you believe you can actually complete."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is very thorough, but makes one fairly big mistake: it assumes there is low variability in task size.This could be a reasonable assumption if you&#39;re very good at adjusting scope, but I would be skeptical unless you have measured it and have the numbers to prove that in practise, tasks indeed turn out to be roughly the same size (±20 % or whatever -- I don&#39;t know the exact threshold.)Why this matters is that under cheap context switches and even modest task size variability, it&#39;s -- surprisingly -- a performant queuing policy to pre-empt the currently processing task to handle every incoming task. The intuition behind this is that if a task is still processing when a new one comes in, it&#39;s likely to be a &#34;big&#34; task, and it&#39;s worth letting small tasks ahead in line. Reduces mean response time.Of course, this could all be moot anyway because context switches are certainly not cheap for software engineers. I just thought I should mention it for nuance. Rules of thumb only get you so far, at some point you have to more accurately model the situation and simulate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those curious about Rust optimization, the “optimized” version makes three changes compared to the “idiomatic” version:* It uses byte strings instead of UTF-8 strings. In my opinion, that’s not an optimization, that’s changing the problem. Depending on the question you’re asking, only one of the two can be correct.* It uses a faster hash algorithm. It’s not the first time this came up in a benchmark article. Rust’s decision to use a DOS-safe hash by default (and not provide a fast algorithm in the std, like other languages do) really seems to hurt it in that kind of microbenchmark.* It uses get_mut+insert instead of the more convenient HashMap::entry method, because the latter would require redundantly allocating the key even in the repeat case. I’ve hit this problem in the past as well. Maybe the upcoming HashMap::raw_entry_mut will make this kind of optimization cleaner."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I looked into GNS a little while ago and what I understood about how it works is:1. I runs on top of GNUnet, which is a huge DHT that can be used for any purpose you like.2. So GNS aims to replace DNS with a newer &#34;modern&#34; protocol, it is not a alternative root zone (like Handshake or such), nor does it decentralize the root zone, it just decentralizes &#34;DNS&#34;.3. How it is supposed to work is, instead of OS bootstrapping using root servers, they are preloaded with a root zone public key (possibly belonging to ICANN) or a list of TLDs (with corresponding owner public keys). Then the key owner can publish zones signed with the corresponding keys on the DHT, which recursively contains keys for child subdomains. It&#39;s like if torrent and DNSSEC had a baby.4. To lookup a domain, you do a request with (tld, pubkey) and verify the response, do this recursively for each label until you have the record you want.5. The problems with DNS it solves is: censorship (DNS is very easy to intercept and censor), query privacy (I don&#39;t know how this works, they don&#39;t seem to use onion routing or something), and secure resolution.One thing to note here is development on GNS started in the 2001s, this was before DNSSEC and DoT/DoH were a thing, and most of the DNS was unsecured (which albeit even is today), and this could have been a completely viable approach."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This might be an unpopular opinion, but I think that decentralized DNS, and decentralized naming in general, is one of the few use cases that can be neatly solved by a blockchain, but is extremely hard to solve any other way.A major problem when designing a decentralized naming system, or any naming system at all really, is preventing malicious users from grabbing all the cool names for themselves. The only way to do this is to make acquiring domains costly, and blockchains are a perfect way to enforce that in a decentralized manner. Other problems include accurately tracking domain ownership and letting the owners transfer domains to others, which cryptocurrencies have solved long ago. As an added benefit, because all domains in such a system are owned by a public key, we suddenly no longer need a root of trust for TLS, instead, we accept any TLS certificate signed by that public key."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; How can a legitimate domain owner tell other people to not use his name in GNS?&gt; A: Names have no owners in GNS, so there cannot be a &#34;legitimate&#34; domain owner. Any user can claim any name (as his preferred name or &#34;pseudonym&#34;) in his NICK record. Similarly, all other users can choose to ignore this preference and use a name of their choice (or even assign no name) for this user.This is confusing me. How is it not a problem that randoms can just claim other people&#39;s domains?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I also think that C# and .NET are awesome. Especially latest releases dotnet 6 and upcoming 7 have a ton of new things to be even more productive.I like the fact, that you can develop command line apps, Web APIs, Desktop Apps and smartphone apps all with the same toolset, including the fact that deployment is possible on nearly every major platform for every major platform (except iOS and macOS Apps, as always only on macOS). Even systems programming and AOT is doable or full featured static deployment is possible integrating a small runtime into a single binary.And boy is .NET fast...This facts made Golang pretty interesting to me, but what I did not like here is the lack of a usable cross platform Plugin-Loader technology, most of the stuff has to be monolithic, then the module management and some of the missing concepts (like generics, which is also now available in go).The sheer amount of concepts in C# is overwhelming (from basics like Generics to less common ones like Extension-Methods, operator overloading, etc.).I don&#39;t like Visual Studio as IDE, but VS Code is an acceptable alternative tool, although I personally prefer the non-free JetBrains Rider.Nuget package manager also has it&#39;s caveats, e.g. that the official repo can only &#34;unlist&#34; packages, not delete them or that the publish times sometimes have horrible delays, but that&#39;s also still acceptable, since you can use the github package registry or bring your own to overcome these issues.Technologies on my todo list include getting into MAUI (a cross platform UI stack) combined with Blazor[1], which can use Web Components in native UI apps and develop TRULY cross platform (Web, Desktop AND Mobile with the same codebase). Like electron, but without the browser dependency due to native integration.Although everything is tied pretty tight to Microsoft, there is a huge open source community developing cross platform libraries, that are easy to use. Even though i find that microsoft has often made strange decisions in the past, the current state is clearly a recommendation to have a look.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eIsQ3Pm2bE"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Amazingly enough it’s not even possible to be sure you’re buying a legitimate Kindle book anymore.I often buy classic books but want a particular edition which might include specific notes or a translation by a specific writer, but following the Amazon search - actually clicking on a link where I’ve constructed the search with meticulous attention to the terms that are essential to me - will often lead to a totally random result from an unknown ‘publisher’ which meets none of my criteria and wasn’t the link that was presented to me.Obviously all the reviews are bunched haphazardly together - including the ones that praise the translation which the presented book doesn’t include, and the ones warning about poor formatting from the pirated edition.If Amazon can’t even sell Kindle titles without commingling, then it blows my mind people buying electronics from them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me, this is a leading indicator that Amazon&#39;s ecommerce side will falter. When I look at the reviews for an item, some reviews are high and people are happy, and other people have terrible experiences that doesn&#39;t even seem to be for the same item. I think it&#39;s because of this issue, where Amazon lets 3rd seller to claim that they have inventory for something.I really don&#39;t trust Amazon for a lot of things now, and would rather go directly to the seller on their site. Especially now that I&#39;ve gotten older, I just want less stuff but with higher quality."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Silk Road was not directly selling drugs, it was only a marketplace where other sellers did it, and for this reason it was taken down. AFAIK selling a counterfeit item is a crime too, so shouldn’t Amazon be treated the same ? One could argue that the Silk Road was created with the purpose of enabling the crime, unlike Amazon, but with the problem becoming bigger every day I think that Amazon knows about it very well but doesn’t act because it is against their economic interest, making it complicit of the crime"</p>

Many, many hours were spent on the various flexagon derivatives.Years later, I made a JS page to combine images and print hexaflexagons for my son&#39;s classmates. Had some fun with that as well; it was much more confounding than I expected.Nowadays, microfiche is gone, the public library is unfortunately not in most kids vernacular, and the attention span that would be required to enjoy doing the math I did has been hijacked.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few years back I was going through some old floppy disks I found in a box and, on one of them, I found a screenshot I took of my desktop circa winter of 2000. In it was a window open with a MUD I was logged into at the time. Another window had Winamp open with a playlist of songs and another window had ICQ open. The only reason I took it was because there was an unofficial competition between our pub and another pub elsewhere on the MUD about which was more popular, and we had finally surpassed them.It&#39;s amazing how many emotions seeing that one image gave me. But the biggest was just this overwhelming sense of nostalgia. As I looked at that, I could remember what I was thinking, what I was feeling, everything that was happening in my super confusing teenage life at that time. Occasionally I will look at that image now, even 22 years later, I can still feel all those feeling again.Of course, my ex&#39;s character is in the screenshot too. So, a bit bittersweet as well. :/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve gotten mixed reactions whenever I share this, but when I program I like to record my screen with OBS.* It&#39;s a mental hack to keep me accountable, especially now working from home. If I&#39;m in an office anyone can look over and see whether or not I&#39;m working. It started as an attempt to mimic this feeling at home, even though I&#39;ll be the only one to ever see the recordings.* It allows me to go back and see how I worked in the past. I have a few videos of myself working from 2015 which I think is pretty neat just because of how different my workflow was back then compared to now. I&#39;m not using the same tools or even on the same operating system.* I&#39;m working on video games which is what makes this very useful for me. If something visually interesting happens, or if there&#39;s graphical bug of some kind, I can go back and breakdown exactly what happened. I&#39;ve stepped through videos frame by frame in the past to debug, it&#39;s been surprisingly helpful.* It allows me to go back and see my progress. I can know what I was working on a given day, see how far I&#39;ve progressed, it&#39;s just generally a good motivator. You can of course do this with git, but if you&#39;re working on something visual it can be nice to see it in motion rather than a textual diff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I totally understand the desire to keep a record of the past, and space is cheap so why not. I used to be a big &#34;digital hoarder&#34;, virtually never deleting anything that might be a bit interesting. But a couple years back I deleted most, though not all of the &#34;archive&#34; of past me. It was a great decision that I don&#39;t regret. The important things you did will still surface from time to time. It&#39;s also always cool to accidentally find a photobucket or google docs account you forget you had and look through it for 10 minutes. But I just don&#39;t find value in intentionally preserving a digital record of myself, and instead allow serendipity to poke my nostalgia centers on occasion. Sorry for the violating the spirit of the thread with a contrarian opinion. My point is just that I&#39;ve done the digital hoarding thing for years and it turned out to not have value, for me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This fractal is non-holomorphic which makes it kind of a dumpster fire..or a burning ship I guess... The easiest layman&#39;s definition of holomorphic is any function or operations on complex numbers that doesn&#39;t peek at the real and imaginary parts of the complex number. In algebra, there is no combination of algebraic operations [1] that can do so. But on computers, we have Re(z) and Im(z), which are easy to calculate since the complex number is simply stored as two parts, and it just pulls one of them out.When you violate this sacred notion, of treating a complex number as a singular entity, indivisible, the operations or functions you get, no longer have nice properties, like being analytic [2]. You are no longer doing algebra, you have gone into the realm of chaotics over R^2 with an equivalence relation through rotations, which is a far different beast.That&#39;s why other fractals that treat complex numbers as first class citizens, singular entities, and don&#39;t use hacks like Re or Im, are much prettier and have less branch cuts.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_operation[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_function"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Pushy pop-ups, &#34;do it now&#34;, flashy colors, and all that stuff.
Things that work like a charm in e-commerce or fashion will most likely not work on devs.Not just &#39;not work&#39;, but &#39;actively repel&#39;. A popup chat bot or a survey form request (during or after using a website or software product) or anything not germane to the task that has a shadow or notification highlight has slowly but surely become a form of wart that elicits a deep, instinctual disgust from me. I&#39;d even say an unhealthy and unreasonable level of disgust.It&#39;s enough to get me to instantly despise a product almost nomatter how well it does its original job.But 100 folks who actually click ads or interact with these distraction baubles (mistakenly or otherwise) are worth thousands of people like me, so I understand why it won&#39;t ever change for the better out of a company&#39;s own volition.---When it comes to advertising, say, developer tooling, I think a large part of the problem is that there&#39;s just not going to be a lot of relevant tools out there, for my job or hobbies, that I either don&#39;t already know about (and aren&#39;t using because I have already evaluated its prospects) or... I am already using it. Conversely, seeing ads for something I am already using has potential for negative effects (see above). Tasteful advertising is thus useful for the rare case of something I don&#39;t know about, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth it when 999/1000 of these ads are detrimental and irrelevant."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work on EthicalAds, one of the ad networks mentioned in the post. We focus on targeting relevant developer-focused ads to content rather than to individuals.The post is great. My only nitpick is that the author mentions that they think retargeting will go away. The scope of retargeting might be reduced especially as third-party cookies stop working but I don&#39;t think retargeting will completely go away. Big ad companies with whom visitors have a direct relationship with (Google, FB) will always be able to do it. They know the pages on their sites and those linked from their site that visitors visit and they will use it to target ads. They don&#39;t need third-party cookies since they have first-party cookies.Networks that just do ads and don&#39;t have relationships with visitors except for advertising will find it harder and harder. At EthicalAds, we don&#39;t do retargeting at all because of our privacy focus, but many ad networks will find retargeting more challenging (less precise, they can always fingerprint users) to do. Doing away with it is a good thing from a privacy perspective but it probably will further entrench the big players."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not included in this list but definitely worth mentioning;- Lowering your hiring bar. When you hire people the burden to get them up to speed and productive is on the existing team. If these people are smart and motivated, great! But no-one benefits from having 200k+ engineers now have to spent their days explaining how GIT (yes, really...) works to a small army of juniors.- Not involving your current team in decisions that affect them. Re-shuffle the teams around, re-architect the product, change the existing workflow, etc. If you hire professionals with 10-20+ years of experience just to ignore their advice, they&#39;re going to be looking for an employer that does appreciate their input very quickly. Nothing is more frustrating than telling a manager not to put his hand in a pan of boiling water, just to see him do it and then blame the cooks for having a pot of boiling water around :)My current manager decided to add 50 outsourced engineers to a team of 5 to deliver the product in a year (instead of the 1.5 - 2 originally guesstimated).In addition to this he decided to give the responsibility for the architecture of the application to outsourced &#34;solution architects&#34; with no domain knowledge and reorganized the teams to split them by job title (e.g testers, developers, operations, &#34;management&#34;, etc).Current productivity is lower with 55 than it was with 5, 3 out of 5 have already handed in their resignation. We&#39;re burning through an additional 3 million this year with 2 crappy React pages to show for it.Next year the damage will probably be worse given the rapid outflow of talent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most of these, I think, relate to a single kinda-meta-problem.Managing software orgs is hard, and most orgs can&#39;t do it well. Using additional management methods, more managers, and more engineers can make the software org less efficient. Software production is weird. Efficiency of software orgs is extremely plastic. An effective 15 person team can outperform a 150 person team and this is normal. Very extreme compared to most fields employing such numbers. Software can be really important &amp; high value. Value can be utterly disconnected from the cost of producing it.I say &#34;less efficient&#34; purposely rather than &#34;worse.&#34; It might actually make sense to go from an efficient 25 person team to an inefficient 500 person team. The additional cost of might be dwarfed by the benefits of marginally more higher output. That might be better economically (even socially), but less efficient.If you&#39;re in one of these orgs, you will not be more happy though. Efficiency feels good. Inefficiency feels bad."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32206579">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Tar is pretty unusual for an archive file format. There&#39;s no archive header, no index of files to fascilitate seeking, no magic bytes to help file and its ilk detect whether a file is a tar archive, no footer, no archive-wide metadata. The only kind of thing in a tar file is a file object.tar = tape archive.  It was designed around streaming files to a tape drive in a serial fashion.  Tape bandwidth has almost always been slow compared to source data devices.  You need to start writing to the target device as fast as possible.  Taking time to construct a full index just delays starting the slowest stage of things, while providing only relatively minimal benefit.Generating an index is fairly straightforward, the file headers give you the information you need, including what you need to know to get to the next file header.  Your only bottleneck is just how fast random reads are.  If the file is on disk, it should be relatively trivial.It&#39;s even possible to do this relatively cheaply with Range headers if you&#39;re looking at a tar file stored on an HTTP endpoint, though you&#39;ll likely want to think about some smart pre-fetching behaviour."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Punchline:&gt; My tarball happened to contain over 800 000 links with &#34;..&#34; as a path component. It also happened to contain over 5.4 million hard links.The behavior is more precisely described not as quadratic, but O(n*m), where n is the number of symlinks pointing outside of the extraction directory, and m is the number of hardlinks. It happens because of the security precautions gnu tar performs to make sure a malicious archive can&#39;t set up a symlink pointing to an arbitrary place in your filesystem, and then extract files to it. The strategy they use has an unoptimized corner case when the archive also has a lot of hardlinks.The mechanism could probably be improved by remembering the list of deferred symlinks in a hash map rather than a linked list, but also, both symlinks pointing outside the extraction directory, and hardlinks, are uncommon.(Edited to correct: The problem exists even if the hardlinks do not actually point at the symlinks.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; You may think that the numeric values (file_mode, file_size, file_mtime, ...) would be encoded in base 10, or maybe in hex, or using plain binary numbers (&#34;base 256&#34;). But no, they&#39;re actually encoded as octal strings (with a NUL terminator, or sometimes a space terminator). Tar is the only file format I know of which uses base 8 to encode numbers.Tar’s “competitor”, cpio, does this as well (at least in one of the popular implementations). The Xcode XIP file, if you’re familiar with that particular format, is a couple layers of wrapping on top of a cpio archive, so deep inside my tool to expand these there’s a spot where I read these all out in a similar fashion: https://github.com/saagarjha/unxip/blob/5dcfe2c0f9578bc43070...More generally, though, both tar and cpio doesn’t have an index because they don’t need them, they’re meant to be decompressed in a streaming fashion where this information isn’t necessary. It’s kind of inconvenient if you want to extract a single file, but for large archives you really want to compress files together and maintaining an index for this is both expensive and nontrivial, so I guess these formats are just “good enough”."</p>

A simple resize was taking 6 hours on my mac 10 years ago, due to IM trying to allocate the whole image at once and then swapping non-stop. And then I discovered that the Graphics Magick fork did streamed resizing, and did the task in a couple of minutes. It’s a small and relatively easy change, but someone had to prioritize handling large inputs first. This is one reason software is hard for me; every time I need to process large inputs I wish I had written a streaming mechanism, but every time I start a project I decide to do the easy thing first and wait until I critically need streaming. Maybe it’s the right thing to do to avoid over-engineering, but this comes up often enough that I’m usually in a mild state of frustration about something being under-developed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very happy that Aras is fighting the good fight, doing some great OSS work after his departure from Unity.  The speed up numbers are quite impressive!I remember when I was first getting into shader programming 10+ years ago, I asked a question on the Unity forums and Aras was one of the first to respond.  Even then he was a titanic figure behind Unity’s graphics stack.  I never forgot how kind he was to help a kid like me out, I’m sure he was quite busy!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The speedup factor is order-dependent.This is why it is very difficult to justify optimization work to management. If there are 20 things to optimize that take 10 seconds each, the change isn&#39;t really noticeable until you&#39;re getting past half-way. And once your processing already takes a few minutes, what&#39;s the harm in adding another 10 seconds?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Free or extremely cheap transportation is a fascinating development. I always found it odd that the rhetoric around transportation was that it should make money. We don&#39;t expect other parts of the government to turn a profit. Why transportation?If Amtrak went that direction and made its transportation close to free, I wonder if we&#39;d see more people try it out. Maybe it&#39;d gain some popularity and we could finally see a shift away from cars. Public transportation is a difficult process because until the money is spent and the line is there, people are not sold. Whereas with cars, even if a highway is not built, people still have a car by default. Therefore the government needs to float money, either in infrastructure or in subsidized fares. At least subsidized fares is a little less binary than infrastructure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I live in Tokyo now, but I&#39;m from Valencia, Spain. I knew the train there was bad when the local subway network, called &#34;metrovalencia&#34;, was known locally as &#34;metrovalenshit&#34; (there&#39;s even a twitter @metrovalenshit), but compared to other cities or specially Tokyo it&#39;s like a toy. In here (Tokyo) they make major station changes without even disrupting traffic[1], the only time traffic is disrupted meaningfully is when there&#39;s a major earthquake/typhoon.Back in Valencia, the gvmt started building a new line, but then they abandoned it for over a decade. In some weekends with strong rains it floods. At least we got to see really beautiful pictures when someone entered and navigated with a boat! Multiple times across the years[2][3].If you go a bit more local (smaller towns) and want to take a bus that is scheduled every 20 min, you go to the bus stop and hope that one will come within the next hour. We had to help a foreigner once that was gonna miss her flight since she was waiting for over an hour with no sight of a bus.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BYW4YYqG5A[2] https://web.archive.org/web/20130111154819/http://www.goodfe...[3] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022pgffEy6A"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"City public transportation, at a very minimum, should be free. The NYC Subway should be free. The Tube in London should be free.The standard American response is to object on the grounds that we&#39;re subsidizing something and it&#39;s a wasteful government expenditure. You know what else that applies to? Roads. We subsidize roads and everyone is OK with that.Charging for public transport is just a regressive tax on what are typically the lowest paid workers.Regional transportation is more interesting. I&#39;m not sure how that&#39;ll work in practice but I&#39;m open to it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"But where are the fusion neutrons? (See Voodoo Fusion [1])[1] https://vixra.org/pdf/1812.0382v1.pdfI&#39;m a professional fission guy. I started out in fusion and switched to advanced fission. These days I don&#39;t see why we don&#39;t just build lots more regular old LWR fission reactors.Imagining that somehow fusion is going to a) work, b) be cheap (fuel cost is only 5% of total nuclear fission cost so who cares), and c) not have the same stigma as fission is kind of weird in my mind.For example, there are leaks of tiny amounts of tritium at some fission plants and people lose their minds. Fusion reactors will have many orders of mag more tritium. Will people not lose their minds just the same? Tritium is notoriously hard to contain since it&#39;s so small. It can permeate through metal like a hot knife through butter.Also, lots of people worry about fission and nuclear weapons proliferation. So does fusion get around this? Not really. In fact it&#39;s worse. Did you know that the two materials you need to make thermonuclear weapons are tritium and plutonium? Tritium breeding is required by almost all practical fusion power plants (the other reactions are 100s to 1000s of times harder, I don&#39;t care what x random fusion CEO says, they&#39;re in it for the sweet billionaire side project money).Plutonium is made by irradiating natural uranium from the dirt with neutrons. Practical fusion reactors have lots of neutrons. Really high energy ones too.Anyway let&#39;s just do fission you guys. It&#39;s way easier. It has been working fine since the 1950s. It&#39;s zero carbon. Waste problem is solved (see Onkalo, and reprocessing). It net saves millions of lives by displacing air pollution. It runs 24/7 on a tiny land and material footprint. We have enough uranium and thorium to run the whole world for 4 billion (with a b) years using breeder reactors (demonstrated in 1952 in Idaho). Get the Koreans over here to build some ARP1400s or the Chinese to build some Hualong Ones until we figure out how to project manage again and then call it good."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A friendly reminder that the idea posed by a pioneer of nuclear energy of just dumping big bombs in a hole and harvesting the heat energy with steam/plasma has never been invalidated and remains the most efficiently-simple solution immediately viablehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_PACERIf containment is your concern (though underground blast effects are decently understood, and blast chambers could be constructed with still strongly net economic/energy positive) - this does not need to be built around any population centers.  At a cost of 1.5% efficiency loss per 1000 km, UHV power lines can direct it from a single write-off location anywhere on earth.  That single location can likely be scaled to supply well beyond the total current global energy production.https://en.geidco.org.cn/aboutgei/uhv/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I represent Sweden in the ISO WG14, and I voted for the inclusion of Embed in to C23. Its a good feature. But its not a necessary feature and I think JeanHeyd is wrong in his criticism of the pace of wg14 work. I have found everyone in wg14 to be very hardworking and serious about their work.Cs main strengthen is its portability and simplicity. Therefore we should be very conservative, and not add anything quickly. There are plenty of languages to choose form if you want a &#34;modern&#34; language with lots of conveniences. If you want a truly portable language there is really only C. And when I say truly, I mean for platforms without file systems, or operating systems or where bytes aren&#39;t 8 bits, that doesn&#39;t use ASCI or Unicode, where NULL isn&#39;t on address 0 and so on.We are the stewards of this, and the work we put in, while large, is tiny compared to the impact we have. Any change we makes, needs to be addressed by every compiler maintainer. There are millions of lines of code that depend on every part of the standard. A 1% performance loss is millions of tons of CO2 released, and billions in added hardware and energy costs.In this privileged position, we have to be very mindful of the concerns of our users, and take the time too look at every corner case in detail before adding any new features. If we add something, then people will depend on its behavior, no matter how bad, and we therefor will have great difficulty in fixing it in the future without breaking our users work, so we have to get it right the first time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; told me this form was non-ideal and it was worth voting against (and that they’d want the pure, beautiful C++ version only[1])I heard about #embed, but I didn&#39;t hear about std::embed before. After looking at the proposal, to me it does look a lot better than #embed, because reading binary data and converting it to text, only to then convert it to binary again seems needlessly complex and wasteful. I also don&#39;t like that it extends the preprocessor, when IMHO the preprocessor should at worst be left as is, and at best be slowly deprecated in favour of features which compose well with C proper.Going beyond the gut reaction and moving on to hard data, as you can expect from this design, std::embed of course is faster during compilation than #embed for bigger files (comparable for moderately-sized files, and a bit slower for tiny files).I&#39;m not a huge fan of C++, but the fact that C++ removed trigraphs in C++17 and that it&#39;s generally adding features replacing the preprocessor scores a point with me.[1]: &lt;https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p10...&gt;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"LLM are definitely not sentient. As someone with a PhD in this domain, I attribute the &#39;magic&#39; to large scale statistical knowledge assimilation by the models - and reproduction to prompts which closely match the inputs&#39; sentence embedding.GPT-3 is known to fail in many circumstances which would otherwise be commonplace logic. (I remember seeing how addition of two small numbers yielded results - but larger numbers gave garbled output; more likely that GPT3 had seen similar training data.)The belief of sentience isn&#39;t new. When ELIZA came out few decades ago, a lot of people were also astounded &amp; thought this &#34;probably was more than met the eyes&#34;.It&#39;s a fad. Once people understand that sentience also means self-awareness, empathy &amp; extrapolation of logic to assess unseen task (to name a few), this myth will taper off."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; In his conversations with LaMDA, Lemoine discovered the system had developed a deep sense of self-awareness, expressing concern about death, a desire for protection, and a conviction that it felt emotions like happiness and sadness.Allegedly.The thing about conversations with LaMDA is that you need to prime them with keywords and topics, and LaMDA can respond with the primed keywords and topics. Obviously LaMDA is much more sophisticated than ELIZA, but we should be careful to remember how well ELIZA fools some people, even to this day. If ELIZA fools people just by rearranging words around, then just imagine how many people will be fooled if you have statistical models of text across thousands of topics.You can go pretty far down the rabbit and explore questions like, &#34;What is sentience?&#34; &#34;Do humans just respond to stimuli and repeat information?&#34; etc. None of these questions are tested here.The problem here is that we know how LaMDA works and there&#39;s just no way it meets the bar for sentience, no matter where you put the bar. LaMDA is trained to acquire information, and then it&#39;s designed so that it says things which make sense in context. It does not acquire new information from conversations, but it is programmed to not say contradictory things.There is zero doubt. LaMDA is not sentient."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just curious, what evidence do we have that humans are sentient, other than our own conscious observations? Is there any physical feature or process in the human brain you can point to where you can say, “aha, that’s it, this is where the lights turn on”? It seems like this is part of a bigger issue that nobody really has a clear understanding of what sentience actually is (with or without a PhD)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I greatly enjoy talking with people in person (outdoors of course) these days about interesting things because it&#39;s such a rare occurrence... One of the most troubling things though is how many people get easily wound up (and aren&#39;t forgiving) about misunderstandings in conversations.People seem to be increasingly concrete in their judgements about social, economic, and political issues that have nothing to do with them as individuals, and often it results in fighting words, and that&#39;s crazy to me. A deep polarization is coming from many fronts, and it also over-emphasizes issues, making people far more offensive and defensive than before -- possibly heightened because of pandemic-related isolation and economic stress.I think a lot of people judge the world based on tropes... The small-minded view based only on the people they&#39;ve observed, rather than being able to place themselves in the shoes of others they don&#39;t know, and it&#39;s a growing problem when narrowly focused people like this lead and make decisions for us all. I think we really need to reject the use of tropes in discussions as fact because it&#39;s toxic, but at the same time, I work hard to not be triggered by anything that&#39;s well intended. We all make mistakes, and as long as you can choose to walk away, being misunderstood is a small price to pay for regular human communication."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An eye-opening perspective came to me a few years ago when I first heard the quote,” When you’re 20, you care what everyone thinks, when you’re 40 you stop caring what everyone thinks, when you’re 60, you realize no one was ever thinking about you in the first place“[0]
That can be good and bad, but is a personally useful frame of reference for the world.  It helps to not take things too personally, but also to be intentionally active in people’s lives when I _want_ to be considered.[0], not sure who to attribute: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/mar/08/viral-imag..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just scanned the first few paragraphs, but saved this as I find it to be a great reminder. I try to read lists of the various human mis-perceptions periodically to build &#34;muscle memory&#34; into my consiousness. I first started looking into this about 10 years ago when I was baffled by the way people acted at work. Now that I realize that &#34;rational&#34; is not default behavior for most people I am way less confused in my daily life. Still amazed though. :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The New York Times did some decent reporting into the pseudo-brands which comes closer to answering the question in the title: having a registered trademark unlocks a lot of on-platform seller tools (predictive analytics, early review program, etc.), and the easiest path to a trademark is to have an utterly unique, nonsense name. Some Chinese municipalities were also offering cash incentives for citizens who obtained foreign intellectual property registrations, further exacerbating the problem.Full article at https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/style/amazon-trademark-co..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The scam is enormously profitable for Amazon and the Chinese black hats. You can tell it is really profitable because Amazon will compensate you for up to $1000 for damages caused by this junk. https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58163915I believe that Amazon probably could not turn the screws on these companies even if it wanted to. It would be a massive loss to their revenue and share holders would revolt. It would bring prices up in aggregate if these companies could not sell junk on the platform.The best they can do is play coy and hope the US government or EU does not crack down hard on them. Caveat Emptor my friends!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is it correct to say that when you get something &#34;shipped and sold by Amazon.com&#34;, it really comes from them? It&#39;s the &#34;fulfilled by Amazon&#34; (the infamous FBA) that you need to watch out for.It&#39;s a bit screwy, but you can filter by seller by clicking into a specific product category, and then selecting Amazon.com in the bar on the left. Then all the items should be &#34;shipped and sold by Amazon.com&#34;.But I&#39;ve been sort of shocked to find recently that Amazon&#39;s prices, even with free shipping, are often not competitive with buying first-party, even with paying the shipping. For a lot of products these days, if there&#39;s a recognizable name brand associated with it, I just by first-party. You get it slower, but you know what you&#39;re getting, and probably end up giving more money to the seller too.I would not have seen myself doing this ten years ago."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People both underestimate and overestimate what PV can do. In summer and around noon, here in western Europe, there is so much PV-electricity produced that it is _almost_ enough to fulfill all demands. In winter, the amount is like a drop in the desert.I have built a 30 kWp PV at home 2 years ago - you would think this is quite big, for a private plant. It is not enough. If I want to power a heat pump (with drilled holes), e.g. to cover the heating for the house from November - February, I calculated I would need about 70 to 80 kWp (optimized for winter sun angle, e.g. pretty steep modules at 60° or 70° that relatively produce less in summer, but more in winter).Now I imagine all the people that buy tiny 5 kWp plants. The only way this would work is collaborative, with buffers at the medium-voltage level.So the biggest problem is really energy transfer or relocation, between different time&#39;s and regions´ needs (winter, summer; night, day; or from different regions worldwide)... btw. here&#39;s a graphic for the calculation [1]. Blue is an imaginary heating pump electricity consumption over the year, red is the predicted pv production for a 60 kWp plant, where 30 kWp are at 60° angle - calculated with Europe&#39;s pvgis tool [2].[1]: https://ibb.co/WKsHPKX[2]: https://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvg_tools/en/"</p>

But there&#39;s nothing to say that something couldn&#39;t function the other way if there was enough willpower and budget to cover, for instance, a huge chunk of the desert near Edwards AFB in CA with hundreds of megawatts of photovoltaics.I searched for &#34;high voltage DC&#34; in that article and didn&#39;t see a mention of it, or anything much else about long distance transport of power.The technology now exists to theoretically cover many hundreds of square km of Libya in photovoltaics and take the electricty to Europe through a sub-sea cable, or series of cables.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi folks - I&#39;m the creator/teacher of this course. I&#39;d be happy to answer any questions that you have about the course, learning deep learning in general, or the state of deep learning in 2022."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am so grateful the FastAI team exists. It wasn&#39;t until I discovered their &#34;Machine Learning for Coders&#34; course that I really started to grok ML. I was in grad school trying to pivot my career from finance to data science. I didn&#39;t come from a computer science / math background and things just weren&#39;t clicking for me. I remember feeling angry, embarrassed, dumb, and overall that I wasn&#39;t smart enough to learn this stuff -- I was incredibly discouraged and felt that I didn&#39;t belong there. I was lucky enough to stumble across one of the course videos on YouTube (thanks recommendation algorithm!), and the rest is history.The amazing thing about these courses is how simple Jeremy (and team) are able to make machine learning. I didn&#39;t need to understand python dependency management in order to learn how to train an really good image classifier. Their approach helped me have lots of little wins, gave me confidence, and helped build the motivation to slog through the harder stuff when I needed to.From the bottom of my heart, thank you @jph00. You changed my life immeasurably for the better. I learned that I AM good enough, I AM smart enough, and I CAN do hard things... I just had to find the right way to learn them. Your courses completely changed my perspective on what was possible for me and opened the door to some of my life&#39;s greatest passions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first Fast.ai course back in around 2016 changed my life.I was studying a masters in statistics and computer science that had 1 neural networks lecture and nobody knew anything about deep learning. Fast.ai and Jeremy’s teaching style helped me start playing with deep learning models really quickly and I changed my thesis topic to computer vision.I ended up consulting on the topic and doing various startups leading to the startup I’m working on now which just finished YC (AiSupervision W22).I doubt be here without fast.ai. I highly recommend and appreciate all the work that Jeremy and the rest of fast.ai do!"</p>

It makes the publishers argument look less like &#34;we were robbed&#34; and more like &#34;we should have made even more cash off the pandemic.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For non lawyers: a request for summary judgment is something any lawyer will do, possibly multiple times in a case. And the vast majority of the time, they’re denied. It does not mean that their case is a slam dunk or anything; just that they want the judge to prematurely end the matter in their favor.It’s almost a useless motion, but because it has worked sometimes, your lawyer would be stupid to not try it.In other words, an article saying that a party requested summary judgment doesn’t really mean anything. I’m almost certain the other party filed one as well."</p>

Because if you have the same frontpage for everyone, it&#39;s feasible to have an expert just pick that instead of needing some weird flaky NN that&#39;s expensive to develop, train, and run, and produces bland (or disturbing)  recommendations anyways.(Even algorithmically-driven sites like HN benefit from that, like dang manually emailing people to resubmit interesting stories.)"</p>

Stanislaus, Yosemite, Sierra, Kings, Sequoia. It was amazing boondocking in the middle of nowhere, no cell signal and taking baths in what is left of the rivers and lakes...Once you get past Yosemite, pretty much all of the reservoirs are empty to less than half full. Majority of the streams are gone.It gets worse the further you head south. Kings and Sequoia are pretty much decimated forests from the fires and beetles. Dead trees for as far as you can see. Given the lack of water, I expect them to be desert in just a few more years.There are quite a few hydro power generation stations deep in the mountains that I had no idea existed. I suspect they will close down as well. I wonder what effect that will have on California power supply over the coming years. That said, it was pretty clear that PG&amp;E is working on updating the infrastructure as they are all over the place working on things.If I hadn&#39;t seen it for myself, I wouldn&#39;t believe it.

It was written before a climate-related megadrought was really on anyone&#39;s long-term radar, but it really explains a lot.For example, dams are only part of the water storage picture, there&#39;s also groundwater, and the water projects often had the goal of protecting groundwater (keeping the water table closer to the surface), but then once they&#39;d provided water via a dam or aquaduct, the farmers would just expand the areas they were farming and groundwater extraction would often increase as a side effect.Humans really aren&#39;t that good at long-term planning, is one conclusion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently left a boutique agency of 5 years and I can definitely resonate with this one. Our agency aimed to catch big fish, and we did, but since they are hard to land we&#39;d pick up small jobs in the meantime, just like the project that you&#39;re describing here. In my perspective, this isn&#39;t someone deliberately ripping you off. I imagine they intended to ship at the cost they quoted, but the team didn&#39;t adjust their working style to match your price point.All the variations of the logo and design mocks are clearly overkill for a $15k project. The design team had time to fill and wanted to provide lots of options for you to pick from, as they typically would on a larger project. Those variations are an expectation for $100k clients, and you got the $100k customer treatment, but unfortunately not at a discount.The reality is, small jobs like this are effectively make-work projects for an agency. They typically don&#39;t pay enough to be an effective use of time for the agency, but are a way to stay in the black between higher value projects. Small customers become &#34;nuisance&#34; customers as soon as a something better is landed. The team members being swapped out as they are needed elsewhere and newly joining team members then need to re-contextualize and regain momentum, all on your dime.Your takeaway is correct, don&#39;t be a small fish for an agency. If they&#39;re busy they won&#39;t take your work, and if do show interest, they are desperate for work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"More anecdotal evidence: a few years back I wanted to get out of the work situation I was in. I looked around, had some interviews, had some offers. None of the postings had salary ranges, as is common where I live.My eyes, however, were set on a specific small company because I liked their product. The process was long and involved multiple meetings, a take-home problem, and stretched over 2 or so months. I was upfront about what my salary expectations were (wasn&#39;t looking for a raise, just a lateral move). They said we discuss salary when you meet the founders, i.e. the last step before getting hired, but they also didn&#39;t tell me that my range was way off.Turns out I had played this 9 week game and turned down other offers just to be severely low-balled by them. Maybe they saw that I really wanted the position and thought they could get away with a low offer.Obviously, I rejected their offer on the spot. I also promised myself to never, _ever_, be fooled like that again. We talk money before I invest any significant amount of time or I walk."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We just went through a large hiring cycle. We posted two versions for every job posting- one with salary ranges and one without.The ads performed equally well in regard to total responses with the better candidates responding to the ones without salary ranges.And... before you say, perhaps your salary ranges were bad, they weren&#39;t. Our salary offerings are very aggressive to the developer&#39;s benefit. In my opinion, salary is a sign of respect from you employer.If your primary reason for responding to an ad is based upon salary you are not going to be happy where you work. I promise. Of the top reasons people are happy at work, salary is way down on the list. [0] It is important, it makes it possible to pay bills, but it isn&#39;t what makes people happy.Meaning, if you are looking for a place you will enjoy working, do not start with salary.[0]https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2014/12/15/the-top-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My former employer had a lot of trouble hiring and getting applicants even though we paid very high wages. They asked for my help. Naturally, they hadn&#39;t posted the salary range. I changed up the listing to talk about what we provided as a company for the employee and why we were such a great place to work and included our high salaries. We immediately had trouble keeping up with the number of applicants.If you pay well, they will come."</p>

However if thousands of people die in thousands different places, it is ignored and considered a fact of life.When a plane or train crashes, we stop everything and redesign the entire network to prevent this from happening again.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It is widely recognized that there is an epidemic of suicides among current and former military personnel, especially those who have been on active duty in a combat theater... There were 3,481 combat deaths in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Since 9/11, there have been over 30,000 military suicides. Over 20 soldiers a day take their own lives.Pet peeve: while I really like the general point of the article, I wish the author had actually provided statistics that support the claim they are making here. 30k suicides sounds like a lot, but what&#39;s the base rate in the general population? The numbers provided don&#39;t actually tell you whether the rate of military suicides is higher than civilian ones, and that kind of undermines the point. To be concrete I&#39;m looking for something like &#34;the base rate of suicide is X% chance per year, whereas amongst soldiers it&#39;s Y% chance per year, suggesting a risk factor of (Y-X)% caused by military service.&#34;A quick search finds some research (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_veteran....) that suggests the rate of suicide among veterans is 1.5x the base rate, which is substantial. Using those numbers suggests that 10k of those suicides quoted above were specifically attributable to military service (and 20k would be &#34;baseline civilian risk of suicide&#34;)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Never owned a car of my own until two years ago. Our car has been hit three times in the last two years. Once totaled on the high way (another drivers fault) and twice while parked. Roughly 50K in damages across the two cars and 3 months in the shop doing repairs. We spent 20K on a new car after the old one was totaled and insurance paid out a fraction of what a similar car would cost. We&#39;ve paid close to 2K in deductibles, way too much for car insurance from a company that doesnt give a shit about us, and close to 1k on car cameras and backup batteries.Thankfully we havnt been hurt but we got lucky. When the car was totaled it was in heavy traffic going 40+ mph and caused a 4 car pile up. I know people who have died in accidents or had their kids die. My immediate family was incredible lucky to not be killed by a drunk driver in a very bad accident early on in my life.Driving sucks."</p>

They’ll dig up a case study from one of their 400 offices somewhere, claiming to be experts on whatever the topic is. Meanwhile, in actuality, your project will be staffed with a team of 24 year old kids where this is their first assignment. And it doesn’t matter anyways, because the people who worked on the original case study are long gone and would never communicate with other offices even if still around.Meanwhile at the big company, you’ll have the opposite problem. A team of people with decades of experience, but who don’t really know anything about anything other than how to make their corporate machine not fire them. They’ll think they know what they want, and will confidently tell you…but in actuality, these people have zero understanding of technology or even how their business runs. And who can blame them, they’ve spent a 30 year career not doing or risking anything specifically, so its hard to learn how anything works with no feedback loop.It then becomes a delicate dance, can the consulting team learn how to do the thing they sold the client fast enough, before the client does their best to try to ruin the project out of sheer hubris and incompetence.This case is famous for being one where the dance went so bad it became a meme."</p>

What you get with that license is... the world&#39;s most complex and difficult content management system, that you now have to develop your whole platform around.

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32186203">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not a very deep CS-y one, but still one of my favourite data structures: Promise Maps.It only works in languages where promises/futures/tasks are a first-class citizen. Eg JavaScript.When caching the result of an expensive computation or a network call, don&#39;t actually cache the result, but cache the promise that awaits the result. Ie don&#39;t make a    Map&lt;Key, Result&gt;

but a    Map&lt;Key, Promise&lt;Result&gt;&gt;

This way, if a new, uncached key gets requested twice in rapid succession, ie faster than the computation takes, you avoid computing/fetching the same value twice. This trick works because:- promises hold on to their result value indefinitely (until they&#39;re GC&#39;ed)- you can await (or .then()) an existing promise as many times as you want- awaiting an already-resolved promise is a very low-overhead operation.In other words, the promise acts as a mutex around the computation, and the resulting code is understandable even by people unfamiliar with mutexes, locks and so on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cache-Oblivious Data Structures: https://cs.au.dk/~gerth/MassiveData02/notes/demaine.pdfA vaguely related notion is that naive analysis of big-O complexity in typical CS texts ignores over the increasing latency/cost of data access as the data size grows. This can&#39;t be ignored, no matter how much we would like to hand-wave it away, because physics gets in the way.A way to think about it is that a CPU core is like a central point with &#34;rings&#34; of data arranged around it in a more-or-less a flat plane. The L1 cache is a tiny ring, then L2 is a bit further out physically and has a larger area, then L3 is even bigger and further away, etc... all the way out to permanent storage that&#39;s potentially across the building somewhere in a disk array.In essence, as data size &#39;n&#39; grows, the random access time grows as sqrt(n), because that&#39;s the radius of the growing circle with area &#39;n&#39;.Hence, a lot of algorithms that on paper have identical performance don&#39;t in reality, because one of the two may have an extra sqrt(n) factor in there.This is why streaming and array-based data structures and algorithms tend to be faster than random-access, even if the latter is theoretically more efficient. So for example merge join is faster than nested loop join, even though they have the same performance in theory."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The union-find data structure / algorithm is useful and a lot of fun.The goal is a data structure where you can perform operations like &#34;a and b are in the same set&#34;, &#34;b and c are in the same set&#34; and then get answers to questions like &#34;are a and c in the same set?&#34; (yes, in this example.)The implementation starts out pretty obvious - a tree where every element either points at itself or some thing it was merged with. To check if two elements are in the same set, check if they have the same parent. Without analyzing it, it sounds like you&#39;ll average findRoot() performance of O(log(n)), worst-case O(n).There are a couple of simple optimizations you can do to this structure, the type of things that seem like they shouldn&#39;t end up affecting asymptotic runtime all that much. The first is that, whenever you find a root, you can re-parent all the nodes you visited on the way to that root, so they&#39;ll all be quicker to look up next time. The other is that you keep track of the size of sets, and always make the larger set be the parent of the smaller.And neither of those actually do anything impressive alone, but if you use both, the algorithm suddenly becomes incredibly fast, with the slowest-growing (non-constant) complexity I&#39;ve ever heard of: O(the inverse of the Ackermann function(n)). Or, for any reasonable N, O(4 or less)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I started reading the article I thought the title was a bit click-baity for Science. But then I noticed that the theory it refers to was not the amyloid hypothesis itself, but the toxic oligomer hypothesis that emerged later. That theory is pretty much the main potential explanation on why every single drug targeting Aβ failed that still keeps Aβ fibrils relevant. It&#39;s a very convenient theory because it keeps the main original observations about the fibrils relevant while explaining why therapies that target them don&#39;t work.One part that is really important that is mentioned in the middle of the article is that these systems are very difficult to handle, and it&#39;s almost impossible to make many of them nicely reproducible. Fibril and oligomer formation depends a lot on the environment and reacts to tiny differences.I find this kind of fraud deeply frustrating, there is so much wasted effort in the wake of faked high-profile results."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh my god if true, and it looks to be true this is huge.The amyloid beta (Aβ) hypothesis has always been fishy but this paper is basically the bedrock of the current investigational trajectory.The Aβ hypothesis was almost dead in 2006 when this method was invented and results posted and it sent shockwaves through the research world. Since then spending on Aβ research by NIH has gone from $0 to $290 million all it seems based on a lie cited over 2000 times in further papers.The article is pretty convincing as is the independent verification that not only concurred but found additional evidence.Sylvain Lesne has some ‘splainin to do."</p>

He is not at the origin of the amyloid-β hypothesis which is more than 100 years old.Even more there are thousand papers published about Aβ*56 and Alzheimer&#39;s disease. How could this guy responsible for this mess?And if what he published was wrong, why this was discovered only 18 later if thousands scientists are working in the field?My understanding is that there is a need to find a scapegoat for the amyloid-β and pointing to an obscure guy is in the interest of many big fish.[0] https://www.statnews.com/2019/05/21/alzheimers-disease-amylo..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I believe the reason cat gets interrupted when we press Ctrl+C is that the Linux kernel on the server side receives this \x03 character, recognizes that it means “interrupt”, and then sends a SIGINT to the process that owns the pseudoterminal’s process group. So it’s handled in the kernel and not in userspace.Also interestingly, the use of \x03 for this purpose is a default, but it&#39;s not hardcoded. You can change it with the stty command.For example, if you runstty intr &#39;^X&#39;then your interrupt character sequence will be Ctrl+X instead of Ctrl+C (!).In order to make this change, the stty program actually has to call into the kernel with an ioctl call (TCSETS or a related ioctl, for &#34;terminal control set settings&#34;).You can learn more about this ioctl on Linux in the ioctl_tty(2) man page, and you can see the various settings that can be changed this way withstty -a(It&#39;s a little bit confusing which things are handled by the readline library and which things are handled by the kernel, as the kernel&#39;s ability to support some rudimentary line-editing features on an interactive terminal long predates libraries like readline. I think readline might actually disable kernel interpretation of some of these control characters when it starts accepting input, and then re-enable them when it stops, but I&#39;ve never looked into that.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The client sends l and then immediately receives an l sent back. I guess the idea here is that the client is really dumb – it doesn’t know that when I type an l, I want an l to be echoed back to the screen. It has to be told explicitly by the server process to display it.Of course the client may be really dumb! Here is a 1930s teletype used as a Linux terminal:https://youtu.be/2XLZ4Z8LpEE?t=656If you would not do it that way, you would run into all kinds of synchronicity problems. How could you be sure that, after rapidly making 50 keystrokes, every keystroke was received by the other end, in that order?"</p>

Here’s an old chart from the 60s that explains it:https://programesecure.com/ascii-values-table-generator-in-c...Unfortunately if you just see the character codes with the decimal, hex, and octal next to them this logic is obscured.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve given this advice elsewhere, and I&#39;ll give it here. Go look at the small business initiatives by each branch of the U.S. military; many are now posting lists of open contracts that you can bid on for an incredible array of things.Browse through those lists and find something you can build.I really believe the U.S. military is in the midst of a large scale transfer of military spending from traditional large defense contractors to smaller, innovative companies. The Air Force has even opened its own venture capital arm and is actively investing in small businesses. Most, if not every, branch in the military publicly posts contracts for small businesses to bid on.I think Anduril is a great example of the possibilities in the &#34;new&#34; defense space.What&#39;s interesting is this shift is very reminiscent of military manufacturing in Japan during World War 2; much of the manufacturing was actually done by small businesses of &lt; 30 employees in &#34;garages&#34; scattered around the country instead of very large factories. That was one of the reasons American bombing by Superfortresses was so ineffective at first, and one of the reasons incendiary bombs began being used.Happy to provide more detail on this. I&#39;ve been thinking about this space for awhile."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to be the education director at a makerspace and now run a 3D printing company selling small plastic parts and teaching entrepreneurs how to start small manufacturing businesses at home.Few thoughts:- Focus on your hobbies and other industries you know well. What problems exist? Where can you make things better? Are there problems people mention over and over again?- CAD modeling is often THE fundamental skill needed for people to bring their ideas to market. You can make CAD models that look almost real using software you can get for free. This allows you to work backwards, first determining if there&#39;s a market, and also working out many of the design flaws before making somethingIf you&#39;re just excited to make stuff, and want to get your hands on something, you can do all kinds of things in a tight space.- 3D printers are small and provide many automated opportunities
- Laser cutters are dead simple to set up and use to make real products and are easy to automate. 
- CNC machines can be had for under 5k and are super powerful
- Portable MIG welders have a small footprint and welding tends to be in high demand
- Leather working tends to be high perceived value though automation is limited
- Soldering and electronics repair requires little space but again, automation is limitedI&#39;ve got loads of other ideas too but I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s good for now. My contact information is in my profile if you&#39;d like to talk more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I started making jet ski tread mats out of astro turf in my garage last year. Dead simple to cut, margin is super high ($60 for a standard set of three on ~$8 worth of material), and time spent per unit from roll to package is something like 15-20 minutes. It was fun and made about $30k over the summer months but I stopped when I moved back to the west coast.I could have handled the whole operation in a spare bedroom if I didn&#39;t have a garage, and there are plenty of areas where I could have dropped the time required or the cost. I never bought the turf in bulk and I used household scissors to cut from a template so buying a roll and cutting with something more effective may have netted me more. Niche leisure products in spend-y verticals typically do well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It might be worth mentioning a famous abdication which caused a lot of consternation, albeit in another game.  I love this story but may have gotten some details wrong.Marion Tinsley was world checkers champion from 1955-1958, then took a break, then again from 1975-1991, when he resigned in protest (at age 64).  He was utterly dominant; indeed it is hard to think of a competitor in all of history more dominant over his sport or game than Tinsley.In 1990 Tinsley decided to play Chinook, the best checkers computer program in the world.  Chinook had placed second at the US Nationals so it had the right to enter the world championships, but the US and British checkers federations refused to allow it.So Tinsley resigned his title.  Tinsley then played Chinook in an unofficial match (which he won).This power play really stuck it to the federations: nobody wanted to be named the new world champion knowing Tinsley was fully capable of crushing them.  Eventually everyone came to an agreement to let Tinsley be the &#34;champion emeritus&#34;.Tinsley played Chinook four years later, at age 68, still probably the best player in the world.  But in the middle of the match he complained of stomach pains and withdrew after only six games (of 20), all drawn.  Tinsley&#39;s pains were real: he later died of pancreatic cancer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Time to change the format. It&#39;s understandable you don&#39;t want to spend your whole career preparing for these long matches all the time. For the challenger it&#39;s 6 months of preparing, but for Carlsen it would&#39;ve been his 6th time of preparing for this in a few years.They have also become less entertaining. 12 matches is long (edit, 14 now), but no one dares to take any risks. Caruana was just defensive and all games ended in a draw. Karjakin they both at least won each their game, but still had to go to rapid tie-breaks. And against Nepo it was a steamroll, understandably meeting him again isn&#39;t that exciting.It&#39;s also almost impossible for a new person to get a chance. Even Carlsen didn&#39;t like the format and didn&#39;t participate in the Candidates for a few years, and when he first did he almost didn&#39;t win it to be allowed to play the WC match. Even though he clearly was the best player at the time.I wonder how this will affect the status of the title, when it&#39;s in practice is now a title-fight between the second best players.Also what will happen to the hype in Norway? Each WC match has so far been live streamed on all big news pages, biggest TV channels etc. It will still be a Christmas tradition to watch the rapid WC tournament I guess, but I&#39;m afraid this will lead to less coverage. But just to tell how big Carlsen is in Norway: This is the top news on all outlets at the moment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Obviously this raised the issue of Bobby Fischer. The article mentions this but doesn&#39;t really go into the details.Fischer beat Spassky in Rejkyavik in 1972 for the World Championship. This took almost 3 months (July to September) and there was controversy, disagreement and negotiation about where and how it would take place. This had the backdrop of being a Cold War proxy too of course.Interestingly, Fischer didn&#39;t play competitive Chess after this. He was set to defend the title against the eventual challenger, Anatoly Karpov, in 1975. Fischer too didn&#39;t like the tendency for draws and proposed a format of first to 10 wins (with Fischer retaining the title in case of a 9-9). This was rejected and Fischer ultimately abdicated and never played competitive Chess again. He also became a semi-nomadic recluse too.But it also wasn&#39;t Fischer&#39;s first hiatus from the game. There was the 1972-1975 gap but also anotehr in the 1960s. He clearly seemed like a troubled guy.I&#39;ve always found it fascinating the level of commitment required to play Chess at this level. I certainly have never had any interest in that (nor the ability, to be clear). No one really seems to know how to solve this without going to a more blitz like format.Chess at the highest level seems to revolve around memorizing a whole book of openings and defenses while being able to take advantage of mistakes but also finding novel approaches in standard openings and defenses but now it seems you have to go fairly deep into a game before you go off-book."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The font is used by the teamviewer website. When inviting a partner to a teamviewer session, one can do so by sharing the invitation url.The invitation url looks like this (where XXXXXXXX is the session code).  https://get.teamviewer.com/v15/en/sXXXXXXXX

The website will check if a teamviewer font is installed (using javascript). If the font is found, the web site assumes that teamviewer is installed. The teamviewer installer also registers a protocol handler in the operating system.
The website (javascript code) will thus try to launch teamviewer directly using a url like the following:  teamviewer8://instantsupport/?sid=XXXXXXXX

Otherwise, if the font is not found, it will prompt the user to download and install the teamviewer application.Source:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"30 days before your subscription expires, teamviewer send you a friendly email to remind you to that your subscription expires in 30 days and to be sure to renew before then in order to not lose service.What that email does not tell you is that unless you cancel your subscription at least 30 days (ie on that very day) before your sub expires they will renew you automatically and demand a full year&#39;s subscription under threat of legal proceedings.Personally I believe that the purpose of this email is to lull you into a false sense of security that you can just let your subscription lapse instead of renewing when that is far from the case."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My proposal:1. Browsers should ship with a set of fonts used just in the web browser that web designers can count on. Right now, there isn&#39;t a font I can count on finding in Chrome on all platforms. This especially matters for non-English languages, where a different system font can lead to a website that looks very different.2. Browsers should not load fonts installed in the operating system. It&#39;s a fingerprinting vulnerability. And it also causes issues where the system-installed font is unexpectedly different from platform to platform. For example, Arial is different across platforms, especially once you consider non-English languages."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My car (Lexus) and my iPhone X:The car detects iPhone presence, like, 50% of the time. If it does detect it, it shows me a couple of half-naked shaved guys hugging each other and begins playing &#34;Songs of Innocence&#34; the moment I turn the ignition on. I tried deleting this song from the iPhone, but it auto-magically restores itself somehow, as if it is in the telephone&#39;s firmware. The image of men hugging in shade is baked into my mind forever at this point.As I want to set my plans in silence, I press stop on the dashboard. I set my Google Maps navigation, turn the knob to increase the volume so I could hear instructions, and this triggers &#34;Songs of Innocence&#34; to continue playing and the second burst of outrage in my cardiovascular system. I press the stop the second time, and at this point can continue on my journey - but should I try to increase the volume again, I have to remember the hugging men are always there.Once (or twice), the phone just went berserk and couldn&#39;t stop playing them. I tried everything, but the Songs were playing, and the men were hugging while I was doing 70 mph on the motorway. I had to reboot the phone, but after the reboot, the car was unable to pair with it.I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a Lexus problem, or an Apple problem, but what I know is that I really fucking hate U2."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried to learn why BT is still somehow painful to use, and the article basically does not have an answer.My take from comments here and my experience:- Makers of BT devices can&#39;t agree on many important common things (easy discovery / pairing mode, priority, etc), and have little incentive to seek agreement. It&#39;s like phone chargers before USB.- Makers of BT devices tend to cut corners and/or add not-entirely-standard features. They &#34;save&#34; on writing a good driver. They care little if devices made by their competition don&#39;t work reliably or at all in the mix. (And even sometimes their own!)- RF noise makes radio interfaces like BT inherently not always reliable. But the user never notices when a small EM storm rages nearby, for the user it&#39;s just &#34;damn bluetooth glitches for no reason at all&#34;."</p>

					<h3><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj.o1808">“No convincing evidence” that depression is caused by low serotonin levels</a></h3>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yeah, but thats hardly news, we have known that for decades. Otherwise direct serotonin releasers would be the most useful ADs. But these mostly give people nausea and serotonin syndrome. ADs work mostly by being FIASMAs, reducing inflammation and oxidative stress, increasing neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, increasing the activity of other monoaminergic systems, and the serotonergic portion is mostly explained by downregulation of 5-HT1A autoreceptors due to chronicly high extrasynaptic 5-HT levels. This also explains the delayed action of ADs.At least this is my knowledge from when I last researched this topic in depth.But that would be a little bit too much for the general public, so it is simplified, to this annoying effect that everyone talks of &#34;low serotonin levels&#34; where in fact the underlying systems are way more complex."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Other clinicians say, however, that the notion of depression being because of a simple chemical imbalance is outmoded anyway, and that antidepressants remain a useful option for patients alongside other approaches including talking therapies.This is the key line in the summary.The concept of attacking an idea no one really believes is really a straw man.More importantly the modern practice of medicine is &#34;evidence based medicine&#34;, not &#34;mechanism based medicine&#34;.
That means treatments are tested as to if they work, not how they work.
Ideally in multiple well run double blinded randomised controlled trials with at least some against treatment as usual.
Unlike the past when we thought more about how they might work, theorising something is off about someone&#39;s humors and adjusting with leeches.Anyone looking for a truly mind bending result should look at Hjorth et al. 2021 [0], the study recruited people with social phobia and gave them all an SSRI (escitalopram). Half were told they were getting a sham active placebo and &#34;should not expect to get better&#34;, half were told &#34;you&#39;re getting the known effective treatment&#34;.Headline result being told you are being treated leads to 4x as much response with brain changes in the dopamin networks.In the meanwhile, rather than worry about how antidepressants work, why not take a look at electroconvulsive therapy which has proven time and again to be the most effective treatment for depression. Yet we have no idea how it works, other than knowing a decent seizure in those without epilepsy makes you less sad? What on earth.[0] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-021-01682-3"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a theory which I can’t substantiate, just anecdotes and conversations I had throughout the years. But, I’m convinced a lot of depression/anxiety stems from thinking too much and that in turn is caused by an ever complex word with looser and looser guidelines or norms.I’m not making judgements weather this is necessarily good or bad but rather observing.In the past, even as recent as the 50s but certainly before the 20th century, a persons course in life was mostly determined at birth.You’re born, you play, you grow up, work the fields or a job, get married, have kids of your own and die. Society was more rigid and pretty much funnelled you through a “tried and tested path”, for good or for worse. And the lack of information made things “simpler” in a way in the sense you had a small number of people to get input from. Take child rearing for example. Many modern people worry so much and research ways to “optimise” their children for example ( I’m thinking of a lot of questions I saw on the parenting stack overflow ) whereas in the last, you’d just ask your own parents. And, since they were older, the assumption was they knew what they where talking about, even if it was not necessarily true. Same with health, same with sexuality, relationships, a lot of things.Essentially lack of information and a rigid social structure meant fewer choices which meant less thinking. And less thinking meant less depression and anxiety.Now when you have a world of information at your hands, you have way more things to think about, to worry about and to look for information on how to fix or improve.I’m not sure medication, even “working” one is a sustainable solution to what appears to me to be an environmental problem rather than a biological one."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of folks here arguing that the focus on TikTok is unfair, given the data collection practices of domestic corps like Facebook.  From a privacy point of view, this argument is well-founded, but I think it&#39;s tangential to the argument TFA is making, which is: this data collection done by a foreign government and exploited for surveillance or espionage is a national security risk.I get it.  We want corps to stop hoovering up our data because they can use it to manipulate us with advertising, and they can mishandle it such that other bad actors can exploit it.  I&#39;m with you, this is a valid concern that we should address.  But I think TikTok&#39;s specific case warrants additional concern because it&#39;s all that, plus it puts a geopolitical adversary in control of the data, countless devices, and a media channel central to the current cultural zeitgeist.I don&#39;t think it&#39;s reasonable to wait for general regulation of social media corps while TikTok continues to do its thing, particularly if targeted action against TikTok is politically viable.Edit: typo"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems an intractable mess.- Our phone hardware and operating systems are intrinsically insecure.- There is no practical/effective data gathering regulation (and I&#39;m not sure
   it&#39;s possible to craft any without destroying innovation)- All social media companies are doing it, leading to jeers of &#34;hypocrisy!&#34;- All governments play the same games, reducing the arguments to
   &#34;Whose side are you on?&#34; That&#39;s effectively meaningless in a
   globalised world. The consequence is more nationalism and an ever
   more fragmented splinternet.- The only proposed solutions amount to more authoritarian,
   controlling and regulatory responses.What can we do?There is a solution. Stop protecting these companies. Burn down
WIPO. Tear up practically all &#34;intellectual property&#34; laws. Revoke
millions of patents. Repeal all DCMA type laws regarding reverse
engineering. Kick trademark and brand protection law to the curb.The real problem is gargantuan monolithic, captive audiences that
exist because incumbent monopolies enjoy protectionist measures that
amount to a giant international trade racket.Creating a real market that forces radical interoperability would
solve many of the problems we see today. Who would care about TiKToK
or Facebook if they were one of 500,000 small &#34;Social Apps&#34; that
connected to a standardised international network.Hell, we could even give it a catchy name, like &#34;The Internet&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been a software dev since the 90s and at this point, I&#39;ve learned to basically do things like audit trails and soft deletion by default, unless there&#39;s some reason not to.Somebody always wants to undelete something, or examine it to see why it was deleted, or see who changed something, or blah blah blah. It helps the business, it helps you as developer by giving you debug information as well as helping you to cover your ass when you are blamed for some data loss bug that was really user error.Soft deletion has obvious drawbacks but is usually far less work than implementing equivalent functionality out-of-stream, with verbose logging or some such.Retrofitting your app and adding soft deletion and audit trails after the fact is usually an order of magnitude more work. Can always add it pre-launch and leave it turned off.If performance is a concern, this is usually something that can be mitigated. You can e.g. have a reaper job that runs daily and hard-deletes everything that was soft-deleted more than n days ago, or whatever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Views are a simple solution to this problem.  Pretty much all moderns RDBMSs support updatable views, so creating views over your tables with a simple WHERE deleted_at IS NULL solves the majority of the author&#39;s problems, including (IIRC) foreign key issues, assuming the deletes are done appropriately.I feel like a lot of developers underutilize the capabilities of the massively advanced database engines they code against. Sure, concerns about splitting logic between the DB and app layers are valid, but there are fairly well developed techniques for keeping DB and app states, logic and schemas aligned via migrations and partitioning and whatnot."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The concept behind soft deletion is to make deletion safer, and reversible.&#34;That&#39;s one part. The other part is that in many industries you have regulatory data retention and audit requirements. This is arguably the most valuable and common reason to perform Logical deletes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I will just add to the chorus here:* I graduated as a Computer Engineer.* Worked as EE/EEE entire career (currently almost 14 years).* Half of my class of EEs and CEs went into other careers immediately after graduation because money was better.* 10 years later my best conservative estimate (based on sampling from friends from my year) is that at least another quarter has left because money.* I have mainly worked in companies that make embedded devices, which is a market that is supposed to be exploding. So I should be getting paid better right? Have always been paid worse than my SE peers even though there&#39;s x5 - x10 as many of them.* Know lots of SEs who moved from EE because money was better (chief complaint from them is that SE is easier but they don&#39;t care because job less stressful and again more money).* Have never met an SE moving into EE.* I am now at a junction point in my career where I will either: Leave EE completely and work in something else (probably SE or IT), start my own EE business, consult in compliance of EE products (had one gig for a while and it paid well). Why? because money.And I don&#39;t want fast cars or huge houses or any of that absurdity (although A house would be nice). Just living comfortably would be nice. Having the salaries of my SE and CS friends would be amazing.To those commenters who say that you need to be bright to be an EE, it is very flattering, but I am obviously not very bright :D(edit: formatting because, again, not very bright :) )"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I moved into IT from &#34;formal&#34; engineering and its always frustrated me that a job that involves working on extremely expensive engines using upper level college math gets paid almost nothing compared to people who change colors on a webpage every once in a while. I&#39;ve been on floors where multi-million dollar pieces of equipment are used to produce parts with obscene levels of precision being used by expert machinists making 80k a year who risk their own personal safety making these parts.I have EE friends with master degrees who design PCBs that are printed millions of times that struggle to afford rent.It makes no sense. Why is web software so easy to make money in? Why do we value hard engineering so little?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My friend is an EE that I went to school with. He&#39;s very bright and definitely sharper and harder working than me.
I went to school for Chemistry and switched to DevOps - which are the not the highest paid of SEs.
I make 1.5x what he does. I help run a package tracking dashboard. He ensures power systems for millions of people work flawlessly in all conditions. He&#39;s looking to quit the industry because its so hopeless."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32151609">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you are like me and wondering &#34;What makes carbon different from Rust or Zig?    1. The ability to interoperate with a wide variety of code, such as classes/structs and templates, not just free functions.

    2. A willingness to expose the idioms of C++ into Carbon code, and the other way around, when necessary to maximize performance of the interoperability layer.

    3. The use of wrappers and generic programming, including templates, to minimize or eliminate runtime overhead.

In otherwords, what carbon can do that Rust can&#39;t do, is take a C++ class with a `foo` method and call that method.  Or create a class with a `foo` method and call that method from C++.  Probably one of the biggest hurdles to get over in C++ interopt.  Most don&#39;t do that, instead you&#39;d make a C function binding and struct and move data/invoke functions through that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not immediately obvious from this page and GitHub org, but this is a Google led project. It&#39;s led by Chandler and the c++ toolchain team. I have no idea of it&#39;s endgoals or how open to non-Google ideas it will be."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the end of the safety document:&gt; Overall, Carbon is making a compromise around safety in order to give a path for C++ to evolve. C++ developers must be comfortable migrating their codebases, and able to do so in a largely automated manner. In order to achieve automated migration, Carbon cannot require fundamental redesigns of migrated C++ code. While a migration tool could in theory mark all migrated code as unsafe, Carbon should use a safety strategy that degrades gracefully and offers improvements for C++ code, whether migrated or not.&gt; That does not mean Carbon will never adopt guaranteed safety by default, only that performance and migration of C++ code takes priority, and any design will need to be considered in the context of other goals. It should still be possible to adopt guaranteed safety later, although it will require identifying a migration path.That&#39;s very interesting and pragmatic. It would be interesting if they can eventually come up with the same level of safety guarantees via a different path than Rust&#39;s borrow checker.-------------Since one of their goals is to automatically translate modern C++ to Carbon, I do wonder how well that is going to work in general.I definitely welcome an alternative to C++ that would be easier to read and understand. That would be a benefit to the world."</p>

If the state of the resource changes such that the allowable actions available on that resource change (for example, if the account goes into overdraft) then the HTML response would change to show the new set of actions available.If the client knows nothing about the meaning of the responses, it cannot do  anything with them but show  them to a human for interpretation. This would suggest a restful api is not made for system-to-system communication, but requires human mediation at every step of the way, which is precisely not how api’s are used. In short, this definition of restful api’s can’t be right, because it suggests restful interfaces aren’t api’s at all.

Hypermedia is just an expansion on what text means to include temporal anchors within a media stream; most researchers have dropped the distinction.&gt; Hypertext does not need to be HTML on a browser. Machines can follow links when they understand the data format and relationship types.So, to me, a proper format is something like...id: 1234url: http://.../1234name: foodepartment: http://.../department/5555projects: http://.../projects/?user_id=1234This is hypertext in the sense that I can jump around (even in a browser that renders the urls clickable) to other resources related to this resource."</p>
