								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just researched good/quality crafting printers yesterday. Search results were mostly blogs and crappy websites that offered obviously no insights but were just SEO optimized to direct you to their Amazon affiliate links. Especially sad since those affiliate links to Amazon mostly resulted in &#34;This product is currently not available&#34; sites.Repeated my search on Youtube to find reviews or unboxing. Most video search results were basically &#34;Youtube SEO&#34; again - the most viewed/top-ranked videos did never show a single actual print run or even the printer available. It was mostly marketing websites turned into video (slowly scrolling/moving over product description or pictures clearly taken from the web). And of course, affiliate links in the description.The web has become a crappy place to research products as long as money can be made with those through affiliations. I wonder if outlawing affiliate marketing would make the world a better place.P.S: Whats most ridiculous about my Youtube Printer research experience, the best and most helpful video was a sales video from a home shopping TV station [0], where they actually showed some printing action and handling of one of the models I was interested in.[0]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytMXgjCReO0"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not just Google---the World Wide Web itself is rapidly becoming a defunct protocol, the culmination of a decades-long shift in the Internet&#39;s center of mass away from browsers and towards centralized and commercialized apps---from personal web pages to LinkedIn/GitHub/Twitter handles, from the ubiquitous WordPress blogs to YouTube videos and Medium posts, and from forums to Tweets and subreddits.The useful information on the Web is now concentrated in a few places---Reddit, Quora, Stack Exchange, Wikipedia, etc. When I want reasonable search results, I search there instead of the Web as a whole. (And even many of these services are in the late stages of the Silicon Valley life cycle---desperate monetization and engagement-increasing gimmicks---with uncertain futures.)Wikipedia, bless its heart, lurches on as a cathedral to early Web&#39;s dream of information democratization. It stands as a wonder of the ancient world: incomplete, built from technology few now understand, and reflecting values and priorities that no longer quite align with contemporary culture. But it persists thanks to its inertia and the undeniable sense of awe it invokes even today."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google was still useful for things that are non-marketable. But in the last year or so, I have started to realize how awfully bad has gotten even at that.Case in point: Open source mailing list archives. For various reasons, some times I have to search for entire email threads that are available in the web interfaces of some mailing list archives. I have part of a phrase of some email, I put that into google with quotes, and it returns some results, usually with the main archive being in the first results. In the last year or so, Google has started returning no results for some phrases of emails that do exist and are available in one or more public archives.When that started to happen, I tried Bing. And Bing returns results with links to archive. So does duckduckgo most times. But for Google, it&#39;s like if that particular email I&#39;m searching at that moment didn&#39;t exist (for other emails in the same mailing list it works fine). It only happens occasionally, but it&#39;s getting worse. So I have started to rely on DDG and Bing more and more, because they always find what I want.So Google is starting to fail at some of the most basic aspects of a search engine, it&#39;s not just the ordering of the search results - there are some public web pages that it won&#39;t see for whatever reason."</p>

For example:  const sym = Module.getExportByName(&#34;lime.ndll&#34;, &#34;SDL_SemWait&#34;);
  Interceptor.replace(sym, {

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting tidbit about Papers, Please: it&#39;s written with Haxe (a programming language), on top of OpenFL (an open-source Flash alternative), which uses Lime as its foundational cross-platform library. The nice stack traces you see in the article, such as:openfl::display::Application_obj::__constructare because Haxe actually compiles down to C++! (That&#39;s also why it has nice interop with C/C++ libraries like SDL.) Haxe boasts an insane amount of compile targets -- just taking a glance at its Github page, it can compile to Javascript, C#, C++, Java, Lua, PHP, Python, and Flash, plus a couple different Haxe-specific interpreters.Not many game developers use Haxe, so it has a small, tight-knit community. Other well-known games written with Haxe include Dead Cells, Northgard, and Dicey Dungeons."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Some scientists say these worries about attention are a moral panic, comparable to the anxieties in the past about comic books or rap music, and that the evidence is shaky.I agree with them.It&#39;s hard to pay attention to something for long unless it&#39;s entertaining. Reading a book, reading a paper, etc -- these activities take discipline that most people don&#39;t develop or don&#39;t often apply. This isn&#39;t new. The mistake is thinking that the ability to concentrate on something non-entertaining is the baseline. One reason so many people think they have ADHD is because they make that mistake.We had the same anxieties about radio and TV. Those anxieties were right and wrong. Technologies do change how people behave but it&#39;s always the same story. There will be entertainment freely available and you&#39;ll have to choose to concentrate on things that aren&#39;t entertaining that you consider worthwhile."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is a veritable war going on for your attention, and the battlefields are your eyeballs, your ears and ultimately your brain. Psychologists have been enlisted, as they are in every war to try to win it for &#39;their side&#39;, be it one of the big silos or some dying TV or newspaper era behemoth, there is no reasonable way in which you can withstand that kind of frontal onslaught. The only way to really deal with this is to not participate.Beware or you too will be collateral damage on the balance sheets of these media conglomerates. Unmediated reality is still there for you to peruse, but &#39;augmented reality&#39; will be the next big wave for tech and I&#39;m pretty sure that it will end up being used mostly for advertising purposes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This for me is key, these sorts of problems cannot just be solved on an individual level. They are systemic.&#34;Individual abstinence is “not the solution, for the same reason that wearing a gas mask for two days a week outside isn’t the answer to pollution. It might, for a short period of time, keep certain effects at bay, but it’s not sustainable, and it doesn’t address the systemic issues.” He said that our attention is being deeply altered by huge invasive forces in wider society. Saying the solution was to just adjust your own habits – to pledge to break up with your phone, say – was just “pushing it back on to the individual” he said, when “it’s really the environmental changes that will really make the difference”.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many people kept insisting &#34;Not many young people are dying from Covid-19&#34; a statement that over looked the fact that, under normal circumstances, not many young people die at all. But there was an article in the New York Times that offered these facts about people aged 20 to 40.July, 2019: 11,000 deadJuly, 2020: 16,000 deadBoth numbers are small in a country where 3 million people die each year, about 250,000 a month. But it&#39;s still a 45% increase, so that age group was the worst affected, in terms of the increase in death. The increase in the death rate of old people was not as dramatic, as older people make up the vast majority of all deaths, every year."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;The CDC weekly death counts, which reflect the information on death certificates and so have a lag of up to eight weeks or longer, show that for the week ending Nov. 6, there were far fewer deaths from COVID-19 in Indiana compared to a year ago – 195 verses 336 – but more deaths from other causes – 1,350 versus 1,319.&#34;So last year more covid deaths (particularly among the elderly), but while those numbers have declined, the numbers from younger &#34;working age&#34; people have increased more than enough to make up for it.&gt; &#34;Just 8.9% of ICU beds are available at hospitals in the state, a low for the year, and lower than at any time during the pandemic. But the majority of ICU beds are not taken up by COVID-19 patients – just 37% are, while 54% of the ICU beds are being occupied by people with other illnesses or conditions.&#34;Well a lot of people were avoiding medical care (precisely because of Covid concerns), so this makes some sense.  Couple that with the increased death rate for younger people and something has happened to worsen the health and outcomes generally for that population.  Cue wild speculation and theories."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Zotero is, if you&#39;re not in the market for a closed source silo like EndNote, the only game left in town. Mendeley went full on Evil, and Papers for Mac is Mac only, closed source, and missing dozens of functionalities that are absolutely a must have in academic writing and research.An absolute must have is BetterBibTex (https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/), which adds better Citekey management and, my personal highlight, &#34;export on add&#34; functionality. In short, everything I save into a specific folder in my library gets exported as a .bib file right away. That way I can click a button in my browser and have the citation ready in my LaTeX editor, Word, or Obsidian (https://github.com/hans/obsidian-citation-plugin) within seconds.The latest beta also adds full Markdown export for Notes. I tend to keep my notes on papers in Zotero, attached to the paper, but export them for filing in Obsidian (which I then feed into MkDocs for our work group&#39;s large repo).Unless you need Apple Pages support, which Apple keeps to itself and only sells for mighty moolah to a select few, Zotero can do anything EndNote can do, is Open Source, and with that won&#39;t drive your PI up the wall with yet another expense."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I highly recommend going for the beta version which features a (game-changing) built-in pdf reader[1], with annotations (searchable and synced with the beta iPad app) and many more improvements.Zotero is an amazing tool and I could not imagine writing papers without it. For collaborative writing, it syncs the bibliography with overleaf[2] and google docs. The browser add-on allows to build your library with one click while browsing, and it parses wonderfully meta-data from all (most) publishers and pre-print servers. Then my unique bibfile (symlinked in every project) is continuously updated to reflect new items or manual changes.But I use it even for non-publishing side of research: one can save webpages (with snapshots) and write notes with formatting around them. My personal research workflow involves note-taking with the markdown app Zettlr[2], from which I can cite my Zotero library using simply `@[Author:Title:Year]`. I can then build notes from a twitter thread and stats.stackexchange.com answers, then connect it with papers and blog posts that way, and a specific chapter of a book with my annotation on the cloud. It not always straightforward as a workflow but it works wonders.And the team is very responsive on the forum and on twitter. If one of the dev is ready this, thank you so much for making researchers life way easier !EDIT: I just realised I can share my libraries online. A bit ashamed because it is very messy, but in case you are wondering what a Zotero library looks like, here is the link to mine [4] (without the notes and the embedded pdf and data files because I cannot share all of them. Moreover, I don&#39;t use the folder structure anymore so its very messy).[1] https://www.zotero.org/support/pdf_reader_preview[2] I recommend the BetterBibTex extension for anything related to tex, it&#39;ll save you a lot of time[3] https://zettlr.com, another great app.[4] https://www.zotero.org/wosk/library"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a grad student, Zotero is a lifesaver! Thanks to the people developing it!I use Google Drive for my pdf storage using some Zotfile acrobatics (awesome plugin btw) to manage my actual pdfs. I plan on switching to Zotero&#39;s cloud storage to support development as soon as I can.That being said, I wish I had a nice workflow for reading papers on my iPad like I do on PC (Windows specifically, I know there are software for the Mac/iOS ecosystem but I don&#39;t have a Macbook so...): Open Zotero -&gt; double-click on the paper -&gt; Bam, the pdf opens in Acrobat where I can highlight and annotate, and save to pdf directly for future use.The closest I got to this on iPad was to use the Zotfile plugin and use the Send to Tablet feature as described here [0], and opening and annotating the pdf on iPad.Another interesting workflow seems to be using Obsidian to store the relationships between papers using annotations and highlights from them [1]. Another way to do this would be LiquidText but I paid 20+ USD separately for both the iPad and Windows Store versions, and it asks me to pay up again so I don&#39;t know what&#39;s up with them...Still, I hope Zotero keeps being developed as it&#39;s the best, and perhaps the only open source research management software out there.[0]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7novaC_O_Y[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Fjhad-Z61oEDIT: Added clarification of OS I am using."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The main issue with &#34;Web3&#34; is that it moves records of transactions from many private places to one public place. Sure this one place may not be controlled by a single entity, but it facilitates tracking at an unprecedented level.Cryptocurrencies are the ultimate example of this and are an absolute boon to tax collectors, forensic accountants and fraudsters. In our current economy financial transactions are recorded in millions of individual ledgers that are kept private, or in the case of cash transactions are often not recorded at all, or are not linked to an individual. There is no central ledger.With crypto currencies however you can not only see all transactions but also trace them back to individual users as long as you can link a wallet to a person. This is a massive increase in centralisation yet discussion of whether this is a good idea seems to be entirely missing. The notion that centralising transactions in one place is somehow an example of decentralisation just seems mad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with web3 is not that it&#39;s centralized -- that&#39;s irrelevant.The fundamental problem with all crypto&#34;currencies&#34; is as follows: the world uses real currencies and there is only one way this enters into the world of crypto&#34;currencies&#34;: by someone selling a coin to someone else. Thus, regardless of what crypto&#34;currency&#34; we are talking about, it would be a zero sum game if not for transaction fees. However, with transaction fees it becomes a scam because there&#39;s a set of players who are guaranteed to win and there&#39;s another set of players who, en masse, are guaranteed to lose. It utterly doesn&#39;t matter what you do with your crypto&#34;currency&#34;, this is the underpinning scam of it.And once you entered the game, the only way for you to not lose money is to find a greater fool who will take over your crypto&#34;currency&#34;, everyone who owns some becomes a proponent of it. It&#39;s an ingenious scam.And no, nothing in the real world is like this. In the real world, the amount of currency increases when a bank extends a loan which then creates more value by such things as being using as capital, allowing you to enjoy a home now instead of decades later and so forth. Also, stocks are not a zero sum game -- companies actually create value and so forth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the author makes the mistake of assuming that web3 is a meaningful, tangible term being used in good faith.In reality, web3 is a marketing buzzword that cryptocurrency boosters have started promoting in an attempt to legitimize their resource intensive and otherwise useless financial speculation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe AirDrop is a a great example of how Apples vertical integration and full ownership of software and hardware really thrives. It may not offer interoperability with other platforms, but that’s because other platforms don’t have the control needed to implement the same level of integration of hardware and software needed.Without the direct low level control of the radio hardware they would not have been able to integrate both Bluetooth and WiFi in the way that AirDrop does.I hope one day standards for this type of functionality appear so that other platforms can implement it. Ideally apple would contribute their tech to create the standard but that’s probably wishful thinking."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"No book influenced my attitude toward philosophy more than Wittgenstein&#39;s Blue Book. Here are a couple gems:&gt; The questions, &#34;What is length?&#34;, &#34;What is meaning?&#34;, &#34;What is the number one?&#34; etc., produce in us a mental cramp. We feel that we can&#39;t point to anything in reply to them and yet ought to point to something. (We are up against one of the great sources of philosophical bewilderment: we try to find a substance for a substantive.)&gt; The idea that in order to get clear about the meaning of a general term one had to find the common element in all its applications, has shackled philosophical investigation; for it has not only led to no result, but also made the philosopher dismiss as irrelevant the concrete cases, which alone could have helped him to understand the usage of the general term. When Socrates asks the question, “what is knowledge?” he does not even regard it as a preliminary answer to enumerate cases of knowledge. If I wished to find out what sort of thing arithmetic is, I should be very content indeed to have investigated the case of a finite cardinal arithmetic. For:
(a) this would lead me on to all the more complicated cases,
(b) a finite cardinal arithmetic is not incomplete, it has no gaps which are then filled in by the rest of arithmetic.&gt; Now I don&#39;t say that this is not possible. Only, putting it in this way immediately shows you that it need not happen. This, by the way, illustrates the method of philosophy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not quite all public domain. (in English) [0] (maybe? gray area)I&#39;d highly recommend checking out his work on (and coining of the term) &#34;language games&#34; [1] I&#39;m not sure I agree with all of the thinking behind them, but it&#39;s a fascinating concept that has useful nuggets whether or not you agree with everything Wittgenstein says about them. They are explored pretty fully in his work &#34;Philosophical Investigations&#34; [2] This work pretty much set aside a fair amount of his thinking in Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, which is still an interesting work in its own right. I think that even a cursory ELI5 treatment of this material in a standard college course would be very useful in arming students with tools needed to dissect language. I&#39;ve used it (in brief) when teaching a course on Informal Logic in relation to propaganda.[0] It seems copyright on the English translation might still be in effect, or at least a gray area of determination. Since it&#39;s a common text use in college courses I&#39;m guessing the copyright owners may fight public domain release. The issue will be whether or not the translation was a work for hire or if it can be considered sufficiently different to constitute an original work. The English translation by Anscombe, Hacker, and Schulte occured posthumously, and so might not be considered work for hire. Hopefully it will resolve in favor of public domain. For a shorter consideration of &#34;language games&#34; check out Blue Book.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_game_(philosophy)[2] https://www.amazon.com/Philosophical-Investigations-Ludwig-W..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Do we know what Wittgenstein himself would have thought of this? Did he have opinions on &#34;intellectual property&#34; regimes?Did the &#34;intellectual property&#34; regime contemporaneous with him writing encourage or discourage his output?I mean, there&#39;s some thought that Giuseppe Verdi reduced his output when copyright was introduced: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1336802"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Many eons ago...Around 10 to 15 years ago...Seen a similar serialization and date processing bug with a Java based Enterprise Integration Platform used by some of the largest companies in the world.Several European Central Banks were unable to process transactions ;-). Can&#39;t provide more details, to protect the innocent. Since then, it has been a standard within the Testing group of that vendor to always have a running platform setup with a date 6 months ahead ( clock sync from a different source ). Something I added to my own Software Engineering and Testing standard practices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We shouldn&#39;t blame Microsoft for this; I once worked in the veterinary industry, and one Practice Management System allowed you to register a pet including their real or approximate birth date, or by entering an approximate age.If you entered a birth date, the software would calculate the pet&#39;s age, and we noticed we had the odd quirk, like a 400 year-old cat etc. I couldn&#39;t see an obvious pattern to the anomaly, and it didn&#39;t occur often, so I created a support ticket.After a couple of days, I received a response that &#39;dates were hard&#39; and we should correct the ages manually as needed.So there you have it: Dates are hard.(No, the bug wasn&#39;t ever fixed.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The memo from Emirates about not setting altitude in system to airport altitude is so weird. I really hope that&#39;s not the actual message Emirates is putting out there.It doesn&#39;t matter was in system. You run your checklists and configure for your own flight / your own departure etc. Memo should be to training / recruitment - where did you find these pilots to fly a 777?So they obviously didn&#39;t pre-flight the flight. And they don&#39;t seem to have used their takeoff checklist either? That should get them through flap retract and 2,000 feet or so.Takeoff checklist might have rotate at 160 or so. Then you get to positive climb and V2. You then clean up the plane (flaps / gear etc), maybe hit 2,000 feet / 210kts?This is all checklist stuff. I&#39;ve no idea what&#39;s Emirates has as checklists, but this is like 101 entry level flying stuff. What was pilot monitoring doing during all this?They still on ground at 215 kts? 262 kts at 175 feet?!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pilot (piston engine, with only around 20 hours of light jet dual). As a pax on this flight, I might not have noticed much unless I was looking out the window.This seems like a fault of the crew (obviously), but probably more on the PNF (pilot not flying) than the PF (pilot flying). Article says 4 pilots were on board, but fails to mention that 2 of them (relief pilots) were likely not in the cockpit on the departure.It’s hard for me to imagine that a qualified crew would fly such a non-standard departure with “we were following the flight director” as an excuse. There’s nothing above you to hit on departure; get away from terrain! Fly the calculated airspeeds. Where was the Vr callout?! That rotation to a pitch angle is what takes you off the runway, not the FD command bars.Once they made the mistake and corrected it, I don’t have much concern with the continuation. 262 knots indicated isn’t that big of a deal that I’d worry about shedding parts from departure flaps and leading edge devices or stressing the gear (they likely pulled the gear up well before breaking 250 KIAS anyway). I’d be more concerned with the safety of an overweight landing than continuing. (A 777 can dump fuel, but the crew that just moments ago couldn’t fly an entirely routine departure isn’t the crew that I want to be calling an audible and figuring out how to safely dump fuel at night and return for a max weight landing. How would they program the FD for that?! ;) )My prediction is that almost every pax had no idea how close to dying they came until they read about it later.I catch heat every time I mention that air crew training and certification standards are not uniform across the globe and that I am reluctant to fly on many foreign-flag carriers. (However, Emirates and most EU-flag carriers are ones that I would not hesitate to fly on.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The thing that stands out here the most is the complete lack of control that the crew had over the plane. The crew was managing the computers rather than flying the aircraft.&#34;Perhaps they are &#34;Children of the Magenta&#34;:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ESJH1NLMLs... and I cannot recommend this video enough.I am not a pilot and I have no interest in flying nor any particular interest in aviation, generally ... and I find this talk to be fascinating.EDIT:  you can jump to 3:35 where he gives a specific example of a situation where pilots need to choose between automation dependency and dropping down a level of automation.  He&#39;s a really good speaker and you can tell the audience is very engaged."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;How accurate are online polls?&#34;[M]ost online polls that use participants who volunteer to take part do not have a proven record of accuracy. There are at least two reasons for this. One is that not everyone in the U.S. uses the internet, and those who do not are demographically different from the rest of the public. Another reason is that people who volunteer for polls may be different from other people in ways that could make the poll unrepresentative. At worst, online polls can be seriously biased if people who hold a particular point of view are more motivated to participate than those with a different point of view.https://www.pewresearch.org/2010/12/29/how-accurate-are-onli...Rather than serve as accurate assessments of public opinion or beliefs, online polls at best surface sentiments and potential areas of interest.  Some are mere amusements.  Many serve a darker purpose of advocating for a specific cause or ideology (a &#34;push poll&#34; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_poll), fishing for either insights on how audiences might be manipulated through advertising or propaganda, or outright soliciting personal information that is of use in hacking into accounts by guessing passwords or so-called &#34;security questions&#34;."</p>

				<div class="story__comments">

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29761728">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"HTTP Basic Auth could be so much better with a little help from browsers. If it was a bit better, most websites wouldn&#39;t need to implement login pages over and over again. Plus it would be more secure since the popup is in its own security context.* Add a button to log out. Logout never really worked across browsers with basic auth.* Allow to inject a logo or a tiny bit of customization for branding. The default popup looks too ugly.* Improve the Digest auth to modern crypto standards. Stop passing plain passwords over the wire.That&#39;s it. It&#39;s not a massive amount of work and it could enable to simplify a lot of the Internet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Caddy comes with basic auth support because it&#39;s still useful for a lot of use cases.IMO the biggest weakness of basicauth (when deployed over TLS) is the fact that most server configurations store the passwords in plaintext, usually in a config file. This is like storing passwords in plaintext in a database. Caddy does not allow this. You have to use a secure hash on the password before adding it to your config: https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.authentication.pro...Of course, password hashes are slow, so KDF&#39;ing a plaintext string at every HTTP request can grind even powerful servers to a halt. So Caddy can optionally cache hash results in memory (we do expect memory to be safer than a config file -- and Go is a memory-safe language in this regard). And while this can introduce nuanced timing variances (fast if recently hashed), they do not necessarily correspond to correct passwords.If you think this stuff is interesting and want to help make Caddy&#39;s basic auth even better, feel free to contribute or sponsor: https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find HTTP basic auth very useful to &#34;protect&#34; gitlab, wiki, forum, et al. internal resources exposed to the internet. With a simple apache/nginx config it is possible effectively to hide those from the intenet and in addition to their built-in authentications (ldap-based) have a fense reliable enough to prevent zero-day vulnerabilities of these populular web applications. Having them as sub-folders of a single web-domain (with proper rewrites added to apache/nginx) prevents numerous HTTP basic auth requests so authentication is required just once after the browser has been restarted."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a few years out of grad school, working at a tech company, and single.  I came from an academic background where talking about interesting ideas and concepts was the norm.  I had a pretty uncommon career path into tech and I&#39;m not some coder.My experience is that when you&#39;re in my position, it&#39;s getting harder and harder (with age) to find people who are interested in talking about ideas, entertaining the curiosities in life without some agenda/getting offended by the controversial ones, talking about possibilities and concepts (rather than objects).  Like having conversations on advanced mode with people who are similar.Often times at parties, when I get bored, I think of a quote, &#34;Great minds discuss ideas. Average minds discuss events/things. Small minds discuss wine.&#34;It&#39;s getting more and more common that I find people just wanting to talk about wine.  Or the equivalent.  Stuff that&#39;s completely forgettable after you leave the party.  I mean that stuff is fine, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with talking about good food you&#39;ve had, some articles you&#39;ve read, movies seen, etc. too.   And to be funny and engaging while talking about it.  It just feels like... after you&#39;re done talking about that, what then?Or if I do meet people who are intellectually interesting, how to get more connected or where to take it after a chance meeting and pleasant chat?That said, what do I have to offer at this stage of my life either, to a stranger?  I&#39;m unmarried, so I don&#39;t have kids or the mortgage to talk about.  I&#39;m not a CEO or someone powerful.  Also I&#39;m single -- what are people supposed do with that?   Don&#39;t have a lot of great reasons for anyone to want to go out of their way to spend more time with me after even an interesting 30 min conversation, without some other excuse.We&#39;re not all living close together in shared housing to make intellectually stimulating conversations natural and prolonged.  People have their lives to lead, not sit around talking about theoretical ideas.  To contact the few people I&#39;ve found who are interesting would be... how?  &#34;Would you like to schedule a get-together again for a conversation date?&#34;It&#39;s not going to get easier either.   Probably in a few years I&#39;ll be the really odd guy.  Eh, it&#39;s a life choice I&#39;ve made, I realize that too -- to be more interested in ideas and experiences than say... people.I figure I&#39;d better find some interesting hobbies to make up for the lack of intellectual stimulation.   But deeper, what am I working towards?  For whom?  So, sometimes I think of changing jobs just to see more of the world and gather experiences to be able to have more intellectually stimulating conversations.  Learn about VC?  Hear about more companies?  Where/how?Yeah, it&#39;s a bit of a problem sometimes to ponder."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I took a ten year break from reading books. Instead I programmed, read blog posts, followed the news, and had a few good talks with friends here and there.When I started reading again my world caught on fire. A good book is vastly, unimaginably better than doom scrolling, and the wealth of ideas and history and inspiration that starts to accumulate as you read more is life changing. For example, I learned how to properly build habits, how my childhood in a cult came about and what other people who left have done to come to terms with it, and endless interesting facts about lifelong hobbies and interests. Reading is great."</p>

But some people I know have the skill of finding a subject of conversation with practically everyone they meet at a party. One of them has literally talked to British Royalty, yet seemed to have no difficulty holding a conversation with a man with limited education, some substance abuse issues, and assorted other difficulties in life.It seems to me that this is a valuable skill to aspire to. And if at first glance nobody at the party seems to have anything in common with you — maybe that&#39;s all the more of an opportunity to hear about views and experiences outside one&#39;s usual circles?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Key points:&#34;Thus Beijing prefers that the best talent in the country work in manufacturing sectors rather than consumer internet and finance. Personally, I think it has been a tragedy for the US that so many physics PhDs have gone to work in hedge funds and Silicon Valley.&#34;&#34;The US focus on efficiency has revealed the brittleness of its economy, which has neither the manufacturing capability to scale up domestic production of goods nor the logistics capacity to handle greater imports. Decades of American deindustrialization as well as an aversion against idle capacity has eroded domestic manufacturing.&#34;&#34;In the face of this challenge against a new peer competitor, the US has demonstrated a superb capacity for self-harm.&#34;&#34;For someone in the middle class, there has never been a better year to live in China. That comes down to the entrepreneurs, who are creating businesses to please people.&#34;All, absolutely true as I&#39;ve commented previously in other posts. The decline of America is primarily a story about misallocation of talent and the demise of the American middle class as a result."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Manhattan meets MauiI think that is a stretch beyond snapping point for Hong Kong. Most days in Hong Kong I could see the air pollution obscuring buildings in the distance. It&#39;s AQI is terrible https://aqicn.org/city/hongkong/ . There are nice mountain walks and nearby islands but it is extremely dense and urban. It&#39;s one of the places Ghost in the Shell used for reference!Also the narrative here feels mostly from the mainland China point of view; having to go and deal with &#34;problematic&#34; Hong Kong. But problems between Hong Kong and the mainland began when Beijing used its influence to restrict Hong Kong&#39;s traditional democracy, so only &#34;approved&#34; candidates could be voted into office. And since then it&#39;s increasingly clamped down on the freedoms Hong Kong previously enjoyed, most recently doing things such as removing the Tiananmen Square memorials (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-59764029). At this point the writing is on the wall and bit by bit Hong Kong will brought in step with the rest of mainland China.Unlike the author I found the Hong Kong bureaucracy fast and effective. Enforcers &#34;sometimes able to look the other way&#34; sounds like corruption to me and people with better guanxi being able to bend the rules. I&#39;d rather have the laws fair, clear and applied to all equally (though that&#39;s always going to be a gradient).Despite all that, it&#39;s undeniable China is on the rise and that&#39;s going to be the dominant story of this century. There&#39;s potential for that to be a great boon to the world and I hope that&#39;s the reality that comes to be."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m a mechanical engineer - smartbolts are cool but rarely used in my experience. Much more commonly used are DTI washers: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_tension_indicatorDue to the washer style can be used with a wide range of fasteners. The most common type, in my experience, due to the ease of use, has a little bit of colored goo inside the arched cells. The goo squirts out when the specified torque is reached.That being said, there are a lot of approaches to this same problem. Another common technique is breakaway bolts that are driven with a piece that snaps away when a certain torque is reached: https://youtu.be/lrCoi3gaLfU"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At Boeing, I learned that bolts should be lubricated before torquing them in order to ensure an accurate torque. I initially thought wouldn&#39;t the lubrication allow the bolt to unwind itself? Surprisingly, no.Since then, on my car, I always put a bit of grease on a bolt beforehand. It keeps the water out, preventing the bolt from rusting itself together. It makes for an accurate torque. I&#39;ve never had one unscrew itself, and I can always get the lug nuts off!Of course, you still need to use lock washers. For critical bolts, use a cotter pin or a safety wire."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Summary: the tests were conducted on guinea pigs because they can develop immune reactions to repeated tick bites like humans do. Mice do not seem to be suited for that for once.The vaccine was administered intradermally. It consists of nucleoside-modified mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles like we know them from Covid vaccines already. The contained mRNA sequences encode 19 different proteins that are usually found in the saliva of a particular kind of tick in the US. These proteins were selected because of prior research it was known that they seemed to cause inflammatory reactions in the host. The inflammatory reaction that occured at the site of the tick bite hampered feeding of the ticks and reduced risk of disease transmission. The vaccine mostly seems to buy more time to remove the ticks before an infection can take place because the disease causing bacteria was not directly targeted by the vaccine."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Postgres&#39;s dominance is well deserved, of course. My only concerns with it, both are actively worked on, are bloat management (significant for update heavy workloads and programmers used to the MySQL model of rollback segments) and the scaling of concurrency (going over 500 connections). Bloat was taken over by Cybertec[1] after stalling for a bit and is funded (yay), while concurrency was also enhanced out of Microsoft [2].

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"An aside:&gt; L3 cache is shared by all cores of a CPU.I recently learned this is no longer true! AMD EPYC processors (and maybe other recent AMDs?) divide cores into groups called &#34;core complexes&#34; (CCX), each of which has a separate L3 cache. My particular processor is 32-core where each set of 4 cores is a CCX. I discovered this when trying to figure out why a benchmark was performing wildly differently from one run to the next with a bimodal distribution -- it turned out to depend on whether Linux has scheduled the two processes in my benchmark to run on the same CCX vs. different CCXs.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epyc shows the &#34;core config&#34; of each model, which is (number of CCX) x (cores per CCX)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The culprit was a shared atomic reference counter (Arc). The cache invalidation across cores eliminated any kind of scaling via multiple threads.The solution is to stop sharing. The author had to make changes specific to this codebase for each thread to have its own copy of the offending dataset."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The notion of &#34;lock-free&#34; is fundamentally misleading.It trips up everybody who hopes &#34;lock-free&#34; will be a magic bullet freeing them from resource contention bottlenecks.When you have explicit locks, aka mutexes (condition variables, semaphores, what-have-you), the interaction between your threads is visible on the surface. Replacing that with &#34;lock-free&#34; interaction, you have essentially the same set of operations as when taking a mutex. On the up side, overhead cost may be lower. On the down side, mistakes show up as subtly wrong results instead of deadlocks. And, you get less control, so when you have a problem, it is at best harder to see why, and harder to fix.Because the lock-free operations involve similar hardware bus interactions under the covers, they cannot fix contention problems. You have no choice but to fix contention problems at a higher, architectural design level, by reducing actual contention. Having solved the problems there, the extra cost of explicit mutex operations often does not matter, and the extra control you get may be worth any extra cost.What is lock-free good for, then? Lock-free components reduce overhead when there is no contention. Given any actual contention, performance is abandoned in favor of correctness. So, if you have mutexes and performance is good, moving to lock-free operations might make performance a little better. If performance is bad, mutexes and lock-free operations will be about equally as bad."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an egregiously editorialized headline, but this was the easiest way to submit two separate links to LKML in one HN submission --- link to Fillipo&#39;s tweet about those links.The @zx2c4 Filippo is referring to is Jason Donenfeld, of WireGuard fame. It was news to me that he&#39;d taken over the Linux kernel random driver! But it&#39;s welcome news indeed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The popularity of the Blake family annoys me, as I feel that it&#39;s overhyped. Sure, they&#39;re fast (on current hardware), but they&#39;re supposed to be cryptographic hash functions. I know that BLAKE received some scrutiny in this regard, as part of the SHA3 competition. But then BLAKE was obsoleted by BLAKE2, which in turn was obsoleted by BLAKE3, making the claims to security less and less sensible.And all this is before the actual winner of SHA3 comes into the picture. With parameters as specified by SHA3 it&#39;s a lot slower than BLAKE3, but it is my understanding (IANAC) that(1) The SHA3 security margin can safely be decreased, as NIST set the security requirements too high. This is one of the reasons for the speed difference.(2) The sponge-based crypto popularized by Keccak (the SHA3 winner) is much more amenable to cryptanalysis than the more traditional crypto such as the functions in the Blake family. This means that Blake&#39;s security would be less sure even had it received the same level of scrutiny. But AFAIK Blake received much less scrutiny than Keccak, or even other sponge-based functions, such as the ones in the NIST Lightweight Crypto competition.https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/lightweight-cryptographyhttps://keccak.team/2017/not_arx.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note for those who only read the headline: the 3x speedup was achieved by removing a call to RDRAND in the extraction path, not the change in hash function."</p>

Like, congrats, you managed to host a bunch of web applications via containers on a dedicated server. It&#39;s really nice for a super personal project and I&#39;m sure it helped OP gain a lot of operational experience across several domains, but I just find this type of article to be &#34;DYI porn&#34; for a highly specific subset of DYI.2). On HOWTO articles about infra (2/2): Is there any sort of comprehensive infra setup guide out there? Even something that just covers &#34;core&#34; AWS services (CloudFront, EC2, ELB, ECS, Lambda, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and a few others...) feels like it would be incredibly useful for so many people.3). &#34;AWS on Rails&#34; - I feel like we&#39;re getting close to a time when &#34;AWS on Rails&#34; emerges and we see the birth of a new opinionated tool that says &#34;Most people just want to ship their product, not fiddle with cloud infra.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel like there is wisdom in &#34;Make hay while the sun shines.&#34; When you&#39;re young and unencumbered by responsibility and family, when your cognitive abilities are at their peak, when your energy is endless, when your body is strong and healthy, when your knees work, and your fingers can type without arthritis: that&#39;s the optimal time to work and earn. Min-max that salary and stay healthy. Due to compounding interest, a dollar made in your 20&#39;s is far, far more valuable than a dollar made in your 60&#39;s. Every morsel you make and save early means your retirement comes earlier. There will never be a more efficient time to earn those days of leisure that will come later if you stay healthy.Take that vacation to Bali when you&#39;re young, and you are wasting your prime, strongest days that could be making you financially secure and/or independent. Go windsurfing for a year in Ibiza after college, and you&#39;re adding 5 years to your working life--retiring at 62 instead of 57. It didn&#39;t sound like much time when I was young, but today, as I turn elderly, I&#39;m counting down the years until I can finally retire, and kicking myself for goofing around when I was younger. If I could do it all again, I&#39;d have tried harder to get into big tech early, I&#39;d have taken comp and 401(k)s and advancement more seriously. I&#39;d have played fewer video games, traveled less, and relaxed on the beach less.Life isn&#39;t short--it&#39;s LONG, and you have a brief moment in that life to maximize your preparation for the rest of it. Use it wisely."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pithy, but true.It&#39;s only half the story, though. Moderation and balance are the real key. Overwork is not good in the long term. But underwork can also be a problem, even when employers let it slide.Starting in my 30s, my friends who operated in the extremes of overwork or underwork started to diverge from everyone else. Overworked people were burnt out and had few friends and social connections left. Underworking people were often first to be laid off and slowly fell behind in their skills relative to everyone they were competing against for jobs.Most of them found balance and got back on track, but I know a few holdouts who went all-in on the vagabond life of traveling the world and having fun, as well as a few who have just disappeared into their work and have basically lost social skills at this point.Balance and moderation aren&#39;t really that difficult when you make them a priority. Especially in this job market where employers aren&#39;t squeezing employees as hard because everyone has so many alternate opportunities."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really tried to like macOS for an entire year. I used Yabai[1] as tilling window manager which is much better than Amethyst mentioned in the article. I also wrote my own compose key tool macos-compose[2] and rofi-like clone choosem[3] (eventually bought into Alfred).Yet with all of this effort I still went back to linux after a year (Arch with Qtile and Gnome). What really killed macos for me was the fact that animations could not be disabled entirely and everything felt like it&#39;s behind several ms of a delay. I work on the move so I don&#39;t have the luxury of multi-screen setup so switching between programs, workspaces and windows is the most important part of my workflow - it just drove me nuts.Now I run simple Lenovo yoga laptop with arch+qtile+gnome and honestly, my performance at work at least doubled. That&#39;s my anecdote anyway.1 - https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai2 - https://github.com/Granitosaurus/macos-compose3 - https://github.com/Granitosaurus/choosem"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I did the exact opposite. I was on MacOS since 10.2.But lately I felt things have become way too locked down (both hardware and software), too dumbed down (too many apps resemble mobile apps with limited functionality) and too opinionated. Sometimes I just want things differently. Another reason was that many new features are specific to iCloud integration and as I use many OSes (both computer and mobile) I could not take advantage of those anyway. I need cross platform. So a lot of selling points became irrelevant.I moved to FreeBSD with KDE on top and it felt like a breath of fresh air finally being able to set up my system the way I want it. This is so empowering.It became my daily driver about a year ago and I haven&#39;t looked back though I still use Mac and Windows for work, Windows personally for gaming and Linux for some servers.Of course I lost some stuff too like Apple&#39;s excellent multi DPI and great hardware integration. And many apps that were great like pixelmator. But I gained a lot of configurability and the ability to upgrade my hardware again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me Linux is about freedom. Other systems might be better in UI/UX or performance (e.g. give more FPS in games for NVidia cards), but I remember the times when Microsoft dominated the IT world and it looked scary.All corporations strive to fragment the market using non-compatible technologies and then to monopolize the market by consuming other fragments.This strategy failed in the 90s with the arrival of Linux. Although many times I felt like the whole world will become Microsoft/Wintel, I think we barely missed.Now, corporations are trying to do it e.g. via forcing everybody into the cloud and killing open protocols. E.g. I have several email accounts and I can&#39;t gather mail from all of my mailboxes in one application. Situation is even worse with Calendars. I have two jobs and also my own personal calendar server and I can&#39;t collect all my calendars in one app also. I have to routinely check Google Calendar, because even though I can add it to my Thunderbird Calendar, moved or canceled events changes are not propagating to Thunderbird. And I can&#39;t integrate Microsoft Outlook calendar into my Thunderbird at all.I really don&#39;t want to rely on whims of one corporation. Also, regarding MacBooks: I remember when the touchbar had no alternatives and it is really awful. This is what monopoly means: you have to live with bad decisions. You have to pay absurd money for a piece of cloth or a roller for the desktop case."</p>

It&#39;s just a rendering engine that happens to use some subset / superset of HTML, JS and CSS, but it is not compatible with web libraries and components.As a basic example, SciterJS crashes loading the &#34;hello world&#34; ReactJS project (at least it did last time I tried it - the author recommended I used a custom version of React he publishes). It&#39;s perfectly fine to come up with a lightweight cross-platform UI rendering engine (we know we need more of those), but having it web-adjancent while not really web-compatible is a recipe for frustration."</p>

I built the frontend using Tailwind (https://tailwindcss.com) and DaisyUI (https://daisyui.com) and, using Go compiler flags, I can release the app using both WebView (github.com/webview/webview) (which, yes, does require the host OS&#39; collaboration) and Wails (wails.app) (which also does.)On Linux/AMD64, the binary&#39;s size is 3.7M when building for WebView, and 6.8M when targeting Wails.The way the app works is I drag/drop files to the UI, magic happens, and I use github.com/ncruces/zenity to prompt the user for a save location.I cross-compile the apps using xgo (https://github.com/karalabe/xgo)It&#39;s been working pretty well on Linux, Windows, MacOS. I think WebView&#39;s approach of limiting the feature set is working well as it feels more &#34;native&#34; than Wails (better refreshes and resize operations for instance)However, I already have a few tickets reporting that, for instance, the app is displayed as a blank window in some environments. And it&#39;s hard to debug remotely, obviously. So, this is where Sciter may be a better option."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While depression can certainly be caused by chemical imbalance and not because of how your unconscious mind impacts/limits your experience of life, I took the approach that exploring my subconscious through therapy was the way to get out.For me it worked very well and I think the journey is an amazing one to go on. Building from the ground up and understanding all the foundations within. I always wonder about treatments which don&#39;t have this benefit, although the results in terms of lifestyle change sound extremely positive.One of the hardest parts of therapy is diagnosis of what to work on. Even though an issue will be &#34;presenting&#34; itself clearly, it can often be a bit of a decoy. For example, a lack of self-esteem is often a useful derivative of an unconscious fear of upsetting others. Low self-esteem =&gt; avoid situations/behaviours that upset others.During therapy I found dreams, when analysed outside of the &#34;conventional&#34; Freudian/Jungian frameworks provided a simple and accurate method of reaching the root diagnosis (the fear of upsetting others vs. the decoy issue of low self-esteem).I got a bit obsessed by the topic and wrote a paper on it which can be downloaded here: https://psyarxiv.com/k6trzAnd was discussed on HN here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19143590"</p>

I’m walking my dog and playing the guitar again, for nothing more than the sheer joy of it.”  Most importantly, he said, “I’m remaining positive and being respectful of others. These are big changes in my life.”Serious question: are these typical signs of depression?  Now I&#39;m wondering if I have depression."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “The treatment, known as Stanford accelerated intelligent neuromodulation therapy (SAINT) or simply Stanford neuromodulation therapy, is an intensive, individualized form of transcranial magnetic stimulation. In the study, remission typically occurred within days and lasted months. The only side effects were temporary fatigue and headaches.”&gt; “Twenty-nine people with treatment-resistant depression participated in the study: About half received SAINT, and the rest underwent a placebo procedure that mimicked the real treatment. After five days of treatment, 78.6% of the participants in the treatment group were no longer depressed, according to several standard methods of evaluation. “It’s quite a dramatic effect, and it’s quite sustained,” said Alan Schatzberg, MD, the Kenneth T. Norris, Jr. Professor in Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, who was a co-author of the study.”Makes me wonder what percentage of the placebo group improved?&gt; The transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration requires six weeks of once-daily sessions. Only about half of patients who undergo the treatment improve, and only about a third experience remission from depression."</p>

Taking a telephoto shot with a tiny sensor in something other than great light (even a heavy overcast is often not enough) will require a lot of software processing. I’m

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my 1980s version of Empire, all the global variables were kept contiguously in one source file. To save/restore the game, it just took the address of the first one, the address of the last one, and blitted it to a disk file, and blitted it back.Very fast &amp; easy.Of course, it broke when COMDATs were introduced.I did a similar thing with my text editor. The colors were configurable. The usual way was to have a configuration file, which the editor would read upon startup. But floppy disk systems were unbearably slow. So what I did was take the address of the configuration data in the data segment. I&#39;d work backwards to where those bytes were in the EXE file, and patch the EXE file. This worked great!Until the advent of virus scanners, which broke that. Virus scanners hated self-modifying EXE files."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminded me of the old days working in Windows 3.1 and my first professional project was to write a SOCKS client that could be loaded up and intercept all calls to Winsock&#39;s connect() function.  It needed to do this without modifying the other programs and it had to happen at the DLL level and not the VxD layer where our IP stack ran.Turns out there was an undocumented Windows API function along the lines of &#34;AliasCsToDsRegister&#34; or something like that - I&#39;ve tried to find a reference to it but I can&#39;t find it.  It allowed me write into the code segment (the CS was global and read only - as it was shared among all processes)  and replace the first few bytes of the connect function call with a jump to my code which would then put it back, make the call to the socks server, do some other magic, put my jump hook back in and the return to the caller.  Good times!Kind of surprised I remember this and more so that it actually worked."</p>

It only works because its so bare-bones, it doesn&#39;t use try/catch and calls to other functions are possible because the function pointers are passed in through the registers and the compiled code is small enough to fit in a single page.An example function I memcpy and run:https://github.com/skimmilk/liblibinject/blob/master/src/lib..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We&#39;ve been using SQLite in production as our exclusive means for getting bytes to/from disk for going on 6 years now. To this day, not one production incident can be attributed to our choice of database or how we use it.We aren&#39;t using SQLite exactly as intended either. We have databases in the 100-1000 gigabyte range that are concurrently utilized by potentially hundreds or thousands of simultaneous users. Performance is hardly a concern when you have reasonable hardware (NVMe/SSD) and utilize appropriate configuration (PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL).In our testing, our usage of SQLite vastly outperformed an identical schema on top of SQL Server. It is my understanding that something about not having to take a network hop and being able to directly invoke the database methods makes a huge difference. Are you able to execute queries and reliably receive results within microseconds with your current database setup?Sure, there is no way we are going to be able to distribute/cluster our product by way of our database provider alone, but this is a constraint we decided was worth it, especially considering all of the other reduction in complexity you get with single machine business systems. I am aware of things like DQLite/RQLite/et.al., but we simply don&#39;t have a business case that demands that level of resilience (and complexity) yet.Some other tricks we employ - We do not use 1 gigantic SQLite database for the entire product. It&#39;s more like a collection of microservices that live inside 1 executable with each owning an independent SQLite database copy. So, we would have databases like Users.db, UserSessions.db, Settings.db, etc. We don&#39;t have any use cases that would require us to write some complex reporting query across multiple databases."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe SQLite is about to explode in usage into areas it’s not been used before.SQL.js[0] and the incredible “Absurd SQL”[1] are making it possible to build PWAs and hybrid mobile apps with a local SQL db. Absurd SQL uses IndexedDB as a block store fs for SQLite so you don’t have to load the whole db into memory and get atomic writes.Also I recently discovered the Session Extension[2] which would potentially enable offline distributed updates with eventual consistency!I can imagine building a SAAS app where each customer has a “workspace” each as a single SQLite db, and a hybrid/PWA app which either uses a local copy of the SQLite db synced with the session extension or uses a serveless backend (like CloudFlare workers) where a lightweight function performs the db operations. I haven’t yet found a nice way to run SQLite on CloudFlare workers, it need some sort of block storage, but it can’t be far off.0: https://sql.js.org/1: https://github.com/jlongster/absurd-sql2: https://www.sqlite.org/sessionintro.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve always thought it interesting that there was a time when large(ish) websites were hosted using servers that would struggle to outperform a modern smart toaster or wristwatch, and yet modern web applications tend to demand a dramatic distributed architecture. I like the examples in this article showing what a single modern server can do when you&#39;re not scaling to Google&#39;s level.As an aside, what about distributed derivatives of sqlite, like rqlite, as a response to the criticism that sqlite requires your database server to also be your web server. Could something like rqlite also provide a way for an sqlite database to grow into a distributed cluster at a later point?https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite"</p>

					<h3><a href="https://www.duskborn.com/posts/2021-aoc-zig/">A Review of the Zig Programming Language (Using Advent of Code 2021)</a></h3>
				</div>
				<div class="story__comments">

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29702607">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Computer language inventors are torn between a voice whispering “use the language Luke” and and a more gravelly “let your feelings for the compiler grow, embrace the syntax side.”I did a two-day sprint through Zig a month ago and really really liked it. It has some quirks that I would have done differently, but overall I think it’s pretty cool. I just need a good small scale project to try it out on now.My favorite example of the “use the language” ethos is the way Zig does generics. I have hated generics/templates in every language I use them in. They are the gordian knot of confusion that most languages in pursuit of some sort of unified type theory impale themselves on (yes, I’m mashing metaphors here). But Zig just uses its own self to define user types and generics come along for free. It resonates (with me at least) as a realization of what Gilda Bracha has shared about how to reify generics.[1] https://gbracha.blogspot.com/2018/10/reified-generics-search..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Initializing arrays is weird in Zig. Lets say you want to have a 0 initialized array, you declare it like [_]u8{0} * 4 which means I want an array, of type u8, that is initialized to 0 and is 4 elements long. You get used to the syntax, but it’s not intuitive.Alternatively:  var some_array = std.mem.zeroes([4]u8);

Though as mentioned later in the article the standard library documentation is not very good, making this not as obvious as it could be.&gt; Everything in Zig is const x = blah;, so why are functions not const bar = function() {};?Good question, there&#39;s an accepted proposal to fix this: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1717&gt; The builtin compiler macros (that start with @) are a bit confusing. Some of them have a leading uppercase, others a lowercase, and I never did work out any pattern to them.In idiomatic zig, anything that returns a type is uppercased as though it were itself a type. Since only a few builtins return types, the vast majority of builtins will start with a lowercase letter. I think it is only `@Type`, `@TypeOf`, `@This`, and `@Frame` that don&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I also did AoC 2021 in Zig: https://github.com/avorobey/adventofcode-2021One thing the OP didn&#39;t mention that I really liked was runtime checks on array/slice access and integer under/overflow. Because dealing with heap allocation is a bit of a hassle, I was incentivized to use static buffers a lot. I quickly figured out that I didn&#39;t have to worry about their sizes much, because if they&#39;re overrun by the unexpectedly large input or other behavior in my algorithms, I get a nice runtime error with the right line indicated, rather than corrupt memory or a crash. Same thing about choosing which integer type to use: it&#39;s not a problem if I made the wrong choice, I&#39;ll get a nice error message and fix easily. This made for a lot of peace of mind during coding. Obviously in a real production system I&#39;d be more careful and use dynamic sizes appropriately, but for one-off programs like these it was excellent.Overall, I really enjoyed using Zig while starting out at AoC problem 1 with zero knowledge of the language. To my mind, it&#39;s &#34;C with as much convenience as could be wrung out of it w/o betraying the low-level core behavior&#34;. That is, no code execution hidden behind constructors or overloads, no garbage collection, straight imperative code, but with so much done right (type system, generics, errors, optionals, slices) that it feels much more pleasant and uncomparably safer than C.(you can still get a segmentation fault, and I did a few times - by erroneously holding on to pointers inside a container while it resized. Still, uncomparably safer)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a neat idea - and not without precedent.Installing each package into it&#39;s own directory, and maintaining symlinks into that directory structure, was an approach explored for large system installations in the 90s and 00s.NIST depot, Xheir, CMU, and Nix all did this in varying ways. The advantage of this approach was that packages could be installed once on an NFS, scoped by version/configuration, and mounted into the filesystem of every work station on a campus. The workstations then just needed to maintain references to the files on the NFS for their particular software configurations. There is also some interesting exploration of composable configuration templates that allow workstations to inherit and extend a particular configuration (i.e. the physics department might have a base template).Nix is easily the most successful in this space. It even uses something similar to the NFS approach! It can maintain a remote cache of observed configurations to pull from instead of redoing work.Reading these LISA papers is a lot of fun. If you work in system administration (i.e. maintaining an Artifactory instance for your company) and have a day to spare - I&#39;d very much recommend reading them, starting with the Nix paper!To get you started:Nix - https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa-04/nix-safe-and-polic...Depot Lite - https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa-viii/depot-lite-mecha..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is actually a neat idea, and I am saying that as the archetypical, grumpy &#34;I like my sys the way it is, thank you very much!&#34; - kinda guy.A lot of the directory structure of POSIX systems is completely obsolete in the 21st century. The difference between sbin and bin? Historical, for the most part, and irrelevant in the age of rescue systems.One question that is nagging at my mind with this: What if two programs require the same lib, how is this resolved?Because, when I install progA, the lib is symlinked into the index, so when I now install progB, the lib is installed again if I understood correctly. Storage is irrelevant, the pkg manager sees there is a symlink, so it stays in place, all is well.But now I remove progA, so what happens? progB is still present, still requires the lib, it is also still installed, but now the symlink, which refered to /Programs/progA/libs/thelib.so is broken. How is this situation handled?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here&#39;s the problem with non-deterministic conversations: everyone has an opinion (fair enough), and is willing to state it with the authority of a highly experienced subject matter expert.In deterministic conversations, a naive opinion stated with a lot of authority would be shut down quite quickly (eg: many areas in programming where you can quickly prove something to be right or wrong). You can&#39;t do that in politics, business, and many other areas. As a result, we have about 8 billion politicians and business experts.The author is making the assumption that listing a salary is connected to being a progressive business. A bunch of other people take this a step further and state how not listing the salary is a part of some conspiracy (in YC&#39;s case, apparently this is an attempt to lower the payroll costs of their portfolio companies).The reality is that even the most transparent companies out there (eg: Gitlab) do not disclose individual salaries. No, it has nothing to do with some secret plan to underpay anyone or certain groups. It&#39;s simply a fact that people become incredibly irrational when it comes to compensation, and the minute you lay it out in the open, you open up a huge surface area for conflict. Last year we learned that encouraging political activism at work has a similar dynamic, and many companies have made that a no go zone as well. It&#39;s not because they are racist or don&#39;t care - it&#39;s because it takes a tiny minority of people to get the entire business derailed, and it&#39;s hard enough to keep that from happening in the best of times; once you add a catalyst like salaries or politics, it&#39;s like adding fuel to the fire.But rather than ask ourselves why the leaders at Gitlab and millions of others companies have made the decisions they did, it&#39;s a lot easier to just make assumptions - &#34;it must be coming from a bad place, so let me brainstorm what some of those bad places could be.&#34;I&#39;ll take it a step further - Colorado State Senator Jessie Danielson would make you believe it&#39;s more likely that millions of companies are &#34;bad actors&#34; than that she just doesn&#39;t have the relevant experience in business to predict which way her bill was going to work out. Now that she&#39;s cost so many of her constituents lucrative remote jobs, it&#39;s too late to admit Mea Culpa, and instead it&#39;s everyone else&#39;s fault. If she was held a bit more accountable, the next time someone tries to bridge the gender pay gap they will hopefully spend some time interviewing and learning from people who have the relevant experience in hiring."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It really still isn&#39;t the norm anywhere to list compensation and I suspect that Y Combinator has the same problems of disparate compensation based on when people joined as any other company. Heck, we are all switching jobs constantly because the new guy got more than we did, despite being the same level and having more experience at the company.Plenty of companies decided to stop hiring from Colorado rather than post compensation in the job postings.If I had to guess, I suspect it provides no competitive advantage to list compensation except if you pay top tier.As an anecdote from a friend, the wage differences can be substantial. The friend just recently got a new job and the senior who mentored him in onboarding also got promoted a level too. That senior was talking about how they finally reached six figures (Canada has much lower pay than the USA, so this isn&#39;t crazy). My friend made six figures starting, with 3-5 fewer years of experience and just about two years overall.There are a lot of absurdly underpaid people out there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried to start a trend a few months ago on the month Who&#39;s hiring posts to get posters to put the compensation.  I automatically upvote any post with compensation, but few have it.I even posted about it once and got a ton of upvotes but then the mods buried my post.I would love to see more job posts with compensation in fairness to people who aren&#39;t good at negotiating, but it just isn&#39;t the norm these days."</p>

Currently it defaults to 64 bits on most architectures. Although it defaults to 32 bits on some traditional architectures (i686, ARM), this is planned to change and applications should not rely on this.So it sounds like glibc plans to change the default, just like musl has done."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fact checking has been laughable from the beginning.  It is inherently biased.  The heavy political leanings of those in direct control of the organizations&#39; verdicts are brought up time and time again, and even memes are being made about sites like Snopes.  My favorite meme goes something like:Did x member of y political organization get arrested for hitting some in the head with a baseball bat?FALSE.[big block of text]X member of y political organization was arrested for hitting someone in the head with a cricket bat.[big block of text]"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think what many here and the writers of the article are missing is that you can both be truthful and misleading. These are not mutually exclusive. Let&#39;s start with the title: &#34;The Study That Convinced the CDC To Support Mask Mandates in Schools Is Junk Science&#34;. If you just read this (titles are very important and most people only read these) what will you take away? What the authors are trying to say is that this one study has problems.But reading further in the article they rise doubt about masks in general, which is something we know is highly effective (purely from a physics point of view). They don&#39;t say masking is effective, they continually question if it is. This is really problematic. The study being wrong doesn&#39;t question _if_ masking is effective, but _how_ effective. There&#39;s a major difference in these statements and they can have readers, who are not experts and don&#39;t know scientific vernacular, to doubt and distrust more science than the article _technically_ draws into question. The article is suggesting that this is the norm and because this study is bad we get to question all the others.So the problem here really is that while yes, the article only questions the one study they do so in a way that questions more fundamental knowledge that we have. Masking works. How much? Harder to say. There&#39;s a few old sayings such as &#34;the devil never tells a full lie&#34; or &#34;the devil sows doubt&#34; (often with truth). These are the errors that the authors are making here.I would conclude that they aren&#39;t inaccurate, but are misleading."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sigh. Comments in this thread are predictably polarized.I personally think that fact checking is potentially damaging to society but so is the ability of social media to spread misleading claims.It&#39;s difficult to predict which is going to be worse in the long run. As in many things we&#39;ll probably learn to tolerate a degree of both and aim to find a &#34;least worse&#34; outcome.Anyone claiming here either that no fact-checking would be the best outcome or it&#39;s inverse (I can&#39;t quite formulate what that would be right now) is probably wrong and the messy middle is probably correct."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everybody&#39;s got questions and suspicions, but here&#39;s my rather subtle one: If you&#39;re editing dramatic video footage for YouTube, why exclude the exciting moment when the engine suddenly quits? Why edit out the suspense of your repeated attempts to restart the engine? Why omit the drama of your repeated radio calls?I think if you&#39;re a YouTube narcissist, you leave everything in that attracts attention and views. Now of course maybe if your ego is especially fragile, you edit out anything that makes you look bad. (Bad in your own opinion, mind you. There were numerous things left in that make him look bad in my opinion, but I digress.) So maybe he thought he sounded panicky on the radio, and maybe he thought he looked inept trying to restart the engine (or maybe he was too dumb to try either of those), but that still leaves the moment the engine quits - why leave that out?Now you know what they say about assume: it puts U between me and some ass. Which I don&#39;t appreciate. But nonetheless I assume that moment is not shown from the cockpit camera because he killed the engine. And if he killed the engine, he probably never tried to restart it, and never made any radio calls.It&#39;s kind of like when your cell phone is turned off all day, on the same day your spouse happens to get murdered. Nobody can triangulate &amp; prove you were at the crime scene... but........."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a private pilot and I regularly fly aircraft similar to the one in the video. Engines can fail for any number of reasons, but catastrophic engine failure is exceedingly rare, and most of the time an engine stoppage is going to be something that can be corrected easily, such as fuel starvation (maybe failure to switch fuel tanks?), or a misconfigured fuel mixture, or a fried magneto.As student pilots, we train extensively for engine-out scenarios by running through checklists to increase glide distance, diagnose the problem, and hopefully restart the engine. At the very least, we evaluate all options.The first thing you are trained to do in an engine-out is to pitch the aircraft for best glide speed, and you don&#39;t even see him do that in the video. The prop stops spinning and he immediately opens the door.Bailing from the aircraft was the first thing he thought of doing, and that is the complete opposite of what every pilot is trained to do. I can&#39;t emphasize enough how much the engine-out checklist is drilled into you during training. Any qualified pilot is going to exercise some of those options unless their intention is in fact to bail from the aircraft."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is well written, and I learned stuff (the trailing spaces and end-of-buffer indicators).Modern Emacs configurations tend to revolve around use-package, which wraps up the package installer logic at the end of this configuration and makes it somewhat declarative. Just going by the standards of r/emacs or places like that, it&#39;d be unusual to see a .emacs that didn&#39;t ultimately boil down to a bunch of use-package clauses configuring stuff like LSP, Magit, company, ivy, and yasnippet.If I was going to add just one thing to this starter configuration, it&#39;d be a single example of use-package, to make it clear how to add and configure a package the user just read about online --- it&#39;s just such a big part of how Emacs is used now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ahh, I finally get to flex. With our powers combined, me and a random unknown dev successfully set up a Python REPL that has access to emacs. I.e. you can program emacs via python:https://twitter.com/theshawwn/status/1472371143000707075https://github.com/zielmicha/emacspy/issues/1Setup guide: https://gist.github.com/shawwn/64e17ac3f7b272ce0ce16eb6a593b...Maybe this&#39;ll be the boost you lurkers need to get your butts into one of the coolest editors. &#34;Not your dad&#39;s editor&#34; -- new emacs slogan, probably. /sBonus screenshot of compiling emacs on a 96 core TPU: https://i.imgur.com/YtJ8jF7.pngIt launches emacs, then uses the (relatively) new dynamic modules feature to start a Python runtime, which can then import a library that accesses emacs.But to my surprise, Python can also import whatever you already have `pip3 install`&#39;ed. I imported jax and did some high speed calculations in lisp. Just kidding, I really did import jax, but it&#39;ll take a bit more work to be able to pass numpy arrays to emacs. :) But it&#39;s &#34;just&#34; a matter of making some kind of RPC system so that (+ a b) ends up calling back into python to do the addition. Then the circle will be complete -- elisp from python (already done), and python from elisp (&#34;exercise for the reader&#34;).For real though, go throw that fella a star on his github repo. The most surprising thing was that this project has been quietly on github for like two years already. It was sitting at zero stars when it popped up in one of my random google searches."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My big eye-openers (some from postdoc) were more about the sociology of science than the day-to-day productivity:- Even the most blatantly wrong and illogical published work can only be displaced by another publication that explains/does the same phenomenon better; i.e., people are going to keep believing in phlogiston until someone shows them oxygen. If you simply point out inconsistencies in phlogiston theory, in person or in writing, they may well make a variety of unwanted psychological deductions about you.- Similarly, nobody actually enjoys being around critics or enduring criticism, and therefore you will observe many senior scientists partially avoiding the major downsides of being a critic by artfully concealing criticisms inside what sounds to the uninitiated like mutual affirmation sessions. You have to listen very closely and learn the lingo to pick this up.- Never question a scientific superior (other than maybe a direct mentor or very close colleague) with any other approach besides &#34;I have a helpful suggestion about how you can maybe reach your intended destination better/faster/more precisely&#34;. Regardless of where that destination might be, such as off a cliff or into a wall.- The opinion/fact ratio you are allowed to have as a scientist is directly and very strongly correlated with seniority, H-index, and so on.- The incentive structure of scientific publication is such that there are big rewards for being right on an important question, bigger the earlier you are to the party, and little to no penalties for being wrong, so long as the error cannot be provably and directly linked to fraud. There are a variety of interesting consequences to this incentive structure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Missing from this actionable survey is the skill of answering questions that haven&#39;t yet been answered in the secondary literature (books, reviews) or even primary literature (journals). This is, of course, what research and a PhD is all about in the end.In my experience, this fact was the #1 reason why some peers dropped out of PhD programs. They joined expecting a continuation of undergraduate education, which consists largely of recapitulating what appears in the secondary literature. Instead, what they got in graduate school was the expectation that they would be producing the primary literature. That&#39;s a very different game.It was a game these peers discovered they hated playing. Nothing in college can prepare you for the isolation of spending your time becoming the world&#39;s expert on a narrow technical topic. Your usual reinforcement mechanisms of approval from family and friends gives way to slight comprehension at best. Then there is all of the alone time doing research requires. But I suspect the hardest part of all is the seemingly endless lineup of dead ends and false hope. Not only is success not assured, you often have no idea whether the result will have any utility even if you succeed.Then, just when you&#39;ve gotten the hang of this finding answers game you discover that the real expectation is to be the one who formulates good questions. The kinds of questions that, although they will certainly involve dead ends, will ultimately pay off in some meaningful way. Very little in a bachelor&#39;s prepares you for doing this. It&#39;s a hard-won skill that comes from a round or two (or three or four) of months (or years) spent answering questions that nobody cares about. A lot hinges on your relationship with your advisor on this one.The PhD isn&#39;t just a bachelors degree but harder. It&#39;s a completely different animal. The skills in this article are very useful toward that end. But there&#39;s a lot more to the story when it comes to skills for finding answers to those unanswered questions, and formulating worthwhile questions without answers.The benefit of all of this work and discomfort is that you come away with the ability to answer worthwhile questions that haven&#39;t yet been answered. And that&#39;s a highly transferrable and applicable skill."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Two things I would add to this that I learned early on in my PhD:1. Presentations aren’t really about conveying information.I sat though so many dull presentations, they were very informative but I can read a paper quicker than they can badly present the same information.The best presentations were the ones that covered the whys of the work, the applications, the next steps, the specific problem areas - often these aren’t covered in the paper but, armed with that extra insight I am far more likely to read the paper and remember it.Presentations are (as the author says) about telling stories.2. Show up. So many PhDs waft around not doing a whole lot, and so land up being on the program forever. This only benefits the uni and is detrimental to the student. I noticed in the first month of my PhD that most people did a lot more work at the end than the beginning - so I flipped it, worked consistently from day one and got done in just under 3 years.Carry this over to your daily life and it’s almost a super power for getting stuff done. Consistently showing up and plugging away in something reaps rewards."</p>

After devoting untold hours to reaching the top of their profession.Let&#39;s say you&#39;re a professional earning $300k plus in software.You&#39;re often working 100% remote, using your monitor 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, just for work.  Plus untold hours of HackerNews (strictly after 5pm of course).I just find that&#39;s truly not an unlikely situation to be in.Without reference to the technical merits of the Apple Display, I don&#39;t think dropping $5000 on a monitor is outlandish for any professional in the situation I&#39;ve described.My hairdresser for example has a $4000 pair of scissors.  He uses the damn things every day, and he sharpens them twice a day.Whilst it&#39;s not essential, taking pride and investing in the tools of your trade is not a thing to frown upon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been waiting for good external Retina displays for years. That the situation has not improved after all this time is incredibly frustrating. Why is no display manufacturer [0] interested in setting itself apart by producing and marketing a lineup of reasonably priced external pixel-doubled (~200 ppi) displays? For some reason everything must be 16:9 and 4K with no regards to display size, resulting in some very awkward pixel densities. The fact that Apple is able to mass-manufacture a 5k display with a whole computer in it for just a little bit more than an UltraFine 5k is to me an indication that at least it’s technically feasible.[0] There is LG, but these displays have their issues as the article explains."</p>

It turned out that he still had a number of friends in that area, and had forwarded it on to a friend to investigate.“Never heard of this lawyer chap,” the response came, “DO NOT respond!”So, of course the Archbishop responded.For a moment, I put myself in the shoes of this “Nigerian Prince”, getting an email from “Archbishop Desmond Tutu”, shaming the alleged prince for attempting to scam innocents on the internet.

Of course it’s all based on luck, but that doesn’t make it an uninteresting read. I admire the diligence of the author, and how well they played the lucky cards they were given.I am frequently in awe when reading technical articles on HN, with people advancing the state of the art in some technology. Those people also are incredibly lucky, because they were born with massive talents that, through sacrifices and education, they transformed into life achievements.As an average software engineer I was not lucky enough to be born with cognitive skills that will ever allow me to reach those technical highs, but that is not a reason to crap on it saying “Just luck! Just genetic/environmental luck!”.Similarly, I don’t typically read from others: “It’s easy for you to rewrite the Linux kernel in JavaScript over a weekend, your work is just luck because you were born a genius in a developed country so all your achievements need to be discounted and you have no merits!”.I suspect when it comes to compensation talk people tend on average to get more bitter than they should otherwise be.Maybe I take this to heart because I made significant sacrifices to immigrate to the US and, while I was immensely lucky to succeed in the endeavor, most people I know would have never taken those uncomfortable steps (leaving family behind in a different country, sacrifice personal space by frugal living in a HCOL area as opposed to a LCOL area with a house and backyard for the kids, …), yet they will happily “complain” that my compensation is much higher than theirs, and that there is no merit to it, rather than simply admitting that they willingly chose a different path in life, but they could have chased my same opportunities with largely the same financial outcome.If I was reading this article and I was not a tech worker in the US but interested in getting those compensations, my first reaction would be “damn, let me research what are the options for legal immigration to the US and let me start down a path that has good odds of me landing a tech job over there within 5-10 years”. It would not be “let me complain on HN how the country I am a forever-prisoner in has a 90% effective tax rate so that I feel good about my situation”."</p>

It works fine with ballpoint or fountain pens (some notebook papers don’t work well with fountain pens and people think they need special expensive paper). Obviously it doesn’t come in a neat book. I just used plastic document sleeves for the first level of organisation (one could then view more than two pages at once too) and box files for the second, though it wasn’t very necessary. I don’t have much to write and record these days.I currently use paper for free-form drawings or diagrams for work as photographing a paper drawing is the most efficient process I currently have for getting such diagrams into emails/our wiki."</p>

Free Software may often tend to be free-as-in-beer as well as free-as-in-speech but, where it is, that is as is. If you have special, and especially time-sensitive, needs that aren&#39;t as is, you pay someone to do it. It&#39;s not a gratis support contract with response time guarantees.

He is frustrated things are hard from the beginning, jumps don&#39;t work right away and he stopped after a few minutes. I remember my perseverance as a kid.I was thinking about that lately, I see my kids don&#39;t have this strong motivation as I had, not for anything. Everything works for them and is layed out. For example, when I was young I had a lego technic motor, but the wires sometimes got oxidatid or just broke, and I had to fix it. My son has a new lego set, and the motor always works, except when the wireless remote runs out of battery. 
Same with gaming, it always works, while in the past even getting a game to run could be a challenge on its own. And when he gets stuck in a game he watches a YouTube. No hours of frustration and endless searching and figuring for a solution.I see my kids don&#39;t have much of these challenges, everything works for them.Don&#39;t know how this will affect them on the long run. Now it&#39;s only my observation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the late 2000s, as a teenager, I was gifted a Runescape account. This account had level 80+ woodcutting, allowing one to chop magic trees - which would produce the most expensive lumber in the game. It took a staggering number of real hours to achieve this skill level, we&#39;re talking several hundred hours minimum.At some point I had realized that there were different sketchy websites that would buy and sell the in-game currency, gold pieces or GP. It was something like $10 to 1M GP. I could chop enough magic logs in about 4-6 hours to make $10.I had a breakthrough. What if I wrote a macro to record my cursor and clicks during my route from the &#39;bank&#39; (where you can deposit any amount of any material) to the nearby respawning magic tree forest?Weeks went by and I had passive income. Runescape eventually introduced the Grand Exchange, a literal in-game stock market that allowed power users like me to sell much larger quantities of certain items instantly, across all Runescape servers (referred to as Worlds) simultaneously. This required a standardized pricing mechanism, like an order book, where prices of any item would fluctuate based on buy and sell orders.Suddenly, I now could see a +-10% change on the value of my digital assets, on which my passive income was built.I could go on; Runescape in fact taught me much about economics. What&#39;s extraordinary is selling Runescape gold led me to Bitcoin, and I&#39;ve watched cryptocurrency for nearly a decade, seeing trends from a MMO propagate throughout the world. It seems human nature to innovate and stagnate, and the more immediate our collective feedback loops, the quicker these cycles are."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A thought exercise you should undertake if you&#39;re thinking about / talking about crypto/NFT/web3-related projects:  If the financial instrument that underlies the project were to stop going up in value XX% per month, would you still be interested in the project?I do this a lot because I&#39;ve made the conscious (and perhaps financially foolish) choice to stay away from everything crypto/blockchain related (for now, at least).  So I have some perspective in being able to ask myself &#34;Why is this interesting?&#34; without any emotional-financial attachment.  I do this little exercise every time I read about some new brain-twisting scheme to move money around and capture some of the XX%/month rise.Play-to-earn seems to fit the same mold:  You can talk all you want about how play-to-earn is &#34;the new new&#34; and how it&#39;s helping people out of poverty and changing the dymanics of gaming and yadda yadda yadda.  But just ask yourself:  If the money music stopped tomorrow, would you play the game?Is there a &#34;there&#34; there without an underlying token that&#39;s gone up XX% in the last N months and everyone hopes will still go up XX% in the next N months?It sounds like the answer, at least when it comes to Axie Infinity, is no.  It doesn&#39;t sound fun.  It doesn&#39;t sound compelling.  It DOES sound like an opportunity for people to extract money from the crypto system that&#39;s fundamentally based on the assumption that the crypto system will continue rising in value forever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I didnt read much of the thread but I will assume that most of the people here is aware of how every single NFT game is just a ponzi.But I&#39;ve lived myself, what the author mentions as a &#34;way to lift people out of poverty.&#34;, from the era before NFT or &#34;play to earn&#34; games existed.I come from Venezuela, a full 3rd world country and I was &#34;lucky&#34; to play an MMO (lineage 2) during my young days and somehow I was good at it, i invested so many hours on it and managed to get into top tier guilds and worlds 1st event, and somehow, my character and my items were worth thousands of dollars in the market, and suddenly i went from being a 14 y.o boy sitting in pc, to bringing more money in 1 week to my family, than my entire family together for 1 year.I could understand that, while all other people on the game were playing for fun, it became my job, a job that actually got me and my family out of poverty...At the time (2007) there were a lot of chinese &#34;farmers&#34;, and people used to make fun of them, not only fun but the rest of the players were blantantly denigrating towards them, at 1st I didnt understand but once that I became a non-chinese farmer, I realized how It was a really good thing to do.Eventually I started botting, I bought more PCs and had a full army of bots, I kept making more and more money, and it helped me and my family leave the country and pretty much bought a house, a car and paid my family expenses for like 4 years out of lineage 2 adena farming.Also, scripting the bots pretty much got me to learn programming and english, so what I am now it&#39;s pretty much the result of some guy from chicago offering me 20$ in paypal for an item i had in my inventory that i got it while killing a monster, it all started there, that litle forbidden transaction in an MMO, changed my life completelySo, even tho it was like a job for me, I never saw it like a job, even tho it gave me a lot of money, i never got into the game as a way to get money, i was just a young kid trying to have some fun..But now, I get really sad everytime I see those ponzi NFT games, that only sell the idea of getting rich, and I get even more sad when I see tons of venezuelan youngsters fall for it, honestly, they are just playing with their desperation."</p>

Matrix and Zulip, even after years of chasing, still sadly haven&#39;t caught up to Discord functionality- and UX-wise; until that happens, people won&#39;t have a good reason to budge.Regarding IRC, Drew is kind of famous with his ascetism, claiming that the impossibility to share GIFs, videos, files, use threads, have internal chat history, are all features rather than limitations[1]. The thing is, people don&#39;t care about it, they&#39;ll simply vote with their own legs. Mail and mailgroups face a similar UX challenge. Not everyone is willing to endure the pain of learning and using mailgroups and IRC just because they&#39;re FOSS.[1] https://drewdevault.com/2019/07/01/Absence-of-features-in-IR..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Disregarding closed source issue I find Discord, any chat, unsuitable as a public user-developer interface.Why?1. Asynchrony. User needs time to collect data, write a bug report and so on. Developer needs time to reproduce the issue, work on it. Finally there are a lot of timezones - people ask/answer at different points of time.2. Long lasting. Communication can take days, weeks and even months as new details emerge. Accessing a year old thread should be as easy as accessing a thread created yesterday.3. Publicity. You want everything written to be as public as possible. Read access should be available to everyone without registration. Read access should be available via web browser. So that other users (who often experience the same issues) can easily find existing communication on the topic, and if they can&#39;t find it themselves you can at least send them a link which brings me to permanence.4. Permanence. Each individual communication (message) should be accessible by a URI which never changes. Each individual communication page should have links to thread/parent/children/references.5. Searchability. Follows from (3) and (4) but the easier it is for a user to find past discussions - the less noise you&#39;ll have.Chat systems such as Discord, Slack or Matrix are fundamentally incompatible with these requirements as they are focused on synchronous, ephemeral communication."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On a related note, I’ve found myself actively seeking alternatives (edit: to the project itself, not just to chat) when an OSS project only has a chat-based community as opposed to forums or mailing-lists, for two (edit: three) reasons:- it’s impossible to search chats meaningfully, whereas forums/DLs let you quickly figure out if you’re facing a common issue (and finding resolutions easily)- asking about something in chat and tracking replies a day or two later (because you will quite likely not get a quick reply to complex issues) is also quite hard unless you just happen to be awake at the same time as a core dev and can actually spend the time together (although that usually devolves into “file an issue with more details and tag me”).- I don’t want to sign up for a dozen different services or private forums to even access that info.Not to mention that (depending on community) you might just get a lot of irrelevant chatter thrown in, or just plain “this is the wrong channel” replies because there are no signposts."</p>

The antithesis of being responsible and respecting users in the modern day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is framed so negatively toward LastPass, which is unfortunate. They stopped all usage of correct passwords they believed were compromised, which is exactly what I&#39;d want them to do in this situation. Them warning users their master passwords are compromised is a good thing! Yet it&#39;s framed as though they&#39;re admitting to something.&#34;However, users receiving these warnings have stated that their passwords are unique to LastPass and not used elsewhere.&#34; That&#39;s really hard to verify. I think most users would say that rather than admit they re-used passwords (or used similar passwords that were easy to reverse engineer). Since there only seems to be 2-3 reports of this, and they&#39;re self-reported and not cited, it doesn&#39;t seem like LastPass was compromised.I&#39;m not saying I like LastPass (I use 1Password and find LastPass to be much worse), but I haven&#39;t seen any indication at this point that LastPass has been compromised at all.(To be clear, it&#39;s very possible I&#39;m wrong and this message won&#39;t age well.

This means that it is very easy to get overwhelmed by the number of recruiters trying to call you, and we will explore time management a little further down the text.This has been my experience as well, and while I understand the desire for introductory &#34;sales mode&#34; type calls, I think it&#39;s progressed past that point to something nearly pathological.As an example, I recently had a recruiter that I was previously in contact with over email cold-call me while I was skiing, trying to schedule a meeting with a hiring manager (I picked up the call because I thought it might be one of the people in my group that I didn&#39;t have in my contacts). When I requested she please send me an email to schedule the meeting, as I was out of the office, I got an email where she sent an email to schedule the phone call, to then schedule the meeting over the phone.

It seems like he definitely is able to find new jobs very efficiently so I think his advice here is valuable.However if I were hiring for an engineering leader, I would probably pass him over. I don’t see anyone being an effective leader by only sticking around for less than 2 years. Having tenures less than 2 years especially at senior roles doesn’t give a lot of positive feelings of leadership in my opinion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Independent headhunters and recruiters are a valuable resourceI had an experience with an independent recruiter that went so poorly that I haven’t been able to take those kinds of people seriously since.A few years back, I was recruited to an up-and-coming startup in the healthcare space in a senior role. It was a massive pay increase, meaningful equity, and a company name I was proud to put on my resume.An independent firm reached out to me about the role and I was definitely interested. One thing I noticed while doing my independent research was that lots of people had very poor Glassdoor reviews of the company, basically comparing it to Theranos in terms of its culture, constant firings, cult-like CEO, etc. I reached out to several former employees to discuss their experience and could not get one to talk to me about working there. Meanwhile, I was hearing from the recruiters that they hired a new exec team and most complaints were not relevant to the current situation there.I brought the complaints up with the recruiter and the company during my interview process, and they both told me it was just a couple disgruntled former employees trying to make the company look bad. The recruiter offered to put me in touch with others they placed at the company, but I couldn’t view them as objective sources.I started the gig and it took me all of two weeks to realize the company was in fact firing people constantly and I had been completely lied to by the recruiter and the company.As much as I want to believe that there are recruiters out there that look out for devs, the reality is that software talent is the product in that relationship and there aren’t a lot of financial incentives to ensure transparency going into these professional relationships. Recruiters get paid when you sign, which creates an inherent conflict of interest when you’re looking to them as a trusted resource."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thinking aloud here, it does seem like (as we&#39;ve always known), anyone doing eCommerce online is effectively beholden to their payment provider.Given Stripe is pretty popular, it feels like for many it is becoming the &#34;S3&#34; of payments in terms of an API. Would it be viable for others to implement the same API on the basis of compatibility, portability and interoperability?In the past, I recall dealing with systems where you&#39;d have multiple backend processors for major external functions, and you&#39;d load balance which provider was used. Some might have more favourable pricing, and be a preferred partner, while others might be potential future preferred partners being tried out (see how many failures you get from them, compared with the current preferred partner).It seems that, if this was possible to implement (card tokenization obviously being an issue here), you could have multiple independent backend providers implementing the Stripe API as a provider, and you load balance across them.Just like how you could use another S3 API provider for storage if one is giving you hassle, or not offering satisfactory performance or support. Sure, you have migration work to do, but having the same API and underlying properties should speed things up and let you get new transactions onto the new storage ASAP.ACME is like this for SSL - there&#39;s now multiple CAs implementing the one API. Could we get there for payments too?"</p>

I knew I was gay at the time and wouldn&#39;t come out until I was 18 or so, but my life just got a lot easier when I removed religion completely. I also recall discovering increased moral agency -- as a Christian I had been taught I could simply confess whatever and it would be forgiven (an idea I found laughable), and that the objective basis for making moral judgements comes directly from god (another idea I found laughable). As an atheist I was suddenly responsible for making my own moral judgements and conclusions (I had to decide upon my own objective basis for making moral judgements), and forgiveness was something I had to work towards myself (as in I had to forgive myself for things, which is not easy, but is incredibly rewarding) versus simply getting it for free from some nonexistent deity. All in all, was an incredibly positive change in my life, and I do believe there can be a weird sort of spirituality to 100% atheism that people don&#39;t really acknowledge."</p>

My normal day consists of feeding them, bathing them, calming tantrums, losing my temper, getting bitter at my lack of time for hobbies, and growing resentful of my lack of time for reading the Bible, praying, etc.But then I remember that this is a true dying to self. Not only a dying to self, but a dying to the world too as each of these sacrifices, failures, and victories occur hidden away from the world. Thus I commend myself to this daily humbling, this emptying, and also trust myself to the daily prayer of the monks, whose prayer and sacrifice are also hidden from the world and whose labors I suspect are also just as arduous, frustrating, and challenging at times.&gt; For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find i"</p>

Part of the personal prayer time includes seeking direction on who I might help that day. Throughout the day I try to take little breaks for a brief prayer, longer if I&#39;m stuck on a programming bug whose solution eludes me and for which I need extra inspiration. Also I try to go on a daily walk to appreciate nature and to recognize blessings in my life. Each meal includes a prayer of thanks. Before bed there&#39;s a brief family scripture study and prayer, then a prayer with my wife, then a personal prayer to round out the day where I try to reflect on how things went and what I hope to do better tomorrow."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Employees not succeeding at disconnecting from work is often unintentional, and caused by subtle, pernicious effects of middle managers simply existing and following basic incentives (such as &#34;my boss just sent me an email after dinner, guess I should act/forward it along&#34;).Forcing companies to write down their policy on this seems like a pretty good idea, because it forces HR to actually decide how they want their employees to be treated, and enables middle managers to be held accountable for their actions along this axis."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"PSA: In a lot of country, non-competes agreement are illegal, at least in the form they usually take. In many jurisdiction,  non-compete will only apply when specific condition are met. For example, in France[0], all non-compete have to have :- a &#34;reasonable&#34; time limit- a specific geographic region (i.e: only in France, U.E, etc...) -&gt; this is very often omitted, and &#34;the whole world&#34; is not valid.- The non-competition has to be for a specific activity. This is often not understood and instead you find something like &#34;not work for our competitor&#34; or &#34;not work for a company in this field&#34;. This is not specific enough and will be thrown out in court.- There has to be a financial compensation.Despite this, almost all the company that I worked for in France had non-applicable non-competes agreement in their contract. None of them offered a financial compensation and none had a specific region.As far as I know, this is not a France-only thing, and non-competes creeps in almost any employment contract in the world, especially in the tech field. Learn your rights.[0] https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F1910"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reading the text, they didn’t actually create a right to disconnect from work. They only require employers to write down their policy and share it with employees:&gt; The legislation offers no guidance as to what must be included in the policy, and simply provides that the policy must include &#34;such information as may be prescribed.&#34; This was apparently intentional as noted in the legislative summary in an effort to offer employers flexibility to develop a policy appropriate to its operational needs.So unless I’m missing something, a company can write down “Employees must be available as needed” or something equally vague and they comply with the policy.In practice I would expect most employers to write a lot of vague wording about how employees aren’t required to be active online in their off hours, but they’ll leave the door open for emergency communications as needed. No sane company is going to write down a legally binding policy that nobody is going to contact anybody else at certain times. Imagine how easy it would be for a manager to break such a restriction by accidentally tagging an employee name in Slack at the wrong time of day, for example.The “right to disconnect” seems largely symbolic.On the other hand, banning non-competes is a big deal. They are effectively banned in my location (and several other states in the United States) and it’s great to not worry about it at all."</p>

I can mint an NFT saying the OP owns a bunch of Ubisoft games and give it to him, but his account will still be closed. Ubisoft could mint an NFT saying he owns a bunch of games and give it to him, but his account will still be closed. (He probably still has the receipts from when he bought the games in his inbox somewhere, but of course, his account is still closed.)We can store whatever records we like in a fancy distributed database, but his account will still be closed. The only fix here is Ubisoft needs to not close peoples accounts.Somewhat amusingly Ubisoft is in the process of launching an NFT system (https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/12/ubisofts-first-nft-pl...) and as anyone paying attention would no doubt expect, it doesn&#39;t solve anything related to this; up to an including the fact that if you get banned you...lose your NFTs.There is no technological problem to solve here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey, great project - the more competition in this space the better. To be honest, at the moment the algorithm doesn&#39;t return any sensible results for anything (at least that I can find), but I hope that you can find a way past this as it&#39;s a great place to have a project.I&#39;ve included some search terms below that I&#39;ve tried - I&#39;ve not cherrypicked these and believe they are indicative of current performance. Some of these might be the size of the index - however I suspect it&#39;s actually how the search is being parsed/ranked (in particular I think the top two examples show that).&gt; Search &#34;best car brands&#34;Expected: Car ReviewsReturns a page showing the best mobile phone brands.then...&gt; Then searching &#34;Best Mobile Phone&#34;Expected: The article from the search above.Returns a gizmodo page showing the best apps to buy...  &#34;App Deals: Discounted iOS iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows Phone Apps&#34;&gt; Searching &#34;What is a test?&#34;Expected result: Some page describing what a test is, maybe wikipedia?Returns &#34;Test could confirm if Brad Pitt does suffer from face blindness&#34;&gt; Searching &#34;Duck Duck Go&#34;Expected result: DDG.comReturns &#34;There be dragons?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; We plan to start work on a distributed crawler, probably implemented as a browser extension that can be installed by volunteers.Is there a concern that volunteers could manipulate results through their crawler?You already mentioned distributed search engines have their own set of issues. I&#39;m wondering if a simple centralised non-profit fund a la wikipedia could work better to fund crawling without these concerns. One anecdote: Personally I would not install a crawler extensions, not because I don&#39;t want to help, but because my internet connection is pitifully slow. I&#39;d rather donate a small sum that would go way further in a datacenter... although I realise the broader community might be the other way around.[edit]Unless, the crawler was clever enough to merely feed off the sites i&#39;m already visiting and use minimal upload bandwidth. The only concern then would be privacy. oh the irony, but trust goes a long way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A laudable effort. Two questions:1. What is the rationale behind choosing Python as a implementation language? Performance and efficiency are paramount in keeping operational costs low and ensuring a good user experience even if the search engine will be used by many users. I guess Python is not the best choice for this, compared to C, Rust or Java.2. What is the rationale behind implementing a search engine from scratch versus using existing Open Source search engine libraries like Apache Lucene, Apache Solr and Apache Nutch (crawler)?"</p>

Don&#39;t just throw data into a black hole for years.2. Make sure recording the data is as easy and comfortable as possible.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using Daylio [0] for the last 2 years to track my mood and activities. It&#39;s less comprehensive than the system described here but much simpler to implement. It lets you set up a reminder with a mood selector, and you then select the activities you have accomplished. The activities are completely configurable. I&#39;ve started by tracking just a few habits and I&#39;ve added more along the way.I can&#39;t praise this app enough. Main pros:- all your data is stored locally not in the cloud, but you can easily back it up on Google Drive- it lets you export your data anytime- It comes with nice dashboards, weekly, monthly and yearly reviews. It let&#39;s you see the impact of each activity on your mood. It really gave me some interesting insights on my mood patterns.My only complaint really is that the only numeric value you can track is your mood, everything else is yes or no.A year or so ago, I&#39;ve also started using Clockify [1] to track the time I spent on each activity. Again, I don&#39;t track everything, only a few habits I want to improve on. It has a mobile and desktop app. The UI could be improved but all the features I need are free, and most importantly data export.It&#39;s the perfect time of year to set up a tracking system. My recommendation is start small. Track only a couple of activities first and add more as you build the habit.[0]: https://daylio.net/[1]: https://clockify.me/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I lead the Microsoft Open Source Programs Office team. I&#39;m sorry this happened.We have merged a pull request that restored the correct LICENSE file and copyright, and are in touch with the upstream author Leśny Rumcajs who emailed us this morning. We&#39;ll look to revert the entire commit that our bot made, too, since it updated the README with a boilerplate getting started guide.The bug was caused by a bot that was designed to commit template files in new repositories. It&#39;s code that I wrote to try to prevent other problems we have had with releasing projects in the past. It&#39;s not supposed to run on forks.I&#39;m going to make sure that we sit down and audit all of our forked repositories and revert similar changes to any other projects.We have a lot of process around forking, and have had to put controls in place to make sure that people are aware of that guidance. Starting a few years ago, we even &#34;lock&#34; forks to enforce our process. We prefer that people fork projects into their individual GitHub accounts, instead of our organization, to encourage that they participate with the upstream project. In this situation, a team got approval to fork the repository, but hasn&#39;t yet gotten started.To be as open as I can, I&#39;d like to point to the bug:- The templates we apply on new repositories live at https://github.com/microsoft/repo-templates- The bug seems to be at this line of the new repository workflow: https://github.com/microsoft/opensource-management-portal/bl...- The system we have in place even tries to educate our engineers with this log message (https://github.com/microsoft/opensource-management-portal/bl...): &#34;this.log.push({ message: `Repository ${subMessage}, template files will not be committed. Please check the LICENSE and other files to understand existing obligations.` });&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The attitude in these threads always boggles my mind.  When YOU, your teammates or someone else you know makes a mistake, then it’s just a mistake.     But when someone at Microsoft makes a mistake it’s because Microsoft is evil and by extension so is the person who offended.“It’s a big company”, you say.  They should have a process!  And I’m sad to say, they do/will have a process exactly because of this attitude.  Then, everyone wonders why it takes forever to fix that bug they’re furious about or why features are slow to come.Full disclosure: I work for MS, though have nothing to do with this.  It’s a huge company. I know hundreds of people and most of them are upstanding and try to do the right thing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think that just because some &#34;bot&#34; did this Microsoft is to be excused. Someone decided that using a piece of software to automatically alter license files. This is a genuinely stupid idea. And they already fucked up in the same way with the CUPS project. Will they learn without someone taking them to court over this? I don&#39;t think so."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thank you for this gesture. 
I lost almost everything. Job, 7-year relationship, my mental health.Feeling that I&#39;m not only alone but inadequate to have a life like anybody else.I&#39;m still alive, so there&#39;s that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thank you for this post, I spent the majority of Christmas &#39;19 and &#39;20 alone and it was in the middle of a very challenging time of my life. I&#39;m very young and grateful for the friends and others that included me in their holiday celebrations, and having time alone to reflect and come to the realization that Christmas doesn&#39;t come from having family to share it with.While most traditional Christmas stories and many people focus on celebrating children, love and family, material goods, etc it&#39;s also about looking on the bright side of life, counting your blessings, and carrying on traditions. A happy Christmas is a choice, and my advice to all who are alone today is this: Build your own traditions, buy yourself something and wrap it up nice, decorate a tree, make gingerbread houses, or cook a meal you really like, whatever appeals to you.I&#39;ll leave you with the last line from How the Grinch Stole Christmas and a link to an In Our Time episode about (A Christmas Carol)[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0012fl5]:&#34;Welcome Christmas, bring your cheer. Cheer to all Who&#39;s far and near Christmas day is in our grasp, so long as we have hands to clasp. Christmas day will always be, just as long as we have we. Welcome Christmas while we stand, heart to heart and hand in hand.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This year, after a tumultuous breakup (that quite literally plunged me into my deepest crisis to day), I’m practicing being alone. Mostly because what lead to said breakup in the first place, was me being a relationship-addict, which at this point in my self-awareness journey I understand to be a transgenerational issue. Thus being with family does not help at all (even though I did my fair share of being with them yesterday). As opposed to OP, I’m less than happy about the whole thing understandably.What helps is hiking, I guess, trying to get a grip on whether doing it alone or with others helps more.I guess this is close to being rock bottom for me at this point, hope you guys feel at least a tiny bit ok."</p>

This person not only posts in the evenings, weekends, and sometimes into the graveyard shift, but does so in a cloying, overeager, performative kind of way.&#34;while that job was running I took the opportunity to go learn this new skill!&#34;&#34;I finished this step of the process.

I don&#39;t want work conversations to stretch into nonworking hours. I don&#39;t want this to become part of the culture in my team or company.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are so many super cool aspects to this!- it&#39;s always fun when a new equation or formula is discovered, doubly so when it is very practical- actually really easy to wrap your head around it- seems very computationally efficient. Basically boils down to sorts and distance- not limited to strict numeric fields ( integers and reals). Anything with an ordering defined can act as your Xs/Ys: characters, words, complex/vectors (under magnitude). I think you could even apply it recursively to divide and conquer high dimensional datasets.- looks useful in both LTI and non stationary signal analysis- possible use cases: exoplanet search, cosmology in general, ecology, climate, cryptanalysis, medicine, neuroscience, and of course, someone will find a way to win (more likely lose) money on stonks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"About 14 years ago, at my first job, I worked with a colleague[1] who introduced me to the wonderful world of open source: the culture, the philosophy, how to submit patches to open source projects, etc. He also introduced me to Debian GNU/Linux which I use actively to this day.One day, he began working on certain audio/video encoding problems that needed to be solved for our project. He chose FFmpeg as the primary tool around which he began building his solution. After having spent several days with FFmpeg, figuring out and documenting various ways of using FFmpeg to solve all our audio/video encoding problems, one day, when we went out for lunch, he declared to the team,&#34;FFmpeg is awesome! If you give me a shoe, I will turn it into a video file!&#34;[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=topa"</p>

It&#39;s great for simple media processing jobs (builds a graph, runs the graph). A build of &#34;FFMPEG&#34; includes that media processing framework plus dozens of open source libraries (filters) that do the actual work (x265, x265, libav, etc).&gt;So &#34;FFMPEG&#34; gets a lot of well deserved credit (it&#39;s the framework that lots of applications and well-known services run), but the core FFMPEG is probably a tiny fraction of the development man-hours in a build of FFMPEG. It&#39;s all the linked libraries that make it useful.It is also worth stating this is from 2020.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There’s a lot of good stuff in here, things I’ve used in my personal life to great effect.The really important thing here (that’s hinted at towards the end) is moderation.Do some of these things. A little at a time. Find what works and what doesn’t.Saying the truth no matter what the cost is extremely dangerous advice to follow literally.Pick battles you can win. Know when saying the truth matters and when it doesn’t. Know when your “truth” is just another opinion no one around you at that moment agrees with.As my dad always told me, “you can be dead right.”Life is too short to be miserable trying to obtain someone else’s goals. It is too short to optimize everything. Remember that happiness in the moment matters. (But not at the expense of the future.)You’ll never find me reading a book I don’t like or skipping using GPS, because things cause more stress than benefit.Having a car break down and having a magical moment because of it? Do the opposite. Actively seek those moments by finding people to help instead of waiting for the moment to happen.If I have any advice to add, it is be honest and be kind. Fight when you need to fight, make peace when you don’t. You don’t need to fix everything, just make the world better by being in it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Liked most of this except #1&gt; Discovering and living out a sense of calling — a personal vocation, or something you are uniquely meant to do — is the ultimate way to cut through the mimetic noise of the world and begin to shape both a moral and a vocational compass.There are on the order of 7 billion human beings on earth. We don&#39;t all have a personal vocation or something we are uniquely meant to do. One of the keys to leading a happy and fulfilled life is being able to be content to live within the bounds that most of us operate in. Most of us are not uniquely gifted, not particularly special, not here to do one thing in this world. But we can be kind, be helpful, try to do as little damage to other people and the world as we can, to find value in things that last and do not cost the world very much, to enjoy our lives regardless of what we do for a living, not because of it.It may be a gift from the Renaissance to believe in individuality in the way that #1 clearly does, but it&#39;s a gift that doesn&#39;t scale to huge populations (it may not even have been right with much smaller ones). It&#39;s wonderful to live in a society that allows for individual self-discovery and self-expression, but we should not blind us to the reality that almost all of us are not on a unique, singular mission."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"But ads in real life do not prevent me from going on about my day. There is no analogy to interstitial pages with ads like in Forbes some time ago with the button Continue to your article: it would be infuriating if you had to view an ad before being able to use the subway ticketing system. You also don’t have ads on at the airport timetable screen. You don’t have pinkertons following you to learn your habits and show you “relevant” ads. If you walk into a grocery store wearing sunglasses, the clerk will not stand in front of you and say “I am sorry, please remove your shades before continuing because ads support our store and you need to see them.”But yes, unhealthy amount of advertising IRL should be limited as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I cycle to work on an ebike. About 25 km each way. One of the major issues is the lack of proper infrastructure and awful attitude by drivers, in particular service drivers.Advertisement company vans are a prime example. There are rolling advertisement posters  in most bus stop shelters. These drivers will park up on the footpath blocking pedestrians and those using the bus to update the advertisements, often in the mornings during rush hour. They will park on the cycle lanes and force cyclists out into fast moving and unaccommodating aggressive traffic.The same goes for delivery drivers. Legally they are permitted on double yellow ‘no parking’ lines on the street but the perception is no not hinder car traffic so they park up on the footpath instead.During the pandemic there was a lot of temporary work on cycling infrastructure, mostly lazy efforts such as painted cycle lanes and plastic bollards. These drivers simply drive over the bollards or if wide enough down the protected lane. If you challenge them they are verbally abusive.The attitude of all persons in a mechanically propelled vehicle is that this is not their fault. They are just doing their job. Their companies trot out the tired line that they take safety seriously bla bla bla…So in regards physical advertisement is public space, for me this is a symptom of a wider problem of perceptions of ownership of our cities public space. We forget that cities are for people. We let cars dominate the majority of the available space. We let oversized vehicles make deliveries in medieval city streets. We use cars for short inappropriately short journeys such as for bringing our kids to school, often because it’s too dangerous to let them walk or cycle because there are too many cars.We need to start treating our cities like parks with a focus people and figure out ways to remove ICE powered vehicles and limit the space all vehicles occupy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Advertising as it is done presently has at least three faults, which is just as much a fault with the ethics of society for allowing this to go on:- adverts seeks to hijack your attention away from whatever you were doing, which is a mental burden resulting diminished performance (in the case of a work environment), is downright dangerous in the case of traffic environments and lessens the enjoyment in the case of leisure activities.- there is little to no ethical restriction on content; the advert that gets displayed is likely not that of the best product: it is the one whose owner paid the most money, and the ad that gets the most traction is the one that tells the best story, so perfused with lies by omission and other forms of deceit that we don&#39;t even notice any more.- the ubiquity of ads causes an perpetual escalation of the struggle for  attention, to the extent that we might credibly expect to get ads implanted in our brains eventually if we don&#39;t say enough is enough.The solution seems simple enough to me: we need to establish a code of conduct for advertisers which at the core means that they may no longer shove ads down our throats at every junction; instead adverts should be freely displayed in separate spaces (like a dedicated page on each website) where people voluntarily could look for products and services that they need (or just to browse), much like the ad pages in newspapers of days now long gone by.All we need is a mechanism that promotes this behavior, and sanctions breaches."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ruby now has “punning.”&gt; Values in Hash literals and keyword arguments can be omitted. [Feature #14579]&gt; {x:, y:} is a syntax sugar of {x: x, y: y}.&gt; foo(x:, y:) is a syntax sugar of foo(x: x, y: y).This is going to be controversial and take some getting used to, but I think eventually everyone will love it. It’s not an easy syntax to learn - I remember when this came to JS it took a while to get my head around all the different ways this shorthand was used in the wild.It’s hard to come up with new syntax that can peacefully coexist with the established language. I think in hindsight it would have been helpful for Ruby if it had done something like square braces instead of brackets for hash literals, or not allowed brackets for blocks. The most ambiguous syntax all involves hash literals vs blocks… this adds to that cognitive load.But typing out a long hash literal just to capture a bunch of local variables or methods is so common, and the duplication is quite annoying, so on the whole I’m glad this was added and am sure I’ll use it a lot :)"</p>

The gravity well of the closer cluster acts as a giant lense, acting as an additional optical element to the telescope propelling us even further into the distant past.As we watched the launch I asked her what James Web means to astronomy.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It’s surprising and disappointing to me that this—titled “ADHD Accommodations Guide”—buries accommodation recommendations under sub-links and all of the remaining content is advice for, presumably, those of us with ADHD who are trying to work around lack of accommodations.That said, there’s plenty of good advice even if it’s a little inconsistent. It’s also fascinating how much the social part overlaps with challenges faced by Autistic people[1].For ADHD folks who find some of the advice on multitasking/focus in meetings wanting: it’s absolutely okay to stim (perform some stimulating, often repetitive action) when you find your ability to stay focused isn’t what you need or what’s expected. I have a reputation for spending most of my time in meetings playing minesweeper. It’s not because I’m not engaged, it’s because it helps me stay engaged. I happily stop or mute my mic if the clicking sound is disruptive, but otherwise I’ve continually established with teammates and even clients that having that part of my focus on something mostly mechanical helps me stay in the conversation and productive.1: Which I increasingly feel confident in the idea that there’s no meaningful distinction and ADHD should/likely eventually will be considered part of the spectrum, but that’s not why I’m commenting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a useful post, thank you.I have only recently become aware of what it means to try to work with someone who has ADHD. I’d heard of ADHD but I didn’t know what it was or what the implications were.Then, a project went terribly terribly wrong. I tried to make sense of it through empathic modelling of my colleagues circumstances, but this only made it worse. I was baffled by that, which is when I realised I needed more information about ADHD, because just placing myself in my colleagues shoes didn’t help when we were using very different thought processes.Without a model of ADHD thought processes my attempts at empathy were counter-productive.I’d try to put myself in my colleagues position in order to understand my colleagues feelings but because we have different thought processes this didn’t work at all.I think I’m seeing the limitations of empathy for the first time. Until I have a better working understanding of ADHD, articles like this with practical tips are my best guide."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing that most (if not all) people who have ADHD want is to be normal. This works against them, similar to other people with disabilities, in that asking for accomodations feels like admitting defeat. Like you will never make progress in your lifelong struggle. Like you have an incurable disease.While it&#39;s cool that workplaces can make such accomodations if requested, it would just be better for fucking everyone if these were available to everyone. That&#39;s the real problem with being disabled: you&#39;re treated abnormally.Sure, there will always be exceptions, but just recognize humans are not fungible, and be kind. Don&#39;t make folks lives harder than they already are."</p>

Many days, it&#39;s the first thing I open in the morning and/or the last at night, and I sure am thankful that amid the firestorm of superficial engagement maximization platforms, there&#39;s at least one site that consistently leaves me feeling more informed, enlightened, and rational. Happy Holidays, HN!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I would really say that &#34;running your own email&#34; is a set of things that can be done independently:- Getting your own domain and using a provider such as fastmail or proton is a first step that gives you lots of security fom arbitrary. Because you own the doorstep, you can change provider without having to inform all your contacts of the move. You&#39;re also more secure from unilateral moves from your provider.-Hosting your own mail server means that you are responsible for the persistence of your mail. It&#39;s a nice artisanal thing to do, and you may be satisfied to know that no one is reading your mail.-Sending your mail yourself is the real hard part, because you need a stable IP that is accepted as a legitimate mail sender. Moreover, you need to monitor this property in the long term. Every mail server has their own way to choose who is a legitimate mail sender, and it&#39;s an ongoing pain to check that.You&#39;re not forced to go all the way, you can simply pick a domain to secure the frontdoor, or you can host your mail server without sending mail by yourself, etc. You can also self-host, and change your mind later without much impact.I personally would incite everyone to do at least #1 for safety reasons, #2 if you want to fiddle with the system to know how it works, and to avoid #3."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Someone should try &#34;artisanal email server&#34; using cloudron or yunohost !
the bigger problem is that &#34;authoritative&#34; email monopolies such as Gmail, 365 and the other big ones arbitrarily define and impose what is a legit email server or not and even with better score than gmail an &#34;artisanal&#34; email server can suffer from being classified into spam by the big tech players just because they can and will do anything to maintain their monopoly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yeah I stopped running my own. I kept getting blocked by Microsoft in particular (mainly consumer recipients at live.com and outlook.com, strange enough not corporate O365 users!). I&#39;m 100% sure I did not send any spam, the only emails going to those addresses were legit from a family member. DMARC and SPF were all set perfectly, relays blocked, I was not on any spamlist and I never have been either.Literally every month I got blocked again because my server did not have enough reputation. Kept logging tickets to get it unblocked and then a month later it was back. One time I did manage to get a personal email back from a guy in India. Said that it was because my mailserver did not send enough legitimate mail for their algorithm to trust it.So the lack of spam is not enough anymore to be blocked. You actually have to send a load of legit traffic to build up &#39;reputation&#39;. Now just being a small time sender is a problem. This way the big players can just carve out a bigger market for themselves. They basically break the decentralised concept of email by doing this.In the end I moved to O365, which felt bad because I didn&#39;t want to reward them for their behaviour. But we moved to it at work too and I wanted an instance with full admin rights to explore. My contract is up next year so I may change then if I can find a party that does it well and ideally cheaper."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is something I&#39;ve always wanted for virtual textbooks. A single .html file with all the JS, CSS, images as inline data blobs, etc. For most physics, math, CS, etc books, this should be possible. It would make it trivial to download the book for offline use and share it with others. Other than the raster images, the entire content of these types of books would probably fit in a couple MB of text. The use of #anchors or other smart URL manipulation would also make it easy to share internal hyperlinks if you want to tell a friend to look at chapter/section #foo_bar of the book."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well, TiddlyWiki[1] has been going it for 17(!) years. It&#39;s a very mature, polished, and extensible engine for wikis, blogs, and personal knwledge bases.The entire thing (including the editor!) is a single .html file. By default, even images are embedded.For my ADHD Wiki[2], a resource that talks about ADHD with a copious amounts of relatable memes intertwined with the text, I chose to just use images in the same directory instead of embedding them; so you might need to do some work to download that page (I think File -&gt; Save as.. can give you a readable static version on some browsers).Anyway, somewhat surprising that people are stumbling into how much you can do with just one well-crafted .html file. Look ma, no node.js, no (no)SQL database, no nothing except for one file for one website (and that file isn&#39;t even that large, given what TiddlyWiki allows you to do).TiddlyWiki can be run on node.js, but I don&#39;t see much reason to. If I want to make changes, I use the built-in editor, and then the &#34;Save...&#34; button generates me the .html of the updated version. Save it over the old one, upload over ftp, done. No deployment process to speak of.And, at that, the feature set rivals (and, at times, exceeds) that of, say, Wikipedia.(And for math nerds: it supports LaTeX via a KaTeX plugin. Maybe you can&#39;t copy-paste your entire thesis, but it&#39;s pretty damn close to real-time full-featured LaTeX).[1]https://tiddlywiki.com/[2]https://romankogan.net/adhd"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"“How to change your mind” by Michael Pollen.I read a lot of books, and this is one that caused a change in my life. The succinct summary is that psychedelics are misunderstood and there is more and more research showing their potential, especially in the treatment of trauma.I had a difficult childhood. It’s something I still struggle with personal interactions because of this, even after years of therapy. After reading Michael Pollen’s book I thought this might be something that could move the needle on my day-to-day quality of life.I found a shaman and did an 8 hour blindfolded mushroom trip. Similar to what’s outlined in the book. Previously I’ve never done anything more than weed occasionally.It had a profound impact on me. The way I describe it is like jumping off a diving board into a deep dark pool, and the pool is you. Then spending hours there.I don’t know if I’d do it again but I learnt a lot about myself. I won’t proselytize here either, because the research is still early. There’s also risk because you put a lot of trust in someone who’s there with you while you’re high. But I do recommend at least reading the book."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Dispossessed, by Ursula K. Le Guin.It identified so many of the &#34;edges&#34; of society and how I think about and interact with the world, on a daily basis.Without a doubt one of the best books I&#39;ve ever read. Maybe even the best.The only other book that came close this year was Robert Sapolsky&#39;s A Primate&#39;s Memoir."</p>

They&#39;re thoroughly strange fantasy books, oddly written and frequently chewy reads. They have an interest in politics and metaphysics; but they also have magical railguns, the sorcerous application of FOOF [1], and a five-ton battle-sheep named Eustace.The first book is fairly straightforward: A quiet backwater of the Commonweal is under threat, and its only defense is an understrength territorial battalion, a handful of experimental artillery pieces, and three of the mightiest sorcerers of the age.Then the second book (A Succession of Bad Days) isn&#39;t at all about the military, and is more like the weirdest going-to-sorcery-school book I&#39;ve ever read. It also has an extended, detailed section on using sorcery in canal construction. If you ever wanted a book about the best ways to use magic in the service of civil engineering, this series is your jam.These books really aren&#39;t for everyone, but I kind of love them, and they aren&#39;t widely known, so I&#39;ll always take an opportunity to shill them.[1] https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/things-i-won-t-wor..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Charlatans begone.  2x is a fashion statement and Ive been learning at a much faster rate for quite some time.The real answer to speed learning, is to watch the video at 200x, in a concrete room buried ten meters deep, with your nose pressed pensively to a 50&#34; flatscreen surrounded by a frigid black ocean of PA speakers and amplifiers.  Ive found that in five to seven hours, Ive fully comprehended the video as it &#34;repeats twice&#34;, ad infinitum.now, the volume is critical as it is not to concede 110db at any time.  this promotes learning at 200x the volume of the original video.  At the end of your learning session it is important to remain unclothed, as this promotes the knowledge to absorb into your body fastest whilst the room leaves you in inscrutable darkness, to succor a distant memory of the learning materials interdisciplinary themes and objectives.Once youve climbed from the pit --and washed the learning jelly from yourself--  then you will have attained full and complete knowledge of how to properly tie a tie, or water a houseplant, or whatever you should need to learn.  The pit will remain there for you should you ever dare to utter another question in wonderment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m a bit puzzled by the recurring apparition of articles about learning faster on HN.I don’t think I have suffered from the speed at which material covers a subject since I left school. Finding interesting material, properly structured with a good balance of introductory and in depth coverage and giving solid insight into a topic remains challenging — it already was when I was a student to be fair. Good teaching ressources are the exception rather than the norm. Finding the time to properly conceptualise and deeply think about what I’m trying to learn has been challenging. But the speed at which I can consume teaching material is not something I remember being bothered by this past decade. Thinking about it more often than not I wish I could actually go slower rather than faster.I’m curious about how the experience of others commenters differ here as it’s obviously a topic of interest to some in this community."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"(Note: full study PDF is on researchgate)I would take this with a giant grain of salt:1.)  N is in the hundreds of students, all with similar backgrounds - likely a highly specific population.  It may not generalize well.2.)  The videos were pretty short: 3-15 minutes long.3.)  The overall effect size is pretty miniscule - it would make little practical difference.4.)  The video topics were roman history and real estate appraisals.It will be interesting to see if this generalizes (to longer durations, more technical topics, more diverse population, etc.), but given the above I wouldn&#39;t change any personal habits based on this study."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Starting at Win7 the telemetry and invasive advertising ramped up to the point where I don&#39;t feel I can customize the Desktop to what I want without heavy tweaking.And if that amount of tweaking is necessary why not go Linux instead.So got rid of my Win10 install, went with KDE Neon+Steam. And now I wonder what took me so long.I haven&#39;t tested my entire Steam library yet but my top 10 games run perfectly, some times with some changes to the Proton version but beyond that even workshop mods are available.I am seriously impressed and can&#39;t imagine myself going back at all.If only Adobe would release their software in Linux, then, I could ditch MacOS too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My daily driver is Ubuntu 20.04, and I stopped dual booting with Windows back in December 2019, which up to that point had been the way I did all of my gaming.I haven&#39;t looked back since.Sure, there have been some games that haven&#39;t worked. Some of those just needed some tweaking, and for some I just waited a bit until Proton caught up. For the rest that still don&#39;t work, I am content with just shelving until such time that they work.I have been consistently surprised at what games actually work through Proton. For instance I played Titanfall 2 &amp; Battlefield 1 without any issues this year. On Linux.I probably spend around 200$ each year on video games, and this initiative by Valve will be the sole reason I will continue to do so (and not having to run a Windows instance in my home)."</p>

Black officers said that sentiment reveals a misunderstanding of why the union exists: It isn’t to win special rights for Black officers, they said. It’s to demand they be treated equally.&#34;This passage should have been earlier in the report. Before, the report emanated a stench of trying too hard to find racism behind every rock.Instead, the reporter later describes a story of a bureaucractic racket - primarily driven by state powers and labor, to promote corruption &amp; nepotism, which has disproportionately impacted black officers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was one of the developers on this game in the 90s:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lubyi79e6SYIt was meant to be 100% 2D, and the programming and art went down that path for a few months before it was realized that there just wasn&#39;t enough RAM on PCs of the time to store all the possible sprites for the characters in every rotation.  The numbers get out of hand very quickly when you have four main characters, each of which can walk in 8 or 16 directions, can also run, walk up stairs, climb ladders, crawl, fire one of 20 different guns etc. The isometric backgrounds are all sheets of 2D tiles, laid out just like in Street Fighter and every other sprite based game.So, several months into development it was decided to change all the characters to 3D to save RAM. I switched the entire game over in two weeks, including creating all the tooling to convert from 3D Studio to.. whatever the fuck, because there were no rules in those days. When that game was started there were almost no 3D accelerators, and I don&#39;t remember if you needed specific SDK for them. I seem to remember our game couldn&#39;t use them, perhaps because of the way the 3D and 2D were composited in the frame, which was very unusual - most games were either 2D or 3D, not a combination.Are there any easter eggs hidden in the sprites for SFII? There were various ones in Abomination, mainly written in the graffiti around the cities.And then there are ones like this (TFT) that we can&#39;t talk about:

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The key to this solution isn’t really the .txt file or the formatting.It’s the ritual. Any productivity system can be made to work once it becomes a habit and therefore your default action.I think .txt files or Org mode are attractive to devs because they feel like something we’d be doing anyway during our day. the same system will work with a paper journal or even a fresh piece of paper every morning if, and only if, it can be integrated into your natural daily workflow as an automatic habit. I personally found that paper is better for me because I get to it before unlocking my computer and being confronted with work and communications and notifications that compete with it. However, I have a lot of peers who couldn’t hang on to a paper journal or TODO list during the day if they tried, so digital formats win.The real key is to make it a habit and learn to stick with it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve always kept a text file or spreadsheet of things to do, priorities, etc... My biggest problem isn&#39;t keeping a list and getting organized, it&#39;s remembering to look at my list. I tend to space out for days working on a problem and forget to look at my list.I&#39;ve experienced a big productivity boost by using the desktop background of my 43&#34; monitor as a whiteboard (blackboard actually). I have an jpg the size of my monitor that I jot things down on as text on the image. I can store meaningful small images the trigger my memory to do something. I&#39;ve become so used to visually thinking about what I&#39;m doing that I switched my text file todo list to markdown so I could store images in it.It&#39;s surprisingly quick to keep my large jpg open in paint and jot or paste things to it and then reset it as the desktop background. I learned later this is called a &#34;vision board&#34;Still, I&#39;m so bad at spacing out that I need more than looking at my vision board monitor all day, so I use the Windows system scheduler to bring up a daily, weekly and monthly html file that reminds me to do things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ah, the OBTF or &#34;One big text file&#34; meme was making rounds 10-15 years ago. I ditched mine out of curiosity for other systems -- but I&#39;m still surprised how well it actually worked. Calendar, links, drafts of stuff I wrote -- it was all there. I was kind of proud when, at one point, my file (brain.txt) reached 1 MB.I&#39;ll just share some of those old links for new kids on the OBTF block.Probably one of the discussion starters in 2005: https://web.archive.org/web/20060101001857/http://www.oreill...Which apparently got inspiration from this:
https://craphound.com/lifehacks2.txtAnd was passionately discussed by the 43 Folders crowd:

https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/1508/zettelkasten-v...I&#39;ve tried to set up a Zettelkasten many times, but in practice, loosely structured flat files, maybe utilizing the OS&#39; file system (folders) and occasional ad-hoc hierarchies, still beats everything else for me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I guess taking some risks as I am not really authorized to use social media, but at AWS there is a sauron like focus on not letting internal engineers view customer data.  On my service we don&#39;t even have tools to do it and the security controls are very tight and getting tighter all the time.  It&#39;s a big fucking deal, if not the biggest fucking deal, besides KTLO.Posting to get ahead of some of the comment here on security posture."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Okay, opinions up front: I don&#39;t think this is worthy of &#34;declaring a security incident. Having some experience working behind the scenes, just because this policy was changes this way doesn&#39;t mean &#34;All AWS Support personnel had unrequited access to your S3 objects.&#34; To me, this reads as Twitter inflammatory nonsense. Here&#39;s why:* KMS Encrypted objects would not be accessible because the support personnel would need permission policies that grant `kms:decrypot` permissions to encrypted objects. The only way this could wind up happening is if you are granting the AWS Support principal access in the KMS Key Policy.* Objects with a default-deny bucket policy could not have been circumvented with the support team&#39;s escalated privilege. So if you have a policy that looks something like this, that data was not exposed:{  &#34;Action&#34;: &#34;Deny&#34;,

  &#34;NotPrincipal&#34;: [...]

}* Internal Checks. AWS has a lot of protections and checks in place to prevent their support personnel from accessing metadata about S3 objects. They don&#39;t have tools to fetch the actual objects unless your really high up the food-chain. Think like, people with a legal or security related reason to need to review data.Nevertheless, I&#39;ll share some nuggets of wisdom I&#39;ve accrued over the years, in a hopes to save y&#39;all some time:If you have an NDA with AWS, I&#39;d recommend reaching out to your TAM and asking them about what the potential exposure was; and make sure to ask about the internal access control mechanisms.But everyone who&#39;s concerned and DIDN&#39;T set up data access logging already: 1) Consider turning that on to trace potential disclosures in the future. 2) Open up a case with Premium Support under the CloudTrail, state that you have a security incident and you need to retrieve data events for the time of 2021-12-23 to 2021-12-22. If granted to you, save that sucker in S3 and query it for requests coming from `support.amazonaws.com` in Athena. [0]Hopefully this helps some of y&#39;all.[0] https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/analy..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Such concerns specifically led to my decision of only uploading sensitive data to S3 with client side encryption. Since the aws cli tool only supports server side encryption with keys stored on amazon servers (where the non-default managed keys cost like 1 USD per month), I decided to simply symmetrically encrypt the backup of my syncthing data volume with AES256 using gnupg and only then pushing it to the S3 bucket."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For five years, I ran a network of Twitter accounts promoting local tech events. They were (uncreatively) called the &#34;Tech Events Network&#34; and included ATXTechEvents, DENTechEvents, NYC_TechEvents, and 50+ others that would broadcast local meetups, even supporting basically unknown tech communities like Albuquerque with ABQTechEvents. All received massive traffic, engagement (RTs &amp; likes specifically), and became an active megaphone for their respective communities.. gaining almost 300k followers.More importantly, the meetups and events they tweeted saw attendance rise and more people know about them in general. It was great for everyone and I had hundreds of thank you tweets, emails, and DMs.But Twitter&#39;s repeated, bizarre, and unexplained API limitations hobbled the system more times than I can count. They&#39;d suddenly suspend one for &#34;API abuse&#34;, I&#39;d get it manually reviewed and they&#39;d release it.. only to have 10 suspended the next day. I even started asking followers to tag @TwitterSupport on our behalf and zero progress.After dozens of suspensions, I finally shut it all down. I haven&#39;t come up with a theory beyond Twitter hates tech communities but that feels off.."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A couple of months ago some colleagues and I submitted a very basic request practically begging Twitter for access to users’ follower/following graph on the new API. The use case was super-simple and obvious (allow people to import their followers into a new app) and didn’t involve any sort of data mining or spam or anything.It took days? weeks? to get a generic rejection message from a “no reply” email address. Meanwhile — much irony — A16Z can help apps like Clubhouse get super-access since they were also a huge investor in Twitter.All of this pro- and anti-web3 stuff is a sign that all of these inter-connected webs of egos in our industry are jostling for power in an ecosystem that doesn’t need them very much. Meanwhile, there are lots of people in other verticals who completely missed the boat on the web investment play who are beginning to realize this is their opportunity to jump in and scale their capital alongside the people on the ground. A major investor / operator shakeup is about to take place."</p>

He didn&#39;t.Did he only come to the realization it was the &#34;worst thing&#34; after leaving the positono where he could&#39;ve fixed it?Dorsey&#39;s passing the buck here, both ways: blaming his predecessor for the error, then saddling his successor with the undone hairball task of fixing it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fun fact about SpeedCrunch history, the software descends from an off-hand blog post by Roberto Alsina, a KDE developer, complaining about KCalc usability [1]. Back then developers were often just unthinkingly cloning &#39;skeuomorphic&#39; interfaces like Apple used back then, designing user interfaces that resembled physical objects instead of taking advantage of the opportunities afforded by computers.His blog post elicited several rapid responses from developers taking his PyQt-based mockup and turning it into a &#39;real&#39; application ([2], [3]). One of those was Ariya Hidayat&#39;s &#34;SpeedCrunch&#34;, which has been actively maintained up to the present day. I can&#39;t find Ariya&#39;s original 2004 announcement, I think the original link was http://ariya.pandu.org/blog/archives/2004/10/calculator-feve... but that&#39;s dead now.But it&#39;s really neat to see how this all started from a day or two of hacking on a solution to a simple problem.[1] https://ralsina.me/stories/33.html

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Have to say as a football fan, it&#39;s a scandal that they&#39;re running the world cup in Qatar. A winter world cup pushes the schedules way off what&#39;s normal and traditional. That is of course not the only concern, there&#39;s also stories about dozens of people dying building these stadiums in the desert heat.There&#39;s also a heck of a lot of stories about how Qatar was able to get the world cup in the first place. It seems that FIFA isn&#39;t exactly free of corruption, which is a shame because they&#39;re supposed to be in charge of the world&#39;s favourite sport. Of course there&#39;s no accountability in any way, who even knows who their national FA rep is? I guess that&#39;s one of the perks of running a sport with that much history, people will still feel compelled to watch.One thing that&#39;s positive is that ordinary people are not ignorant about this situation. You&#39;ll find in every FB post about this there&#39;s a load of voices expressing what I&#39;ve just expressed. So whatever the Qataris think they&#39;re buying with this massive outlay, they&#39;re not getting it.On the sporting side it appears they&#39;re making a decent effort of building a home grown team that isn&#39;t going to totally embarrass them, which is quite the challenge."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The tendency by FIFA and especially UEFA to prioritize money for its partners and for its officials above principles and sport has turned me away from organized football. I find it repugnant that when BBC and The Guardian (among others) reported back in 2013 on Qatar’s labor conditions in sweltering heat, the deaths, and what is essentially slavery to build stadiums, it was met by the football community and larger news media with a resounding thud. It wasn’t until the last few years that footballers who had nothing to lose started to speak their minds. It’s honestly disgusting to me to the point where I don’t know when I’ll ever want to watch the World Cup or Champion’s League again.I used to get excited by these events because the sport still seemed to be prioritized and people got genuinely excited by seeing talent rise to the level. I came of age hearing just how good Messi would become after his early appearance for Argentina in 2006 I think. His rise has witnessed the transition to players representing teams and entire brands. It hardly feels like sport but lifestyle, prestige, and entertainment, something Qatar is desperately trying to purchase as their oil money starts to dry up.https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-24394971Maybe there was earlier reporting on this but this was the best I could do on my phone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;In August, Amnesty released a report that documented that at least 15 000 migrant workers had died since Qatar was awarded the World Cup hosting rights in 2010.&#34;If these figures are true, then no matter how &#39;successful&#39; the World Cup 2022 turns out, it will always be tainted by these shameful figures."</p>
