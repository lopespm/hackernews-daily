								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A4 is so ubiquitous around me (Europe) that, no matter its merits or not, it&#39;s really a major PITA when you get documents that are not A4.  They don&#39;t line up nicely with the A4 stuff.  They don&#39;t go gently in the A4 folders / sleeves / pockets / ring binders (files) / etc.Typical offenders in my case are medical bills printed on dot-matrix printers.I don&#39;t even know if there&#39;s perforated continuous stationery/form paper with tractor holes that, once you strip the holes, is A4 sized?  I guess it&#39;s really uncommon if it exists for I don&#39;t ever recall seeing any actually used.Now don&#39;t get me wrong: hearing the song of a dot-matrix printer makes me happy (brings back lots of memories as my first printer was a dot-matrix one) and it&#39;s nice that that tech is still in use here and there.  I just wish the dot-matrix printers in Europe would use A4 continuous paper (which may or may not even exist).And don&#39;t get me started on oversized continuous paper that is not perforated: this is the kind of stuff that can trigger obsessive-compulsive disorder!I guess all this rant to say that even in Europe, where A4 is ubiquitous, you still have places using other sizes than A3/A4/A5 etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article sadly misses the root of the An sizes. A0 has an area of 1m^2, setting its dimensions and defining the rest of the sizes. Quite genius!The B sizes start at B0 with a length on the short side of 1m, then follow the same pattern. The C sizes, often used for envelopes, are defined as the geometric mean between the equivalent A and B size.As a child of an architect, when I was a kid my dad would bring old A0 drawings home as paper we could draw and paint on the back of. Loved it.-
Edit: it does mention it, I skimmed it too fast…"</p>

There is no big organization behind Leon AI, just me and more with the community later.At the moment the whole core is being rewritten, many new features are coming up. Please do know that the main strength of Leon is about the core and not the skills yet. Once the official release shipped, with the community we will all focus on building new skills by extending from the core and let Leon makes meaningful things.
Among the upcoming things, new offline STT/TTS solutions will take place.It&#39;s going to take some time to build a respectable personal assistant that respects our privacy, but we are getting there.If you have any question or just wanna chat, feel free to join us on Discord."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is great, because Unreal is a C++ project that&#39;s not so easy to just Rewrite In Rust.It&#39;s also nice it uses bevy&#39;s ECS. It&#39;s made to fit Rust&#39;s type system and borrow checking model, and is highly parallel. It&#39;s really awesome how easy it is to distribute work across cores with it, without risk of heisenbugs thanks to Rust&#39;s data-race-safety guarantees.I know game development sees traditional software best practices as not applicable to them, but then games struggle with showstopping bugs and single-core performance bottlenecks. I hope someone will bet that Rust, despite being stricter and seemingly slower to iterate with, can be a net benefit from lower defect rates. Rust users outside of game dev praise the &#34;if it compiles, it&#39;s usually correct&#34;, and that junior devs can be told not to write unsafe code, so they can&#39;t cause UB and memory corruption."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am always skeptical about these type of projects. Out of the box Unreal Engine supports C++ and Blueprint.The problem with C++ is the slow compile times, and if you make mistakes the engine crashes. In general you produce stuff slower by using  C++.Blueprint is a visual scripting tool, it compiles fast. But it stores code as a binary blob in source control. And I&#39;m personally not a fan of visual scripting, I would prefer scripting by just writing code.So generally I prototype in Blueprint and then rewrite in C++ later on. I would love an intermediate language that has fast compile times and saves as a source file instead of a binary blob.The problem is most of the projects that integrate with another language get abandoned after a while. MonoUE was abandoned, USharp was abandoned, now the newest attempt to integrate UE with C# UnrealCLR looks abandoned. SkookumScript doesn&#39;t support UE5. Haxe support for UE was abandoned.Do I really want to risk writing a ton of code in a language that might not support future engine versions? To be honest, I don&#39;t want to take that risk."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great, because Unreal is a C++ project that&#39;s not so easy to just Rewrite In Rust.True. Although rewriting Nanite in Rust would be useful. Nanite is a very clever data structure for meshes. It&#39;s brittle, and full of internal relative addresses within the data item, so it&#39;s very vulnerable to buffer overflows. If it becomes widely used outside of UE, it might become something that gets supported in GPU hardware."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is relevant to today&#39;s events because Magnus Carlsen just withdrew from a tournament[1] after yesterday&#39;s loss to a significantly lower rated opponent who had previously been suspended for cheating on chess.com. The tournament organizers have also implemented additional anti-cheating protocols starting today.Whatever comes out of these accusations, the chess world will sure enjoy its new infusion of drama.[1] https://twitter.com/MagnusCarlsen/status/1566848734616555523"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Though I&#39;m not much of a poker player myself, I am friends with many professionals who have found success both online and offline, in games from pot-limit omaha to no-limit hold-em.Cheating in online poker has been around for many years, with varying success by online gaming companies to implement anti-cheat measures in their software. With recent developments in AI, there is renewed discussion about cheating as the best AIs have no trouble beating anything from PLO to NLHE.It was only a matter of time before this started to spread offline, and just a few weeks ago, I heard a story from a friend of a friend who caught a player using a device similar to this during a private game he was hosting. It&#39;s only a matter of time before these sorts of devices continue to spread, and I&#39;m not sure how the world will respond.It would be a huge deal to cheat at events like the World Chess Tournament, but the consequences of getting caught will likely stop at complete disgrace. Cheating at events like the World Series of Poker, with tens of millions of dollars on the line, or even worse, private events with potentially billions of dollars at stake, could lead to a hell of a lot worse."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I did fairly well in the test (I didn&#39;t remember that you couldn&#39;t shift into the sign bit), but it really helps highlight how stupid the C promotion rules are. In C as soon as I have to do arithmetics with anything but unsigned ints all sorts of alarm bells start going off and I end up casting and recasting everything to make sure it does what I think it does, coupled with heavy testing. Now add floats and doubles into the mix and all bets are off.Rust not having a default &#34;int&#34; type and forcing you to explicitly cast everything is such an improvement. Truly a poster child for &#34;less is more&#34;. Yeah it makes the code more verbose, but at least I don&#39;t have to worry about &#34;lmao you have a signed int overflow in there you absolute nincompoop, this is going to break with -O3 when GCC 16 releases 8 years from now, but only on ARM32 when compiled in Thumb mode!&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These examples do look scary. However, in my 16 years of experience of mostly writing In C, I have never found a single chance that I need to actually use the expressions that I got the answers wrong.Never mix unsigned and signed integer comparison unless you know exactly what you are doing.And never do arithmetic on boundaries definitions like INT_MAX, they are boundaries , why you need to compute a derived value on boundaries?If you do not need arithmetic behavior, do not use signed integer, use unsigned. Because computer does not understand sign, so if you do not need a sign, do not use it.You do not need to be a language committee member to write C , you just need to understand the reason behind its design."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Found a disappointing bug in the test:  (unsigned short)1 &gt; -1 

Correct answer is: implementation-defined.The left operand of &gt; has type unsigned short, before promotion. On C implementations for today&#39;s popular, mainstream machines, short is narrower than int; therefore, whether it is signed or unsigned it goes to int.In that common case, we are doing a 1 &gt; -1 comparison in the int type.However, unsigned short may be exactly as wide as int, in which case it cannot promote to int, because its values do not fit into that type. It promotes to unsigned int in that case.  Both sides will go to unsigned int{*}, and so we are comparing 1 &gt; UINT_MAX which is 0.Maybe the author should name this &#34;GCC integer quiz for 32 bit x86&#34;, and drop the harder choices like &#34;implementation-defined&#34;.---{*} It&#39;s more nuanced here. If we have a signed and unsigned integer operand of the same rank, it could go either way. If the unsigned type has a limited range so that all its vallues are representable in the signed type, then the unsigned type goes to signed. My remark represents only the predominant situation whereby signed and unsigned types of the same rank have overlapping ranges that don&#39;t fit into each other: the unsigned version of a type not only lacks negatives, but has extra positives."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m surprised no-one in the comments has mentioned MailInABox [0].On recommendations here, I switched to it 2 or 3 months ago from Gmail, after Google announced they were going to start charging for Gmail on custom domains.  I&#39;d no previous experience at all with running my own mailservers and had always been put off by how complicated it seemed.Even with a non supported configuration setup [running the mailserver for my domain on a separate VPS from the domain itself] MIAB setup was pretty easy. I had it installed and was up and running in no time. I then spent a couple of days setting up the various DMARC MTA-STS policies etc. [most of that time involved looking up what they were and why I needed them!] and [after testing with an unimportant account] migrating the rest of mine and my family&#39;s and friends&#39; emails across from Gmail. I was able to import half a dozen accounts from Gmail with about 8GB of emails between them, using ImapSync [1]So far [fingers crossed] it&#39;s been almost painless. Giving the lie to the commonly held belief that running your own mailservers needs constant hands-on maintenance. My MIAB setup runs quite happily on a $5/month Linode [I checked the IP was not on any blacklists, before I started] and the whole thing has been pretty much &#39;fire and forget&#39;. MIAB sends me weekly reports on what&#39;s been happening. Software updates are a one-liner in the terminal and I&#39;ve had no trouble whatsoever with Google, Microsoft etc. as regards the mail not getting through.If you&#39;ve always hankered after running your own mailserver but [as I did] thought it was too difficult and required too much &#39;hands on&#39; tinkering, I heartily recommend you give MIAB a go.DISCLAIMER: I run a couple of dozen email addresses on 3 or 4 domains on my MIAB. Probably sending and receiving a few hundred emails a week between them. YMMV if you&#39;re a heavier user than this.[0] https://mailinabox.email/[1] https://imapsync.lamiral.info/"</p>

The tactics were different, but the goal is effectively the same.The key differences are Kiwifarms is targeting individuals personally. And that they’re doing it kind of randomly, for the lulz. Whereas their main opponents here are targeting a company/community, and acting in self-defence.I know who I think is more worthy of protection."</p>

After learning about the situation from the last couple threads here and going down the rabbit hole of sources, the future of the internet seems pretty sad... If cloudflare doesn&#39;t reinstate the website after dealing with said immediate danger they claimed was the reason to remove its protection it just shows how hard you can shut someone down by just twitter outrage.If the threat really was so dire, and if there really was something of the sort sure i can see allowing the obvious DDOS in the background go thru and take the website down. But not reinstating it after the time they were claiming to buy by doing it was already bought it means if you scream loud enough on twitter, even while having an obvious army of arsonists behind you, the firefighters will just stop serving said target.Sure, cloudflare is a private company and all that, nobody questions it, but it doesn&#39;t make it any less unsettling."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting to see the comment thread digging into all sorts of criticism of the article (is it 2 kWh / fridge? Or 1.1? Should the author discuss renewable earlier or more seriously?)The main point I got from the article was a helpful reminder that a large part of the world doesn&#39;t have basic things that I take for granted (not just refrigeration, but you might also include air conditioning, transportation, etc). And that if we did want the entire world to live a life that includes things like that, we just don&#39;t have the energy right now.EDIT: I kept thinking about this and it doesn&#39;t stop at just basics. It&#39;s also things like living in a comfortable, well-manufactured home. Being able to buy toys for your kids. Taking airplanes to visit family or to vacation. Enjoying the consumption of meat, or food delicacies. The list goes on as you expand the threshold from basic necessities, to comfort, to luxuries, and you can decide where you want to draw the line."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not really.A lot of poverty is societal poverty (of order, collaboration, help, education, distribution, and so on) and is worse, even all other things (like relative cost of energy to average salary) being equal.You can be a slum-living destitute poor in a country even though you have financial access personally to several times the energy expenditure of someone in another country (or area of same country) with a different lifestyle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is exceptional. It may be reductive or even wrong but at least it&#39;s trying to quantify these issues and it uses actual data. Not only does this allow for analysis, it also makes it, in theory, falsifiable.If the article is right and all it takes is around a doubling of the current global energy, at 1.1% population growth and a global annual increase in energy usage of 2.5%, this gives around 50 years before we start producing enough energy to push poverty levels below 1%."</p>

I&#39;m in their &#39;sender program&#39; and they still don&#39;t actually bother to contact postmaster@, but a few emails is usually enough to unblock the block within 24h.Agree with a sibling comment that many major providers fail to operate the SPF/DKIM/DMARC tools they insist you do.Each to their own, but ultimately if we don&#39;t hold on to the freedom to operate our own mailservers, it will be taken away through inaction. This means doing some things right: DMARC, DKIM, SPF of course, server maintenance, good password policies and of course IP reputation. The best way I can recommend for IP reputation is to use a dedicated provider or VPS provider that disallows things like VPN endpoints, where it is less likely they&#39;ll assign an address with a poor reputation. A good provider might also ask you what you intend to host, and you might be able to discuss IP addresses with them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been hosting my mail for 20+ years now, with minor issues. I guess I&#39;ve been lucky.Reading the comments here makes me incredibly sad. Every answer that tells me to use a provider misses the point. The Internet was created so that there could be many independent nodes, not so that everybody has to rely on one of several blessed providers. I should be able to run my own E-mail.The real problem is lack of incentives. The big corps do not care about e-mail. It doesn&#39;t make money and isn&#39;t easily controllable. You can&#39;t turn it into a walled garden and lock users in. So, it gets minimal attention, and only defensive measures are developed.Either we solve the spam problem, or things will get worse.

I&#39;ve heard this may be because of hardware issues, but I haven&#39;t looked that deeply. I&#39;ve owned Pixel phones before and like the no BS + Google Apps-centric approach, but this phone really soured me on Google phones. :-("</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is 44 years ago, that I worked on a program in FORTRAN and it is 43 years ago that I learned LISP. It is about 36 years that I am writing software for a living.The longer I am a software engineer the longer I begin to understand that the soft skills are much more important than all the technical skills. For me software engineering is much about dealing with my insecurities and coming to term with my weaknesses. I also feel that it is a lot about dealing with your ego and a lot with cooperating with colleagues and bosses. The longer I am a software engineer, the more I understand that developing software is not about writing code but communicating with people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “Try different things” is the key, of course.32 year programmer here (started at 19).I cannot “amen” this sentiment enough. But probably not in the way most will read it.Most will interpret this at a macro level: Learn some Smalltalk! Now go learn Lisp! And then Clojure followed by Haskell, throw in some Java or C++ so you know what pain feels like! This is OK, it is good to be somewhat travelled in your journeys as a programmer.But I find that there is a micro application that gets overlooked. You can do a lot of “try new things” right in the stack you’re in without having to bust strange new worlds. Most languages end up with many ways to do things. You can and should take time to explore those. Learn the conventions/idioms, but then push/challenge those.I was afraid of C macros until I took time to really try some things with them. It didn’t mean I suddenly used them for everything, but overusing them for a bit helped me better make good choices about them.C pointers intimidated a peer until I forced him to forego index based for statements, using all pointer math instead.Smalltalk context objects were kind of “behind the scene” magic until I decided I’d like to figure out how to implement goto in Smalltalk. After that, they opened up for me.Python decorators are “magic” until you make a few of your own.The examples could go on and on.Try new things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is my 30th year programming. I always hope it&#39;s my last. Programming for money destroyed the fun hobby long ago.It&#39;s just reinventing the wheel year after year by this point. The last thing the world needs is more software.The web is the crappiest platform ever conceived; I won&#39;t touch it. Social media is poison. Smartphones didn&#39;t impress me in 2007 and they don&#39;t impress me now. They&#39;re annoying and intrusive. I still like desktop software. I know, I&#39;m a dinosaur.I just don&#39;t care about computers any more. I don&#39;t care what direction the industry goes in. I&#39;m not depressed and I don&#39;t need to learn a new language or work on a different project.I love creative problem solving. What I do not love is solving whatever problems are handed to you without asking whether they truly need solutions, or whether it&#39;s good for the world. Much of what people want computers to do is a waste of time and of life. Whether it&#39;s bureaucratic corporate garbage or thought stopping entertainment.I&#39;m so tired of computers."</p>

Kiwifarms absolutely may have been a despicable place causing real harm to people. In that case, the police should initiate a request to take them down that Cloudflare or ISPs etc. are obligated to follow. The problem is the government is completely ineffective and regularly offloads their responsibility to platforms like Facebook, Cloudflare etc. A private company should not be making decisions on essentially freedom of speech. Its just one more responsibility that law enforcement has completely shirked leaving others to clean up the mess."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So he ran a DDoS network that wasn&#39;t behind Cloudflare, but used Cloudflare to stop his website being DDoSed by competitors, and this means Cloudflare was helping him DDoS others?No, it means Cloudflare was helping keep his website up, in a neutral manner.In other words, exactly what Cloudflare have stated their policy is.Now if Cloudflare allowed him to run DDoS code on its Workers, then yes, that&#39;s Cloudflare helping him.Very false equivalence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article seems to have been posted to make a false equivalence with the current Kiwifarms situation. There’s a pretty clear difference in urgency between taking down DDOSers and deplatforming a forum that is a gathering point for a mob engaging in mass harassment, stalking, and SWATing. One is a nonviolent crime. The other is a crime targeting an individual that had already escalated to the point of a high risk of violence, with no sign of slowing down."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#39;One port to rule them all&#39; was a mistake. Instead of being convenient, USB C has become a confusing ordeal of varying capabilities and quality control. It is like we&#39;ve gone back to having many different types of connectors, but it is even worse because they share the same form factor. For any of the devices that use USB C to charge, I only use the cable that came with it when I purchased it.While I complain, I would also like to mention the USB forum&#39;s insane naming strategy and non-obvious labeling system. Remember when USB 3 was easily identifiable because of the blue plastic in the port?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ok I knew the situation was confusing but after reading this I am dumbfounded. It seems so much strictly worse than the old world of having different cables with different connectors - yes you had to have a lot of different cables but you couldn’t get it wrong. Now we have all the same complexity and you can’t tell what’s what by just looking at the connector."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has been a big pain, for me.The only docks that have worked for me, have been the CalDigit TSX docks, which I have used for a long time. The TS4 is out of stock on the CalDigit site, and I&#39;m never using Amazon again, for anything over about $100. I&#39;ll get it, eventually.I have the latest 14-inch MBP (M1Max).The biggest issues that I encounter are:1) External keyboard wake up/recognized.If I use a dock, the keyboard is often not recognized. I found that I need to plug directly into the Mac. Otherwise, it sometimes won&#39;t wake the computer, or the computer sometimes &#34;forgets&#34; the keyboard.2) Monitor Handling.I use a 49&#34; LG Ultrawide (5120 X 1440). I used to have it split into two monitors (3840 X 1440, 1680 X 1440), but now use it as a single, ultrwawide, after Apple started natively supporting that resolution.I found that many docks (even &#34;Thunderbolt&#34; ones) and adapters, refused to allow me to select the ultrawide size. Also, the monitor would often fail to be recognized, after the computer wakes, and I would have to reach under, and unplug/replug, to get it recognized. I have the monitor plugged directly into one of the TB ports, with a TB-to-DP cable, and it works great.From what I understand, the new CalDigit should fix these issues."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Originally made by Bob Nystrom [1] who now works on Dart, it is now maintained by ruby0x1 who is a game developer and most importantly creator of a game engine that uses Wren as a scripting language [2]. Unfortunately Luxe is still not publicly available (closed beta), which I admit is a bit of a frustration for me as I&#39;ve been following development for a few years, but it does show a lot of promise and in the meantime I&#39;ve become a happy user of Godot. I keep Wren in the back of my mind as an easy-to-embed scripting language in cases where you could integrate Lua (which Wren outspeeds) but not LuaJIT.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=munificent[2] https://luxeengine.com/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wren seems pretty elegant, but it makes the same mistake a lot of languages do when it comes to operator overloading.  If you put the binary operator as a method on the first object, then there isn&#39;t a simple way to have &#34;builtin_object &lt;operator&gt; your_object&#34;.For instance, Wren doesn&#39;t provide complex numbers, so you aren&#39;t going to get a nice syntax for &#34;1/z&#34; or similar.  I could make similar examples with scalar multiplication for vectors, matrices, or Numpy-style arrays, etc...Python and other languages have fallbacks to work around this, but Wren does not.  And really, I think of binary operators as 2 argument functions, not methods on the left object."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Buyer beware - my wife hates Amazon and goes out of her way to not purchase from them. She has encountered several vendors on Walmart marketplace that simply place orders with Amazon at 100% markup - the packages arrive in Amazon boxes w/ a receipt showing the actual cost paid at Amazon. Total rip-off.When ordering electronics from Walmart Marketplace, particularly TVs, I’ve found that the marketplace sellers freely substitute makes and models. Maybe nobody notices if you are shipping a gift to someone else, but since I need specific models from specific manufacturers for development it gets noticed when I order LG model XYZ and get a no-name tv instead. I stopped ordering from Walmart altogether after the second time (out of two, consecutive) that happened.So my advice is anything you buy online at Walmart, make sure it is not a marketplace seller, just save yourself the trouble.In all cases Wal-Mart refunded my money after waiting for a week for the vendor to respond, though I had to lug the stuff to the UPS store to return it. Amazon usually suggests I donate stuff rather then return it.I’ve not had any issues with the items sold by Wal-mart actual, those you can buy with confidence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazon let’s the same thing happen in their store: https://www.amazon.com/s?k=1+tb+flash+drive&amp;crid=1XK7KPUOQ4X...It’s horrible and they won’t do anything about it despite contacting them via help requests and Twitter.3 of the top 5 listings are total scams.And Amazon’s choice for 1TB flash drive is a scam: USB Flash Drive 1TB, Flash Memory Stick for PC/Laptop, Ultra Large Storage USB Drive, Portable Thumb Drives (Black) https://a.co/d/cTi7XqZ"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Flash drives with hacked firmware to pretend to be bigger capacity than they were (along with other evildoing, like counterfeits targeting people paying a premium to get Sandisk quality) were already rampant on eBay IIRC 15+ years ago.I was still seething over some of the storage ones when, a few years ago, I joined an anti-counterfeiting startup.  (Sadly, our successful MVP launch integrated into a high-end factory production line happened just as Covid was breaking out, which spooked our flagship customer, and impacted followthrough we needed, then we ran out of runway while pivoting.)As a consumer, I can imagine a lot of things that the marketplaces like Amazon.com and Walmart.com could do to improve trustworthiness.  I don&#39;t know whether those make business sense.  I&#39;d love to see consumers reward a marketplace that conspicuously kept out the scammers.Ideally, the solution would protect integrity of all brands, not only house brands."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s 2 different things going on here:- The optimal amount of fraud in society is 0- The optimal amount of fraud a business/industry should accept is non-zeroThe simple observation that the cost to prevent each marginal fraud attempt increases; the last 0.1% of fraud costs way too much to prevent compared to the first 99%. Obviously society would be better off if fraud didn&#39;t exist, but since it does the effort expended is only worth it up until when the marginal cost of prevention exceeds an acceptable threshold (when it starts to lose you money).The optimal amount of fraud is still 0, but the optimal amount of fraud prevention lies somewhere on the margin.This is why important transactions like banking have KYC checks, and buying a pair of sneakers don&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This whole article is one giant time sapping piece of click bait.The author makes the unexpected claim that businesses want a non zero amount of fraud. And so as a reader you are tempted to read on because you haven&#39;t heard this before. But essentially the argument is that fraud is needed as an unavoidable byproduct of allowing trust/credit in the system to facilitate transactions. However, if businesses could have the trust without the fraud of course they would. I wouldn&#39;t be so upset if the author had been more upfront about what this was about. I&#39;m sure there are plenty of people out there who are learning about the fraud and trust/credit relationship for the first time. Just don&#39;t try and spin this in a way that it isn&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like this starts with an agreeable premise. Some fraud is egregious, costly, and/or easy to detect. These low-hanging or high-impact cases are most worth pursuing. At some point you reach diminishing returns, where the amount of time / effort / capital you&#39;re putting in to eliminating fraud outstrips the losses from the fraud itself.I don&#39;t know that I agree with the ethical conclusion that the optimal amount of fraud is therefore non-zero. The leap from &#34;anti-fraud efforts are expensive&#34; to these sentences in the final paragraph was not, in my opinion, convincingly made here:&gt;We should, as a society, accept non-zero amounts of benefits fraud. We should accept non-zero amounts of cheating on taxes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"To be maybe controversial...I&#39;m still thinking about it, but I do wonder if diverse casting works in European fantasy stories. The problem I have is that it generally pulls me out of the experience/ makes it less immersive. I welcome diverse castings in modern shows (though we don&#39;t need every show to follow a template &#39;diverse&#39; casting). 
A common counter argument is, well you can suspend your disbelief and imagine a dragon, so why is a diverse community in a small village not ok? It just feels less immersive. Yes, I can go along with it - but I&#39;m not sure it works. It feels like the modern world superimposed in a fantasy setting. I&#39;d prefer to be sent to an alien world.It is problematic, as years of discrimination in the real world for women/ethnic minorities were wrong and we should encourage equality in the corporate world. However the entertainment industry I wonder should in some ways be exempt. Maybe. One area where there isnt a discussion on &#39;diversity&#39; is music and also novels. This is because there are tons of tons of novels and music bands to listen to. No one cares if a particular band is &#39;diverse&#39;. 
So I wonder if the only solution out of all of this, is to have more shows - yes, make diverse inclusive European fantasy shows, but also make traditional european fantasy shows too etc. What I think will happen is that in such a scenario most European fantasy fans will choose traditional like shows. Because the story is more immersive and you are brought more into this old world. Maybe. Like I say, I&#39;m still undecided. For modern/futuristic films I find diverse castings just as immersive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t get reviews saying that TRoP, or some other new prestige TV series, is &#34;terrible&#34;, or &#34;a disaster&#34;, based on the first couple of episodes.Some really excellent TV series have taken more than a whole 26-episode season before they find their rhythm and get properly good. ST:TNG is a classic example, but I&#39;m pretty sure you can come up with others. And some people are claiming that a new series totally worthless, not based on the first series, but based on the first episode? Are you kidding me?I mean, is it OK if the first episode of a series is unevenly paced, and contains too much exposition, and clunky &#34;tell, don&#39;t show&#34; dialogue about who the main characters are and what their deal is? No, no it isn&#39;t. We should ask that writers do better, and trust audiences to have the patience to learn who characters are through action over the course of a few episodes.But just because they don&#39;t do those things, is it really worth writing off the next 5 (or however many) seasons of a show, based on one episode? Who does that? What does anyone gain from that?OK, there&#39;s a lot of prestige serialised TV out there now, and you probably can&#39;t watch all of it even if you wanted to, so some culling is probably necessary at some stage. But does anyone really have to write something off quite so soon? You can&#39;t even give it half a season to try and get up to speed?I don&#39;t get it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Everyone here is so incredibly focused on money as the primary motivator, which I guess given the thread question makes some sense. But I&#39;d like to just put in a little word for money not being everything, and client type / work type actually being a really important part of the equation.HN is a forum where increasingly I see posts every single day about the high level of misery in tech / how can I get out of this rat race / high levels of stress / undervalued / etc etc.I charge £500 a day. It&#39;s not much compared to some of the rates on here, but I work with lovely, interesting clients in the non-profit sector. My clients love what they do and I do good work for them so they love what I do. I have long term, low stress, friendship-like relationships with my clients, not shouty / nasty / high stress ones. I&#39;ve done this work for 12 years, and had to work with maybe a handful of assholes during that time.FWIW I think there is a &#34;lower budget bar&#34; under which demands are insane for the money being offered, and we should all avoid this work unless we actively want to take a race to the bottom. But - I think there is undoubtedly a &#34;higher budget bar&#34; over which the stress level and expectation is made exceedingly high. This (I would imagine; I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ve worked in non profits my whole life) is probably also equated with sector - if you&#39;re in a FinTech environment I would imagine you&#39;re looking at high budgets but also an insane number of highly pressured assholes shouting at you all the time.What am I basically saying? I guess - yes, charge enough (and this is probably more than you think it should be) - but also, look at the bigger picture of your work / sector. Think about happiness, work-life balance, client motivations, etc - and use this to inform what you charge and how you charge for it. That&#39;d be my advice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Anybody who did PS1 dev back in the day will have had to do some crazy hacking stuff to get performance or memory.  The first project [1] I worked on I had a C version of my graphics engine and animation system, and in parallel I&#39;d have a MIPS assembly version which was super optimised (the C version was effectively a reference).I made the whole engine and animation system fit in 4K so it would fit into the instruction cache of the CPU.  The whole frame update cycle wouldn&#39;t need to touch main memory (for the code).Also, because loading from main memory was slow (4 cycles) and the chip was RISC (1 operation per cycle), you&#39;d need 3 NOPs after the Load-op for the register to be loaded. The C compiler (if I remember right) never really filled those 3 NOPs with useful stuff.  So, I&#39;d do hand written concurrency (in MIPS assembly) by loading other stuff I&#39;d need into those NOPs - this was particularly effective when working with 3 dimensional vectors or 4 dimensional matrices.Trying to keep super-optimised hand-written concurrency in assembly, in my head, was a challenge and not something I&#39;d recommend!  Still, the engine had more throughput than Sony claimed of their machine.  Every bit of performance gained would mean an edge over the other games.Then the game was canned by Eidos.

Or prevent it from producing pornography? Or CP? The last one should be fairly straightforward (kid + nudity = get it out), but the first two are very broad limitations. I understand if you want to make it not super racist, but with pornography, I&#39;m not sure it has a point... even more so given the fact that erotic art is very common in the real world and I&#39;m pretty sure this model (and others like it) can&#39;t distinguish between erotic art and pornography (which you can&#39;t blame it for given the legal standard seeming to be &#34;I recognize it when I see it&#34;), meaning it can only ever be used to produce SFW imagery scrubbed of any &#34;risque&#34; factors or themes, because the authors didn&#39;t want to deal with any kind of erotic art due to this impossibility of separating erotic art from pornography.If the point of all of these models is to get to something resembling an artist, then why intentionally kneecap it from the start and prevent it from producing art?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a reason we don&#39;t just &#34;let the builders build&#34;. We used to do that (certainly to a massively greater extent than we do now), and the result was that although a few of them managed to construct monuments we can all be proud of, most of them built a pile of crap and/or damaged the places they built in and the people they nominally built for. This is true of literal buildings, but it&#39;s also true of a great many other things that we &#34;build&#34;.The author of this delightfully titled but almost content-free piece seems not to consider Chesterton&#39;s Fence at all: before you criticize let alone dismantle regulation, you should be able to demonstrate a sound understanding of why it came to exist in the first place. For bonus points, a rigorous explanation of why the reasoning no longer applies in the current time period is helpful. TFA provided neither."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unspoken and underlying the author&#39;s entire worldview seems to be, &#34;the more new things, the better,&#34; a not uncommon tunnel view in the engineering world. The purpose of regulation, ideally, is to ensure that whatever activity/process is being regulated is worth the cost(s) for the majority of people. Defining those terms and making that decision is precisely the job of regulators, who are ideally accountable to a democratic base. In the worldview where all that matters is &#34;growth,&#34; people suffer. Running water is a huge quality of life win for EVERYONE. If you ask most people what would really help make their lives better, it&#39;s not gonna be colonizing mars, building tunnels under LA, whatever, it&#39;s gonna be access to resources we already have. Healthcare, clean water, clean air...perhaps we should think more about engineering as it can be applied to expanding access, and not so much to &#34;making new things,&#34; which most people don&#39;t need or care at all about."</p>

Why bother constructing housing when you can just have other people&#39;s labour increase your land values? Why should I increase the supply of residency spots when constraining that supply increases my salary by $100k? Why bother with bold bets when you have net work effect monopolies?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A better question might be: Why is the private sector responsible for providing accurate health information? As this article shows, the incentives for people running medical websites and the people reading them are not aligned. I&#39;d say the UK NHS website and symptoms/medications pages hit the nail on the head - https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/. It has no advertising and provides short, easily readable and actionable information on the majority of conditions and the correct way to use and take many different sorts of medication.And crucially - if the information present is not sufficient, clear and obvious UI elements that direct the next best steps to get the help you need, whether that be ringing the non emergency helpline or immediately going to A&amp;E.

One of my clients is actively trying to reduce their dependence on Amazon and instead integrate with other marketplaces.I see it&#39;s just Shopify-to-Shopify for now - bravo for starting with probably one of the most costly integrations.  I&#39;m working with a client right now who had to build these integrations using a low-code drag-n-drop platform which allows a quick MVP but has slow job processing, so isn&#39;t great for high order volume.The &#34;amazon&#34; comparison is good for marketing - sure you&#39;re not doing all their marketing, or having their reach but you are connecting suppliers, buyers and fulfilment which is a genuine problem.The companies who would use this often have developers on board already, so providing open source, accepting contributions and turning this into a useful dev-friendly service will almost certainly find paying customers.Following :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few points I&#39;m skeptical of:  simply connect to the seller’s infra instead of locking them in.

One of the value-adds of Amazon is there&#39;s a whole bunch of tech sellers don&#39;t need to know how to write, run, and maintain. You&#39;d need to understand how big the niche &#34;technically literate to run their own e-commerce business, but selling on Amazon for other reasons&#34; is, then how your operation would answer those &#34;other reasons&#34; to make you competitive to the niche.  If, for some reason, the seller is removed from the marketplace, their software stays with them and they can continue accepting orders directly.

Apart from the software systems, there&#39;s a whole bunch of basic business processes that Amazon takes care of, which are less portable. Using FBA? Leaving means learning how to run a warehouse, shipping logistics, pricing, staffing, etc. Not using FBA? How&#39;s your Marketing department doing? Hopefully you didn&#39;t let it get too anemic or too fitted to &#34;people who are good at gaming Amazon&#39;s algorithm.&#34;In short, if your value add is: &#34;Amazon, but you get to take the tech home with you if you leave the platform,&#34; then that feels like a small niche of highly competent businesses, then you&#39;re stuck with &#34;well if they could do all this on their own anyway, why are they choosing Amazon?&#34;Hope that helps and wasn&#39;t just me blabbering.

Two pieces of feedback:- Using a copyleft license like AGPL makes this an automatic non-starter for most businesses, no matter how impressive your tech might be. You&#39;ll have a lot more luck with mid-size and enterprise adoption with an MIT license.- You&#39;ve really built an Order Management System for marketplace use cases, which is in industry typically a distinct domain from a Warehouse Management System (WMS) or a Transportation Management System (TMS) which at large-scale tend to handle how orders actually get fulfilled and shipped to customers. Your naming is a bit misleading - at the very least I&#39;d emphasize somewhere on your landing page that this is an open source Order Management System if you want eCommerce domain folks to grok quickly what you&#39;ve built and how it plugs into a broader architecture."</p>

Snapshot-and-restore is a particularly cool capability, especially if you solve the data movement problems (like these folks have).One challenge to clone-and-restore that they don&#39;t talk about here is making sure that clones don&#39;t behave too similarly (like returning the same cryptographic random numbers). We wrote a paper about that a while back (https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12892), and the Linux kernel community has been doing some great work in that area recently too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Beware that such techniques slow down memory access for the newly running VM quite substantially.For example, a simple memset() call across a few gigabytes of RAM inside the VM might slow down a factor of 1000x after a VM clone like this.Both &#39;parent&#39; and &#39;child&#39; VM&#39;s see the slowdowns.Some types of garbage collector also see really substantial slowdowns.It was a deal-breaker for my project where I did similar sorts of things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not to diminish this work, but I think it&#39;s worth noting that it&#39;s increasingly possibly to launch new VMs extremely quickly too.  FreeBSD/Firecracker can reach userland in 33 ms, and the OSv unikernel boots in under 10 ms.I think increasingly we&#39;ll see Firecracker used with EC2-like setups of &#34;create a disk image with everything preinstalled and then boot it&#34; rather than using snapshots of running (suspended) VMs."</p>

Not only did the technology improve, allowing for lighter, smaller, and programmable pacemakers, but doctors began to realize that this excessive longevity of nuclear pacemakers was excessive.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Both Kagi and Orion are deeply impressive products. Even though I try every new general purpose web browser and search engine that comes out, this combo is the only one that stuck.Orion: Finally a non-chrome based web browser that can compete with the likes of Brave and Arc. It works much better on Mac than the alternatives, with the same engine as Safari it also benefits from deeper system integration such as native Sign-in with Apple and password management. Also, like Brave, comes with powerful ad and tracker blocker so you don&#39;t need a separate extension. I also love its built-in tree-style tabs implementation.Kagi: It is Google without all the bad parts. It is user centric like some other alternatives, without the poor index and search results.Props to the team, I am looking forward to what&#39;s to come. It is mind blowing how a single small company can make one of the best desktop browser AND search engine AND mobile browser on the market. Hope they are not spreading themselves too thin and can fund the development of all these for a long time!My only complaints are the slow performance of Orion on iOS, and its poor handling of app urls. Latter caused some issues when I had Orion set as the default browser on my iPhone and some payment flow that used app redirects between my banking app and the store app got stuck. I was lucky and I could manually launch the app by pasting the app link in Safari, but I hope it can handle these cases as well as Mobile Safari in the future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I joined the Kagi beta two weeks before it ended and have been a paying user ever since. I find the price to be quite steep but so far it have no regrets and will most likely continue my subscription. I average over 2000 queries per month.- Search result quality is at least equal to Google for most queries and far superior for queries involving discussions or technical topics. Sadly, it is inferior for queries in my area of expertise (Swiss law).- Kagi is the only alternative to Google that I know of (and I have tried many) which is able to produce good regional results and mix them - when appropriate - with international results. Most privacy focused search engines are very US centric.- Blog spam and copy cats are not completely gone but the situation is at least bearable, especially after continuosly filtering them and boosting credible sites instead.- Customization options, filtering options, speed and site layout are also far superior when compared to Google.Apart from the lower quality results from queries involving my area of expertise, the only thing that still keeps me using Google Search are the reviews from Google Maps.All in all, I recommend supporting this product."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t stress how much better Kagi is than Google, I&#39;m a paying user. No more scrolling through tons of ads. Filtering by time and language is great, no more GitHub and Stackoverflow clones in the result. 
Thank you, I actually haven&#39;t realized how small Kagi still is, given how polished that product already is."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ve been interviewing for 8 months. Getting to many final rounds, 1 lowballed offer, 1 rescinded offer, and it’s playing a mental toll. Today, I got a rejection that went along the lines of “everyone loved you and there was absolutely 0 negative feedback, but we just found a better fit.”  I almost broke down, but hid behind a facade of positivity because the long weekend was starting and my kids can’t afford a bummed out Friday.Interviewing shouldn’t require such thick skin. I’m here questioning my life, and reduced to worthlessness."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These styles of multi-round interviews inspired by the FAANG collective started picking up in Australia before the pandemic, but it got to a point where most of my more talented colleagues and I all agreed it just wasn’t worth the time for the salaries being offered. 4 round interviews for a ‘senior’ developer position on $120k?When interviewing my own candidates, I use a 1 hour interview mostly focused on approach and personality. We have a probation period to work out if they’ve over-promised, and most of our tech industry is big banks that won’t notice if they waste a few weeks salary trying someone out. Honestly, for the salaries the local market provides, I think 1 interview is fair. Any more and I think we’re wasting peoples time for nothing.Personally, I’ve dropped out of application processes when they’ve indicated there are multiple rounds, and my salary hasn’t suffered for it relative to my friends who put up with them, so I feel like I’m ahead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My last job search took a toll on my mental health. I felt like a worthless person for 3 months. I could feel (or imagine?) the disdain of the interviewers as I was failing their tests. The fake enthusiasm on their side as they rejected me (&#34;that was great! But we&#39;re not going to move forward with you! Good luck!!!&#34;) and on my side while pretending I was excited when in fact I was worried about money and the gap on my resume.I dread the next one."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is actually a way to delete Meetup groups, versus just leaving/stepping down from them.The Meetup docs are quite clear about the default behavior if you leave/step down: https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002865332-Closi...The answer you needed was just a quick Google search away: https://www.google.com/search?q=delete+meetup+group, e.g. https://support.google.com/developergroups/answer/7378020?hl... and many other results.Could Meetup offer up this distinction more clearly in their user docs? Sure. But like I said, the Meetup docs are pretty clear what happens when you follow their instructions.It&#39;s hard not to read OP as &#34;we took an action without doing due diligence to fully understand the consequences of doing so.&#34; The point at which you make an assumption like this is the point at which you bear equal responsibility for unfavorable outcomes.Edit—the UI is actually very clear about this, and has been for at least the last couple of years: &#34;Your members will be given the chance to become the organizer and keep the group running without you.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has been an issue with Meetup for as long as I remember. The problem is there are two distinct scenarios.One is that the organizer has lost interest or is stepping down for some reason. Allowing the community to continue on Meetup in that case makes sense, by having someone step up to continue paying Meetup.The other is that the community as a whole has decided to move to a new platform. In this case keeping the now defunct community around and making it seem viable is bad. The current active members will know where to go, but new potential members or former members that want to re-engage are going to get confused.I got burned by this a couple of times, finding a group on meetup only to discover that it’s a ghost group, to the point where I’m now suspicious of any meetup group I find that hasn’t had an active event in the last couple of months.This is where I think Meetup is shooting themselves in the foot by not having a way to dissolve a group if the group as a whole decides to move."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a multiple meetup organizer and owner on meetup.com and I find it actually great that the meetup can stay alive if the organizer stop to pay.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This really sucks to hear. What’s unclear to me is whether Twitter is being negligent or abnormal here or whether this is just shitty world politics unfolding partly on Twitter. Twitter is being used by both sides to fight over a narrative. Nothing new in that respect.The author doesn&#39;t really propose a solution other than Twitter essentially siding with him and take (what appears to me to be) a political stance. Of course moderating political topics isn’t outside Twitter’s wheelhouse, but this is what you get as a society when you let arbitrary entities arbitrate speech: ambiguity and unclear expectations.On the one hand, it’s reasonable for the author to expect that Twitter removes clear misinformation from their platform since that’s what they purportedly claim to do. On the other hand doing so would go against a national narrative and piss off lots of Pakistanis. Uh oh.Maybe Twitter was never about being arbiters of facts and instead just pandering to the popular political narrative of the time? Or maybe they are objective and they’re just trying their best and we’re all human and we’ll do better next time? Regardless, this is the reason people get so frustrated with censorship: it cannot be applied objectively and fairly in every case.Twitter and social commentary aside: sounds like the author needs political asylum or at least real protection. Twitter is not the right entity to depend on to handle this situation, I fear."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am sorry for the responses I am seeing on HN. People with cushy lives who&#39;ve likely never faced similar danger seem to just not really get it.I will say that your framing is one that most Westerners will have trouble taking seriously.It might go over better to document known cases where this pattern occurred and show the similarities.  Walk people through it like they are five, so to speak.I know it&#39;s hard to do that kind of objective writing when you are feeling so threatened due to genuine threats, but in my experience that approach works better.I know you didn&#39;t ask for advice. I apologize for my bad habit of trying to be helpful in the only way I know how.I hope something improves soon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Twitter, despite millions of Pakistani users, it seems has no moderation system that understands local dynamics.Many would argue they don&#39;t even understand the local dynamics of the U.S. It&#39;s impossible for twitter to be an arbiter of the truth around the world, and you shouldn&#39;t expect them to be. However, I understand that&#39;s cold comfort for someone facing the threat of torture, death, or exile from their home, and I think your decision to call out twitter using your own platform to act with respect to your specific circumstances is the right thing to do and really the only way to handle this kind of thing.Good luck, I hope you stay safe and that the government doesn&#39;t succeed in silencing you."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My favorite Stephenson&#39;s novel is Anathem with superb world building (as usual) but also a pretty good story and ending.But it&#39;s also a book whose world (specifically the avout society) attracts me. I&#39;ve grown up in a Catholic setting, but &#34;converted&#34; to atheism/agnosticism pretty early. But even with its many failings, there are certain aspects of religions which seem worth preserving - the focus on community, the rituals, a particular rule framework, meditation (prayers) and introspection.The book presents a (on a certain level) pretty attractive model of society which combines the practical religious patterns with a full rationalism.I kind of understand why such &#34;atheist religion&#34; is unlikely to get off in the real world, but it&#39;s still something I would wish for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree, I don&#39;t think diamond age gets enough interest. It&#39;s one of my favorite books and the ending is unsatisfying but at least upbeat. Seveneves is also tons of fun. And if you know anyone who likes history, his older Baroque Cycle is pretty greatI haven&#39;t heard this in an interview or anything but I think now Stephenson is older and successful enough, he just writes the books exactly how he likes. Diamond age feels like he was agonizing over every word to keep everything so short. But Fall, and his newest book Termination Shock (which I also didn&#39;t like most of) ,just feels like an author who likes writing. Both have these amazing moments, which reminds me like a jazz musician, where it&#39;s almost effortlessly insightful and funny. But with no editing or second thoughts"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Much as I love Neal Stephenson&#39;s novels, I really wish he&#39;d stayed around at the writer&#39;s class he surely took until they had learned how to wrap up books and write endings; more often than not, I turn the page on a Stephenson novel only to find it was the last...(While I exaggerate a little, his stories do not end as much as END - I would be thrilled if he could spend a few pages wrapping it up in the end before leaving us waiting for the next title...)The yarns he constructs are definitely entertaining enough for me to cope with this very minor annoyance, though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Funny story: my first task when I joined the original iPhone team was to merge our forked WebKit with master. It was a sort of hazing ritual slash &#34;when else would we do it but when someone new joins?&#34;. Anyways, we used a tool called SVK[1] in order to get very primitive &#34;git-like&#34; abilities. It was basically a bunch of scripts that used SVN under the hood. For example, in order to get the &#34;local everything&#34;-style behaviors of git, the very first thing it did was checkout every single version of the repository in question. For WebKit, this meant that the first day was spent leaving the computer alone and letting it download for hours. I made the mistake of having a space somewhere in the path of the target folder, which broke something or other, so I ended up having to do it all over again.Anyways, I distinctly remember one of the instructions for merging WebKit in our internal wiki being something like &#34;now type `svk merge`, but hit ctrl-c immediately after! You don&#39;t want to use the built-in merge, it&#39;ll break everything, but this is the only way to get a magic number that you can find stored in [some file] after the merge has started. If it&#39;s not there, try `svk merge` again and let it go a little longer than last time.&#34; A few hires later (I think possibly a year after) someone set up a git mirror internally to avoid having to do this craziness, which if I remember correctly, was treated with some skepticism. This was 2007, so why would we try some new-fangled git thing when we had svk?1. https://wiki.c2.com/?SvkVersionControl"</p>

She later immigrated to Japan and played for their national team and gave China some trouble for a while.There is also this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton_at_the_2012_Summer_O...The funny thing is, they do that in table tennis (actually also badminton in some other cases other than the one in the article) not even just to secure the gold medal: since China is/was so dominant in this sport, they sometimes do it to ensure certain player can get his/her &#34;grand slam&#34; [2] (to win all the major tournaments in their career).[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis#Notable_players"</p>

Unfortunately Google Translate doesn&#39;t seem to work on wayback machine, but you can copy paste the text.Funnily enough, at least in this particular report, it is her coach who told the story. Really shows how this behavior was normalized enough for it not to be considered too shameful to admit.The reason Ye and her husband are persona non grata is unrelated to the Olympic incident, but because her husband is involved in the &#34;New Federal State of China&#34; (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Federal_State_of_China).

Imagine an Olympic competition, you might be in the right shape to compete in the Olympic only once, and you miss that not by your chance.No officials in Iran take the responsibility of this decision, no one knows what institute forces athletes to abandon their competition, but this continues.Many of top athletes migrate to other countries (usually just stay in the country they are for the competition as refugees, and do not come back with the team, then they move to another country) for a chance to compete free from this restriction."</p>

They find, time and time again, in all sorts of fields, that extremely parsimonious models like equal-weighted linear regression of one or two predictors outperform expert judgment[1].One would think this is cognitively dissonant enough, but it gets worse:This article, with the thesis that good arguments are more important than data, is based on, well, a good argument – not much data. On the other hand, the work by Meehl et al. claiming pretty much the opposite, is based on, well, a lot of data, and maybe not much intuitive reasoning.

Fortunately, as I&#39;ve grown older, I&#39;ve become more comfortable with holding completely dissonant opinions in my head at the same time.----Edit a few minutes later: This actually prompted me to refresh on the subject. It might be the case that Meehl is actually making the same argument as this article, only it gets distorted when repeated. Some things are reliably measurable; for those things be data-driven. Other things not so much, then use your expertise.----[1]: Here&#39;s just one relatively early example: http://apsychoserver.psych.arizona.edu/JJBAReprints/PSYC621/..."</p>

But if you start to ask questions, it&#39;s all very obvious that they didn&#39;t really understood what they were doing and that very often it doesn&#39;t really matter to them in the first place; it&#39;s all about reaching a decision using some pseudo-scienty method that nobody dares to question because &#39;data&#39; and &#39;science&#39;, without having to take responsibility."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have experienced this first hand, so this article resonates a lot with me.I worked with a manager who prioritized work which was easily measurable, so he could report the good numbers to leadership and get career points out of this. Unfortunately the project we took on was a demanding and technically challenging problem, and in almost a year of work of a team of engineers we made barely any real progress or made any actual difference, but the numbers were great and people were satisfied during presentations. I ended up feeling completely disconnected from my job and losing all motivation to work there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yes, the situation is dire. I live in Lisbon as a foreigner for more than 12 years now. We pay a rent for a small flat that used to be very expensive and now is on the cheap side in our quarter of the city. Luckily, we have an older contract that cannot be changed as easily as newer ones. I&#39;m not thrilled by the possibility that our landlord might cancel it some day, however, e.g. for relatives to move in. Rents in the city have skyrocketed, we&#39;d have a hard time finding anything, even though we both work full-time and have salaries above average. It&#39;s crazy because all new homes and apartments are &#34;luxury apartments&#34; with insanely high pricing both for buying and renting. They&#39;re mostly empty or are (often illegally) rented out as holiday apartments. It&#39;s incomprehensible to me how ordinary Portuguese families survive in Lisbon. I guess most of them have inherited property.Quite honestly, apart from the generally increasing  gap between rich and the poor, one big problem in societies nowadays is that you can simply get richer and richer just from owning property. For example, if you own three ordinary apartments in Lisbon, you can live in one of them and easily make a good living by renting out the other two as holiday apartments. Because cleaning services, guys who do repairs, etc., are cheap in Portugal, this involves almost no work. Moreover, the net worth of your property will continually increase while you do (almost) nothing. I&#39;m not saying I blame these people, I would do the same if I had the opportunity, but this is a huge structural problem in my opinion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This sounds like what happened in the SFbay area(south bay/pennisula), I grew up there and it used to be a great place to live, center left politics, lots of families and a diverse set of industries with many middle class opportunities. right around 10-15 years ago things started to change dramatically for the worse, housing and costs everywhere skyrocketed, homeless population exploded, politics veered hard left. Most of my friends from high school(90%) were forced to leave due to rents going from $1k a month to $3k a month for a 1-2 bdrm apts. Those that owned houses also moved as they were fed up with crime and could get a way better house somewhere else. Middle class jobs all disappeared from the area, families also left, the neighborhoods I lived in San Jose (rose garden/willow glen) had barely any kids for my daughter to play with as there were no families anymore, the rose garden neighborhood had 0 kids on the street, the willow glen neighborhood had 1 family w/ kids who moved away during the pandemic.I was lucky and making really good money in tech but was devastated by how the area I grew up in had turned into a nightmare and everyone I know (even family) leaving the area. I too ended leaving as the cost vs. quality of life didn&#39;t make any sense and I couldn&#39;t see my family living in a place I didn&#39;t even recognize anymore. Most people don&#39;t talk about it but there is a huge diaspora of bay area residents due to the stuff mentioned above and it breaks my heart to think we will most likely never return and familiy/friends I expected to spend the rest of my life with all leaving."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very difficult to change because, in the &#34;Pax Neoliberalia&#34; world we live in, profits are Sacrosanct - and the higher the capital concentration, the holier so.
But some straightforward fixes:1. Flood the market with affordable state housing, Austria-style - with the bonus of building new, boosting the national economy.2. Create very progressive (rapidly rising) taxes based on property value - making untenable the current practice of parking money and profit by simply buying &amp; holding empty flats and the like.3. Raise salaries - currently portuguese salaries, and their weight on GDP, rank the lowest in the EU.(and no, it won&#39;t create an inflation spiral:
the current inflation spike is, first and foremost, the result of a supply shock, price-gouging and speculative/cartel practices - corporate profits being at a record high is proof of that)Unfortunately, incentives are heavily stacked on leaving things as they are, as the ruling class is mostly made up of the landlord class, and, is not sensitive to (sometimes even not aware of) the struggles of assetless commoners that only earn income from their (low) salaried labor. Or, even worse, stands to lose their current large gains on capital/assets if this is fixed - and most portuguese media outlets trumpet their - private - master&#39;s voice and interests.
Additionally, just leaving things as they are, also scores brownie points with the EU by making the Government (even if &#34;center-left&#34;) appear &#34;frugal&#34;. And PM Costa has personal ambitions for future EU high office.(...who will be the next head of the European Commission or the European Council?)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the goals of any code base of significant size should be to reduce the cognitive load (not lines of code per function).Assume the developer working here just had a 45 mins sync, has a meaningless repeat meeting about vapourware in 10 mins and a 2 hours town hall meeting after lunch... and still have to deliver that mess of a requirement you made him promise to deliver before any of these interruptions were even on his calendar!- Always aim for declarative programming (abstract out the how it does it),- limit the depth of the function calls (rabbit hole developers...),- separate business logic from framework internals and- choose composition over inheritance.- Also avoid traits and mixins (run from the dark magic)- don&#39;t over document the language or framework, only the eyebrow raising lines, the performance sensitive stuff and the context surrounding the file if it isn&#39;t obvious.- name stuff to be easily grepableEasy rules to go by, (there are probably more), they can make or break your ability to work, so that you can get interrupted 12 times an hour and still commit work.I don&#39;t find these in books, just decades of sweating and pulling my hair &#34;why does it have to be so hard!?&#34; I have met plenty of senior devs who naturally do the same thing now.The code size fallacy is a prime example of the wrong way to look at it. Plenty of extremely large code base in C++ are far more manageable than small JavaScript apps.Mixing boilerplate framework junk with your intellectual property algorithms &#34;what makes your software yours&#34; is a sure way to hinder productivity in the long term.You write code 3-4 times. You read it 365 times a year.One last thing I recommend if you deal with a lot of interruptions and maybe multiple products, various code bases... keep a    // @next reintegrate with X

The @next comment &#39;marker&#39; is a great way to mark exactly which line of which file you were at before you left this project, for a meeting, for lunch, for the day, etc.  And it allows you jump back into context by searching for @next and go. Also since it&#39;s visual and located, your brain has a much better time remembering the context, since we&#39;re good with places and visual landmarks.It&#39;s far more efficient than roughly remembering what I was doing, looking at the last commit, scrolling endlessly through open files. Don&#39;t commit @next though :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Multiple levels of abstraction kills me, at least without adequate documentation. Conceptually, it&#39;s veey easy to grasp, but in code it becomes a mess making jumps through multiple unfamiliar files in a large code base. Essentially, you end up having to hold all the pertinent information on that code in your head, which largely defeats some of the purposes of breaking them into multiple files."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve often thought of this as &#34;developer empathy&#34; when I was working at Amazon. Generally regarding people who create APIs for other developers to use. The idea being that you can make your API simple or complex, and most developers tend to make their API complex, because they think their system is really powerful and cool and want to expose all the power to end users. But, you need to remember that your users aren&#39;t just using your API. They are using maybe 100 other ones as well. And there is no way for a person to learn the ins and outs of all 101 complex APIs. Add to this the fact that the more complexity you expose, the more unintentionally coupled your API becomes to your implementation (generally). So, make your APIs simple, and provide backdoors if you really want to expose complexity.I will say, this did not get me promoted at Amazon."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve worked at multiple startups sub 50 to &gt;1000 (unicorn status) and have founded and sold my own company. I&#39;ve also worked at a few of the FAANGs. This is common advice, especially among VCs since it&#39;s one of the key benefits used to pitch prospective employees on giving up that fat FAANG salary, but in my personal experience, it&#39;s not so cut and dry.Working in a startup will brand you as a startup person and help you meet VCs which may make it easier to raise. It&#39;ll also show you the problems that that particular startup faces and give you n=1 degree of pattern matching. On the flip side, something like YC can give you the same benefit or just shipping a for-profit side project on the side. Additionally, given how poorly run most startups are today, I&#39;d posit that you&#39;re actually in more danger of learning the wrong lessons than the right lessons by joining a startup. At the end of the day, the truth is likely to be Peter Thiel&#39;s observation that joining the right, highly successful, high growth startup as a very early employee is a great way to learn exactly 1 method of starting a successful company--the way that company did it. But if the startup you join isn&#39;t that rocketship, you&#39;ve only learned how to (or how not to) achieve that particular path of failure or mediocrity.Not particularly great advice though, because then the challenge becomes identify those startups. And if you could do that reliably, I&#39;d suggest you switch careers into VC instead :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Want to get to point X? Visit point Y first!&#34;Just go to point X directly. Too many people shy away from their dreams and delay, because they want to learn first, practice first, and get ready before the real adventure. You will never deplete &#34;more things to learn&#34;. You are only depleting your lifetime. And no matter how close working at a startup is to working on a startup, it will never be as close to it as itself.If you need to save up some money or take care of any other blockers first for your own safety, fine. If there is a great company working on a great problem that you are excited by, great. But if you want to start a new company, then working at a startup is not a practice for starting a new startup. It is a practice for working at a startup and a practice for wasting another day of your life not living the way you really want to live."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish I had had that opportunity back in 1985 when I founded my first one, but being outside of the Bay Area (as in 1500 miles away) there were basically no software startups at all, and with no internet/web/ycombinator etc, no way to learn anything except by trying and failing. We did ship our product, do marketing, make some sales but not enough so we had to sell the product and close down. Today I know all things I did wrong but back then you were working in a world unlike today, and not even one person to ask as everyone starting software companies back then was just as clueless unless you were in a few places in the country. It&#39;s hard to explain to people today just how hard this was (for example I tried to borrow some money at a local bank to buy computers, and when told we were a software company, the loan officer assumed we were making ladies undergarments)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"After using SD heavily for a week, I half agree with this. It is incredibly disruptive, and it&#39;s wild how much it accelerates the creative process. I&#39;ll give you that.But two things I&#39;ve noticed:First, artists will still have a massive advantage over non-artists with this tool. A photographer who intimately knows the different lenses and cameras and industry terms will get to a representation of their idea much faster than someone without that experience. Without that depth of knowledge, someone might have to rely instead on random luck to create what&#39;s in their head. Art curators might be well-positioned here since having a wide breadth of knowledge and point of reference is their advantage.Second, we need the ability to persist a design. If I create a character using SD, I need to be able to persist that character across different scenarios, poses, emotions, lighting, etc. Based on what I know about the methods SD/Midjourney/Dall-E are using, I&#39;m not sure how easy this will be to implement, or if it&#39;s even possible at all. There will always be subtle differences and that&#39;s where being an artist who can use SD for inspiration instead of merely creation will retain their advantage over a non-artist.That said, holy crap. This tech is insane."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Andreas, author of the Replicate model here -- though &#34;author&#34; feels wrong since I basically just stitched two amazing models together.The thing that really strikes me is that open source ML is starting to behave like open source software. I was able to take a pretrained text-to-image model and combine it with a pretrained video frame interpolation model and the two actually fit together! I didn&#39;t have to re-train or fine tune or map between incompatible embedding spaces, because these models can generalize to basically any image. I could treat these models as modular building blocks.It just makes your creative mind spin. What if you generate some speech with https://replicate.com/afiaka87/tortoise-tts, generate an image of an alien with Stable Diffusion, and then feed those two into https://replicate.com/wyhsirius/lia. Talking alien! Machine learning is starting to become really fun, even if you don&#39;t know anything about partial derivatives."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe I can shine some light on the debate from an concept artist standpoint that works in VFX and advertising. I worked on feature films (3 of them in the imdb top 100), tv shows (like game of thrones) and hundreds of AD campaigns.In the last 10 year the work of a concept artist changed dramatically we have gone from purely painted concept art to mostly &#34;photobashed&#34;. Photobashed means basically that you rip apart other images and stitch them together to get the desired image. Some start with a rough sketch for the composition or make really rough grey shade 3d model and &#34;overpaint&#34; them. When it comes to &#34;photobashing&#34; the disregard for copyrights was always there and it&#39;s the worst in smaller studios and a bit better in the leading ones. Still most of the time everyone argues that if you only use really small parts of the images it is covered by fair use. There are some examples were studios got sued but mostly without bigger financial impact.A few months ago I started working with &#34;DiscoDiffusion&#34; to generate the images I use to photobash. &#34;DiscoDiffusion&#34; can produce great &#34;painterly&#34; images but struggles with photorealism and is slower, not as coherent as &#34;StableDiffusion&#34;.
Still the adoption rate in the concept art community was insanely fast. This all got topped by &#34;StableDiffusion&#34; in the last week. Ofc there are still people that want to do it the &#34;right&#34; way and not use AI but we had the same discussion years ago when &#34;photobashing&#34; came into place and some artists still wanted to paint the whole image. As concept artist you are mostly paid for your design thinking that means it is less about the process and more about the finished product. The turnaround time for styleframes got reduced from 3-4 hours while painting to 45 min - 1 hour when photobashing with stable diffusion me and my peers in the studio are now at 20-45 min per styleframe. When &#34;photobashing&#34; most people constrain themselves on their image library and ressources like Photobashing Kits. Not only does &#34;StableDiffusion&#34; cut the time in half it also gives greater freedom in composition and design especially if you are using  img2img.So where does this leave us? For the work in fast paced art environments like VFX, games, conept art or advertising &#34;StableDiffusion&#34; is a welcome gamechanger. Tradionalists and Artists outside of the industry might feel threatened but for us in these industries it&#39;s a god send."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Side topic: DJI is the clear market leader, and it&#39;s also a Chinese company.Is there a viable alternative for EU customers that are sensible about the geopolitical aspects of this?I also looked at some open source firmware, but didn&#39;t find anything particularly appealing. e.g. [0][0]: https://www.parrot.com/en/open-source-drone-software"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s really amazing is that they used a $2,000 drone, not something super super high end and specialized and out of reach. Plenty of hobby photographers have camera bodies, or combinations of camera body and lens, that cost that much.I have waded into the drone space recently. I had my eye on them (specifically DJI; they&#39;re clearly the leader) for a while (hobby photographer; lover of tech toys), but every time I looked in the past they were too expensive for me to justify. My uncle had one that as $1200 or so, and then a friend had one at like $600, and then just before we were going on vacation to Scotland I looked again and -- HOLY CRAP -- there&#39;s a model at $299.Sold.It&#39;s the DJI Mini SE, and you DO give up some stuff vs. the next level (about $500), but most of it is the drop from 4K video to &#34;merely&#34; HD. (There&#39;s also reduced range, which might end up mattering more.) OTOH $299 is for me a point where, if I fuck it up, I can be sanguine about it.It&#39;s INSANELY easy and fun to use. I got comfortable enough to send it far out over lochs, and to learn to trust its &#34;return to home&#34; function when flying in places where line of sight might obstruct the signal. If you haven&#39;t played with one you probably wonder how it handles losing a solid connection with the operator, and the answer is that, at least at this level, it remembers where it launched from, heads to a previously-set height (to avoid obstacles) and then comes home. At some point en route it&#39;ll re-acquire a connection and you can take back over.(Higher-end models (like the one they took to Everest) are able to navigate around obstacles and fly a more complex path home, but hey, this is the $299 model.)I&#39;m happy to share the video I shot but not publicly here. PM me (is that a thing?) if you want a link. And if you plan to travel somewhere beautiful where drone flight isn&#39;t severely restricted, I strongly suggest you consider getting one, China or not."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"An accurate but pretty lacklustre &#34;mea culpa&#34; and retraction. I don&#39;t mind people making mistakes, everyone does, but seeing how Krebs has handled this whole episode has not inspired optimism in how he&#39;ll handle future mistakes.He was essentially used as an unwitting party in a cyber blackmail scheme, and he doesn&#39;t touch on that at all.  There will continue to be nefarious parties trying to misuse his reputation, so long as he remains a popular cyber researcher.  I wish he would show consciousness of that rather than simply saying &#34;I was wrong.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; As a result of the new information that has been provided to me, I no longer have faith in the veracity of my source or the information he provided to me. I always endeavor to ensure that my articles are properly sourced and factual.This is a strange statement given how the details of the FBI investigation have been public for a very long time.Krebs was fast to report on the initial accusations, but seems to have waited as long as possible to write about the revelations that his source was actually the perpetrator.&gt; This time, I missed the mark and, as a result, I would like to extend my sincerest apologies to Ubiquiti, and I have decided to remove those articles from my website.Given that Krebs is a reporter who has historically built a reputation on exposing things and bringing information to light, the brevity and vagueness of this article feels much more like a compromise to settle a lawsuit than typical reporting."</p>

Maybe there&#39;s a negligence issue, i.e. relying on a single source, not doing enough background, etc. that overrides the normal &#39;good faith&#39; reporting norms?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This doesn&#39;t just ban A100s. It bans those and &#34;any future NVIDIA integrated circuit achieving both peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance equal to or greater than thresholds that are roughly equivalent to the A100.&#34;It&#39;s a ceiling on the performance that can be exported. In an exponentially scaling industry, this is the equivalent of an announcement in advance of a complete ban on competitive products 2-3yrs out.Given that both political parties have placed export limits on tech to China, it seems this is the new normal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is a newly announced Chinese alternative to those GPUs - the Biren BR100.Fabbed at TSMC. (I guess we are about to see if SMIC can do their 7nm at scale.)https://www.nextplatform.com/2022/08/25/china-launches-the-i...CHINA LAUNCHES THE INEVITABLE INDIGENOUS GPU…Here is how Biren says it stacks up on various machine learning workloads, pitting the BR100 against the Nvidia A100:…We presume this is for AI training workloads, not inference. The average speedup over the A100 is around 2.6X. It is not clear if the Nvidia machines were using sparse matrix features, which doubles the throughput, or not. Our guess is they were not."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am not sure what exactly the thought process is here? So NVIDA is losing Chinese market, probably for the foreseeable future. Chinese are one step away from figuring out this technology anyway, if not already. They will not trust us again. It makes them less dependent on us. Oh, and we still need their manufacturing because of the labor costs, environmental issues, regulations and now, energy costs. How would this work exactly? I know it has been done during the Cold War I, but the world looks very different today."</p>

A further idea would be to train a network actually good at dedup and not only similarity by training on positive and negative pairs, eg with triple loss.Here&#39;s my plan on the topic https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AryWpV0dD_r9x82I_quUzBuR...If anyone is interested to participate, I&#39;d be happy to guide them to do that.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Data is an excellent place to look at to get a sense of where the model is likely to work or not (what kinds of images), and for prompt design ideas because, roughly speaking, the probability of something working well is proportional to its frequency (or of things very similar to it) in the data.The story is more complex though because the data can often be quite far away from actual neural net training due to preprocessing steps, data augmentations, oversampling settings (it&#39;s not uncommon to not sample data uniformly during training), etc. So my favorite place to scrutinize is to build a &#34;batch explorer&#34;: During training of the network one dumps batches into pickles immediately before the forward pass of the neural net, then writes a separate explorer that loads the pickles and visualizes them to &#34;see exactly what the neural net sees&#34; during training. Ideally one then spends some quality time (~hours) looking through batches to get a qualitiative sense of what is likely to work or not work and how well. Of course this is also very useful for debugging, as many bugs can be present in the data preprocessing pipeline. But a batch explorer is harder to obtain here because you&#39;d need the full training data/code/settings."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I find the article hopeful for the future of free speech on the internet. Even though the ability to host content on the net is one thing and lacking access to most platforms (where the users actually are) like youtube, facebook, instagram, tiktok is another. The most important thing nowadays is access to the siloed user bases for people who try to express dissident opinions, not the access to the net as whole, even though that is important as well.&gt;For instance, when a site that opposed LGBTQ+ rights signed up for a paid version of DDoS mitigation service we worked with our Proudflare employee resource group to identify an organization that supported LGBTQ+ rights and donate 100 percent of the fees for our services to them.I find this section peculiar. Why does the company have &#34;values&#34;? I though companies were supposed to be looking after the intrests of their shareholders, i.e., profit. Do the shareholders consent to the lost profit being donated to political motives? This broader trend of companies becoming political organizations is terrible, frankly.But even with that said, I find their stance in the article to be hopeful, and sincerely wish that they stay true to their words in this paragraph.&gt;To be clear, just because we did it in a limited set of cases before doesn’t mean we were right when we did. Or that we will ever do it again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s rather disappointing that Cloudflare&#39;s policy is to not host content that is &#34;illegal, harmful, or violates the rights of others, including content that discloses sensitive personal information, incites or exploits violence against people or animals, or seeks to defraud the public&#34;, but they do not apply that same policy to content that they provide DDoS mitigation services for.I don&#39;t see why their policies should differ depending on whether they are hosting or protecting the content in question. Either way, they are in part responsible for making that content accessible. I get the feeling that this is just an arbitrary distinction that they&#39;ve made since hosting this content is more likely to have legal consequences for Cloudflare than simply providing DDoS mitigation services for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If this is in response to Kiwi Farms, I would say this is very disappointing.Love CloudFlare, think they are amazingly innovative, huge amount of respect for the people who work there.I see where they&#39;re coming from, but I don&#39;t see how KF is defensible whilst 8chan et al aren&#39;t."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Buried in the announcement is how Snap is shutting down Zenly and firing everyone who worked on it in Paris, France. Zenly is a location-based social application (think: you can see &amp; connect with your friends on a map). Snap bought them in 2017 for a reported $250-350M when they had ~4M installs. Now Zenly is at 40M MAUs, growing strong as I heard from employees working there.Zenly is (was?) popular in Japan, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and the Nordics. In Japan, it is head-on-head as the most used social app with Line.I find it odd that Snap just shuts down an app that was so popular in regions that is hard to gain foothold for any social media team. They could have likely sold it or spun it out, but chose not do so.It&#39;s also not like the app is a major cost to the company. Less than 100 people work on it across Snap, most based in Paris, France."</p>

While never endorsing the end of the eastern bloc, he made it clear beginning in the late 1980&#39;s that unlike his predecessors, he would not oppose democratic reforms in Eastern Europe by force. To general astonishment, he kept this promise, and with the regrettable exception of Lithuania this commitment to not repeating the crimes of his predecessors is Gorbachev&#39;s greatest legacy. In 1988 you would have been hard pressed to find anyone who could imagine the mostly peaceful collapse of the Eastern Bloc, but Gorbachev had the moral courage to accept this once unimaginable consequence of his policy and to see it through."</p>

He understood the lacunae of the Soviet system and genuinely set about to reform them. But ultimately it was Ethno-national interests in Ukraine, Baltics and Central Asian republics along with the rise of opportunist power-grabbers like Yeltsin that did him and Soviet Union in.And perhaps his own reluctance  to follow the Chinese model. He prefered to do political reforms before economic ones, while the Chinese prefered the economic reforms first and foremost.He ended the war in Afghanistan. He was more keen on Nuclear disarmament than Western leaders: Western leaders dragged their feet on that matter, and ultimately we didn&#39;t get no where near Nuclear disarmament.He ushered in reforms. See the Soviet films of the period to see a very different picture from cold war era Hollywood depictions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would say: Writing is a test. It tests if you understand the subject well enough, and the &#34;other person&#34; well enough, to communicate it to that other person. Most likely you don&#39;t so then you need to think and/or learn more so that you can redraft it so it works. Write something technical and it reveals how little you know!---It is a trope but it works: Write your problem to the most senior developer in an email/slack but don&#39;t press send. Then there is a probably 50% chance you will solve it, or reduce the scope of the problem to {more focuesed question} that you can ask about."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a tech lead, when you&#39;re asked to deliver more, the first impulse tends to be asking your team &#34;how can we do more work?&#34;The correct question should be &#34;What can we NOT do?&#34; - and usually there&#39;s a long list of things that don&#39;t generate business value - from processes, meetings, reporting and overly detailed planning sessions to technical hurdles including slow builds, pre-check in hooks, sign off requirements etc.I know that most feel that they absolutely HAVE to do these things, since there are part of the business process/ definition of done/company guidelines etc... but here&#39;s the thing: If your team delivers value, people stop asking questions. It might take some forceful pushback and even some fights initially, but even if your team is absent from meetings or doesn&#39;t jump through every hoop, as long as you churn out value, you make yourself, your superiors and the business as a whole look good and in turn will be cut some slack."</p>

I still haven&#39;t fully broken the &#34;I&#39;m too busy&#34; pattern but at least now I know there&#39;s a decent chance that I haven&#39;t actually been too busy and I need to look more at what it is that I have been doing and whether or not those things are truly more important than whatever I was &#34;too busy&#34; to do."</p>

Managing people and priorities takes skills that require practice and learning. A manager that, for example, assigns people to work on things they enjoy working on and avoids excess pressure is going to have a team capable of a lot more than a team where the manager doesn&#39;t bother.So, when I see the list of &#34;reasonable ways for the business to exert influence over the work&#34; I feel like a huge missing one is &#34;help the manager manage their workload and the team better&#34;.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You did this? Nice job!&gt; Please also check out Keysharp, a WIP fork of IronAHK, another complete rewrite of AutoHotkey in C# that tries to be compatible with multiple OSes and support modern, v2-like AHK syntax with much more features than this one. In comparison, AHK_X11 is a lot less ambitious and more compact, and Linux only.Fascinating, lots to check out here. Thank you.BTW this kind of work falls into poweruser tools IMO, which is an important area for cultivation of Linux Desktop focus. Traditionally in the Linux community this has been more of a distro-maintainer&#39;s support choice (offer poweruser tweaks and tools, or not) so it&#39;s always nice to see new distro-independent, non-dev-poweruser options coming into being."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see the benefit in this, having one script that works everywhere.It&#39;s also good to know linux has autokey (https://github.com/autokey/autokey) for the same result. The name is close, but it&#39;s a different project.It&#39;s not compatible with autohotkey, but you can script using python. I used it to enter dates, emails and automatize dynalist.io actions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice! I used to love AHK to death, incidentally it also got me my first paid programming job.It‘s about the only software I dearly missed after switching to Mac, but recently I found Hammerspoon and couldn‘t have been happier.Yep, Lua is a bit weird and exotic, but hey, so is AHK. In the end, you trade in some of AHKs terseness for better modularity and compatibility with existing packages.https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the stated goal of MV3 by Google[1] was to avoid extensions with broad permissions:&gt; our new declarativeNetRequest API is designed to be a privacy-preserving method for extensions to block network requests without needing access to sensitive dataThis MV3-based AdGuard extension still requires a broad permission to &#34;read or modify host data&#34; on all sites[2]:    &#34;host_permissions&#34;: [
      &#34;&lt;all_urls&gt;&#34;
    ],

So what you have now is the same required permission to &#34;read or modify host data&#34; as with MV2, but with a network filtering engine capabilities gated by Google (an advertising company).We can&#39;t innovate anymore the filtering capabilities of our content blocker engines as we have been constantly doing over the years.For a recent example, there has been discussions lately with filter list maintainers of whether uBO should support AdGuard&#39;s proposed capability of being able to support pattern-matching for `domain=` filtering option[3] (uBO supports AdGuard lists).That sort of proposition is not possible to entertain with MV3 since only Google get to decide how the filtering engine will evolve, if at all. All content blocking issues will have to be resolved with the Google-controlled filtering engine, and left unaddressed if the solution can&#39;t be shoehorned in the declarativeNetRequest API.* * *[1] https://blog.chromium.org/2020/12/manifest-v3-now-available-...[2] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/Web...[3] https://github.com/AdguardTeam/CoreLibs/issues/1550* * *Edit: removed stray `[` character."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Manifest v3 is going to be a slaughter. Extension developers have known the slaughter was coming, but Chrome users are going to be taken by surprise. Many free Chrome extensions aren&#39;t going to get updated at all for v3, because it&#39;s too much work. Many aren&#39;t going to work right anymore because of the new restrictions. And ad blocking aside, v3 seems like a nightmare in general, and still quite buggy. The service workers vs. background script issue discussed by AdGuard will affect many or most extensions.I&#39;ve been postponing the migration of my extensions to v3 for as long as possible. One extension should be fine, but the other one... I&#39;m afraid of what that&#39;s going to be like."</p>

No problem, we&#39;ll be there tomorrow&#34;I really don&#39;t understand how it&#39;s done. Clearly they must have parts distributed ahead of time.I&#39;m just amazed that it&#39;s included in the price considering the cost of sending a technician out to a customer. The fact that even here on HN a lot of people think Apple&#39;s support is good suggests that Dell might be able to save a ton of money by lowering their support level, so I don&#39;t really get why they offer it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I absolutely love my Framework laptop for dev. I feel the software support is also quite good, at least for Fedora which is explicitly supported. I got the DIY edition and put everything together, including installing Fedora, in under 1 hour. And I&#39;m a really slow guy, haven&#39;t build a computer in 10 years - its too easy with framework.This laptop is really build to be repairable and modular and it does not suck at all. I think it will last a long time.The ability to choose your own edition also means I got a reasonably affordable laptop with loads of RAM, which I find is quite useful for development."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Please excuse the long-winded answer...I have also given up on Apple, but mostly because I can&#39;t see the value in it anymore, otherwise my experience with them has been satisfactory (Intel CPU models).For the past few years I used a Microsoft Surface Pro because it seemed to have good build quality and high screen resolution, but despite this I have had to replace it as part of a recall due to a graphics hardware issue, so it was not without its flaws. On a side note, I found the Windows OS to be OK for non-dev work, but would always &#34;work&#34; on the Linux subsystem... so even though Windows supports it quite well, I would just suggest 100% Linux.For 2022 I decided to buy a &#34;gaming&#34; laptop and switch to 100% Linux. The build quality is a little lower than Apple, and the screen resolution is not as good as Apple or Surface Pro, but it is still good, and when using my external monitor there is no difference.The benefits are clear, however, for less than 50% of the cost I am getting superior performance, discrete GPU, excellent cooling, and NO LOCK-IN. There is also the added benefit of being able to play the occasional video game with great performance.So far I don&#39;t regret it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We have this kind of censorship in India as well, even the in weirdly innocous places. In James Bond movies, and I think Gone Girl as well, scenes were by zooming into character&#39;s faces or just straight cuts.This is probably the only reason I maintain a US iTunes accounts (used to have to buy gift cards from sketchy sites online to keep this going, but I recently discovered that my Indian Amex card works fine with a US address).Also trivia for those who are wondering how cuts are made, at least for cinema content: all video and audio assets are usually sent to theatres in full, but there&#39;s an XML file called the CPL (composition playlist) that specifies which file is played from which to which frame / timestamp in what sequence. Pure cuts or audio censorship can be handled by just adding an entry to skip the relevant frames or timestamp, or by specifying a censor beep as the audio track for a particular time range.https://cinepedia.com/packaging/composition/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The solution to this is, of course, piracy. I&#39;m glad people like those on /r/DataHoarder preserve media in their complete forms so I don&#39;t have to watch them censored.A recent example is Community which has an episode of a character dressing as a dark elf, and the joke is that another character  assumes it&#39;s blackface, even though it&#39;s not. Well, networks and streaming services now removed it and unless you have the original discs, you simply can&#39;t watch that episode.Unless, of course, you pirate it, which is how I watched it."</p>

And, in these times of VC prosperity, could there be another attempt at it, this time with longer-term dedications than &#34;Whenever we get bored of the PR from funding computational research or there&#39;s a momentary lapse in market conditions?&#34;Long-term computing research is one of the best ways to ensure YCombinator&#39;s continued growth and avoid dominance from companies that are increasingly avoiding the publication of their own research (and, divorced from either of those two things, it would do a substantial amount of good, which is more important to some people but less an immediately-swaying argument to capital); it seems absurd how it was sort of thrown to the wayside on what seemed to be a whim (judging by when VPRI shuttered and the other two stopped seeing activity, possibly by the 2017 crypto crash causing YC to momentarily get more conservative in its funding)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The cursor lag is really bad, particularly on Windows, but there are at least 2 ways the lag could be much lower:1. Use &#39;desynchronized&#39;, e.g. canvas.getContext(&#34;2d&#34;, { desynchronized: true });2. Instead of using requestAnimationFrame(), draw as soon as a move event is received.Here&#39;s a paint app that uses techniques 1 and 2 to achieve much lower input lag drawing the pen strokes that chase the cursor:https://paint.js.org/Two other tricks to be aware of:3. [Chromium only.] Use &#39;pointerrawmove&#39; to get move events as soon as they happen instead of waiting for a big bunch of coalesced moves to all arrive after a delay.4. Drawing where the cursor is predicted to be in order to compensate for lag works well during smooth cursor/pen motion. For example, the Windows Snip &amp; Sketch tool actually renders the line you are drawing in front of the direction your pen tip is detected traveling because when using, say, a Microsoft Surface Pen on a physical Surface Pro screen the line being drawn would otherwise noticeably lag behind the physical pen tip (especially on a 60Hz screen) unless this predictive trick is used.Finally, be aware of open Chromium issue #992954. When the devtools are open [F12], coalesced events aren&#39;t used so you get lower input lag but more events to pump (like &#39;pointerrawmove&#39;). This bug is maddening because it depends on whether or not you have the debugger open!https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=992954"</p>

(Not affiliated.)Edit: Incidentally, I tried running it on a CPU.  It is possible, but it took 3 minutes instead of 10 seconds to produce an image.  It also required me to hack up the script in a really gross way.  Perhaps there is a script somewhere that properly supports this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi DanielFirst, I love what you&#39;ve done here, and why - congratulations on making it this far!A few suggestions:1) An independent web route is important, but you could lower the friction even further with browser plugins.  Like you, for general articles I use push-to-kindle[0] which only needs two clicks - no copy/paste, etc.2) Have you also thought about including a copy of the original article  - so that in a single download, there&#39;s the article followed by the HN discussion, all accessible from the document&#39;s index?3) I could see this developing further as a productivity tool via subscription - maybe I set up an account with you and then receive a digest of the day&#39;s top-10 (or 20, whatever) articles and discussions.  Or a weekly digest? Might be a powerful way to divert people away from the regular distraction of HN, but still allow consumption.Good luck :)[0] https://www.fivefilters.org/push-to-kindle/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m in a similar situation as as you in that I wear glasses and have busted right eye due to eye muscle surgery in the early 1980s.  I can &#34;see&#34; out of it but reading text is impossible unless it&#39;s like a foot tall.  The thought of avoiding screens never occurred to me.  Wouldn&#39;t any medium be it a screen, paper book, or Kindle cause eye strain on your left eye?  I&#39;ve seen many optometrists/ophthalmologists over the years and nobody recommended to avoid screens.  One doctor advised me to avoid using contacts since eyeglasses always give you eye protection for the left eye and that was it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If that idea of your lifetime not being enough is stressing you out, Dr David Burns&#39; work on cognitive behavioural therapy might help. Saying you want to be an expert in many things because you are interested in many things could be papering over some deeper anxiety-driven motivations around &#39;not being good enough&#39; or &#39;not being worthy of respect&#39; or &#39;needing to prove yourself to someone&#39; or &#39;not wanting to be a nobody&#39; or &#39;wanting to avoid the bullying you used to get&#39; or etc. The Feeling Good podcast[1] is a good audio introduction and has many examples, his book Feeling Great is more of a self-help style written introduction.The important question is not &#34;what should I work on?&#34; or &#34;how should I decide and prioritise?&#34;, it is something more like &#34;I have thought processes, they model imaginary futures and guide me away from predicted harm. Why do I have an imaginary future of not being enough of an expert and feel suffering in the present? Where did that thought come from and what is it doing for me, and do I want to keep it?&#34;.You can go with the desire for expertise part, &#34;why do I need to be an expert in many things?&#34; - whose respect are you trying to earn? Whose criticism are you trying to avoid? Who are you trying to avoid being like? What emotional disaster is that trying to protect you from? Or the other side, &#34;what is so bad if I am not an expert in many things on my deathbed?&#34;, what&#39;s imagined social or emotional harm is that warning me of?[1] https://feelinggood.com/list-of-feeling-good-podcasts/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I let my natural curiosity guide me. I used to beat myself up about not being one of those people who have a singular purpose, someone who focuses deeply in one area, but found solace in Susan Fowler&#39;s blog post:&#34;All of the really great people of the past and of the present always have some singular destiny. Somehow they know exactly what they love, they find it when they&#39;re young, and they spend their entire lives doing that one thing. Their destiny, their singular passion becomes their entire life, and they love every minute of it. It&#39;s their calling, it&#39;s what they were born to do, and it&#39;s beautiful.&#34;...&#34;People tell me I can&#39;t do all the things I want to do, and they are of course wrong, because I can and I do and I will. But I still can&#39;t ever reach my greatest, deepest, most secret goal, the goal I left off that list: to have a singular passion. Maybe that&#39;s ok. Maybe my life will always be about running toward that unattainable goal, trying and loving everything I find along the way. And maybe at the end, when I have to give an account of my life, I&#39;ll say that I never was anything, but I was everything.&#34;Source: https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/5/21/life-without-a-d..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The threads in here about honestly confronting the finite time available and defining goals and understanding why you want expertise are both reasonable and important to think through.But in terms of actually picking what to focus on, I&#39;d suggest looking for under-explored intersections of domains that are interesting to you. This is for two reasons:- If the particular intersection is not field with a large number of people doing real work in it, the &#34;bar&#34; for being an &#34;expert&#34; is lower. In a well-developed area, even after doing quite a lot of learning, one might not be an &#34;expert&#34;.- The intersection can give you a view on those adjacent fields which may reveal other interesting opportunities, and may make you at least fluent or productive in those areas."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I do a small trick that seems to work wonders (at least for me).I don&#39;t limit myself at all. When I want to do any activity that seems to be dopamine-fuelling (emails, HN, Reddit, Stripe, other metrics, even company Intercom), I just have to set a timer to certain duration. I can reset, snooze, or extend durations however I want. No rules. Just the action of setting a timer.Oddly it has made myself way more conscious and intentional. Resulting in almost no actual distractions when I do want to focus. Technical tricks (blocking apps, websites, or DNS) are unfortunately too gimmicky because it&#39;s so easy to bypass. And personally I had no results with those."</p>

If there is a big community of hobbyists in the relevant field who do the same thing in their dayjob, I think this works well.Edit: A more open source version of this is to GPL the source and offer a more commercial friendly licensed product for a fee.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a concept sitting in &lt;that folder with all the ideas&gt; that is pretty high on my list of &#34;man, I want to make this happen&#34; but would need a team to execute on.The idea is to integrate the kickstarter model with github&#39;s issues (specifically, feature requests).  You run an open-source project and people can submit feature requests that come with a fundraising campaign.When someone wants the software to do something new (support a new platform, implement an interface, etc) they draft a campaign a la kickstarter, someone who can contribute to the project negotiates with the drafter pricing, targets, and stretch goals.Past this point, it&#39;s the drafter&#39;s responsibility to do the marketing for the campaign and raise funds.  Once the target $ amount is hit, it&#39;s on the person who picked up the contract to get the work done.There are, of course, a ton of details to work out, and executing on this is going to be resource-intense on a number of vectors that aren&#39;t necessarily technical (legal, finance, hosting costs).  Also, I suck at UI.  The business itself would naturally be a non-profit.addendum:  I also have a day job that I have no intention of leaving, so factor that in to time-to-completion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The chart is interesting because it misses the important part - it covers time, but not adoption.For example, adoption of GIMP has not likely materially increased over time (as a relative percent of total addressable market)IMHO, what the author gets wrong what so many people who claim this (they are not the first, or the last) get wrong - open source as a whole sucks at building products, but is great at building infrastructure.
(and pretty good at infrastructure products).If you go look at areas where an open source thing is a de-facto market-leader, they are mostly infrastructure.  Not all, but the ones that aren&#39;t have clear product management of some sort.That is - the good open source products are often built/driven either by extremely product focused people (This is rare), or by companies driving them with PMs.Not that the engineering doesn&#39;t matter - of course it does, but if you want a good and successful product, engineering is just a part of what is needed.  Sometimes not even the main part!Open source focuses mainly on the engineering part, often creating technical meritocracies that focus on making &#34;The technically best software&#34;.This is totally cool, but also totally orthogonal to building &#34;a good product that people want to use&#34;.Secondarily, you have the issue of survival in marketplace (IE There are a rash of OSS companies achieving near 100% of total addressable market share, and still going bankrupt due to inability to monetize).  This, however, is not as big an issue as the first (as people can always still pick it all up when that happens)Open source could always get better at products, but its historical development models were geared towards exactly the above (IE it does what it says on the tin)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;All software will be open source, and no one will make money with software.I&#39;m really not convinced. The chart shows Photoshop having an alternative in with GIMP in 1998. And 24 years later, people are still paying lots of money for Photoshop. Pretty much all of these examples are similar. Yes open source has replaced some categories of paid software like VCS, but in a way it just opened up more paid software in the form of hosts and surrounding tooling like Github and paid git guis.If anything I think we have moved backwards. We are no longer looking at making copies of grep and dd. If you want to make an actual alternative to Photoshop you&#39;ll need thousands of workers spread over a lot of skill sets. You need cloud technology specialists, AI/ML experts, R&amp;D, design experts to do real studies and interviews with users, etc. You need teams of people working on out there new and untested ideas pushing the state of the art for image editing. While the alternatives are still trying to catch up to 2015 UI design patterns."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; all software will be open sourceThere&#39;s a heck of a lot of &#34;boring business software&#34; out there, often quite niche, solving problems various businesses have. Anything that survives, just by virtue it has survived, has a positive ROI for everyone involved, including the customer.Where is the supposed alternative going to come from?Are people being paid to write that software suddenly going to stop and go build it for free? Are there random people that will suddenly develop an interest in figuring out how to automate filling out a bunch of Mississippi state government permit request forms, or how to convert an obsolete file format that&#39;s only used in the gas industry to another obsolete file format and FTP it somewhere, or how to convert customer orders to a cut lists used by a multi-million dollar industrial machine of which less than 100 exist in the world?Are the customers (businesses) going to suddenly decide to hire up an engineering team and build this themselves, at probably higher cost than they pay today and definitely at way higher risk? Maybe they&#39;ll get together with a bunch of businesses with similar needs -- aka their competitors -- and pool their resources to build something?I think none of this will happen -- or will happen in such exceedingly rare circumstances it&#39;s not worth considering.Which means I&#39;m pretty confident to say there will always be proprietary software."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something I learned not long ago on this site: low quality/too long HDMI cables can make some monitors go black when the user stands or sits on a certain kind of office chair. [1] [2]Apparently it&#39;s a known issue at Dell: [3]&gt;Surprisingly, we have also seen this issue connected to gas lift office chairs. When people stand or sit on gas lift chairs, they can generate an EMI spike which is picked up on the video cables, causing a loss of sync. If you have users complaining about displays randomly flickering it could actually be connected to people sitting on gas lift chairs. Again swapping video cables, especially for ones with magnetic ferrite ring on the cable, can eliminate this problem. There is even a white paper about this issue.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voW5kEI7JKE[2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6pY4t0k1hk[3] https://support.displaylink.com/knowledgebase/articles/73861..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a lot of respect for this developer’s patience. Back when I was a solo developer, these types of issues were death by a thousand paper cuts. I didn’t have the skills to deal with the amount of support and debugging these kinds of problems entail. And it’s especially frustrating when the answer ends up being “It’s due to how the manufacturer of this monitor just didn’t properly implement the spec and there’s nothing I can do to fix it.” I can’t imagine writing software where this is the norm! So kudos to the developer!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first issue, where multiple monitors have the same vendor/model/manufacture date/serial number, couldn&#39;t that be solved by also storing which port it&#39;s connected to? That way, if you have two HDMI ports, if both monitors have the same UUID, you store settings based on port rather than UUID. I don&#39;t know if this is possible with this new USB-C world, but at least with traditional hardware, it seems like the OS knows which port a monitor is connected to.Anyways, interesting post. It&#39;s always fun to discover how much hardware is just broken and doesn&#39;t actually correctly implement the protocols or features it&#39;s supposed to implement."</p>

Then they take the offspring, test for blight resistance and rebreed those back with purebred American chestnuts. Then they repeat the process. Take those offspring, select for blight resistance, rebreed with American species, etcAfter a few generations they created an American chestnut tree that looks almost exactly like the purebred versions but retains the blight resistance of the Japanese and Chinese speciesReally amazing work[0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbrY-J0bpto"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cool to see this here and people talking about it. I volunteered with the American Chestnut Foundation during my summers in high school. Usually spent a few weeks on the Meadowview research farm collecting catkins off trees, “processing” the catkins to bottle the pollen, bagging trees to prevent uncontrolled cross pollination, and pollinating trees by hand.My uncle and I also usually took hikes in NC to try and find remaining trees with pollen in the wild. From what I understand, the pollen from these few remaining living trees is used to help re-introduce regional biodiversity into the backcrossed American/Chinese hybrids.Highly recommend going and helping out on the farm if you can spare a week or two, or joining your state chapter if you’ve got one - or sending your kids!"</p>

eastern North America and I’ve read estimates that they may have been a quarter to a third of the trees in those forests before the blight arrived.1 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_chestnut"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The paradox is that you can&#39;t create a theory of music whose notes are both (a) evenly spaced and (b) contain the integer ratios.You want (a) because it you gives you nice algebraic properties (the music structure is invariant under frequency shifts). You want (b) because small-integer ratios are pleasant sounding -- partly culturally-acquired taste, partly because physics gives musical instruments acoustic spectra in integral multiples of a fundamental frequency: f, 2f, 3f ... nf. Small-integer ratios are naturally occurring and very recognizable.Modern tuning (C-f &#34;12-TET&#34; in the article) almost, approximately satisfies (a) and (b) simultaneously. &#34;12&#34; means there&#39;s twelve tones between f and 2f; the ratio between adjacent tones is defined to be 2^{1/12}. This tuning can&#39;t contain both f and 3f (so it fails (b)), but it *can* contain f and 2^{19/12}f ~ 2.9966f, which is actually close enough to 3f to be indistinguishable. (Almost works!) But as you build ratios out of larger integers, it audibly falls apart. The closest you can get to (5/3)f is 2^{9/12}f = ~1.6818f, which is already 10% of the way to the next note. And it rapidly gets worse.This is why two on-paper-identical notes can end up audibly different, depending on what key you&#39;re starting with (and hence how they are approached). There&#39;s tension internal to music theory itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The explanation of enharmonic equivalent (though the author didn&#39;t use this term) is right, but I do take problem with this sentence:&gt; but what musical difference does it make? In the present day, the answer is, none whatsoever.This is not quite right. On all fretless instruments, including most bowed strings and the human voice, enharmonic equivalent notes still have different pitches. The subtle differences in intonation is incredibly important and noticeable on the violin, for example."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My thought is, if you peel back the first layer of music theory, you discover a chaotic, lawless world. The main thing I&#39;ve noticed is that this is extremely unnerving to engineers, who want to learn it as a precise hierarchical structure. Regular people are more focused on the fact that somebody is somehow making it all sound good, and want to learn how to do that.On the other hand, most musicians are completely ambivalent to it, or even thrive in the chaos. Yet the &#34;rules&#34; are useful because they provide a common ground for forming ensembles, or connecting composer and performer. We&#39;ve watched musicians go down the rabbit hole of nonstandard scales, innovative notation systems, etc., only to discover that nobody can play their material.I&#39;m a double bassist. I&#39;m happy just to be able to coordinate my ears, brain, and hands, well enough to play the same note the same way twice if I want to. Claiming that I have conscious control over temperament would be laughable. I&#39;ve got too much other stuff to think about: The notes on the page, the non-notated passages (many jazz bass parts are expected to be improvised), tempo and rhythm, connecting with the rest of the band and the audience, who&#39;s coming in the front door, and so forth. This stuff is all happening in real time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is the great fear of many come to pass - censorship by algorithm. Facebook didn&#39;t outright ban sharing of the Hunter Biden laptop stories like Twitter did, they instead tweaked their algorithm to prevent the story from spreading. We found out about it this time because Zuckerberg owned up to it, but what about next time? For all we know, Facebook, Google and Twitter are doing this right now on a range of other subjects.It&#39;s scary to think that just 2 to 3 corporations have the power to construct a false reality around us, in a way that&#39;s virtually impossible for us to detect."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So let me get this straight.Facebook has absolute control to limit the spread of a story or news on their platform.Facebook has absolute control to outright block specific content based on an algorithm they control.Facebook can and will editorialize content posted on their platform.Facebook has absolute control over the content that users see.Can someone, anyone, please explain to me why Facebook is not a publisher? Why should Facebook continue to receive Section 230 protections? They are gatekeeper, publisher, and editor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found interesting how during the podcast, Zuckerberg compared the suppression of the story to due process in the justice system. A snippet from the podcast (with minor edits, starting from 7:25 of this video clip [1]):&gt; Joe Rogan: is there regret for not having it evenly distributed and for throttling the distribution of that story?&gt; [...]&gt; Zuckerberg: yeah yeah I mean it sucks because I mean it turned out after the fact...I mean the fact directors looked into it no one was able to say it was false right. So basically it had this period where it was getting less distribution&gt; it sucks though I think in the same way that probably having to go through like a criminal trial but being proven innocent in the end sucks. Like it still sucks that you had to go through a criminal trial but at the end you&#39;re free&gt; I don&#39;t know if the answer would have been don&#39;t do anything or don&#39;t have any process. I think the process was pretty reasonable you know. We still let people share it. But obviously you don&#39;t want situations like that[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN3PIGLDscQ"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Banning Delta altogether seems disproportionate. Banning all 767s would be silly. Telling Delta they can’t fly this one particular plane to Accra seems to me like a perfectly reasonable response to a run of incidents involving that plane within a short period of time.Honestly, the only thing that  surprises me about this is that other aviation authorities haven’t followed suit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Between 2010 and 2013, I used to fly to Ghana most summers. Delta would use old aircraft on this route. Inflight entertainment was the screen hanging in the middle of the aisle. Watching a movie on the flight was a challenge. You had to bring your own entertainment to pass the time.Eventually I stopped using that route and took KLM instead. KLM to Schiphol and to Accra. KLM was in a world of it&#39;s own. Similar planes irrespective of whether I was in the US or flying to Ghana. Personal inflight entertainment. The service was way better."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know PAM gets criticized here and there, sometimes heavily, but it&#39;s actually a super flexible system.  The thing that really stands out is that no application actually needs to know about all the various authentication methods possible.  That file in /etc/pam.d/ just corresponds to the app&#39;s &#34;service name&#34;, and you (as the machine administrator) can put in it whatever you want.  The app just needs to go &#34;Hey PAM, I want to start authentication using service &#39;sudo&#39;&#34;, and then PAM will send instructions to the app, like &#34;Display the text &#39;Place your finger on the fingerprint scanner&#39;&#34;, or &#34;Display the text &#39;Password:&#39; and then prompt for masked input&#34;.It&#39;s really quite flexible, and despite its age, still works pretty well with current programming paradigms, whether your UI is text or graphical or whatever.  The one oddity is that when it asks you to prompt for some kind of user input, it will actually expect you to return the resulting input from the same callback function.  So if you&#39;re using a modern-ish GUI toolkit, you&#39;ll need to run the PAM stuff off on a different thread that&#39;s allowed to block while your UI thread is free to do what it needs to do.  But overall that&#39;s just... fine?"</p>

What&#39;s the private bank&#39;s balance sheet look like when they use the central bank money for stock buy-backs instead of for increasing commercial lending?For example, the Fed says it&#39;s unloading the mortgage-backed securities it bought up in 2008-2009.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People should understand this:A free tier is a loss-leader, intended to support sales of the paid product.If too many “…have been happily using Slack’s free plan for years”, then Slack will have to change the terms.Generally, storage and access to storage cost money. If you aren’t paying for it, it is definitely temporary, whether anyone says it explicitly or not. I don’t just mean in a “nothing lasts forever” way, but that it will gone in the relatively short term. This is just reality."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting (and sad) how the forums of yesteryear have essentially gone away entirely, with no good solutions popping up to replace them. I know they were/are incredibly prone to security issues, but they were good at one thing and one thing only: community.I recall spending a crazy amount of time refreshing the index on a site called TradeGamesNow (and to a lesser degree CheapAssGamer) waiting for new posts/comments. Now every site on the web either has a Subreddit (too much tertiary noise), Discord (I&#39;m terrified of making a post on the wrong server by accident), or (to a lesser degree) Slack (limited features, as noted in the article).As to the Slack announcement: I get that guests staying in your house for free eat not-free food. That being said, I have to imagine that Slack could offer a non-real-time updating experience (no polling, disable calls/video/file hosting) to cut down on costs (my assumption is that the active nature of the service is the biggest expense) and make it feasible for a free or $5/mo for X users &amp; unlimited guests.(I&#39;m aware that Discourse was Supposed To Be The Chosen One, but at $100/mo and no self-hosting option (that I can see), I don&#39;t think it&#39;s even considered much. But I could be wrong.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m grateful to Slack for their changes in the free plan, it forced our hands.We realized it&#39;s obvious we can&#39;t trust any of these external SaaS services, in the long run they will ALWAYS change the terms and somehow fuck the customers, paying or not. And then you will lose all the invaluable information and data that belongs to you. This has happened with other services we&#39;ve used in the past too.So we decided to just start self-hosting our own private intranet. I&#39;ve installed gitea, NextCloud, a private irc server (we&#39;re old school irssi users and love it, shoutout for thelounge -client too), a private social network site with Wordpress and Buddypress+BBpress with our own theme, among other things. Everything was super simple to setup and is trivial to maintain, works well across devices without any limitations. We control everything and don&#39;t have to worry about the big brother snooping our data. Along with these came many new business opportunities. So yeah, thanks slack."</p>

I know that anything with a kirkland brand on it is going to be so high quality and so cheap that it feels like I found a cheat.What&#39;s funny about costco is that their in store experience is so good that they have seemingly ignored any sort of online presence.  Yeah they have a website, but it doesn&#39;t seem to actually have a comprehensive list of everything they sell.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel the need to defend Finnish cases. Yes, they have a gazillion, but unlike other languages you might know (eg Latin or German), there’s nothing difficult about Finnish cases.Most cases are simply used where English would use prepositions. In Finnish those are postfixes instead, a bunch of letters tacked onto the end of a word. It’s a case and not a word because there’s no space between the two, that’s it.Eg “talo” means house. Talossa means “in the house”. Talon means “of the house” (actually, “the house’s” - omg English has cases too, super difficult). Talolla means “on (top of) the house”. That’s not harder than prepositions is it?I did cheat a bit, because with some words you first got to find the root before you can tack on “-ssa”. The root of talo is also talo, but for some words you got to apply a (simple, purely letter-based) rule. Eg the root of “ankka” (duck) is “anka” so “the duck’s house” becomes “ankan talo”. There’s a bunch of rules to find the root of a noun and you can learn them in half an hour or so.There’s plenty stuff that’s harder about Finnish (notably the vocabulary), but the cases are peanuts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It should be Japanese, of course!Japanese can be written using either the Latin alphabet, or Chinese characters.  The two most common writing systems in the world.  It can also be written with its own elegant and purely phonetic writing system.  There&#39;s even Braille, Morse code, and sign language encodings.  It is truly media agnostic.Japanese has a regular grammar.  From a linguist&#39;s perspective, aside from the politeness system, it&#39;s really quite normal for a language.  Very little in it to surprise a Finnish, Turkish or Korean speaker.   (Unlike English, which if first discovered today spoken by a people in the interior of New Guinea, would lead to accusations of a linguistic hoax.)Finally, some 40% of Japanese vocabulary is based on Chinese, and Chinese and Japanese technical terms flow freely between the languages to this day.  Another ~20% of Japanese vocabulary is borrowed from European languages like English or Portuguese.  The majority of the world already speaks a significant amount of Japanese and they don&#39;t even know it!  For this reason, Chinese, European, and American, alike, usually find it quite easy to learn."</p>

WFH was a big wakeup call, I think -- once you step away from the commute for a year or two, trying to sit in traffic again seems insane. I guess it&#39;s a successful &#34;unboiling of the frog,&#34; where we realized that car infratructure has been turned up for the last century to unbearable levels.I hate cars. I don&#39;t want to use them on a daily basis. I&#39;m cheap, and I don&#39;t want to own one, or maintain one. I try to do everything I can by biking or walking, or transit if those aren&#39;t feasible. It is nearly impossible in 95% of the USA.Selfishly, I really want the USA to bring city centers back to livable levels by banning most cars and redesigning them for humans. Otherwise I&#39;m absolutely going to end up moving to Europe eventually -- likely the Netherlands -- because driving a car is just so unpleasant for me. I&#39;d rather not learn a whole new language and leave my family and friends so far behind, but especially since covid I&#39;ve come to realize that driving makes me miserable, and I need other ways to get from my home into the world."</p>

You can visit the mountains, beaches, camp in hundreds of national and state parks (for cheap or free).In Florida, some of my fondest memories was jumping into two cars with my teenage friends and riding out the one hour drive to Daytona, where we&#39;d drive our car literally on the beach and then plop down right next to it, sneaking sips of Natural Light that we illegally smuggled there between sessions of football and boogey boarding. Then we&#39;d get back in the car and be back before curfew.All of our vacations were to the Smokey Mountains, a mere 9 hour drive from central Florida. Dad would drive overnight in our minivan while us kids slept in the back seats. We&#39;d pull up to a cabin first thing in the morning and excitedly rush to our claim our beds for the few days we&#39;d be staying there. Despite sleeping a little rough in the car, we were more than energized by the newness of the locale and the existence of elevation we were quite unfamiliar with back home on the relatively flat peninsula, and we&#39;d proceed to hike the woods around the cabin to survey the land.Plenty of human and natural connection is to be had with your own vehicle in America. And I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I always thought it was strange when people would say &#34;The automobile represent freedom&#34;. I grew up in a &#34;streetcar suburb&#34; and later moved to a big city. So for me, cars were always viewed as an expensive annoyance you might need depending on your life circumstances, but certainly not something you&#39;d go out of your way to buy unless you needed it.But as I got older and lived briefly in a suburb of Houston TX it finally clicked: the way so many subdivisions are planned you are quite literally trapped inside your subdivision unless you have a vehicle. Need to buy groceries? Get to school? Go hang out with friends? You need a car. You aren&#39;t heading anywhere interesting without one.So I get why people have a romanic idea of the automobile, but that romance is a side-effect of poor urban planning."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"At a company I worked for we had a strong incentive program to submit patent applications for our work, where each listed inventor would receive a monetary payment of ~$2-3k if the patent was deemed worthy and filed by our lawyers, and an additional bonus if it was granted some years later.The problem is the patent applications would flood in from employees with the hopes that the non-technical lawyers would miss some due diligence like finding prior art. Worst case is you wasted a bit of time on the application, best case is you just made an easy $3k.Now the company was not a patent troll, so I don&#39;t recall hearing about any instances of them actually suing anyone over patents. But it still opened my eyes to how ridiculous the software patent process really is. You don&#39;t have to create anything, write any code, or even be the brightest engineer with a unique idea. You just need to get that idea past enough people. The entire industry is a scam for money, no matter which end of it you&#39;re on."</p>

  Adding user gesture requirement for readText and writeText APIs

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Or, maybe this is just a new “fad” for juvenile orcas that could go out of fashion as they grow up, Jared Towers, director of Canadian research organization Bay Cetology, tells NPR. In the 1990s, scientists observed another strange orca trend, but it has since faded away.&gt; &#34;They&#39;d kill fish and just swim around with this fish on their head,&#34; Towers tells NPR. &#34;We just don&#39;t see that anymore.”Imagining the behavioral / fashion trends of Orcas over time is really fascinating :D"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article mentions it. One of the most mind-blowing facts is that there has never been a recorded human death caused by an Orca.There are many possible explanations for it, selective eaters, not tasty, knowing what they are getting themselves into.At the same time they are curious, playful, and it seems emotional, if they have trends like breaking boats &amp; carrying dead fish. It&#39;s a miracle such playfulness never ever accidentally killed a human.After Sperm whales they have the largest brains in the world. Of course big sections of that is dedicated to their complicated bodily functions. But I think we are most likely severely underestimating their intelligence.Edit: &#34;a recorded human death in the wild&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is at least one well-documented case of a pod of orcas understanding enough about people and boats for them to to initiate a mutually-beneficial and reciprocal understanding of how to cooperate in hunting whales.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_whales_of_Eden,_New_Sou...Given this, I think it is conceivable that these orcas may have achieved some sort of understanding of fishing boats as competing with them for their food, and developed a hostility towards boats as a result.IIRC, not all orca pods hunt whales or other marine mammals, and many are generally fish eaters. I would not be at all comfortable in a life raft or similar boat in the presence of orcas that do hunt seals or emperor penguins."</p>

Imagine you want to forward an email sent to you through an alias, to someone else. You&#39;ve now given that person control over your email alias.Every email from an email alias includes a link. That link is used to look at the details of that email alias and gives you the option to deactivate it. You&#39;d think there would be some login verification to prevent just anyone from using that link, but no, anyone that has this link, can now deactivate your email alias. The password itself is formatted in json, compressed with deflate, and simply tacked on to the end of the link&#39;s URL. When you click on the link, the destination webpage takes the end of the URL, decompresses the deflate, and serves a deactivate button to deactivate the email alias. When you click on that button, the email alias&#39;s address and password are sent to DDG&#39;s API and your email alias is disabled."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have always had an introverted nature. As a child, I would immerse myself for hours reading a book or other solitary activity. When my parents sent me to my room for punishment, they found it didn&#39;t work as I would not be begging to come out.But at different times of my life, I have been quite active socially. My college years especially were filled with social interactions that I grew to enjoy. It started out as friends and roommates dragging me to one thing or another, but after a while I instigated a lot of it.But I naturally gravitated to a career in programming where I can spend 10 hours straight at the keyboard with almost no interaction. My hobby project is a major one that deals with a whole new way to manage data. It has consumed several years of my life as I spend a great deal of my &#39;free time&#39; thinking about it, writing code, or optimizing something.My introverted nature has affected my family life as I withdraw into my own little world. My wife sometimes wonders if I am depressed, unhappy, or stressed. Although I am perfectly content, I have to force myself to come out of my shell and interact much more with the wife and kids (and friends and neighbors). Many of my fellow programmers that I have worked with over the years also exhibit some of these tendencies.I guess it is debatable whether this adds to or subtracts from actual creativity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s kind of easy to take this extremely literally and pick it apart, which a lot of comments here are doing, but might be helpful to broaden what “solitude” means and maybe even read it as though it’s a bit allegorical. Also important to remember this was more than 100 years ago, and that he’s talking very specifically about how to write poetry. All the way through I felt like he could have been talking about social media.Metaphorically, he seems to be saying (to me even more strongly than isolation): that motivation needs to be intrinsic, it should come from yourself and your own desires, not from others; and that you should practice your craft intensely and make sure the practice of writing poetry is free from interruptions or noise that cloud things. He may be naming the state of flow we all want using words for it that we’re not used to these days, along with a push for writers to set their own standards and not judge themselves by publishing metrics. These are fairly timeless and applicable ideas today, not to mention all of us programmers frequently dream of solitude and perhaps resent the fact that we almost never get it at work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Humans are fundamentally solitary. That is our natureAmazing, every word of what that guy said is wrong.Maybe he was actually talking about cats, that would make sense. But humans literally can&#39;t function outside of a society."</p>
