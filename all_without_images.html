								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s an artist called Øystein Wyller Odden that works with mains hum. I find it pretty fascinating:Kraftbalanse is a musical translation of the hum from the mains; i. e. the frequency of the alternating current. The piece is based on the fact that this frequency is not stable, it fluctuates subtly around 50 Hz as a direct result of supply and demand in the power market.The composition consists of a self-resonating piano that is tuned to resonate on 50 hz and overtones of 50 hz (100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz etc.) The piano is fitted with vibration-elements – transducers – plugged directly into the electrical grid, causing the resonance and timbre of the piano to change with the fluctuations on the power market.The piano is accompanied by a string octet. The musicians are equipped with voltmeters that measure the frequency of the current in real time, as well as a score of instructions on how to respond to changes in this frequency.https://vimeo.com/370554138"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Stripe is extremely bad at fraud. I have a company that continues to charge my credit card monthly, their website and email do not work anymore. I continue to charge back them every single month, and Stripe continues to charge my card. This has been going on for about 7 months now. If I ask them to help, they tell me to contact AMEX, I contact AMEX they tell me to contact Stripe.The website doesn&#39;t work, the email doesn&#39;t work, I charge it back every single month, yet Stripe doesn&#39;t care one bit.Attempting to contact Stripe results in emails asking if I need help resetting my password (yes I legit sent an email asking for them to investigate the &#34;company&#34; and they sent back a reply with details on how to reset my password), to telling me to contact my credit card provider.Honestly both companies are giant bags of turds, if you can you should look elsewhere, you can save money on almost every fee, there are alternatives to every single product they provide, and pretty much all of the alternatives are varying degrees of better or cheaper."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The one part of this article that I totally agree with is how terrible the API integration has become. In the early days, Stripe sold itself on a few things, one of which was the simplicity of integration. Since the whole PaymentIntents and SetupIntents introduction (along with the documentation fiasco that happened at the same time), integrating with Stripe is something like PayPal from 10 years ago. Its shit.PaymentIntents workflow (including the necessity to listen for webhooks) deserves a special place in hell. Its like they decided to copy Paypal IPN.I have used, recommended and intgrated Stripe to multiple businesses over the years (generating hundreds of US$ millions). For the past 2 years or so, I have migrated most of them away from Stripe, and any new integrations are done through other payment processors."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is extremely confusing and filled with do many errors it&#39;s hard to even list them all. However, the bit I wanted to focus on was the author&#39;s claim that PayPal got &#34;sued&#34; and &#34;stopped taking money from people&#34;. Getting sued is part of the ordinary course of business for a company like PayPal, and ~85% of lawsuits like that go nowhere, and result in no internal changes. The specific lawsuit the author seems to have been talking about was dismissed entirely by a judge in July, because the contact you sign with Facebook when you use their account explicitly forbids you from suing them instead of going through private arbitration proceedings: https://www.pokertube.com/article/chris-moneymaker-s-class-a... (Chris Moneymaker&#39;s Class Action Lawsuit Against PayPal Falls At First Hurdle).And again, this is the kind of thing that happens to PayPal all the time. The fact that some random lawsuit that never even required a substantial reply from PayPal got picked up by Zed as evidence of their bad behavior &#34;finally catching up to them&#34; really erodes my confidence in the way he represents any of the other details in this article. What else is he misrepresenting or exaggerating?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"May I suggest a purely rational, evidence based take?The trap is your belief in a linear relationship between effort and
outcome. Working harder and longer produces more productivity, right?That&#39;s false.As you say so yourself, your memory goes to shit. It&#39;s not just a law
of diminishing returns. For coders, past a certain point, exhaustion
leads you to start undoing your work. You are into negative
productivity.I&#39;ve pushed through all-nighters where I poured out a few thousand LOC
only to find the next day that I had broken everything and introduced
more bugs than I had time to fix. I just had to revert. An exhausted
hacker is worse than no hacker at all. You&#39;re a liability to yourself
and the project.So, like driving when tired, realise that the urge to continue is
completely irrational, and probably based in the emotional drives of
fear or pride. It would be completely irrational for any manager to
want you to code in that state, and anyone who pushes you to is also
the idiot."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; small hurdles spike my anxiety, my anger flares at the slightest confrontation, I notice fewer jokes, fewer attempts on my part to make people laugh. My memory goes to all hell too and I can’t seem to concentrate on prolonged amounts of anything. Books fall off my radar, I stop listening to music. My phone is in my hand at all times, scrolly-anxiety-inducing apps become impossible to avoid.This describes me perfectly. Unfortunately I can’t take a break because it’s entirely due to being the parent of young children."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On top of taking regular breaks, I think we should also work slower. Burnout is a scary place to be in. While the news calls it “quiet quitting”, I think many people are simply burnt out from the last few years of world conditions and add on the rubber band effect of everything going back to “normal”. It’s just too much change in a short amount of time.I wrote a book about this topic when I was in a state of burnout. I had enough of the many different aspects of the world (overwork, the news, social media, etc) that I believe led to stress based illness.I don’t feel bad for taking time off anymore. You got to put yourself first sometimes to be able to show up for others."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Everytime I read about this, it makes me think about this game:https://termsandconditions.game/(SSL warning)These shenanigans are not required, they are very much designed on purpose.Indeed, corporations can follow the &#34;Do Not Track&#34; header. There is nothing in the EU law that requires a banner, only informed consent.So if I have DNT=1 set in my browser, pop a quick non modal notification saying &#34;we wants to track you but but we won&#39;t because you said not to. Click here if you want to change that&#34;. Solved.I&#39;m informed. I made my choice.But that&#39;s not what it&#39;s about.Because the vast majority of people would not consent. Who are you kidding? This tracking is not benefiting us. It&#39;s like when politician says it&#39;s &#34;for the children&#34; or &#34;to fight terrorists&#34;. Everybody knows there are full of it.So the banner is just the most annoying way that is legally allowed to try to get people to force-accept tracking. In fact, some banner are crafted to make rejection the hardest path for this very reason.Those corps chose to make the web terrible a little bit more every day: tracking, auto play, scroll hijacking, dark patters, cookie banners...We should thank the UE a 1000 times to reveal who are the bad players."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Firefox also plans to have builtin support for auto-rejecting cookies when there is a consent banner. See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1783015. From my understanding, this should be similar to Consent-O-Matic. It will be available on both desktop and mobile versions. This is enabled recently by default in Nightly (but I don&#39;t use Nightly)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ugh i hate these banners.The web browser should control the consent. Like how it worked in IE5 before everyone realized asking was super annoying and just assumed yes.It makes no sense for a web site to collect state to know if its allowed to collect state."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Honestly I hope Google go through with this as it will direct people to Firefox so they can continue using ad-blockers like uBlock Origin.I don&#39;t know how many will come but if Google wants to implode their plugin ecosystem in favour of more advertising, and if that action increases Firefox adoption (and thus a healthy browser ecosystem via competition) then I am for it."</p>

Of course, this does not negate the fact that V3 is mainly there to boost the ad ecosystem of Google, but I&#39;d never want my screen casting extension to be mining bitcoin on the background. That said, I&#39;m not sure how this is going to scale long term, given that it sometimes takes 2+ weeks for the web store review team to approve a genuine one-line change.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"After playing with a C64 Maxi replica (mine has the VIC-20 colors) I can&#39;t think of using a vintage computer without a matching keyboard (and often mouse). The experience is not only the pixels on the screen and the sounds of the speaker, but the whole spatial relationship with the physical object.It probably doesn&#39;t need to be an almost perfect replica like the 64 Maxi, but having the keys in the same places (even if there is no ESC key - looking at you, DEC LK-201). On my desk, my two daily drivers are a Sun Type 7c (Type 7 is in storage, waiting for its rotation) and an IBM/Lexmark/Unicomp PC-122 Model M, and I can say each of them provides a unique experience, tactile, spatial, and, on the Model M&#39;s case, auditory.I&#39;m thinking about learning how to build keyboards and make a couple DIY ones. Switches can&#39;t be the same, but, at least, physical layout, keycap shapes, labels, and colors can be matched."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This point is so good and so important:&#34;Getting lost in your knowledge management system is a fantastic way to avoid creating things. Or calling that friend you’re estranged from. Or doing anything else even mildly threatening. It’s also a fantastic way to convince yourself that unpreparedness is what’s between you and creative work. If you believe you’re unprepared, know that you will never transmute into the perfectly prepared person that you think exists in the future.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think we conflate two types of note-taking:  1. List-style notes of things we need to remember

  2. School-style notes of information and ideas

I think the former requires a tool, but nothing particularly sophisticated - Apple Notes for example with its search indexing is fineI think the latter we write only to stimulate our brain to process information and learn better.I think there is a discrepancy where a lot of tools attempt to make Type 2 notes more &#34;convenient&#34;, i.e. to trying to somehow make them an extension of our brain, but the truth is that it&#39;s like hacking a hard drive to work as fast as a CPU register -- retrieving and working with information is always going to be orders of magnitude slower than working through your thoughts in your brain."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Any article that pretends to know what the right way of taking notes (say, &#34;This is known as a commonplace book, and it is about how detailed your note-taking system should be unless you plan on thinking more elaborately than Leonardo da Vinci.&#34; in this article) is missing the point.People think differently, people have different purposes and goals, people have different constraints on their time, their memory, their field. Can you procrastinate on note-taking? Sure. So can you on writing, and publishing, and building an audience, and writing papers, and doing the dishes.Can people have a fantastic creative output by just opening a blank page and jotting down their thoughts? Sure. Can other people write great books with an elaborate notetaking system? Of course. There are plenty of people out there with terrific, obsessive note-taking and reference systems, Kubrick being one of the prime examples.As someone with what looks from the outside to be an overarchitected note-taking system ( https://publish.obsidian.md/manuel ), it is a system that works great for me, and it is a system that makes me more creative and helps me discover ideas I would have never been able to articulate without. I used linear sketchbooks where I would write and draw whatever for years, filling hundreds of notebooks, and it came nowhere near my obsidian setup in terms of output and effectiveness."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was curious how this worked so I did some reading which I found interesting. In short, this uses ptrace, which is the same Linux kernel mechanism used by debuggers, to attach to a running process and manipulate the open file descriptors (amongst other things) while it runs. So basically it attaches to the process, and changes stdin (fd 0) and stdout (fd 1) to point to your tmux session stdout and stdin.Pretty cool use of ptrace."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a nice tool (reptyr), but not particularly convenient to use, requiring several steps to move the process to the background and remembering the PID etc. I do wish this was a more streamlined, standard feature of Unix/Linux shells.

Not a knock on it - just curious if I&#39;m missing something.My problem with these types of plugins is that, although it&#39;s a bit more annoying to type out a few more characters, with my vanilla Vim workflow I can pre-compute the motions in my head - I can figure out I need to type d7l or whatever way before I get to the point in my editing where I need to, and as I&#39;m typing it out I&#39;m already thinking about what I want to do next. With sneak, easymotion, or leap, it looks like I can&#39;t actually figure out what keys I need to press to get to where I want until I&#39;ve already started the motion. That means I need to take some time to read the label, etc. So maybe I&#39;ve saved a few milliseconds of not having to type one or two more keys, but I lose that and more by having to parse what to do.Curious about other experiences and if I&#39;m off base though.[1]: https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I didn&#39;t expect to learn much from this article - but it actually really resonated with me. I often am responsible for purchasing decisions and found much of the advice to sales reps really insightful.(1) The number one thing that bothers me is when I reach out to a company to explore their product and I get scheduled with a BDR who&#39;s sole job is to &#34;qualify&#34; me as a lead. I know BDRs are in a tough spot - but if you have someone reaching out and interested in your product, take advantage of that and get them straight to the person who can demo and answer questions. I&#39;m shocked at how many companies make me want to prove myself as a customer before spending time on demoing.(2) Ask before recording meetings, and if someone doesn&#39;t want to be recorded make sure you actually have the ability to turn that recording off. I&#39;ve been on calls where the person who set up the Zoom/Gong wasn&#39;t on the call, and so no one had the ability to stop recording.(3) The details of what is shared on calls is often completely lost. Every time a new person gets on the call, they ask the exact same questions that have already been answered. Make the customer feel as though you&#39;re interested in their business, have discussed their pain points, and have a plan ready to help them.(4) Discounting discussions are always a pain. It&#39;s a game that no one likes to play.(5) Offer to send some swag to the implementing team at your customer - not just your champion. It&#39;s a nice gesture and goes a surprisingly long way towards building positive sentiment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just thought the call out for &#34;Protected Health Information&#34; was weird, and it&#39;s wrong. If you&#39;re just having small talk with someone on a zoom call and you say &#34;Yeah, that last COVID booster really wiped me out, I was in bed for 2 days&#34;, that doesn&#39;t mean the call contains &#34;PHI&#34;.First of all, you shared it. The whole reason for protecting PHI in the first place is limiting what others can do with your information, not what you can do with it. And if you share it willingly, and not for medical purposes, it doesn&#39;t mean that the person you shared it with suddenly has a higher burden of security/privacy with that info.Just calling this out because so often see people that fundamentally misunderstand what &#34;PHI&#34; means in a legal sense, and specifically what the HIPAA regulations require."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who was accidentially thrust into an IT role and had to do some purchasing... I absolutely hated sales cales and B2B selling. The simple act of buying a server means finding an &#34;authorized reseller&#34;, going through some sales calls, proving that you are a worthy customer, then they want to know all about your other setup to make sure it is &#34;supported&#34; (which turns out to have no consequence whatsoever). The quoted price is completely different from what is listed, and there are arbitrary surcharges. Isn&#39;t there an easier way? Yes, but the pointy haired boss decided we have to go the proper route. Funnily the reseller had a very trustworthy name like &#34;usedserverdiscount24.de&#34; or something.The worst one was when I was trying to get some antivirus licenses. We were willing to spend a lot on Sophos, because it had good reviews, we were happy with the trial, and so on. But the reseller tried to upsell us, insisted we buy matching firewalls, and so on. So in the end we stuck with Windows Defender (we got a bunch of licenses for Advanced Threat Protection from MS for free)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fwiw I had something akin to the overview effect when I attended a full solar eclipse. I thought I was prepared. I had read up on what to expect because I wanted to make the most of the experience for the kids. I wanted to make sure we observed the &#34;shadow bands&#34; (snake like shadows traversing across single colored surfaces that aren&#39;t always visible).Everything did proceed as I expected (including the shadow bands), but when the eclipse was full, the earth went quiet. All the animals stopped and wondered (including the younger children who were boisterously playing seconds before the full effect).As I stared up into the heavens, I had this deeply profound realization that our planet is traveling through space like all the other planets. The observation and experience of an eclipse made the abstract concept of space a reality and brought it closer to me in a way that just thinking (a lot) about space has never done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It was among the strongest feelings of grief I have ever encountered. The contrast between the vicious coldness of space and the warm nurturing of Earth below filled me with overwhelming sadness. Every day, we are confronted with the knowledge of further destruction of Earth at our hands: the extinction of animal species, of flora and fauna . . . things that took five billion years to evolve, and suddenly we will never see them again because of the interference of mankind. It filled me with dread. My trip to space was supposed to be a celebration; instead, it felt like a funeral.Very well written. Conveys his feelings quite well I find."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unfortunately sending every millionaire into space for them to realize this is an hostile environment is taking us closer to earth destruction. Sorry to be sour about this, but people could just teach themself astronomy and realize there is no place out there to welcome us when the earth will be on the verge to become unlivable. Even assuming a colony of a dozen women/men is ever established on the moon or Mars, they will die in a matter or months or years once the tether to earth is broken.Reading this guy paid millions of $ to realize these basic facts fills me with overwhelming sadness too. Can his experience be of value for us? Given that he could have discovered what he just experienced by reading good books, I think this n+1 experience has zero value. Send human beings in space to perform scientific experiments. Period."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While I agree this is a problem - one which I have been the victim of as well - Amazon accepts the return with no questions and/or charges. This, of course, is not a great consolidation, especially for a novice who doesn&#39;t understand or encounters it too late. But I strongly disagree with &#34;Amazon runs little to no risk selling the fraudulent products, but still makes money off of them.&#34; In the next paragraph the author outlines how they&#39;ve lost trust in Amazon and will not be buying electronics. Erosion of trust is absolutely a massive risk, and one that eBay is also arguably pretty publicly recovering from. I suspect Amazon would prefer not to have fake drives and the costs associated with returns and erosion of trust for the infinitesimal rounding error that makes up the extra revenue they get from fake $20 thumb drives.
I&#39;m far from an Amazon fanboy, but I think the problem is more complex than Amazon turning a blind eye because they&#39;re making $10k extra profit a year from phony thumb drives. As an outsider, it seems like a difficult tradeoff of not creating incredible hurdles to list products, versus counterfeits getting through.In my case, the phony thumb drive I bought was delisted before I got home from the walk to the mailbox, literally."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think there&#39;s one thing that should be clarified from the article. &#34;Sponsored&#34; does not mean that the product is &#34;sponsored by Amazon&#34; as italicized in the article. It means the seller paid money to be at the top of the search query.Perhaps it is a healthy dose of old aged jadedness, but I have a habit of trying to avoid Sponsored items."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have refused to give Amazon any business of my own for several years because their directly-operated logistics business is morally disgusting to me. Realistically they run many businesses, that’s one of them. Their retail business is little more than branding. Their real business is private infrastructure.The retail business overall is a scam. Example: I’ve been trying to find a comforter for a while, and I haven’t been happy with some of the options I found because a lot of other ecommerce sites have not great search experiences. I thought, well I can search Amazon for my preferences and buy it elsewhere. Nope, not even a single filter I applied was true for any search results I looked at. Amazon didn’t even try to serve me cotton comforters, much less any other refinements they offered.They’re in the business of selling business. Whether that’s their logistics connecting suppliers and shipping with sales, or it’s their tech services connecting startups with time shares on a server.I wouldn’t buy a USB drive or a blanket from IBM either. It’s the same thing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is so much more to our report than what was focused on in the WSJ article. The full report will be shared shortly…"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “Outside his online play, Hans is the fastest rising top player in Classical [over-the-board] chess in modern history,” the report says, while comparing his progress to the game’s brightest rising stars. “Looking purely at rating, Hans should be classified as a member of this group of top young players. While we don’t doubt that Hans is a talented player, we note that his results are statistically extraordinary.”I basically made the argument that, in any sport, when a player does statistically much, much better than their previous performance would predict, that in and of itself should be considered evidence of cheating - perhaps not conclusive evidence, but definitely evidence warranting further investigation: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32990022&gt; All this talk of &#34;Carlsen accused him of cheating with no evidence&#34; reminds me of the blowback against some athletes in the 70s and 80s who accused rivals of taking PEDs &#34;with no evidence&#34;.&gt; Sometimes the evidence of someone doing monstrously better than can be expected by their history is sufficient IMO. I mean, look at this article about swimmer Shirley Babashoff [1], dubbed &#34;Surly Shirley&#34; at the time by the media, for suggesting the East German women were on PEDs in the 70s. Nowadays we look back on those images of the East German women, looking more manly than any dude I&#39;ve ever seen, and wonder how we considered with a straight face that they weren&#39;t on a boatload of drugs. Similarly, it completely baffles me how any sane person can think that Flo Jo wasn&#39;t on PEDs in the runup to the 1988 Olympics - her 100m dash record still stands today.&gt; I&#39;m not saying Carlsen went about it in the right way, because now Niemann is basically in an indefensible position, but I&#39;m also not willing to quickly dismiss it because Carlsen has &#34;no evidence&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The fact that an athlete in a competitive sport was allowed to partake in an event even after admitting to cheating not only once, but twice, is outrageous in itself."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33043945">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The attention economy corrupts everything it touches: not just science, but journalism, politics, and even childhood.Being famous used to be rather difficult. Of course there were exceptions (writing To Kill a Mockingbird, being the guy who dove into the river to save a drowning child, for example), but for the most part, you were going to live your life known only to the few hundred or thousand people you met personally.Even though you could pick up a phone and dial anyone in the world who owned a phone, you wouldn&#39;t, and if you did, they&#39;d hang up on you. Now you can force your idiotic, or great ideas onto the screens of millions of people you&#39;ll never meet.Is that a good or a bad thing? It&#39;s certainly bad in some ways, and this is one of them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having spent over 10 years in a university and been a professor, the problem isn’t attention seeking behavior but a lack of accountability.  For example, you can literally make up any data you want in a grant proposal and so long as it sounds right no one can or will double check it. The foundation of academia is rotting, but maybe it’s always been like this"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What most people fail to realize is that fundamentally, most principle investigators, the people who actually run the research world, are primarily fundraisers. Their day-to-day job is a mix of grant and proposal writing, relationship building/organizational meetings, and checking in on their postdocs, candidates, and lab techs.Your main goal, as a PI, is to keep your lab running, and thus research flowing, by any means possible. For some PIs, this means milking every drop of available talent and time out of your doctoral candidates, and is the most common cause of the horror stories you hear about people leaving academia. On the other end of the extreme, they can embed themselves so deeply in fundraising with private or public capital that their lab staff don&#39;t see them for more than 15-30 minutes a week, because they are essentially living their lives hopping from sales meeting to sales meeting.This wouldn&#39;t be a problem if the job of the PI was explicitly meant to be that of a salesman, but the actual role of a PI is to define the research being done. They draft the hypotheses, the expected impact, etc, because that is their intended role, but in reality these will always be constructed in a way that makes it easier for the PI to solicit funding.It&#39;s impossible for the attention economy to not play into the research funding loop then, because every set of eyeballs is another potential revenue source for future research, or a tool to justify growing the footprint of your lab. I wouldn&#39;t go so far as to call the superstructure corrupting of science though, not in those words. I&#39;d say it forces science to be mission focused, where the mission is a subtle negotiation between the people funding the research and the people performing it, and often times the person with the capital lands much closer to their ideal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In one of the later posts, the OP writes that the homeless will lose any physical thing after N weeks. So what kind of 2FA would be homeless-proof? I don&#39;t see a solution.Also, fully acknowledging Google and other bigtechs 2FA is far from ideal:The other thing is, we want at the same time Gmail to be unhackable against best hackers and state sponsored adversaries for the billions of users, including high profile dissidents, journalists, and senators who will inevitably have accounts; and at the same time to homeless people who can&#39;t keep any physical thing. It&#39;s kinda difficult to meet those conflicting requirements well at the same time.Maybe the solution should be to have some basic free state-paid email provider for those people. They are not forced to use Gmail specifically (albeit the number of non-sucking and free email providers is probably close to zero)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can definitely understand not realizing that you could lose access to your account if you lose your phone number. But once it happens the first time, could you not pick any free email that does not require 2FA, and warn fellow homeless to avoid gmail?I disagree with the idea that because a very, very niche audience is in dire straits that the design decisions should be based on their needs. The forced 2FA system has probably prevented identify theft and financial loss for a very large number of people. I&#39;m saying this as someone who thinks Google is a shady and dangerous entity in general.It&#39;s similar to the idea that hard cases make bad law."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who uses 2FA extensively and even has 1Password autofill the OTP codes - 2FA is objectively fucking brutal.Half of you in here have never met a non-technical user. These folks should not have 2FA on ever, because they can&#39;t even use the damn thing with it on.Yes, those users run a higher risk and should be notified of that extremely clearly. But 2FA is a garbage solution to the problem and it should always be possible to disable it.I&#39;m going to continue using 2FA happily like most of those in here - but man the lack of empathy is outstanding in here. I feel bad for your users.And fuck Discord for not allowing me to reset my account with my own damn email address when my phone broke that one time. Total morons, through and through. I&#39;d never want to work with anyone so objectively ignorant and unwilling to admit their ass backwards position."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was in b-school, it was like they were trying to train us to have contempt for employees, especially the jobs where wages were low. They wanted us to treat them as fungible, replaceable cogs in the machine, not unlike this whole stupid pets-vs-cattle debate with servers.I got my degree but left utterly disgusted with management and MBA types. I am of the opinion that business degrees and business school are a toxic influence on most companies and that, with a few exceptions, they would be better served by hiring management types from other parts of the business and giving them some light compliance training instead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I always wonder what business schools actually teach.I worked at a company where it was decided that the tech support department had a bunch of college drop outs and nobody had a business degree so they had to hire some.   A few MBA guys were hired.   These guys had MBAs straight out of school with no experience outside some internships... and man it showed.Their first job was dealing with managing a schedule for about 25 people who manned the the tech support line 24/7.They just couldn&#39;t wrap their heads around the idea that on the spreadsheet if you schedule someone on Friday until Midnight... starting them at Midnight on Saturday doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense / they would be working 20 hours in a row.It&#39;s was horrible working with these guys.  They embodied the &#34;I&#39;m business guy and I made my decision for business reasons and you should follow them.&#34;Eventually I (worker drone) took over the schedule because what became known as &#34;the MBA team&#34; couldn&#39;t handle it / had no idea how to balance priorities and etc.I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some great schools for business / MBAs but I really wonder what they teach at those schools if just understanding simple hours, math, responding to emails in a timely / professional manner isn&#39;t it.   It was almost like the old FedEx advert: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcoDV0dhWPAPerhaps they should all be required to go manage a McDonalds for a year or something?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I dropped out of a MBA after they had us learning that managers and employees are separate classes of people. It&#39;s just not in my character to ever think like this.I personally believe the best managers are those who have been at the front line and work their way up. They know the business from bottom-up and know how to treat people at each layer.Also got super turned off when everyone just compared where they went to get their MBA at. Those who spent like 200k to go to Wharton and do the same job as me always felt weird. Those same types can get a job just about anywhere with that credential alone but also may reduce wages &amp; profits."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is one of the strengths of a federated system run by people who aren&#39;t looking to profit. Firstly, they care about their users and are more likely to take difficult decisions, like the one Ash has made, for the good of themselves and their users. In doing so everyone involved has time to make an orderly move.Secondly, the service survives. Mastodon didn&#39;t shut down. The Fediverse didn&#39;t close. One beloved instance bows out and whilst it is a loss to many, their network endures as they thank the admin(s) and move on.You think this shows a disadvantage compared to twitter? Let&#39;s talk once twitter shuts down. Because it will. How will your argument hold up when f*c*book finishes dying? We&#39;ll find out soon enough. Or how about when a telecoms/media conglomerate buys out flickr or tumblr and puts a stake through their heart? Oh, that already happened.This is a bittersweet testament to exactly how the Internet should be built: on the foundations of openness, community and decentralisation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thanks for your hard work Ash, and sorry to hear about your loved one.As much as I love the Fediverse, I think the culture leans toward instances that are too big. I think the number of people on each instance should be much closer to 1 than 1000.The problem is self-hosting is too difficult for the average person. But that doesn&#39;t have to be the case. Self-hosting shouldn&#39;t be any more complicated or less secure than installing an app on your phone. You shouldn&#39;t need to understand DNS, TLS, NAT, HTTP, TCP, UDP, etc, etc. Domain names shouldn&#39;t be any more difficult to buy or use than phone numbers. Apps should be sandboxed in KVM/WHPX/HVP-accelerated virtual machines that run on Windows, Mac, and Linux and are secure-by-default. Tunneling out to the public internet should be a quick OAuth flow that lets you connect a given app to a specific subdomain, with TLS certs automatically obtained from Let&#39;s Encrypt and stored locally for end-to-end encryption."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A major note in the Mastodon fediverse brought down by the fact that it&#39;s administered by one person who, despite the fact they are running a social network node, never built up the real world trust connections to find somebody they could share the toil of administration with or tap in when it was time for them to bow out because we are all mortal.The technological problems are not the hard problems in this space. The hard problems are social problems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good to see it being in active development. But the one feature I&#39;m waiting for is a network whitelist. For example, it should never connect over my home or office network, but only via anonymous VPN.(Edit: I know you can do this already with firewall rules, or containers, but I don&#39;t trust myself to not make a mistake. Ideally this should be part of the OS. You should be able to right-click somewhere in the window and say &#34;use this network for this app&#34;.)The other feature I&#39;d like to see is sequential downloads, but the developers object out of principle so that is never going to come."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m really excited to see support for torrents v2.
If only because transmission will stop chocking on hybrid torrent files, which should lead to more adoption across the board.I wish transmission supported mutable torrents (BEP46). It would allow completely re-thinking distribution: grab a torrent of your favorite distribution, and have it auto-update to the latest version.Or grab a &#34;super-torrent&#34; that lists isos for all known distributions, select the ones you&#39;re interested in, and let it update... Of course, that can be used for file-sharing repositories too.Maybe transmission is not interactive enough for such a use-case (you&#39;d have to ask the user what they want to do when the torrent mutates, and possibly add simple scripting interfaces for more complex heuristics)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I first came to Linux I adopted Transmission. It seemed less featureful than others but now I like its simplicity, does everything it needs and it is also very reliable.It is not very known but there actually is a transmission-cli for common torrent operations that may come in handy some time."</p>

This article is pretty misleading.The [primary source](https://www.watson.de/leben/urlaub%20&amp;%20freizeit/879935671-...) is a slightly clickbait article asking the questions: &#34;Are AirTags allowed in checked luggage?&#34;.They reached out to Lufthanse asking them. They responded: &#34;Luggage trackers are electronic devices so they have to be turned off when the luggage is checked&#34;.It is unclear wether they really understood how AirTags work and that they are not active trackers.There are a bunch of other magazine echoing this response but I have yet to find an official statement by Lufthansa explicitly banning AirTags."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note that the reason for airport mode is a courtesy to cell-phone carriers.  It&#39;s not any air safety issue.  Rather, 300-500 cell phones all trying to contact the next cell tower, multiple times per minute, would wreak havoc on cell service.https://www.inverse.com/article/51015-cell-phone-use-on-airp...At one point, when both cell phones and laptops were new, there was perhaps a risk to the airplane&#39;s electronics.  Modern cell phones have been steadily tuned to reduce interference with other electronics though - good thing, otherwise you couldn&#39;t use them in a modern home with its dozens of connected devices.  And modern avionics have been shielded to protect them from outside electronic interference - also a good thing, otherwise the next terrorist could simply turn their laptop on.  The ban on electronic transmission is one of those regulations that was a response to technology at a particular point in time but now is largely vestigial.  You can tell because it&#39;s rarely enforced, and yet bad things do not occur just because you forgot to turn your phone to airplane mode."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Circa 2009 or so, my absolute favorite app for the iPod Touch was Patrick Collison&#39;s Offline Wikipedia (yes, that Patrick Collison: https://web.archive.org/web/20100419194443/http://collison.i...). You could download various wikis that had been pre-processed to fit in a very small space - as I recall, the entire English Wikipedia was a mere 2 GB in size. It was simply magical that I could have access to all of Wikipedia anytime, anywhere offline - especially since the iPod Touch could only connect to the Internet via WiFi. It was particularly useful while travelling, since I could load up articles and just read them on the plane.As I recall, there were several clever things that the app did to reduce the size of the dump; many stub/redirect articles were removed, the formatting was pared down to the bare minimum, and it was all compressed quite efficiently to fit in such a small space. Patrick gives more technical detail on an earlier version of the app&#39;s homepage: https://web.archive.org/web/20080523222440/http://collison.i..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FYI, the internet archive hosts a ZIM archive that has dumps of wikipedia and many other works. https://archive.org/details/zimarchiveI wish it was a little more obvious how to search it, or what all the variations mean, but it looks like a valuable resource.It is worth noting that Kiwix works on multiple OSes and on phones and has a wifi hostspot version (that you might run on an raspberry pi, for example). Internet-in-a-box similarly works as a wifi hostspot for ZOM archives.Lastly, it is worth mentioning that there are tools for creating your own ZIM files; it looks like the most straightforward way is to take a static website and use a utility to convert it into one self-contained file."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It really is remarkable how far cancer treatment has progressed, even in the last few years. I&#39;m one of the unfortunate people who, through a close family encounter with cancer, knows more about this stuff than anyone should have to. The oncologist told my relative that if they had presented with this particular cancer just a decade ago, his recommendation would have been to start hospice care.However, in recent years, a very effective checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy has been developed for the cancer in question. ~2x the success rates of traditional chemo, greatly increased overall survival statistics, and with massively reduced side effects. The results speak for themselves: this drug has granted my relative years of extra life in the worst case, and a path to a deep, long remission in the best case.I think that as the technology develops, by 2040 we&#39;ll be looking back at the present state of the art with the same incredulity that we currently have for, like, bloodletting with leeches in the Middle Ages. I think they&#39;ve been saying this for a long time now, but it&#39;s truer than ever that a real cure for cancer is right around the corner."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is not a single disease, but rather a result of several errant biological outcomes.  The mortality rates have improved a lot with better treatments, and around 60% of the population will develop some form of the disease in their lifespan.The most disturbing part is most people are unaware they are ill until relatively late stages of the disease.If you live long enough, one will know many good people that go this way. It is a worthy area of research, as it improves the lives of many families. =)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here is the only clinical data:
https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2020.38.15_suppl.46...Looks as promising as any other promising cancer therapy in phase I trials!There is a renaissance in cancer drug delivery at present, exemplified by antibody drug conjugates. The tech in the article is very interesting, and a superb bioengineering effort. A caveat is that complex multi-unit therapies don’t have a great track record. They are hard to manufacture reliably, and have a very large optimisation volume, so it’s difficult to increment the development as you only have finite resources for human trials. Contrast this with small molecules where there is a well defined process over various chemical and pharmacokinetic factors, prior to testing in humans. We also lack a good system for developing and trialing ‘platform’ tech like this - the current system is set up for single drugs/combos to be tested and eventually reimbursed in each cancer type separately. If you have a platform for delivering tailored therapies agnostic of cancer type, you will run into many barriers. There is currently only one drug I know of simultaneously approved across multiple cancer types (pembrolizumab in mismatch repair deficient tumours, a rare population). So many challenges ahead of the hype here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Every now and then I like to read through Wikipedia pages for things I know more than the average person on. It keeps me skeptical of the things I read on there. For people unfamiliar with a subject (students) I think Wikipedia pages are misleading, poorly organized, and sometimes wrong. That doesn&#39;t make Wikipedia useless, but the author&#39;s best advice is to use Wikipedia as a map to other sources of information.I don&#39;t think Wikipedia has a path forwards for fixing the quality of its articles. In my opinion it requires every page being rewritten by an expert with a single voice, as a traditional encyclopedia would have, which is the exact opposite of Wikipedia&#39;s core. Though I did check, and they have more than enough cash to write a traditional encyclopedia."</p>

Wikipedia should not be used as a source for academic purposes; the sources being referenced on Wikipedia very well could be though and as such Wikipedia is an incredibly useful tool for surface level research and schools should absolutely be taking this approach to using it.They should not, under any circumstance, have children &#34;Googling&#34; the answer to questions. Most of these kids parents already use that phrase as a keystone of their parental pedagogy and they don&#39;t need that in school, too.Wikipedia is wonderful. They have more money then they will ever need so don&#39;t donate; but, they are great. Everyone should have a copy of Wikipedia locally updated yearly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is jaded and angry, but I think there is another archetype called &#34;the politician.&#34; They play the game extremely well, providing poorly thought out solutions quickly to problems they haven&#39;t dug into the complexity of. They lay operational traps everywhere in their quest to get things done fast (like directly embedding config data in code to avoid fixing the config format). Once they&#39;ve picked the low hanging fruit and left too much complexity to maintain, they hop to another company where they sell themselves on all they accomplished leaving out the absolutely unmaintainable mess they left behind."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Archetypes are useful in how you sell yourself. Don&#39;t forget that it&#39;s not what you are, just how you sell yourself.You can change between these every review cycle, job, career, all you want - no one in management is keeping track of your &#34;archetype&#34;. They are keeping track of your impact.Lastly, you are the &#34;person in the box&#34; once you are senior enough. Take the archetypes, look at your org, and see which they need. Whatever is missing will be the most value to the org. How you see yourself accomplishing that box is the real challenge of executives, not this endless &#34;what color parachute are you&#34; self evaluation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A little meta commentary: I&#39;m seeing a lot of negative takes using the word &#34;they&#34; (so presumably these are from people who either haven&#39;t worked in a staff eng capacity, or have, but in dysfunctional organizations).The intent of this article (as I understand it) was to help people navigate the emerging nebulous role that &#34;staff engineer&#34; was, particularly as it started to become a more mainstream concept a few years ago (whereas prior to it, the dichotomy was largely that senior was &#34;the&#34; terminal IC role and you had to transition to management past that).Many engineers on the upper side of the senior spectrum have clearly been operating above and beyond what is typically considered senior level, but not in the capacity of a typical manager archetype, so this was meant to help people understand how to identify/categorize these people as well as help people understand what kinds of challenges to look at after you&#39;ve become a &#34;full-fledged&#34; senior engineer. Resources are useful, whodathunkit.My advice for those eyeing for a staff+ level would be to avoid making &#34;hot take&#34; categories, everyone can do that and if they&#39;re coming from a position of inexperience w/ the subject matter, there&#39;s a good chance it&#39;s a bad take. Instead, try to derive action items from each of the archetypes, and incorporate those into your work. A good point I heard is that no staff engineer qualifies as a single archetype exclusively; the role is usually a mix of all archetypes, with different people leaning more strongly one way vs another.It&#39;s very easy to make sour comments like &#34;oh staff people just spend all their time in meetings, what good are they for&#34;. It&#39;s quite another to be that staff engineer and have to balance technical depth acquisition, alignment among disparate groups and the multiplexing required to operate at high levels at both. It&#39;s easy to chalk it up to politics, but it&#39;s quite another to be able to visualize power structures as tools, and use them as such to accomplish large scale engineering goals. There are classes of engineering challenges that only really arise at the staff+ engineer level, and engaging with them can be rewarding in their own right."</p>

It could also potentially help the Democratic Party in the upcoming election.But if you believe in what the Democratic Party is trying to do for the country, that&#39;s not a bad thing. There&#39;s no corruption in doing popular things that can help get people in your party elected. That&#39;s just good governance and acting according to the will of the voters.The majority of people in the US, 60%, and even a plurality of Republicans support decriminalizing recreational cannabis federally.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interestingly, he specifically excludes illegal immigrants who are not US citizens from the pardon, as well as (implicitly) people who used to be lawful permanent residents but no longer are (perhaps because their visa got revoked after being arrested for possessing marijuana), as well as former US citizens (if there are any who have been charged with this &#34;crime&#34;) and people who were never residents in the US at all (perhaps they got arrested when they changed flights at a US airport).

That&#39;s why the whole system works -- because of the threat of violence.Crypto doesn&#39;t have that.  It has a lot of advantages (I use crypto myself) but it also has a big disadvantage, for now.When the USA starts issuing it&#39;s own crypto they might solve this problem by requiring KYC to get the coins, but then of course you loose the anonymity aspect."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fun story.At my previous company we had &#34;Sign in with Facebook&#34; – whatever your opinions on it are, it was probably the right thing for the company at that time.Facebook decided to &#34;audit&#34; us to make sure we were doing sign in right. The tested it incorrectly, told us we were at fault and needed to fix it, and gave us 2 weeks to do so. We scrambled to figure out what the issue was, only to find after they eventually replied to our emails (all they told us up-front was &#34;it doesn&#39;t work&#34;) that they had tried to use a sign-in only button to sign-up, similar on many websites, not at all for our flow and not something it was possible for us to do. We explained this and they dropped the audit.2 weeks later, they audited us again, failed us again, and gave us a deadline to fix it. We replied pointing to the previous case and explaining again why it was working. We never heard back.2 weeks later, they audited us again, failed us again, and gave us a deadline to fix it. We replied asking what the hell was happening (politely). We never heard back.1 week later &#34;Sign in with Facebook&#34; stopped working with no other warning. We opened a support case, we emailed our ads account manager, we emailed our previous ads account manager as the first was on holiday, and all we got was &#34;we&#39;re looking into it, but it looks legit, fix it&#34;.I asked for a call and explained that the current user experience for users was that they would click &#34;Sign in with Facebook&#34; and see an error saying &#34;Facebook is currently not working, please sign in another way&#34;, and that the only way we had to resolve this was to email all our Facebook auth&#39;d users a password reset with an explanation that Facebook sign in no longer worked, and to then remove the feature from our site.&#34;Ah. Ok yeah let me see what I can do&#34;. It was working about 2 hours later, and we weren&#39;t audited again in the rest of the time I was at the company."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Similar experienceI used to run a graduation photography company, we did professional graduation photos half the price of the &#39;officail&#39; providers (who pay a huge commission to the university, but don&#39;t get me started on that).We promoted our service with facebook events and advertised said events. One year without warning or explination they Facebook just deleted all our events (we would travel from one uni to another over the summer). I frantically tried to get a response from facebook. I never got one.I sued in small claims court and they settled the case (not before being very threatening through high paid lawyers and trying to dodge the case altogether) they never did explain what had happend or why.Ultimately it&#39;s partly the reason I shut the company down, facebook was our channel, without certainty we could host events and promote them it made no business sense to invest in the company."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t have a specific solution for you, but I also run a domain with some thousands of subdomains and is always a fight to not be banned from Google, Meta, internet operators etc. Sometimes is enough one bad actor under one of your subdomains to have a full ban on the whole domain.What I suggest is for your and your clients to contact Meta through the Business Center support. Their support for paying clients is much better. I would also recommend you become a Meta Business Partner if Facebook/Instagram is important for your SaaS."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would have agreed until I started working at Google. Also, you should completely avoid having Remote Desktop and instead use ssh + an editor that works with remote files.At Google we have a custom fork of VSCode running in browser and builds can either be distributed or run on my Linux VM to utilize build cache.I liked it so much I started doing a similar setup for small side projects. Just boot up the Cloud Console on GCP and start coding.Advantages are:- Accessible from anywhere (I use my pc, my laptop, etc. The env is always the same)- More compute (I can attach more CPU + more RAM flexibly)- Less friction to start (minimum environment setup, most tools are preinstalled)- Datacenter Network speeds + Artifacts cached (installing dependencies is fast)Disadvantages:- network dependenceThere are some adjustments that need to be made to your workflow. And for some applications you are dependent on having the correct tooling. However, my personal prediction is most companies will move to this type of development workflow as the tooling improves."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is nothing but a bad strawman from start to finish.Sprints are not made to help organize things, they&#39;re a tool to get more predictable deliveries. Their very short nature forces participants to construct tasks that are easier to estimate and therefore complete on time with a higher probability.This certainly adds overhead to an idealised scenario where people take the shortest reasonble route often enough and that is the tradeoff. Plus: people actually seldomly take the optimum routes in the first place.Nobody has to like it, this is probably not the best method and maybe it&#39;s not even good. But the author misses the point completely."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kanban is the best middle ground IMO. I agree sprints are a distraction. The planning and ceremonies alone sap time. Sprints are really just a form of pressure. In my experience the stories estimating is not accurate enough to set up a predictable sprint, and the inevitable deviation from the plan just creates additional work to audit and adjust, along with a sense of failure around what has often been a productive 2 weeks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I get the hate for sprints, and the bastardisation of agile. I think however, the root cause of this is the way in which our society as a whole has been modelled, in a top down manner where control is wrested from the bottom, and perceived control is given to those in between. Each of these articles that make, valid criticisms in my opinion, always makes me think of Bullshit Jobs [1][2]. Most of our lives nowadays are inundated with menial bureaucracy, and each attempt to reform it within bureaucractic systems has simply lead to the red tape being rearranged. I think this stems from our hesitancy to have more horizontal models of ogranisation.[1] - https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-on-the...[2] - https://bullshit.ist/bullshit-jobs-how-our-modern-bureaucrac..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My favorite nuclear disaster! Criticality events.I lived in Los Alamos for a while. I looked into renting a studio space. I became curious about the property across the street from my prospective rental which was surrounded by a chain link fence with green canvas. I researched and learned it was the site of an original Manhattan site waste dump which had, a few years prior, been enclosed with a negative pressure tent and cleaned up at a cost of 2-3 billion. Apparently the government had dumped an unknown quantity of high level nuclear waste there in an unlined pit in the dirt in the 40s. This led me to research the history of the area.After a couple of months I figured out that my house in White Rock was about 3/4 of a mile from the current waste dump for the entire lab, known as TA-53 or MDA-C or something. They were in the process of excavating the three 200 foot deep pits of MDA-C - one for low level nuclear waste, one for transuranic (as they call “high level” these days) and one for classified waste. If I stood on my roof I could see the negative pressure tents surrounding them. My favorite non-classified project which was disposed of there was the “experimental high temperature plutonium reactor”, from the 90s.The lab has some rather interesting history. There was no concept at all of safely disposing of anything or even recording what they dumped and where until the 60s. The first ever radioactive metal working facility, out on a ridge by the entrance to town (TA 21? 23?) dumped all of their wastewater directly into the canyon untreated. This has recently been cleaned up at a cost of several billion dollars also, and now they are building homes there. The heavy/radioactive metal plumes went down into the earth over 500 feet. In fact, all of the waste from the entire lab used to be dumped into a stream in the middle of town. They cleaned it up, opened it as a park (“Acid Canyon”), then after heavy rains found some barrels they missed which were determined to contain plutonium waste. Oops, cleaned that up some more and now it’s a nature preserve and hiking area. There are still untouched facilities from the 50s where Feynman worked on polonium experiments sitting a few hundred feet from the banks of the Rio Grande.There was a power plant right on the edge of a native reservation neighboring the lab. According to the federal government, the plume of chromium contamination it left ends exactly on the property line of the lab to the reservation.Everyone I met in Los Alamos had zero concerns about pollution having an impact on them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They keep saying that profit seeking was the issue, but taking selfies with plutonium, running a lab for 4 years that produces nothing, and not having any employees that don&#39;t understand the most basics of nuclear physics does not sound like profit seeking. It sounds like someone just has way too much money and runs a nuclear weapons lab as vanity project."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;... tested to see if they remain safe and reliable  for use in the nuclear stockpile.Note here this expression &#34;safe and reliable&#34;, taken from the DoE&#39;s founding legislation, is officially re-interpreted to be very, very different from what a normal person would conclude.Most particularly, &#34;safety&#34; doesn&#39;t mean anything about risks to the public or to people handling equipment and materials. It does not mean anything about them not exploding in their warehouse or while hanging in a bomber. It does not mean protecting against release of radioactive materials or contamination of groundwater or ecosystems.It does not mean keeping people from stealing plutonium or whole weapons. It does not mean keeping bombs from falling out of planes at random (which has happened), or from crews setting them off accidentally or on purpose.  It does not mean keeping bombers loaded with them from crashing or missiles with them on top from exploding in their silos (which have both happened).The only responsibility &#34;safety&#34; places on the DoE is ensuring that, when the button is pushed, the bomb really does go boom.&#34;Reliability&#34;, meanwhile, means only that the boom is as big as it says in the specs.It probably requires legislation to change these re-interpretations."</p>

Which is ok -- but at least be honest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s next?
Dreamfusion Video = Imagen Video (this) + Dreamfusion (https://dreamfusion3d.github.io/)Fundamentally, I think we have all the pieces based on this work and Dreamfusion to make it work. From the looks of it, there&#39;s a lot of SSR (spatial SR) and TSR (temporal SR) going on at multiple levels to upsample (spatially) and smoothen (temporally) images that won&#39;t be needed for NERFs.What&#39;s impressive is the ability to leverage billion-scale image-text pairs for training a base model that can be used to super-resolve over space and time. And that they&#39;re not wastefully training video models from scratch, and instead separately training TSR, SSR models for turning the diffused images to video."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting that these models can generate seemingly anything, but the prompt is taken only as a vague suggestion.From the first 15 examples shown to me, only one contained all elements of the prompt, and it was one of the simplest (&#34;an astronaut riding a horse&#34;, versus e.g. &#34;a glass ball falling in water&#34; where it&#39;s clear it was a water droplet falling and not a glass ball).We&#39;re seeing leaps in random capabilities (motion! 3D! inpainting! voice editing!), so I wonder if complete prompt accuracy is 3 months or 3 years away.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There was some grim stuff happening in the Chancery case: multiple bits of evidence suggesting that Peiter Zatko had in fact been in touch with Musk&#39;s team, in advance of the &#34;whistleblowing&#34; release. The Chancery court had just come in with an order giving Twitter extended discovery rights to look for those communications.If it did turn out that Zatko had been talking to Musk&#39;s team, that would be a very big deal, not only undercutting a big part of Musk&#39;s current case (which he was set to lose anyways) but also falsifying several statements made both to the Delaware court and also to Congress(?!).I wonder also if the appearance, performative as it is, that Musk is choosing to buy Twitter rather than being forced to buy Twitter is helpful for financing. He&#39;s more or less obligated to purchase Twitter, but there&#39;s no rule preventing him from offsetting the expense with a syndicate of co-investors; that syndicate might be easier to put together if he can shift the narrative."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"He got slammed in discovery, lost a lot of his pre-trial motions, and started losing a ton of his net worth by appearing like a buffoon.  He was about to go into an emergency conference at the Delaware Chancery court, and I assume that he was being told &#34;you are going to lose&#34; by his lawyers if not the Chancellor herself.There was some indication that Mudge may have been in contact with him.  He lost a lot of discovery motions about bots.  His own experts told him that he had no case about Twitter bots.  This case has been a loser from the beginning, and I think he thought he could get a better price by doing this.  He likely didn&#39;t want anything else to come out.The Twitter board did a great job not bowing to the pressure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh man, I’m usually not one for drama, but I really want this deal to go through.
I don’t use twitter and as such don’t really care if it implodes, but from what I’ve heard twitter has been a cesspool of negativity for a while now and on a slow but steady downtrend in general.I’m sure Musk will try anything to recoup his investment, so it’ll either go out with a bang, or he somehow manages to pull a rabbit out of his hat and actually turn twitter around. Though I don’t think that’s very likely.Either way it’ll be a fun pastime to follow the unfolding of it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This report provides a detailed background of Hans&#39; potential cheating, and detailed breakdowns of certain aspects of chess.com&#39;s cheat-detection methodology, including previously unknown (or little known) methods such as window focus change event monitoring and post-focus-change move analysis.[1]The report also reveals Niemann&#39;s engine move correlations alongside over two dozen chess Grandmasters who have admitted to cheating on chess.com.  The fact that online cheating is so widespread even among top chess players is certainly news to many, including me.  Perhaps it is a good thing that this scandal is highlighting the issue, and given how widespread cheating may be, perhaps chess tournaments both online and physical need to take cheating much more seriously than they apparently have been.There is also an interesting analysis of Hans&#39; rating improvement history, his over the board tournament performance and key game analysis, and a rundown of key moments in his game against Carlsen in the Sinquefield cup. Each raises concerns.Chess.com&#39;s report also makes it clear that Niemann lied outright about his history of cheating in post-Sinquefield interviews, as he admits in communications with chess.com Fairplay staff to much broader cheating.All in all, the report raises many concerns and it seems reasonable for the chess community to demand much higher standards of cheat prevention and detection across competitive venues.  How long might cheating issues have gone on merely rumored vs fully investigated or acted upon, had this intrigue not developed due to Carlsen&#39;s withdrawal from Sinquefield &#39;22?[1]Tangentially, this induces an obvious concern about cheat and cheat-detection arms races.  A clever cheater might scrutinize this report and refine their cheating plan.  For example, they might recognize the need to use a second device (such as a phone) to cheat.  They might use the data corpus presented in this report to establish limits on how often they use chess engine moves per game, and they might manage their ratings progress over time carefully, so as to stay in acceptable ranges of engine move correlation, rate of improvement, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The conventional wisdom is that if you are not a GM by age 14, it is unlikely that you can reach the top levels of chess.&gt; While that statement may seem discouraging, it has been borne out in modern chess.&gt; Greats like Fischer, Kasparov, Carlsen, and almost all of the modern GMs who have been established as top five players, were notable GMs by age 15 at the latestWow."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So page 9 from the last paragraph is interesting.  Chess.com basically indicate that apart from Hans, a number of highly rated players (including higher than Hans) have been caught and admitted to cheating.I haven&#39;t gone over the report thoroughly, but it&#39;s clearly focused on Hans&#39;s conduct and not so much on the state of play regarding online cheating, which is, even by Magnus&#39;s statement, the chief focus of all of this.As an outsider to the chess world, this revelation of rampant online cheating is the main story.First, not surprising, right?  Using a computer engine is part of learning and preparing in chess (AFAICT).  What other sport has a similar issue where an extremely useful and essential and highly available tool in the sport is considered cheating based entirely on using it within the narrow window of a game?  Of course it was going to leak into play in online games where you only have the data feed of moves and nothing else connecting the players.Second, that it&#39;s common amongst the elite of the sport is huge.  Either online chess is somewhat dead on arrival as a sport and was never taken seriously by many players (which makes sense to me given how integrated computer engines are in the sport) ... or the chess world needs to go through some sort of cultural revolution here.Third, chess.com have a conflict of interest in this meta-discussion, I presume, as they have commercial interests in the survival of online chess.Fourth, the OTB cheating question still seems open and it seems plausible to me that a good chess player would cheat online for followers and income and entrance to tournaments and then use OTB as the real testing ground.  My bias here is that I suspect cheating in OTB is just crazy by comparison as you&#39;d have to carry some sort of device that would stand as hard evidence of cheating while in online play the proof is always circumstantial and so easier for a cheater to convince themselves they won&#39;t get caught.  Which gets back to my second and third points about how online chess maybe doesn&#39;t make much sense and chess.com aren&#39;t quite seeing the forest for the trees on this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The big claim turns out to be a little overstated. The claim:&gt; AlphaTensor’s algorithm improves on Strassen’s two-level algorithm for the first time, to our knowledge, since its discovery 50 years ago.reduces to:&gt; AlphaTensor discovers algorithms that outperform the Strassen-square algorithm, which is a fast algorithm for large square matrices31,32. Although the discovered algorithm has the same theoretical complexity as Strassen-square, it outperforms it in practice, as it is optimized for the considered hardware. Interestingly, AlphaTensor finds algorithms with a larger number of additions compared with Strassen-square (or equivalently, denser decompositions), but the discovered algorithms generate individual operations that can be efficiently fused by the specific XLA33 grouping procedure and thus are more tailored towards the compiler stack we use. The algorithms found by AlphaTensor also provide gains on matrix sizes larger than what they were optimized for. Finally, Fig. 5c shows the importance of tailoring to particular hardware, as algorithms optimized for one hardware do not perform as well on other hardware.So they improved on Strassen’s 50-year-old algorithm by optimizing it for hardware that has only existed for a few years and de-optimizing it for human use? There is so much cool stuff here without claiming to do something you really didn’t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The paper is a great read -- an interesting approach, fun theoretical comparisons, plus benchmarks for optimized algorithms for specific hardware (CPU and GPU, allowing for differing instruction sets).But it doesn&#39;t stop there; from the &#34;Discussion&#34; section:&gt; One important strength of AlphaTensor is its flexibility to support complex stochastic and non-differentiable rewards (from the tensor rank to practical efficiency on specific hardware), in addition to finding algorithms for custom operations in a wide variety of spaces (such as finite fields). We believe this will spur applications of AlphaTensor towards designing algorithms that optimize metrics that we did not consider here, such as numerical stability or energy usage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a gut feeling that there is a faster way to compute logarithms going from least to most significant bit. How would I go about using ML to find it?[Edit] I think Feynman&#39;s algorithm might do it:&#34;Consider the problem of finding the logarithm of a
fractional number between 1 and 2. (The algorithm can be
generalized without too much difficulty.) Feynman observed
that any such number can be uniquely represented
as a product of numbers of the form 1 + 2^(-k), where k is an
integer. Testing for the presence of each of these factors in
a binary representation is simply a matter of a shift and a
subtraction. Once the factors are determined, the logarithm
can be computed by adding together the precomputed
logarithms of the factors. The algorithm fit the
Connection Machine especially well because the small
table of the logarithms of 1 + 2^(-k) could be shared by all
the processors. The entire computation took less time
than doing a division.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have had to answer this question to my kids (one of whom abhors math). The explanation I gave is this:For many subjects, most kids will end up never using them. But, we have no way to predict which subjects will be useful for which kids. Without the ability to do that, our priority is maximize each child&#39;s opportunity. We never want a kid to be in the situation where they would have been interested in a subject and a career path but never ended up discovering that and using it because we didn&#39;t expose it to them.So we teach some of every subject to every kid. That way no matter which path they end up following, they are as prepared for it as we can make them.(Also, yes, I agree that math is good general training for cognitive rigor. Also, numeric literacy is vital for all adults since we live in an ecomonic world and participate in a democracy where statistics are necessary to understand policies.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“Bingo!!” said the teacher. “It’s the same thing with calculus. You’re not here because you’re going to use calculus in your everyday life. You’re here because calculus is weightlifting for your brain.”Total BS...There are better ways to exercise your brain that will be many more times better than Calculus. This is HW so one that comes to mind is programming. But there are so many more. Here are a few, understanding and fixing a car, understanding music and playing music, art appreciation, literature and understanding the human condition and on and on. Recent research has shown that doing daily exercise is a great way to keep a healthy body and brain, rather than sitting on your butt learning a useless subject.Yes, there are professions where Calculus is needed and there are people that truly enjoy math. Cool, take all the math you need and want to learn. You should take it.Anyone that tells you that Calculus is a good way to exercise your brain is just trying to justify their job. Don&#39;t for a minute believe that it&#39;s the best way to use a limited resource like your time.Source: Me, it took me 3 semesters of Calculus to figure out that it was useless to me and 90+% of the people that take any of it.P.S. note: Many people disagree. Good, you should not take it as absolute truth. I guess my real point is that you should question whether you really need to take Calculus. Don&#39;t just take it blindly because you are told you should. You have other options."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a number of angles to this.Want a fancy job? This is one of the hoops to jump through. Same as leetcode further down the line, you won&#39;t do it at work but you will do it to get work. But that&#39;s also a pretty tragic take on it.Practice for other things, sure, that is also a way to see it. You won&#39;t bench press the other team but you will make yourself stronger. But for what? A sport you&#39;ll never play? What are you preparing for?Here&#39;s another one. Math, especially pure math, is a thing that is totally separate from observation. It just sort of exists without being anywhere, and yet there&#39;s all this depth to it. You can get a puzzle that cannot be solved by any anything other than thoughts, and you can keep building on these puzzles that don&#39;t exist. Go nowhere and explore.Lastly I note that it&#39;s mostly math class that gets asked this &#34;what&#39;s the point&#34; question. But you may as well as this about everything else you do in school, and you will mostly find that you&#39;ll have spent years to learn French for 4 weeks of actual use in France, dissected frogs for no reason, and learned how to play the recorder. All things that I&#39;m sure you can find positives for despite the superficial benefits being quite small."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;The experience was physically taxing, he was diagnosed with tendonitis after moving hundreds of boxes a day, but it pulled him out of his depression and helped him gain perspective and a deeper sense of meaning&#34;.......I have mixed feelings about this. What this has proven is working at amazon warehouse sucks, and is not sustainable.I&#39;ve had many physical shitty jobs in my 20&#39;s. Then, I had some health issue and could no longer keep doing that to my body, so I went back to school and got a CS degree.I sometimes get depressed and miss physical work, but then I remember how shit it was and how an injury would prevent me from working. As a dev I think I&#39;m going to be able to earn money as long as I&#39;m alive and have a functioning brain.I guess once you have enough money then maybe someone might find that work fun? Obviously it helped the writer with depression. However, if he ever gets permanently hurt and it affects his daily life I have a feeling depression will come back in full swing. Office work is much much safer.There are ways to help people through tech and have much bigger affect then moving boxes for a shitty company.Edit: What helps my depression is connecting with people outside of work, helping people in my community, doing projects around my house and spending time with my son. Additionally, I try to make good choices when spending my money and limit my spending on stuff I don&#39;t need, as I dislike excessive spending.Edit2: Some great comments below. This is very much poverty/shit job tourism, which the writer can escape at any moment. This is some BlackMirror type of content. Guy makes it big in tech, retires, now works shit job people are trying to escape to cure his depression. He then writes about it on a blog. Now, other non-aware devs might be reading it contemplating leaving their jobs to do a REAL job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read the article, and... I get it.  But something about this just seems weird to me.  I grew up mostly on a family farm, worked every day of my life in some capacity since I was 9 or 10 years old, and did shit jobs to pay for college (which I eventually dropped out of right before graduation).  I don&#39;t think my route into tech is that different from many of the other folks I&#39;ve worked with... this guy lived a /very/ charmed and privileged existence compared to the average American tech worker, and going to work at an Amazon warehouse to get a reality check seems... patronizing somehow.  I am glad he got a reality check, but I feel like there&#39;s another way to do this, or at least how to write about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I had what I would stereotype as a traditional Chinese upbringing in America, which meant my parents very much expected straight A&#39;s. Anytime a B happened, something had gone wrong. The explanation was never like you lack the talent or whatever, but that you didn’t work hard enough.It sounds like the author never got a chance to figure out the intersection between what he liked to do and what he was actually good at. Instead, he was trained to respond to the approval of authority figures. So the true north of his internal compass pointed to whatever the person in charge at the time thought of him.Fast forward to 2021:&gt; I think most people who dream of retirement think that it&#39;s going to be awesome. And it was—for about a month.  I skied on weekdays, shopped at Target at 11am with nobody there, and played video games. But after several months of pursuing various hobbies as my whims and interests—all the things which people who aspire to retire young might look upon with envy—I felt unfulfilled. I became unmoored, set adrift in a sea of theoretical possibility only to drown in unbounded optionality. Novelty and excitement turned into a spiraling vortex of depression as I began to wake up sometimes at noon, sometimes 2pm, and on the rare occasion even getting out of bed at 6pm.With no authority figure to send the positive vibes he craved, the author felt adrift. This is where the gig at Amazon comes in. Authority figures galore and a clear sense of what a job well done meant.Some are chalking this up to poverty tourism. Maybe it&#39;s something else."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I learnt C, more than 20 years ago, from the book The C Programming Language written by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie, also known as K&amp;R. I read the book almost cover to cover all the way from the preface at the beginning to its three appendices at the end while solving all the exercises that each chapter presented. As someone who knew very little about programming languages back then, this book was formative in my journey of becoming a programmer.Appendix A (Reference Manual) of the book broadened my outlook on programming languages by providing me a glimpse of what goes into formally specifying a programming language. Section A.12 (Preprocessing) of this appendix specifies trigraph sequences. Quoting from the section:&gt; Preprocessing itself takes place in several logically successive phases that may, in a particular implementation, be condensed.&gt; 1. First, trigraph sequences as described in Par.A.12.1 are replaced by their equivalents. Should the operating system environment require it, newline characters are introduced between the lines of the source file.Then section A.12.1 (Trigraph Sequences) further elaborates trigraph sequences in more detail. Quoting this section below:&gt; The character set of C source programs is contained within seven-bit ASCII, but is a superset of the ISO 646-1983 Invariant Code Set. In order to enable programs to be represented in the reduced set, all occurrences of the following trigraph sequences are replaced by the corresponding single character. This replacement occurs before any other processing.  ??=  #
  ??/  \
  ??&#39;  ^
  ??(  [
  ??)  ]
  ??!  |
  ??&lt;  {
  ??&gt;  }
  ??-  ~

&gt; No other such replacements occur.&gt; Trigraph sequences are new with the ANSI standard."</p>

Past Channon had not the foggiest clue what impact an unnoticed stranger would come to have on her.

Perhaps you were not the same person, or nor was he.  In meeting at the right time, stars are aligned, it was the right time to intersect.  Or perhaps a host of other reasons.  There may have been better times, perhaps bounded for this success quite close to or at the time you didn &#39;meet&#39;.  And who knows what other &#39;success&#39; could have worked out - collaborators in something, getting together when &#39;re meeting&#39; - we don&#39;t know, an individual&#39;s life&#39;s not repeatable, and that in itself is beautiful.It is indeed fascinating mapping and wondering, and probably applicable to a lot.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was reluctant to mention this kind of story in such a sweet context but a few comments have already touched on privacy, so I want to add my two cents.At some point in the past I had the surreal experience of opening a news website and seeing a familiar face on the front page. Not a celebrity, rather a man whose face had been in some small subfolder of my brain for several years.The man had been convicted of serial rape. He would drug victims and record them. He was known to be active within a certain time range from the timestamps of the videos. He repeated this dozens of times and was only caught after the final victim woke up during the act. Authorities appealed for people to come forward with any more information because they believed there could be more victims than were discovered from the videos.By cross-referencing the location data from my phone with the date of an event my Last FM profile and the location of his home, I was able to confirm why he looked familiar. This allowed me to contact the authorities and bring the start of the known time frame significantly forward.(there might be enough information in this post for the perpetrator to be identified - if you do, please keep it to yourself)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few years ago I had the pleasure of meeting Knuth in his home, my wife was doing some photography for him. He took me to his room and showed me his setup, he was researching Soduku algorithms at the time. His hands were blisteringly quick, moving between EMacs panes, triggering evaluations and printing of results, as fast as any 20 year old. In his 80s , he hasn’t seemed to suffer any mental decline.I started talking to him about some of the latest AI research and he mentioned the papers authors, he had already read them! Not only is he still very productive at 84, but he has not ossified into one particular subject but he continues to keep abreast of other related fields.He also played his huge pipe organ for us, he was gracious, humble, down to earth, truly a  treasure. I only wish he could live another hundred years, selfishly so I could see Volumes 5, 6, and 7 of Art of Computer Programming finished.I should not with some sadness that COVID hit not long after and that year we lost a number of other luminaries in the field like Jon Conway."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note that, to get an idea of the contents, you can see the previously published fascicles, and earlier drafts online (pre-fascicles):• Mathematical Preliminaries Redux: https://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/fasc5a.ps.gz• 7.2.2 Introduction to Backtracking: https://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/fasc5b.ps.gz• 7.2.2.1 Dancing Links: https://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/fasc5c.ps.gz• 7.2.2.2 Satisfiability: https://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/fasc6a.ps.gzThe first three were published together as &#34;Volume 4, Fascicle 5&#34; in 2019, and the last one—Satisfiability—was published as &#34;Volume 4, Fascicle 6&#34; in 2015. Of course the actual publication as Volume 4B has hundreds of fixes and additions beyond what was published earlier, and a lovely preface that you can read here: https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=3143614&gt; You might think that a 700-page book has probably been padded with peripheral material. But I constantly had to &#34;cut, cut, cut&#34; while writing it, because […] new and potentially interesting-yet-unexplored topics kept popping up, more than enough to fill a lifetime; yet I knew that I must move on. […] I wrote nearly a thousand computer programs while preparing this material, because I find that I don&#39;t understand things unless I try to program them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Gage claims that Tipping wound up with three broken ribs, a lacerated liver, head injuries, and a broken neck. &#34;His heart eventually stopped working because of his injuries&#34; and &#34;he was paralyzed….He had subdural hematomas at three places on the left side and three places on the right side. There is no way that grappling would have caused those injuries the way the LAPD portrayed it.&#34;Sure sounds less like a simulation and more like an actual event.It&#39;s really not easy to have someone die during an exercise with this many injuries caused by physical contact. Things like drownings, falls, and collisions can occur in a hugh risk training event- but this extent of injuries from falling on the ground seems real tough to spin as accidental or unintentional. At best you&#39;d have to be extremely negligent, at worst this was a deliberate choice.You&#39;d really think someone would notice the person they&#39;re training with is actually hurt and stop to check in on them, presumably there are measures in place to pause the exercise which people are aware of before starting- were these ignored? 
I guess we&#39;d have to have a discussion on the intent of the exercise and the extent to which force is used with no regard for safety during training, which is a whole other issue."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; He added that the LAPD said no video footage of the training exercise exists, even though these sorts of trainings are often recorded.That seems like standard procedure by now.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As an EU citizen, I am really happy with this decision.I am an iPhone user, but having an iPhone is not ubiquitous here, almost all of my friends/special other, use an Android phone with USB-C. Most of their laptops, Mac or not, use or allow USB-C for charging.
This as been the case for a few years now, yet, if I go somewhere for more than a full day and forget my lighting cable, my phone will become a useless paperweight while every non-iPhone user is fine in the meantime because of the wide adoption of USB-C.
It is also ironic how Apple markets heavily on how you can take great RAW photos or videos but somehow you have to use lightning USB2 speeds to transfer them.
Lightning is barely smaller than USB-C, and clearly my iPhone thickness will not change if it switches to USB-C.As for the e-waste generated by &#34;having to throw all of those lightning cables&#34;, how is it not e-waste that someone buying an iPhone will have yet another lightning cable that will only be used to charge it. If we want to really be more environmentally friendly, wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to have no cable at all with the devices we buy, force the sellers to clearly tell the consumers about it and offer the cable on the side only if needed? With that cable being usb-c, the consumer don&#39;t have to think about the cable type, for non-tech savvy people, that would be &#34;the regular charging cable&#34; and that&#39;s it.
I would also add that all lightning cables won&#39;t suddenly go to the landfill in 2024. Many people will keep their iPhones/AirPods for a while after that date. Many would probably donate their old lightning cables to whoever needs them. In the meantime, we all already have an ever growing landfill in our homes called the cable drawer, and it is also an issue that needs to be addressed."</p>

Now let’s talk about iPhone. iPhone has forever changed the world. Every single day people rely on iPhone, from their most demanding tasks to capturing the moments of their lives, streaming their favorite TV shows, playing their favorite games, staying up to date with the news of the world and connecting with friends and loved ones.Tim Cook: (40:42)
This is what drives us to create the best iPhone possible. To create an experience unlike any other, with legendary ease of use, beautiful and durable designs with water resistance and great battery life, with industry leading performance and the world’s most advanced camera systems, and with privacy built in. People love iPhone, and we keep making iPhone better, more powerful, more capable, and even more fun to use. Today, we are thrilled to introduce our next generation of iPhone. Here it is.Tim Cook: (41:54)
[inaudible 00:41:54]Tim Cook: (41:55)
This is iPhone {15,16}. To tell you more, here’s Kianne.Cayenne: (42:24)
Let’s take a closer look at, iPhone {15,16}, starting with design. It has the sleek, flat edge design that people love. It also have a fantastic new charging port, featuring the same USB-C connector as our beloved iPad, developed in a tremendous effort to {fight against climate change and electronic waste,further enhance the connectivity of the iPhone {15,16}}."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Self-regulation only works if government regulation is a serious threat in case self-regulation fails. In this case, self-regulation failed, so government regulation stepped in to force industry to do what is right.All the handwringing about stifling innovation is on its face ridiculous as mandates to use micro-usb didn&#39;t stop android phones from adopting the new and better standard as soon as it was viable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Copyright, as it exists in the 21st century, is a scam.It does not protect the artists, the creative works, or the little guy. It is a product of decades&#39; worth of lobbying by very rich and powerful organizations and megacorps.I&#39;m not against the idea of a copyright. An artist has the right to enjoy the fruits of their labor, and creative works do have value.However, the original idea of copyright has been bent, broken, dismembered, and sown back together in a Frankensteinian abomination and now serves only to line up pockets of people in the publishing industry. And the US has, through its trade deals, exported this thing worldwide.Disney lobbies for life of author + 70 years copyright duration not out of goodwill towards authors (in fact, it&#39;s been trying to wriggle out of paying royalties to some of them!). Amazon uses copyright as an excuse to push DRM, locking out competition and limiting users&#39; rights (Kindle, Audible DRM). DMCA is constantly abused to take down fair-use content.Meanwhile, book authors are struggling to find a reason to write books, since many barely recoup the costs. Musicians decry royalties paid out by Spotify (that aren&#39;t actually so small, but the majority of the cut is taken by the music industry). Photographers try in vain to stop people just copy/pasting their photos online (what are they going to do, sue everyone?), including in some cases big companies that didn&#39;t even bother to check the copyright.They aren&#39;t being protected. They are being milked."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One under-appreciated limitation on digital movies is geographic restrictions. You buy a bunch of iTunes movies in Canada, then move to the USA, and you no longer have the right to watch them anymore due to licensing.Another significant issue with digital movies and games is the inability to resell the content once you&#39;re done with it. You can sell your DVDs at a yard sale or on eBay but not your iTunes movies. IMO, our competition law should require vendors to allow re-sale of digital goods. Big benefit for consumers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have started a modest Blu-Ray/4k Blu-Ray collection. For me, it is by far the best movie experience I&#39;ve had with any format. It takes maybe 90 vs 20 seconds to get the movie playing, but in return I get noticeably better quality. 4k Blu-Rays&#39; bitrates are around 128 Mb/s. For comparison, Netflix tops out around 17 Mb/s. It really does look and sound noticeably better if you have the TV and surround setup to take advantage of it. Sometimes WAY better.Also, for most physical movies, they had a &#34;+ digital&#34; code included that lets you redeem a digital copy of the movie too. So I can stream most of them on my laptop anyway if I&#39;m away from home or something.Physical media for movies is super underrated, at least for the situation in my country. It&#39;s often cheaper than &#34;buying&#34; the digital version! I can even go to my local used bookstore/Goodwill and find tons of Blu-Rays for cut rate prices. And then I own it forever, and it&#39;s 100% legal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This reminds me of the assassination of Lord British: [1]&#34;Lord British was a player character created by Richard Garriott, the producer of Ultima Online. Using this character, Richard acted as Ultima’s King and would sometimes interact with other players. Lord British had considerable protection from an entourage of bodyguards and was even explicitly coded to be invulnerable to virtually any attack. During the game’s online beta test, Lord British gave an address to fellow players at his Castle Britannia. But while British was giving his address, a player character known as Rainz cast a spell scroll that set the Lord on fire, killing him instantly.&#34;It turns out that shortly before this event, the server had crashed and needed to be restarted. Garriott forgot to reimplement his invulnerability flag, leaving him open to being killed. If that wasn’t shocking enough for the attendees, a fellow developer of the game known as Starr Long, with his in-game character Lord Blackthorn, summoned a horde of demons to kill the assassin. Not only did the assassin manage to escape, but the demons had killed nearly every player attending the address...&#34;[1] - https://www.cbr.com/ultima-online-lord-british-assassination..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is honestly a beautiful piece of work, and will likely be a popular read for law students for decades to come. This is just from the first part:&gt; The Onion is the world’s leading news publication,
offering highly acclaimed, universally revered cover-
age of breaking national, international, and local news
events. Rising from its humble beginnings as a print
newspaper in 1756, The Onion now enjoys a daily read-
ership of 4.3 trillion and has grown into the single most
powerful and influential organization in human his-
tory.&gt; In addition to maintaining a towering standard of
excellence to which the rest of the industry aspires,
The Onion supports more than 350,000 full- and part-
time journalism jobs in its numerous news bureaus
and manual labor camps stationed around the world,
and members of its editorial board have served with
distinction in an advisory capacity for such nations as
China, Syria, Somalia, and the former Soviet Union.
On top of its journalistic pursuits, The Onion also owns
and operates the majority of the world’s transoceanic
shipping lanes, stands on the nation’s leading edge on
matters of deforestation and strip mining, and proudly
conducts tests on millions of animals daily.&gt; The Onion’s keen, fact-driven reportage has been
cited favorably by one or more local courts, as well as
Iran and the Chinese state-run media. Along the way, The Onion’s journalists have garnered a sterling reputation for accurately forecasting future events. One such coup was The Onion’s scoop revealing that a for-
mer president kept nuclear secrets strewn around his
beach home’s basement three years before it even hap-
pened."</p>

But I still get lost when words like “tensor” are used. “structured lists of numbers” really doesn’t seem to explain it usefully.This reminds me that explaining seemingly complex things in simple terms is one of the most valuable and rarest skills in engineering.  Most people just can’t.  And often because they no-longer remember what’s not general knowledge.

Coolify is an open-source &amp; self-hostable Heroku / Netlify alternative.Lots of features are added day-by-day and I&#39;m open for new ones. Visit our Github (https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify) or our feedback page (https://feedback.coolify.io/) to get more info.A few months ago, I quit my job and started to work on it full-time (best decision I&#39;ve made).It is not VC funded (said no to 30+ investors - time will let me know if it was a good decision or not ), but funded by the awesome community! &lt;3Why I&#39;m mentioning this? Because I would like to focus on the functionalities, the community &amp; the users and not the revenue and other boring metrics. I just would like to make a good software, enjoy the process and make people&#39;s life easier. I do not want to make millions of dollars from it. If me and my family could live happily, that is totally fine.Let me know if you have an questions. I&#39;m happy to answer them.(Also I&#39;m working on a cloud/managed hosting version of Coolify (https://beta.coolify.io/))"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am using Coolify (https://coolify.io), an open source self-hosted PaaS which is a relatively newer kid on the block compared to Dokku and CapRover. I tried both of these and I just didn&#39;t like how they were, always had some problem or another.In contrast, Coolify has a great GUI that abstracts away the most common things about PaaS hosting, like connecting to GitHub automatically for git push deploys, SSL certificates, reverse proxying and custom domain support, and best of all, having support for Heroku style buildpacks as well as Dockerfiles. I&#39;ve been quite happy with it, the creator has a Discord and responds to issues very quickly.With regards to non-self-hosted options, I did try out Render, Fly.io and Railway but I found that their free servers were too anemic. I was compiling a Rust backend and it simply could not compile on their free servers. On Hetzner, for 5 bucks I could get a 2 AMD vCPU and 2 GB RAM machine that was sufficient to compile my Rust apps in a way that the non-self-hosted ones were not. I have a JS frontend app that works fine though but I wanted to keep everything under the same VPS, plus I can run other types of self-hosted services on it too, like Plausible analytics and a Ghost blog. I&#39;m not sure if those are allowed on non-self-hosted options.All in all, it costs me 5 bucks a month, and I never have to worry about sudden upcharges for traffic à la AWS as in the very worst, my VPS goes down for a while. I&#39;m now running about 20 different services on this 5 dollar box including databases and applications as well as other services, works just fine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have 4 apps running on fly.io for most of this year and can recommend them.2 are elixir apps that have been created on fly, 1 was an elixir app I had running on heroku, and 1 was rails app on heroku I recently migrated. I used their heroku migrator and it worked pretty much automatically. I had a few steps to follow to move the DB, but their docs covered it - https://fly.io/docs/rails/getting-started/migrate-from-herok...I didn&#39;t want a self-hosted flavor of Heroku, and I value an opinionated and active community around the platform. I&#39;ll mirror another comment here:&gt; Everyone wants to be the new Heroku, but that should be table stakes. Fly is innovative in the same way Heroku was when it launched."</p>

Check out the repo here: https://github.com/snaplet/postgres-wasmWe have a blog post about some of the interesting technical challenges that we faced whilst building this: https://www.snaplet.dev/post/postgresql-in-the-browserLike most things, this is built on-top of the amazing open-source projects that made this possible, but special mention goes to v86.js and buildroot. We just glued it together.My hope is that we as a community can own this project and make PostgresQL, and the software that runs on it, accessible to a larger audience.---[0] Request for collaboration: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32500526"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey HN, we’re excited about this launch. This was a collaborative effort with the team at Snaplet [0].postgres-wasm is an embeddable Linux VM with Postgres installed, which runs inside a browser. It provides some neat features: persisting state to browser, restoring from pg_dump, logical replication from a remote database, etc.The idea was inspired by CrunchyData’s HN post about a month ago [1]. We love the possibilities of Postgres+WASM, and so Supabase &amp; Snaplet teamed up to create an open source version. The linked blog post explains the technical difficulties we encountered, and the architecture decisions we made.We’re still working hard on this, but it’s at a good “MVP” stage where you can run it yourself. Snaplet are working on a feature where you can drag-and-drop a snapshot into your browser to restore the state from any backup. Supabase are exploring ways we can run the entire Supabase stack inside the browser. You can find the Snaplet repo here [2], and the Supabase fork here [3]. There’s very little difference between these two, we just have a different browser UI.Both Supabase team and the Snaplet team will be in here commenting if you want to know anything else about the technical details.[0] Snaplet: https://www.snaplet.dev/[1] Crunchy post: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32498435[2] Snaplet repo: https://github.com/snaplet/postgres-wasm[3] Supabase fork: https://github.com/supabase-community/postgres-wasm"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the things I love from this post is the collaboration on this kind of OSS projects.Making Postgres Wasm helped:- v86[0] to find a new bug- Providing a great deep-dive article that will trigger new ideas in the future- Showcase the possibilities of Wasm and how you can overcome the current challengesI really appreciate these projects are OSS :)Congratulations for the project![0] https://github.com/copy/v86"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Congratulations, Michael, thank you for sharing your story!A cautionary note on using Paypal as your sole payment system. If this is a considerable source of your income, I would caution against only using Paypal or keeping a large amount of money in that account. There are too many Paypal horror stories out there to mention of people getting their accounts limited or shut down without recourse because their automated checks flagged accounts for suspected fraud or violating their ToS. Best of luck!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi Michael, your story put a smile on my face. Its so awesome that you were able to leverage the Google workspace add-on marketplace for your QR code. I think there is still a lot of untapped markets apart from Contact tracing which might use QR codes. So keep plugging and wish You and Your co-founder all the power in the world. Start Small.Stay small."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi Micheal,I admire what you did, seriously. But here us the &#34;but&#34;...In no way am I understating the difficulty of what you have to go though. I am disabled myself and you should celebrate your success widely in t his forum.However, you lost me when you said:&gt;Also, I would like to encourage disabled people, older people to escape your comfort zone and make changes in the world.When you say that things like that you lump all disabilities into one amorphous blob and it actually harms the disabled community. That and your whole story is known as &#34;Disability Porn&#34;.Not all of us have disabilities that are constant and predictable. I was making six digits working at Cisco Systems and idea that I should struggle through it all for some notion of success almost killed me. I have Schizoaffective Bipolar Disorder. It is not predictable and it is way more stigmatized. Plus it get worse when you are under stress. I know you can appreciate that as the owner of a startup.So people will read your story, then they ask me what I do and when I am disabled they say a lot of stupid sht like; &#34;Why don&#39;t you get a part time job?&#34; Or &#34;You are so intelligent, can&#39;t you get an online job?&#34; All because they heard some guy who was disabled by polio did a startup up, or a man with no legs climbed Mount Everest.The part about telling us to &#34;escape our comfort zone&#34; was demeaning as well. In the U.S., many disabled people are forcefully pushed out of our comfort zones. I am currently homeless livening on disability as inflation makes me more and more uncomfortable.This is not to say I do not keep trying. I have taught my self Genetics, Nutritional Biology, amount other health related sciences in hope to keep me alive with this genetic disorder.  But there were times when the effort involved to merely brush my teeth was all the success I could muster.I am glad for you, really, but I had to say all this if not for anyone here, just for myself."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"After reading the article, I still don&#39;t understand the exception Apple purportedly gets from its tracking rules. As I understand it, Amazon is allowed to use activity in the Kindle app to show personalized ads in the Amazon Shopping app without using the ATT prompt. Isn&#39;t that the same thing as Apple using News app activity to personalize ads in the App Store?The part that is unfair is that no one but Apple gets to have an App Store or process IAPs, which has always been the problem with iOS. Trying to make it about ATT just seems like a red herring."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the reasons I pay a premium to use Apple&#39;s products is to not be part of an advertising ecosystem. I am disappointed that this seems to be changing. Ads in the App Store are one thing—ads in Maps, Books, and Podcasts as the article suggests may be coming in the future—will drive me to use premium (even if they&#39;re paid) alternatives. At a minimum, people who pay for an Apple monthly iCloud subscription should be able to opt-out (not just of tracking, which already exists, but seeing ads all together)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To be clear, this is entirely about advertising within Apple&#39;s App Store (that&#39;s what Apple Search Ads is). It has nothing to do with ads on the internet or in Safari, or even within third party apps."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I worked in adtech, I proposed a simple solution to ad fraud on our platform - assume any UA coming from an IP range owned by a cloud provider was a bot and don&#39;t show them ads, don&#39;t count their impressions.Worst case, people using a VPN hosted on EC2 might not see an ad, but I was certain they&#39;d cope. Best case, higher quality traffic increases yields.The business team vetoed that, it would adversely impact their numbers in the current quarter, and well, a significant proportion of their total comp was bonuses tied to those numbers. Also, the shareholders seemed to be of the mindset that has infected cryptocurrency speculators where no matter what, the spice must flow, wait, I mean, the number go up.Then there were all the &#34;bonuses&#34; and &#34;incentives&#34; negotiated with big advertisers or publishers. We just referred to them as kickbacks, because they totally are, but labeling something in code as kickbackPercentage was verboten. Just in case.Advertising has always been corrupt. Bots just corrupt it a little further."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you are paying any bill for ads, make sure you only pay for conversions.   Ie. unless the customer actually buys your product, then don&#39;t pay anything.   Eg. instead of paying $0.002 per view of your ad, or $0.10 per click of your ad, pay $6 per person who clicks your ad and then buys your product.That way, ad fraud doesn&#39;t affect you.    Plenty of ad providers allow such an option.   Internally, they convert your payments per conversion into payments per click and then payments per impression, but importantly this shifts the incentive to get rid of bots to them, not you - you no longer care.   The provider also has an incentive to send you customers who will actually buy your product, and to send the bots and web scrapers to their other clients."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few years ago, I tried to help out a locally owned gym do an experiment with Google Ad-Words. The place small storefront in a run-down strip mall straight out of the 1960s, but it had very good equipment for people that were in the know and it was 24 hours.The owner was a nice guy but he relied entirely on word-of-mouth and his technical skills extended to making expletive laced, 128-point-font signs reminding people to put equipment away in Word. I got the sense the business was not going well after a protracted battle with a former business partner, where the business partner just wanted to liquidate the assets and call it a day. He managed to buy the business partner out and continued to operate the place---sans a few treadmills. I decided to try and help him out by volunteering my time and some money to see if a small, targeted ad buy from Google could help him out. It sure beat finding another place like this.The dashboard made it look very targeted geographically. But, when I investigated where they were all coming from it was 95% international and from affiliates listings from very low quality sites with no information on them. A month and $300 later, I discontinued this experiment because the traffic was entirely bot driven.From that experience, I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that online Ad Tech is 99% a scam."</p>

His videos on YouTube are phenomenal at explaining not only the theory and techniques, but why you should care in the first place.Also, why should anyone study control theory? It&#39;s the math behind making real-world systems perform what you want them to do. In particular, robotics and autonomous vehicles rely heavily on techniques from control theory.If you watch Brian&#39;s videos, keep in mind that they bifurcated into two places: his original videos [1], and his more recent MATLAB tech talk videos [2].[1]: https://www.youtube.com/controllectures[2]: https://engineeringmedia.com/videos"</p>

I tracked that down assuming that it would limit PayPal&#39;s ability to charge you to their actual damages. But no, in fact the text is quite shocking:&gt; If you are a seller and receive funds for transactions that violate the Acceptable Use Policy, then in addition to being subject to the above actions you will be liable to PayPal for the amount of PayPal’s damages caused by your violation of the Acceptable Use Policy. You acknowledge and agree that $2,500.00 U.S. dollars per violation of the Acceptable Use Policy is presently a reasonable minimum estimate of PayPal’s actual damages - including, but not limited to, internal administrative costs incurred by PayPal to monitor and track violations, damage to PayPal’s brand and reputation, and penalties imposed upon PayPal by its business partners resulting from a user’s violation - considering all currently existing circumstances, including the relationship of the sum to the range of harm to PayPal that reasonably could be anticipated because, due to the nature of the violations of the Acceptable Use Policy, actual damages would be impractical or extremely difficult to calculate. PayPal may deduct such damages directly from any existing balance in any PayPal account you control. [emphasis is mine]As I read this (not a lawyer) PayPal claims that any violation of their acceptable use policy will result in an  a̶u̶t̶o̶m̶a̶t̶i̶c̶ charge of $2500 because that represents the &#34;minimum estimate&#34; of the damage your violation causes them.On top of being completely a completely unacceptable policy, the idea that any violation costs them at least $2500 is complete fucking horseshit, if you&#39;ll pardon my explicitness. There is absolutely no way I would ever do business with PayPal as a seller under any circumstances, even if it was my customers&#39; preferred method."</p>

(and much more)They didn&#39;t really even try to stop it in the early days. You could setup an injectable immunomodulator merchant account in under 10 minutes with Square. People started entire pill mills using Square and Paypal. It was wild!Similar to Turo who allowed the vehicles of their users to be used by weak KYC&#39;d users. You never knew who was actually driving the vehicle.I had loads of interesting conversations with Ex San Quentin prisoners, was riveting to listen to some of them talk about the crimes committed with all the fintech startups.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"FYI (before misinformation spreads): OP&#39;s title is a bit misleading. The $2500 policy has been in effect since at least September 20 of last year.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel like some of these perspectives are very tech industry focused rather than gamer focused.As a gamer, I think Stadia failed because the system they created doesn&#39;t make sense. You had to buy games at real $40-$60 prices but you could only play them through this limited service. I don&#39;t think anyone wants that.Compare that to paying the same price for a regular PC game which you can play via streaming using a streaming service, but also play locally, and know that you can take that game with you through multiple hardware decides and streaming services.With Stadia, if I move somewhere with bad internet, there is no way to recover the value of my games I purchased. There is no other gaming system like that. All other systems either have an offline possibility or are pure streaming where you aren&#39;t making a game purchase investment, like Xbox Gamepass or Luna.It just doesn&#39;t make sense except to a really small niche and is not competitive to the average gamer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As Google Stadia&#39;s target user, in my opinion a stronger reason Stadia died is because GeForce Now was a competing and better product.GeForce Now allowed me to play the games I already own with a more powerful machine than I could buy myself, for just $10/month. Artifacts were noticeable but not enough for me to care. If I bought my own gaming PC later, I would be able to continue playing the game there. GeForce Now offered &#34;Hey, you&#39;re playing Cyberpunk at 720p@25fps? Wanna play at 1080p@60fps for $10? And you can leave any time&#34; And I said heck yes.Stadia would have denied me the ability to continue playing on my own machine while charging me even more money. There are a bunch of stories of people with saved games trapped in Stadia. Google made no attempt to be better than the competition. It&#39;s like they&#39;re unaware of anything other than themselves."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are advantages to game streaming but Google never really did anything with them, instead they just made a worse version of a console.The marketing at the beginning was confusing. Everyone had the impression Stadia was like a Netflix for games. But it was almost the inverse, Stadia is a free gaming console but the games cost money. At the very least Google&#39;s number one pitch should have been &#34;We&#39;re giving you a gaming console for free. You could buy a PS5 for $500 or you could play on Stadia for $0!&#34; (In practice the free tier of Stadia didn&#39;t have the greatest quality but many people didn&#39;t even know Stadia had a free tier...)Game streaming could have opened up new possibilities. Any YouTube game video  could have a button for &#39;play instantly, one click&#39; that loaded an already running Stadia session into a game-state with the player in a fun spot. YouTubers could have been able to hand off controls of their game session to viewers. &#34;Okay GodGamer420 spamming in chat, if you think this boss is so easy, now you have control. Show us how it&#39;s done.&#34;Even the lowest hanging fruit. The biggest advantage of game streaming is that it works on any device but Stadia didn&#39;t even work on most Android phones at launch, and for many months after."</p>

For example that if the distribution of employees race does not match the general population then there must be a systemic cause for this.What I don’t understand is why that is assumed true.  If we want to encourage many different cultures to live together wouldn’t it naturally  make sense that different cultures would have different outcomes in job preferences?  How do you separate potential racism from cultural differences?My fear is if there are strong cultural differences that lead to disparate racial outcomes so organizations will always be able to point out that systemic issues exist even when they may be eradicated.  I don’t know how we measure this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Free Speech for Me--But Not for Thee: How the American Left and Right Relentlessly Censor Each Other (1992) [1] is a good read on how we got to a point where our ability to communicate across ideologies appears to be broken in many ways.For example, in 1963 Yale disinvited George Wallace, who was popular in the deep south, as a speaker. As a result, observers were deprived of a chance to hear opposing speakers&#39; arguments. To some, Yale appeared censorious. As Jonathan Rauch describes [2], that&#39;s not good for your case. Censorship is all these characters need to gain new followers. Wallace ran for president in 1968 and nearly forced a plurality which would have given him significantly more influence [3].Early episodes of the podcast So to Speak [4] by FIRE can inform the direction that can get us talking again. Basically, open and civil discourse is the way. The podcast demonstrates, through interviews with free speech advocates, a bunch of examples showing why that is a good target to shoot for, and how to achieve it.[1] https://archive.org/details/freespeechformeb0000hent[2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0T9XSG73kY&amp;t=4889s[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Wallace_1968_presidenti...[4] https://www.thefire.org/category/newsdesk/so-to-speak/page/1..."</p>

These include Australia, Canada, Germany, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, the UK, and the United States.&gt; ..PRC authorities ..use alternative means to apprehend fugitives. “Persuasion” has become a common tactic, which human rights groups have called “involuntary returns.” Such returns are achieved by threats against family members in the PRC, directly approaching and intimidating the fugitive overseas, or outright kidnapping ..Involuntary returns ..comprise a mix of genuine criminal fugitives, officials who have fallen out of favor with the CCP leadership, and others pursued for their religious or political beliefs.Earlier thread: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33049729"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Using &#34;persuasion&#34; in quotation marks is perhaps too nice.It&#39;s coercion, if not worse.Not that there is much we can do about it. Though limiting ability of Chinese authorities to operate outside china is fair. After all we don&#39;t permit organized crime either."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As the report says:&gt; a seemingly recent campaign to counter transnational telecom and online fraud (according to the official provincial statements)The increase in telecom scamming activity is a real thing in China, with scammers operating from southeastern Asia countries. And operators are often Chinese citizens hired for what they originally thought would be &#34;oversea job with good pay&#34;. The &#34;persuaded to return&#34; strategy might be targeted primarily at them.Those scams are particularly bad -- maybe even worse than the telecom scams happening in the US and other wealthy English-speaking countries -- because taking personal loans is way too easy in China. A few clicks on a lender&#39;s app and you get cash transferred to your account instantly. And there are hundreds of such apps. Scammers can talk victims into maxing out their credit lines and wire the loaned cash away.And the fact that there isn&#39;t &#34;personal bankruptcy&#34; laws in China also makes it worse. Such loans are rarely forgiven and victims often had to pay them off with their future income for years out of the fear that loan defaults can affect their credit score for life.So I guess this is Chinese police&#39;s way of &#34;do something about it&#34;. Of course they don&#39;t have jurisdiction overseas and should have gone with Interpol and/or local police first, except that hasn&#39;t been very effective. My 2 cents on the reasons behind this is:1. Local police might be paid off;2. No incentive for local police to prioritize their resource for cases like this -- there were no victims in their own countries;3. There are just too many scammers;Surely once this set up is in place it&#39;s possible to extend its coverage to harass/&#34;persuade&#34; political dissidents but CCP has already be doing it for years without it. If this oversea police &#34;persuasion&#34; program is getting local law enforcement&#39;s attention to the point that they can arrest both them and the scammers, I would see it as an absolute win."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yeah I had to implement this once because we ran a handful of ads on TikTok, so they wanted access to all of our traffic. I protested, saying they didn&#39;t need all traffic to do analytics for people who click through.. just tell me how to identify the traffic you need. This is fair, if somebody clicks on an ad then analytics would be expected.Yeah no, they didn&#39;t allow their advertisers to do that. I ended up getting permission to remove from the site when their pixel was found to be causing a performance impact for users. But without good monitoring for that they would have still been running, possibly for forever. I&#39;m sure this is basically how they get to be everywhere."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; You can’t stop data collection from the tech industry altogether, but with a few simple steps you can make a dent in the amount of information that’s being collected.&gt; Use privacy-protecting browser extensions. You can add extensions to your browser that will do a lot to protect your privacy. One is Disconnect, made by the company that performed our TikTok investigation. The Disconnect extension shows you how websites are trying to track you and blocks a lot of that data collection. Privacy experts often recommend uBlock Origin, as well.&gt; Change your browser’s privacy settings. A lot of browsers have built-in controls you can use to block trackers, including cookies, pixels, and other technologies. Open your browser’s preferences or settings, and you’ll usually find the controls in the privacy section.&gt; Try a more private browser. Google Chrome collects a lot of data on behalf of Google. The Consumer Reports Security Planner recommends Firefox and Brave as more privacy-focused options.Case closed when you use uBlock Origin preferably with Brave or Firefox. As an extra measure I disable JS Unless it&#39;s really needed, and surf in a private/incognito session to stop cookies building up."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What&#39;s kind of crazy is how the images tend to have similarities in small features that become very apparent when flipping back and forth between images, but which are not obvious per se.For example, I flipped back and forth between Beatrix Potter and Paulus Potter. A rounded white bonnet in one picture becomes a couple of blossoms in the other. The roof of a house becomes some shadowy wall with plants in the other. Two flower pots are very similar, just with slightly different coloring.It makes it more apparent that the algorithm etches the images out of noise, and if the seed is the same for two images with different prompts, you&#39;re likely to see traces of that noise represented differently but recognizable in both images."</p>

It is a profoundly expensive question. If pharmaceutical companies can deliver a pill that cures depression and gives life meaning without forcing users to face their angels and demons, then the FDA would give approval before the ink on the submission form had dried.

He it was who invented numbers and arithmetic and geometry and astronomy, also draughts and dice, and, most important of all, letters.Now the king of all Egypt at that time was the god Thamus, who lived in the great city of the upper region, which the Greeks call the Egyptian Thebes, and they call the god himself Ammon. To him came Theuth to show his inventions, saying that they ought to be imparted to the other Egyptians. But Thamus asked what use there was in each, and as Theuth enumerated their uses, expressed praise or blame, according as he approved or disapproved.&#34;The story goes that Thamus said many things to Theuth in praise or blame of the various arts, which it would take too long to repeat; but when they came to the letters, &#34;This invention, O king,&#34; said Theuth, &#34;will make the Egyptians wiser and will improve their memories; for it is an elixir of memory and wisdom that I have discovered.&#34; But Thamus replied, &#34;Most ingenious Theuth, one man has the ability to beget arts, but the ability to judge of their usefulness or harmfulness to their users belongs to another; and now you, who are the father of letters, have been led by your affection to ascribe to them a power the opposite of that which they really possess.&#34;For this invention will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it, because they will not practice their memory. Their trust in writing, produced by external characters which are no part of themselves, will discourage the use of their own memory within them. You have invented an elixir not of memory, but of reminding; and you offer your pupils the appearance of wisdom, not true wisdom, for they will read many things without instruction and will therefore seem to know many things, when they are for the most part ignorant and hard to get along with, since they are not wise, but only appear wise.&#34;"</p>

Outlawing using it to ID peaceful protestors is good.While the points about facial recognition misidentifying black people are true, I&#39;d rather it rely only on the civil rights issues associated with it working and not tie it to misidentifying minorities.

Why would they even need to keep such photographs? Data retention == legal liability."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The use of facial recognition has grown in recent years, despite fears that the technology is flawed, disproportionately misidentifies people of color (which has led to wrongful arrests) and harms civil liberties, but is still deployed against protesters, for investigating minor crimes and used to justify arrests of individuals from a single face match.I feel like I&#39;m the only peron where who doesn&#39;t see a problem with Police having access to facial recognition. Its not like anything used right now is accurate, eg eyewitnesses. If it really is unreliable it shouldn&#39;t be used as a sole basis to arrest people, I&#39;d expect a civil suit if that really happened. However just because some police mis-used it doesn&#39;t mean it should be banned."</p>

But it still feels like a huge amount of work, hoop jumping, and _fragility_ just to reach parity with VS Code/Helix/Zed, which are pretty great out of the box, and which were built to be used as rich development environments instead of extensible text editors.I&#39;ve spent months tweaking Neovim/Emacs configs in the past and I ultimately end up conceding that I&#39;d rather spend that time hacking on projects instead of my editor config. I do feel the pull of these editors, though. I&#39;d love to understand what those who stick with them are doing differently, other than perhaps being more susceptible to sunk cost fallacies. :-)"</p>

If you don&#39;t like its value proposition, don&#39;t use it. Simple. Keep using your IDE or whatever solution you prefer. This is almost exclusively happens in (neo)vim threads, and its so utterly distracting. That there is an entire community camped around neovim should answer your question about why anyone choses it over {insert non-vim solution}"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very important that you develop complete confidence that there isn&#39;t anything wrong with your product. It&#39;s not uncommon, in fact it&#39;s very common, for compromise kits for websites to take measures to avoid detection. A common one is only serving the malicious content when a specific referrer is present (I&#39;ve seen this be Yahoo Search in the case of compromised Drupal installations multiple times, not really sure why). It might be wise to engage a security firm to conduct an investigation if you don&#39;t have in-house expertise in this area. You should definitely review logs carefully for any unusual inbound traffic. Sometimes looking up your own domain on services like virustotal can reveal the problem, as it might turn up samples of malware retrieved from your website.I say this because I have been involved in this exact situation multiple times: website flagged by some or other security service, website operator has no idea why and insists it is fine, website turns out to be serving the landing page of a major pharma scam campaign unnoticed by the website operator due to anti-detection measures."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve noticed that the people running automated flagging systems seem to become inordinately smug to the point that they believe their false positive result over all forms of external evidence. So to them you are a criminal and that&#39;s that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As has already been said, there&#39;s a chance that you are compromised and don&#39;t know.  Obviously keep trying to contact MS, but in the mean time I&#39;d make as much sure as you can that they don&#39;t have a legitimate beef.If you&#39;re willing to share more details about your site such as your tech stack, we can probably give you more specific advice beyond &#34;check your logs for weirdness and hire a consultancy firm that deals with breach detection,&#34; though that is good advice.For what it&#39;s worth I went through something similar to this not too long ago, so I know how maddening it is.  My client never found any breach (though I did find some PHP library CVE&#39;s that could have conceivably been chained together to wreak some havoc), but I ended up rebuilding their prod environment clean and the flag went away on it&#39;s own after a couple days, probably because whatever malware was in there had disappeared."</p>

I&#39;ll say it again, companies should be legally forbidden from blocking 3rd party clients.  They don&#39;t have to explicitly support them, but taking action to explicitly thwart them (and writing ToS that forbids them) should be outlawed.  There&#39;s no reason I should have to be subjected to untold tracking, snooping and advertising functionality to be able to post or look at photos and comment on them.  Tech companies get to exploit the public under the guise of something useful, while also getting to completely dictate the terms of that usage.  The only thing that limits their exploitation of users is the laws applicable in the relevant jurisdictions (and sometimes not even that).  Too bad looking out for the rights of users is apparently just a complete non-issue to anyone in power."</p>

https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2019/07/ftcs-5-bi...&gt; Another way the FTC says Facebook violated the order was by failing to adequately assess and address privacy risks posed by third-party developers. Other than getting developers to click an “I agree” terms-and-conditions box when registering an app with the Facebook Platform, Facebook didn’t screen developers or their apps before giving them access to massive amounts of data that users had designated as private. Of course, in the wrong hands, information like that can grease the wheels for identity thieves and fraudsters.&gt; The order imposes additional requirements to address Facebook’s illegal conduct. For example, Facebook must implement a stringent program to monitor third-party developers and terminate access to any developer that doesn’t follow the rules.https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2019/07/ftcs-5-bi..."</p>

I want to believe it&#39;s for better privacy and security, but it&#39;s being driven by a corporation or two, and that makes me 100% suspicious. Like, for example, suddenly Edge is no longer respecting local DNS options and my pihole protects one fewer device from the real dangers to privacy. I don&#39;t want to be cynical so often, but this really doesn&#39;t feel like a benevolent move. Yeah, it&#39;s conditional at the moment, but as with Chrome and manifest v3, among many other examples, I&#39;m losing my faith that anything with the potential to increase ad revenue will remain turned off for long."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; the VPN will automatically connect when you’re using public Wi-Fi or browsing unsecured networks and sites lacking a valid HTTP certificate.OK, that&#39;s actually a pretty decent idea. It&#39;s not going to be always-on, but it&#39;s providing security specifically for things like coffeeshops/libraries and for sites that don&#39;t provide their own security. In other words, it&#39;s &#34;backup security&#34;, not rerouting all of your &#34;normal&#34; secure traffic at work/home.This mainly protects sites you visit from having JavaScript injected into them by networks when there aren&#39;t any other protections, and the VPN is run by Cloudflare so it will be performant, so I don&#39;t really see any problems here? Seems like a positive development actually."</p>

For example, see the price of major indexes like the S&amp;P 500 or the NASDAQ and plot it on a 10+ year timescale.What surprises me the most actually is how quickly Google can adapt to the situation. Basically, they have been giving out candy for free when there was lots of money coming and now that they expect less, they quickly put on extra income streams and cut out money losers.[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33022768[2]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32927848"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMHO: Google is handling a bunch of things, including Stadia, and including GCP, in a very poor way.GCP: copycat of AWS, but with less high margin, higher level services, so have been losing money since the beginning (ask some of Alphabet&#39;s board members, if you can, and watch their eyes rolling). The only thing that could have given them the advantage - not, not Kubernetes, although K was and is a great thing to fund - was a &#34;cloud in a box&#34; product, so companies could install a rack of GCP in their existing Data Centers, and use it. See &#34;The Cloud Wars of 2017&#34;, written by me [0] six years ago.Stadia: you can&#39;t build Stadia without getting into account that the market has one big monopoly (Steam), and a few huge other ones (Xbox, Epic, etc). The strategy has simply been to ignore this simple fact. It&#39;s like Netflix building a streaming service, without a huge investment into content as well. Doomed to fail from the get go.Small rant, no horses in this game on my part; just a pity that two huge opportunities were wasted like this.[0]: https://medium.com/simone-brunozzi/the-cloud-wars-of-2017-ac..."</p>

Very few people are going to buy 30 competing options as well as a known good control and compare and contrast them in a scientific context, but that&#39;s what&#39;s needed.I remember looking around for a Radon sensor for way too long. An electronic device, a litmus-like strip test, some analog crystal ball -- hell a mail-in lab kit bag of carbon -- but they all seemed inaccurate. The few people that &#34;bought two&#34; always showed heavy variance while the majority that bought and got a number *loved it*. Even buying two that agree often just means the products are consistently and predictably wrong, but most products don&#39;t even check this box ffs.Reviewers that try and apples-to-apples all products by comparing cost, size, advertised features and ergonomics are doing no better than you or I opening up a package and appraising it. For awhile this Google dev was putting up extremely detailed amazon reviews for USBC cables based on their purported features v. reality and it was wonderful, but tucked away and undiscoverable.The world needs multiple parties providing unbiased in-depth reviews, but there&#39;s very little will to pay for even one group to do something like this. Ironically, paying for information in the information age seems almost comical to today&#39;s consumers and while there&#39;s demand for good information, no one&#39;s willing to open their wallets. Labdoor moved from subscription-only memberships to &#34;certified products&#34; and affiliate links because everyone wants to know what&#39;s in their multivitamin, but no one wants to pay for an indepth review. We aren&#39;t cultivating a supply-side that works for us, but against us.The result of this is shilling and fake reviews running wild. I mean hell, consumers will buy a product knowing full well they might get a shoddy knock off and yet it&#39;s $5 less and they can get it tomorrow so they&#39;ll roll the dice. Sadly, we don&#39;t live in a world where people are intimately concerned with quality and accuracy in their purchases.edit: USBC not USB3"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My cheap co2 sensor shows dramatically different readings for my office with the window closed vs open. It is great at reminding me to crack my window open to get more air flow.Its temperature sensor is within a couple degrees of my nest&#39;s remote sensor.My Amazon vo2 sensor can tell if I turned my kitchen fan on to a sufficient level to clear out whatever I am cooking.Lots of sensors don&#39;t need to be precise, they just need to indicate if some action needs to be taken.e.g. If there is a fire, I just need the alarm to go off, I don&#39;t care how hot the fire is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Relative VOC measurements at least are able to detect a no. 2 in nappies. Great to distinguish if you should go in and change them or would be a distraction from falling to sleep when checking. I bulit a Pi ZeroW that measures on the side of the bed and publishes a curve of the last hour of the values. You can see a pretty salient drop when &#34;it&#34; happens."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google&#39;s tendency to do this is why I will never pay Google for any of their services, nor jump onboard any that don&#39;t already have widespread adoption. I knew Stadia wouldn&#39;t last, and I knew it&#39;d be a better choice to stick with companies that actually have some experience in the games industry instead.So good job guys. You proved that yet again, Google will kill off a new service/product before it ever has the chance to get good, and validated everyone&#39;s fears about the same."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I never so much as a saw a single advertisement or retail display for Stadia in the two years since it launched.Microsoft lost A BILLION dollars a year for 4 YEARS before they ever turned a profit on Xbox.You cannot &#34;Lean Startup&#34; your way into a consumer platform."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"OSM needs some form of gamification adding to it.Google Maps app is great, lets you gain points by adding information &amp; photos &amp; reviews etc. They even send you a free bespoke pair of socks or a badge if you&#39;re active enough. So fun to add photos and then see how many views they get (I posted one of a chippy in Scotland (for Americans that&#39;s Fish &amp; Chip &#39;Thick French Fries&#39; shop) which got over 1.4 million views - mental). The location history feature suggests things  to contribute which helps too.Would be good to have something similar to make contributing fun."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When looking at these then/now renderings, one needs to take into account, that only very little of the actual data is rendered on those maps.The database contains an incredible level of detail which can be used in completely different contexts and I&#39;d say what&#39;s rendered is roughly only 1/10th of the data"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some background from the guy who maintains this site at https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Zverik/diary/399925.There is a script (disclaimer, that I wrote) to set up a couple of docker images so you can create / host something like this yourself: https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/mvexel/diary/399939. It requires downloading of a &#34;full history&#34; OSM data file for the region of interest."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As someone who operated on the &#34;adult internet&#34; with payment processors and related infrastructure without being 18, I still carry forward the constant fear that I&#39;ll be banned for retroactive Terms of Service violations incurred when I was a kid. It really sucks when it&#39;s services like AdSense because you&#39;re just screwed forever.I really really wish the internet was more supportive of &#34;early hackers&#34; who want to experiment. I get that there are tons of implications around contract law and child labor here, but there really needs to be an escape hatch if a parent agrees to whatever activity is being done. Ostensibly, this is a young creator getting discouraged from their hobby, even though they&#39;ve shown that they&#39;re good enough at it to deserve some form of compensation. This&#39;ll leave a bad taste in the kid&#39;s mouth for a long time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I received a lifelong ban on using Google Ad products when I was 16 after experimenting with clicking my own ads (and asking my high school friends to click on them). I remember the account accumulated almost $80 before Google detected the suspicious activity and banned me.Given that this was 16 years ago, it would be nice to get second chance.."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been banned-for-life from a handful of services after I lied about my age as a kid.I can see both (all?) sides of this:- As a society we ought to be forgiving of harmless youthful indiscretions- As a business you shouldn&#39;t have to give second chances to people who blatantly defraud you- There is a big can of worms when it comes to doing business with minors on the internet. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a solution as easy as &#34;well when they&#39;re 18, let them log into their account and update their age to acknowledge that they were using the service as a minor&#34; or &#34;just let people open multiple accounts (with wildly different ages) under their name.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Don’t mistake this for victory. Google’s standard playbook when forcing things people don’t like is to spread the action out over a longer timeframe, exhausting the media and keeping the final blow mostly out of the news, and exhausting our individual outrage and will to keep fighting. It works every time, and it’ll work again if we become complacent again. Until and unless Google meaningfully commits to never neuter ad blockers, it’s still critical and urgent that we switch to Firefox."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The postponement was practically inevitable. Manifest v3 is a slow moving train wreck. Extension developers know it isn&#39;t ready and won&#39;t be ready by January.Happy holidays to me, I can kick this can down the road too.Look at some of the known issues:
https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/known-issue...Userscript managers supportEstimated timeline: Canary support around October, 2022.Service workers are not started in response to webRequest eventsEstimated timeline: Targeting Canary support before October, 2022.No way they were going to be ready to disable v2 in January for the stable channel."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So I was actually trying out uBlock Origin Lite [1] (the MV3 compatible version) as my daily driver for the past week and I must say it&#39;s not that bad. I had to manually enable content access for a handful of sites but doing so on an opt-in basis and getting more performant experience on 98% of other sites is actually something I&#39;m going to use going forward even if MV2 compatibility gets pushed further into the future.I wonder how long things will stay that way though, when sites will tailor their tracking/ad annoyances to exploit the MV3 limitations. I really wouldn&#39;t want to opt into every single site I visit.[1] https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases/tag/uBOLite_0.1.2..."</p>
