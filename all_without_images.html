								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s worth mentioning that many smartphone users upload content to Youtube seemingly mistakenly and unaware that they are doing so (also known as fat-fingering[0]). A quick search for:    DSC001.mp4

And then filtering that by recently uploaded always yields interesting results. For those that don&#39;t know, `DSC-XXX` is a standard naming scheme for digital cameras. More on the default naming scheme in the following link[1][0] https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fat-fingerin...[1] https://datagenetics.com/blog/december22012/index.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This hack is great because the dev didn&#39;t have to read assembly code or parse WireShark logs or deploy any kind of cracking software. They simply observed the ecosystem carefully and deduced a failure mode through some serious mental BFS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Classic &#34;confused deputy&#34; problem. What is the current recommendation in the modern microservices world to solve it?When user agent (UA) makes authenticated call to service A, which in turn makes call to service B:UA -[user auth]-&gt; A -[????]-&gt; Bhow to pass authentication information from A,  when making a call to B? Options I can think of:- pass UA token as is. This has a problem that token becomes too powerful and can be made to call any service.- pass own token and pass user auth info as an additional field. This doesn&#39;t solve confused deputy problem, since own token can be used with any user auth and service B can be tricked to make request for data in B not belonging to user- Mint new unique token derived from tuple (A own token, UA token, B service name). B then extracts user information from the token presented by A and authorizes request. This seems to solve confused deputy problem, because A has no access to other UA tokens, so it can&#39;t mint a new token for a wrong user. Downside is that token minting should probably be done in another service and it requires making a call to it for almost every request between two microservices, making it a bottleneck pretty quickly.I&#39;ve never seen last one in real life, maybe it has some critical flaws  I am failing to see?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I kind of wonder if we&#39;re looking at solving this the wrong way. Instead of mandating that manufacturers take specific steps to fix the waste problem, maybe it would be better to tag items at manufacture and charge device makers a percentage based on how long before it enters the waste stream.Manufacturers could solve this by either:- Making their things easy to repair- Creating in house recycling programs- Making equipment more durable and longer lastingAny combination of the above. By picking one specific way of reducing waste, we are ignoring other factors. Few people care to repair Android phones because you can&#39;t upgrade the OS after 2 years regardless. It doesn&#39;t matter if the hardware is repairable, the device is greatly devalued at that point. Like wise, if it&#39;s super expensive to repair an iPhone, people aren&#39;t going to bother and will just replace it.By focusing on the end result -&gt; Devices entering the waste stream &lt;- the manufacturers are responsible for ensuring hardware gets responsibly recycled, repaired, or just doesn&#39;t break. Obviously, to make this work the cost per device entering the stream would have to be significant compared to the cost of the device.Also, the cost should be the responsibility of the maker. Currently in some place in the US, consumers pay the cost to dispose of/ recycle televisions. The result is we end up with TVs on the side of the road. Often on the way away from the dump where people refuse to pay the disposal fee then toss the TV out the door on the way home."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t describe how much I hope something comes out of it. Not because I have some illusion of this tackling corporate greed, or helping the environment - devices will likely become more expensive and bulkier as a result, supply chain of replacement parts is generating heaps of waste too.I simply am surrounded by tens and hundreds of sort-of-broken devices that don&#39;t force me to replace yet, but are not fixable either. The laptop overheats, phone compass never works properly, one port in the TV is dead, there is no light in the fridge (but it still works). The list goes on. I just want a world where stuff lasting a lifetime exists."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just yesterday my SO told me the subwoofer was broken. It&#39;s a wireless unit, which pairs with the soundbar, which I got with my TV about 5 years ago.I quickly come to the conclusion the power supply is broken. And of course the power supply is internal.I tried to open up the thing, being fairly competent with electronics. But try as I might, I just couldn&#39;t figure out how this thing comes apart. I don&#39;t want to brute force it, thing is stylish and my SO likes that about it, but also a lot of plastic so easy to break.Ok, I searched the web for a service manual. Nothing. Not even close.In contrast, the DVD player my mom uses (mostly as a glorified CD player) died before xmas. It&#39;s an old Sony unit, bought in 2000 or 2001, and been on ever since (standby or active). I searched and I found a beautiful service manual, with detailed schematics and instructions for disassembly and reassembly. Even the PCB itself has lovely markings making it very clear what is going on where.Quickly discovered the issue in the power supply and ordered some replacement parts (still waiting).Sure I could probably have found a second-hand DVD player for cheap. But yeah it just seemed so senseless to toss away a perfectly good unit when by all accounts it just needs $3 worth of parts."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I see a number of people here describing Parler as &#34;unmoderated&#34;, but it turns out they do have extensive moderation [1] that they use to ensure ideological conformity in their posts. Then the most active users were paid for their content too [2]. This really makes it more of a propaganda weapon than a free speech platform.[1] https://twitter.com/donk_enby/status/1347939939120533506
[2] https://twitter.com/donk_enby/status/1346565749977051136"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This story truly terrifies me: my team owns my company&#39;s sign up page. (I speak for myself and not them, of course).Sounds like Parler, fearing that their OTP provider might go down, decided to fail-open, ie: if the dependency throws an exception, presume there&#39;s something wrong with the dependency and that the code provided is acceptable. It never occurred to them that the dependency could be down permanently, or that malicious actors[0] would be able to realize it and exploit to quickly.Lesson learned: do not fail open where security matters, where authentication matters. Failing closed prevents new users/customers from signing up, but it protects your existing users/customers.[0]From a security standpoint, these are malicious actors. I would also probably buy said malicious actors a beer if I met them, accompanied by a high five.Edit: this is a hypothesis of course. Maybe the bug was somewhere else in the system- it could be in Twilio&#39;s provided integration library where the fail-open occurred."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;In a press release announcing the decision, Twilio revealed which services Parler was using. This information allowed hackers to deduct that it was possible to create users and verified accounts without actual verification.&gt;With this type of access, newly minted users were able to get behind the login box API used for content delivery. That allowed them to see which users had moderator rights and this in turn allowed them to reset passwords of existing users with simple “forgot password” function. Since Twilio no longer authenticated emails, hackers were able to access admin accounts with ease.So these &#39;security researchers&#39; are random hackers that illegally gained access to accounts and servers are actively doxxing people and this behaviour&#39;s now being praised?Apart from being illegal, I seem to recall severe backlash against several instances of doxxing in the past, which is exactly what these people have done.I wonder if people would still be cheering this on if 70TB worth of twitter information had been leaked instead."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m struggling to try to understand what this means for the risks of running a business in the cloud going forward. It was not just AWS dropping them, but many of their other vendors dropped them too, essentially killing their business overnight.Granted, for this first case the bar was extremely high. You needed literal storming of the Capitol and a platform seemingly specifically targeted at those people for this to happen. However, now that the precedent is set, I would expect the bar to be lowered going forward. That creates risks that need to somehow be mitigated (and reflected in valuations).Even for businesses that are not in such politically charged areas, I can easily imagine getting inadvertently tangled up in some popular issue and having vendors become targets of online activist (whether it&#39;s your own vendors, or whether you are a vendor to a target).What are the best mitigations here, both technical and social? Vocally side with the popular issues, or try to stay completely out of them, to try to avoid becoming a target (e.g., social media presence)? Try to reduce dependence on cloud providers and vendors by building more in-house? How far would you have to go, since a colo or an ISP can drop you just as AWS can?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"All I’m going to say is that I’m all for free speech and setting fair rules for everyone to play by (ie regulation), but looking at the examples provided in the buzzfeed articles this is beyond simple free speech. I hear a lot of people saying this is just another example of the left trying to shut down free speech but there are clear threats being made on the platform. If Parler doesn’t want to do any content regulation then fine (though this should be any easy place to draw the line), but I can’t blame Amazon for saying “we don’t want that here”."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a former Ubiquiti employee, I&#39;m sad to watch the slow decline of the company. There was a steady exodus of engineering talent through 2020. The CEO was focused on moving to countries where engineering was cheaper and employees complained less about constant crunch mode. If you search around, you can find interviews where he brags about closing the San Jose office because he thought everyone there was too entitled.The saddest part is that we had many good engineers who could have continued to do amazing things with the UniFi momentum. So much time was wasted on dead end products like FrontRow. Most everyone I know left for jobs where we were treated better and paid more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"PSA: with Mailchimp URLs, it&#39;s best to remove the `?e=xxx` URL parameter. That way, A) you can&#39;t be identified by the sender as the person who shared the email, and B) other people can&#39;t flood your inbox by clicking the &#34;unsubscribe&#34; link at the bottom of the email.In this case, the cleaned URL that should have been posted is https://mailchi.mp/ubnt/account-notification"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regarding authenticity, from the TechCrunch article about this:&gt; The networking company quickly followed its email with a post on its community pages confirming that the email was authentic, after several complained that the email sent to customers included typos.Indeed: How am I supposed to know whether this email is really from Ubiquiti?* There was apparently no official press release.* All links in the email, including the &#34;Change password&#34; button, are to e.g. `https://ui.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=somehexnumber&amp;i...`.* The delivering server is `mail42.atl11.rsgsv.net`, which the TLD of which doesn&#39;t seem to resolve in my browser to provide hints.* Various news sites that reported this either just referred to &#34;emails people got&#34;, screenshots random people got via Twitter, or link to the Mailchimp site, for which I&#39;m not sure how to verify whether the &#34;ubnt&#34; account actually belongs to Ubiquiti.Given this, how shall the normal affected user figure out that this isn&#39;t well-executed phishing?It seems companies could do a much better job making it obvious that their emails are legit. Especially if they were just breached, and &#34;Change password&#34; buttons are involved."</p>

The blame for Myanmar violence should be placed squarely on the people that are spreading misinformation that incites violence.  Even if Facebook does a better job policing content, don&#39;t you think these perpetrators will find an equally effective technology to spread their propaganda?  If not now, then in the future surely they will?Don&#39;t get me wrong, I do think Facebook should police clear misinformation that can lead to human suffering, but it seems like the media want to convince me to hate Facebook.  I hate the people behind this misinformation.  And, I would love Facebook to get involved, but I don&#39;t hate them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I mentioned this on Twitter[1], the reason to encrypt before sending over SSL is not about double encryption, it’s about how a large backend system is designed.Often, you have load balancers that are SSL endpoints, so the data is decrypted at that point.You can start to see the problem already. What if there is a different bug, and so a dev starts logging requests somewhere down the line? You accidentally start logging cleartext passwords. Oops. Facebook was fined for this not that long ago.But if the password is encrypted, then it’s not really an issue, and the black box blob can be forwarded to a login microservice. There, the team decrypting will be on higher alert.So depending on the structure of various teams, you now have fewer teams that need that kind of security oversight and can move faster.Smaller blast radius of something goes wrong.[1] https://twitter.com/sroussey/status/1347688753221931010?s=21"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve heard about the security of a mobile banking app about eight or so years ago, when mobile banking was still very much a new thing and trust was a big issue. They too opted to write a second encryption layer on top of TLS / SSL, fearing MITM attacks. That was also when iOS didn&#39;t support SSL pinning yet.It seemed to work for them, security researchers went to town on it and while they quickly discovered there was a second encryption layer below SSL, they were unable to determine what it was and how to crack it.IIRC their encryption was never broken, and thanks to that track record, they slowly increased daily spend limits over the mobile app.Long term, because they were very forward-thinking and they had competent native app developers (as opposed to the competition who struggled for years with mobile web / crossplatform tech), they increased their market share by a lot, now being the largest bank in NL; can&#39;t find historical data, but they went from 37% in 2016 to 40% in 2018."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I keep being somewhat baffled by Steam&#39;s login process every time I&#39;m forced to go through it. Apparently Steam is such a cesspool of (pre)pubescent teenagers, with rampant account hacking and theft of funds, swag or whatever, that they feel the need to fortify the process if only to make it more inconvenient for the hackers.- “Remember the password” barely ever works, even on desktop. Since I don&#39;t quite log in every day due to being too old for that, I have to redo the process every time—on a machine that I bought with my own money just for myself and intend to protect with both technical means and physical force.- Somehow copy-pasting passwords from KeepassX/XC doesn&#39;t work on Mac, with the shortcut. Not sure if this is a misfeature of Steam, but I have to paste the password to an editor first and then copy out of there into Steam. (Seems though that ‘paste’ in the context menu does work—this might&#39;ve changed since I first noticed the issue.)- And of course, the weird variation on 2fa, via email, instead of the good regular TOTP. As is tradition by now, I&#39;m also given the choice of installing yet another app on the phone, which somehow doesn&#39;t quite seem to serve my interest."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m just going to come out and say something that I&#39;ve had a hard self reflective time coming to the conclusion of. I don&#39;t believe in free speech without limits.I have strongly felt that the actions taken by these companies is morally and ethically the right thing to do, for any business and that is inconsistent with believing in true free speech. My line for free speech seems to lie in speech that incites violence or speech that discriminates against people for immutable characteristics of their person, both of which I know Parler harbors in abundance. I think there are simply some ideas that are too repugnant to not rebuke.That said I don&#39;t like how centralized we&#39;ve become on these existing platforms either. Monopoly on communication means it&#39;s too easy to let that window slide on what is acceptable speech to limit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It must feel pretty surreal to be someone that is constantly moving to different communication apps and instantly finding them pulled by anyone and everyone.We&#39;ve seen an escalation of this from higher-level platforms (obviously Twitter can ban an account if they desire) to medium-level platforms (I suppose Apple gets to pick what I can do on my own phone even if it feels a bit wrong), but I&#39;m curious if this will also escalate to low-level platforms (will hosting companies, registrars, or even ISPs start taking similar actions on a regular basis?).At this point it appears to be in a bit of a feedback loop as well, since it&#39;s obvious that deplatforming groups will make them feel persecuted and even more upset, which then makes them more likely to be deplatformed by whichever platform they move to next.Could this escalate even past low-level companies and result in decentralized, uncensorable, and end-to-end encrypted technologies having action taken against them (as more users, including some that are radicalized, seek them out)? I certainly hope not, but I have no faith in our government&#39;s various administrations here to begin with, especially given that we are likely only at the beginning of these types of conflicts.(Obligatory note that I am not defending any given platform, group of people, or anything of that matter, as I find it much more interesting to talk about how systems like this may play out instead)"</p>

Open a directory that loads slowly (e.g. one with thousands of files on a smb3 mount)2. While the list is loading, select a file (but do not open it)3. Wait for the whole list to loadOnce the list finishes loading, the file on the very top of the list gets automatically selected (discarding your selection).Thus, if you select a file and click open, in the time between you select and click open, the selection can auto-change and you&#39;ll end up opening something else than what you&#39;ve selected.It is this bad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You will find lots of such examples of a feature which you personally find very important and wonder why such a simple thing is not supported yet. I guess everyone has such examples. And you will also find such examples for MacOSX or Windows.For me personally, I wonder why mouse wheel/scroll acceleration is still not implemented. I implemented it a while ago for Xorg, which is outdated now, and also the maintainer was not happy with my approach. It&#39;s now a long outstanding proposal for libinput, https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libinput/libinput/-/issues/7 / https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/-/issues/405 (original bug report from 2010: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29905).Anyway, I guess there are actually not too much people caring about this feature. And the intersection of those who do and those who have enough free time and knowledge to implement this is just empty.Btw, I don&#39;t quite understand the comment about KDE. It sounds like the the author claims that KDE lacks other relevant features. But comparing Gnome vs KDE, it is quite clear that KDE has much more features. This is never a complaint I heard about KDE."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has somehow gotten worse in recent years.  When saving, it used to be you could use the mouse to navigate to a directory, then type the desired filename, and press enter.Now, typing the filename initiates a contextual search within the current directory.Clicking in the filename textbox and starting to type doesn’t work either.  You have to highlight the base (not the extension or “.”) of the filename.  At that point, you can finally start typing the name of the file you want to save.The same problem occurs if the file chooser happens to already be in the directory where you want to save the file."</p>

Add to that the subdomain-driven localization strategy and many other moves that were considered SEO best practices back in those years when the on-page factors used to matter.But that was just the start. Wikipedia killed it in SEO when it was easy to do so, but it also did one other thing that most SEO-driven sites (eg: About) didn&#39;t do correctly - it cared deeply about the content quality and also resisted to run ads (anyone remember Jason Calacanis&#39; articles on how they are leaving $100m on the table? See [1]). So when Panda came around, Google correctly rewarded Wikipedia with #1 rankings for over 50% of its terms (!!), and Jason Calacanis had to shut down Mahalo which got destroyed by Panda.Wikipedia&#39;s dominance continues because it&#39;s basically impossible to overcome its lead in inbound links and domain authority. Add to that a surprisingly under-the-radar company culture which has avoided any major blow ups despite its community wielding so much leverage over the world&#39;s education and having to make a lot of difficult calls on a daily basis.Well done.[1] https://calacanis.com/2006/10/28/wikipedia-leaves-100m-on-th..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In grad school back in like 2007 I took a 2-credit class called &#34;The History of Nuclear Enterprise&#34; taught by one of those long white-haired Doc Brown type professors. The final project was for each of us to make Wikipedia pages describing some important topic that wasn&#39;t covered yet. I made one on the university&#39;s nuclear reactor which had just been shut down. I dug through many linear feet of archived info, scanning photos and collecting various info for the page. It was super rewarding. I was hooked.Variously since then I have gone deep into some fringe but important-to-some topic and found hard-to-find sources. I&#39;ve found it effective to collect and present this information in Wikipedia pages.Like a few months ago I made the page for the Aircraft Reactor Experiment [1], the world&#39;s first molten salt-fueled nuclear reactor, built and operated with intent to make nuclear-powered long-range aircraft. I&#39;m pretty proud of the page, and go back to use it somewhat regularly. Having the platform of Wikipedia inspires me to go the slight extra mile in personal research in a way that can be used by everyone.Thanks Wikipedia, for existing.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_Reactor_Experiment"</p>

The field of control theory has some really simple and really robust methods for getting a system from state A to state B. If you aren&#39;t trying to learn how the system works simultaneous to your algorithm being deployed, it can be a really a good fit.This book and control theory solve different problems. I&#39;m just commenting because I sometimes see modern ML folks trying to apply super duper general techniques to problems that are easily solved specifically with simple undergrad-level techniques from the specific fields (including this material to control problems).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Advertising is evil episode 3457I know I say this a lot but ad-supported business models are corrupting. Spam is the original sin of the open internet and the unwillingness to get to grips with this is a big part of why we can&#39;t have nice things.Context: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Canter_and_Martha_Sie...On Usenet, which ran on NNTP, every user could maintain their own killfile, which would allow people to hide spam. But it wasn&#39;t easy to share killfiles, and while the more technically capable people would easily filter it out they were also blinding themselves to a problem that eventually choked the life out of the community. Similar observations could be made about advertising on the web, from standardized banners leading towards today&#39;s web horrible mess.The basic problem is that the costs of spamming and lying are generally a lot lower than the potential profits, so the more opent he system the more spam it tends to attract. Try looking at used car adverts on Craigslist for example, dealers in busy areas tend to run a hundred ads a day with 500 keywords. Some people flag them, of course, but most don&#39;t bother and the profit in selling a single car is worth the minor downsides."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve worked at both SV and traditional companies, and I feel like this very closely matches my experience.One of the things I worry about is that even at companies that are doing &#34;Agile transformations&#34; and adopting methodologies like Scrum, in practice have &#34;Product Owners&#34; who are there to give instructions via Jira tickets. Other roles like &#34;Business Analysts&#34; are there to ensure that lowly developers never have to worry about things like understanding the business themselves.So I get funny looks when I suggest that engineers should go talk to people in the business, and write design docs. Silicon Valley engineering practices can look very non-Agile to a lot people from traditional companies that are doing Agile."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have noticed that as SV companies get larger they tend to adopt the more &#34;old school&#34; approach. Not that it&#39;s a binary - it&#39;s a spectrum, and depending on management chain/how an org runs, people can have different experiences.I think it&#39;s caused by1. When you have very deep management chains you start to have lots of people with opinions on what you should do, how you should do it, who you should do it with. Even if on average most of them aren&#39;t micromanagers, it only takes a few.2. As you grow you start pulling in more people with experience outside of SV who bring in culture with them. Note that &#34;SV&#34; is also not monolithic here. Companies like Microsoft (ok, technically not SV) are farther to the &#34;traditional&#34; side of the spectrum.3. &#34;Horizontals&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a good article but there is a causality problem. I know a lot of pure software companies in the EU that work like that. If software is your core business, developers are in the loop at every decision, if your core business is building power plants...they are not. Now the Marc Andressen argument might be that software eats the world and everybody should run their business like this, and that might actually be true or not. Beside this product/core relationship problem, I see one other issue and that are margins, many SV companies are comparatively young and are in new markets with high margins (or ridiculously high funding) these high margins change their way of doing business."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There isn&#39;t exactly a shortage of examples where mmap() was in the short-term quite convenient to get to market quickly with something Good Enough to appear production ready, that in the long-term proved to be rather problematic.Mongodb&#39;s original mmap storage engine (32-bit support anyone?), ultimately required replacement (wiredtiger was purchased in part for this reason IIRC).systemd-journald read side (journalctl, `systemctl status`, sd-journal API), performance/scalability definitely suffers from the decision to use mmap for all IO.mmap IO is extremely seductive in terms of programming style/convenience as it facilitates writing procedural, IO-naive code that assumes file-backed memory accesses Just Work.  But this is transparently blocking, synchronous code.Since your program isn&#39;t explicitly scheduling IO and continuations for execution upon completion of IO, there&#39;s zero application-level IO parallelism.  The only asynchronous IO possible is what the kernel can automagically perform using relatively dumb page fault heuristics and madvise() hints.When your process triggers a major fault on an mmap region, everything comes to a grinding hault; no speculative execution past that point, no potential for triggering other page faults in other files or independent regions of the same file, it all stops until the data is read from the backing store.  Not without the use of threads, which brings a host of other issues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Claiming &#34;mmap is faster than system calls&#34; is dangerous.I once worked for a company where they also heard someone say &#34;mmap is faster than read/write&#34; and as a consequence rewrite their while( read() ) loop into the following monstrosity:1. mmap a 4KB chunk of the file2. memcpy it into the destination buffer3. munmap the 4KB chunk4. repeat until eofThis is different from the claim in the article -- the above monstrosity is individually mmaping each 4KB block, while I presume the article&#39;s benchmark is mmaping the entire file in memory at once, which makes much more sense.After I claimed the &#34;monstrosity&#34; was absurdly stupid, someone pointed to a benchmark they made and found that the &#34;monstrosity&#34; version was actually faster. To me, this made  no sense. The monstrosity has triple the syscall overhead vs the read() version, requires manipulating page tables for every 4KB block and as a consequence had several page faults for each 4KB block of the file. Yet it was true: their benchmarks showed the monstrosity version to be slightly faster.The idealist in me couldn&#39;t stand this and I reverted this change, using for my own (unrelated) experiments a binary which used the older, classic, read() loop instead of mmap.Eventually I noticed I was getting results much faster using my build on my single-socket Xeon than they were getting on their $$$ server farms. Despite what the benchmark said.Turns out, the &#34;monstrosity&#34; was indeed faster, but if you had several of these binaries running concurrently on the same machine, they would all slow down each other, as if the kernel was having scale issues with multiple processes constantly changing their page tables. The thing would slow down to single-core levels of performance.I still have no idea why the benchmark was apparently slightly faster, but obviously they were checking it either isolated or on machines where the other processes where running read() loops. I guess that by wasting more kernel CPU time on yourself you may starve other processes in the system leaving more user time for yourself. But once every process does it, the net result is still significantly lowered performance for everyone.Just yet another anecdote for the experience bag..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not sure the conclusion that vector instructions are responsible for the speed-up is correct. Both implementations seem to use ERMS (using REP MOVSB instructions)[0]. Looking at the profiles, the syscall implementation spends time in the [xfs] driver (even in the long test), while the mmap implementation does not. It appears the real speed-up is related to how memory-mapped pages interact with the buffer cache.I might be misunderstanding things. What is really going on here?[0] Lines 56 and 180 here: http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=sysdeps/x86_..."</p>

As a person of logic and reason and based on multiple sources of information that I consider reputable, I strongly believe this did not take place, and I would need multiple, reputable sources of information and likely trusted peer acceptance before I would change my mind to believe it did.My way of trying to only accept what I believe to be accurate information will always be imperfect, and, at times, fail me. But I believe it is only shades different from what someone who believes in election fraud does. Their sources include the content of speeches made by the President of the United States, news anchors and journalists of conversatively-biased news, and perhaps most importantly, peers they trust liking and sharing those same speeches and articles with them as a stamp of acceptance.That&#39;s a complex and very human problem that is not readily solved with gut reactions, broad strokes and absolutes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is not an original idea/thought that I have, but feel repeating it is vital:This whole censorship crusade that the Facebook, twitter &amp; now reddit is on is a dangerous precedence we are setting for our society. Whatever they call it, this is censorship.Already due to AI suggesting similar contents on services like Facebook &amp; Youtube and the design of sub-reddits on reddit, we have living inside echo chambers. Atleast users have an option of searching for different contents on the platform. It&#39;s a bit easier to come out of the echo chamber. Now, by pushing people off the platform, echo chamber platforms are coming up like parler &amp; rumble. The divide is widening.I am not sure what other options are there, but censorship is the worst option."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sadly, note that the study talked about here [1] is investigating the effect of the N501Y mutation, not the more worrying E484K mutation found in the South African 501.v2 strain that likely does escape antibody drugs and reduces neutralization by convalescent sera from past infections.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The bigger question I have is when will we be ready to confidently claim that the vaccine doesn’t just prevent symptoms but also prevents spread? (Edit: at the same or nearly the same 95% rate)I can’t see a human trial being able to show this, and contact tracing is overall so poor how long will we have to wait to not see a case that can be tracked back to a vaccinated individual before we are willing to agree that the vaccine is highly effective at stopping transmission?For example, by Feb 1 we will have millions of people who are effectively protected at least from symptoms due to vaccine. So e.g. by March 1, if we have no, or single digit, reported cases of 2-week post-jab transmission?The corollary is how durable is the effect?To fully reopen the economy you need some kind of consensus on where the truth lies to these two questions.I wonder if public health agencies will never really admit, but just the case count will start to dwindle and mitigations will start to lessen, without ever really coming out and admitting vaccinated people don’t need mitigations 2-weeks-post-jab.Similar to how we’ve never really admitted that people who’ve had COVID are immune and can no longer spread it.I think fundamentally gov’t is too afraid of having two classes of citizens, and mainly, that one class (the antibody negative class) lying that they are actually the other."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What worries me is that there doesn&#39;t seem to be some global coordination in the distribution of the vaccines. It looks more like an individual race, than a synchronized collective effort.In the scenario where only the old accept to get vaccinated, and the vaccine doesn&#39;t reach the required threshold to stomp the virus. The virus become manageable, the economy reopen but the virus run rampant in the asymptotic population slowly mutating over-time until it finds a variant that is resistant to the vaccine by successfully infecting a vaccinated person.And it just needs for this to happen in a large population cluster where the vaccination doesn&#39;t reach the threshold, either because they do not have access to the vaccine yet or because some fraction of the population decide to  not get vaccinated, for everyone to get screwed-up again.Then we get a new vaccine every year."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Okay. I was at Amazon too in that time frame, and I don&#39;t recall the Sun to Linux transition to be all that big a deal.Amazon was always at that time facing challenges on every front, the dot-com bubble breaking etc. There was a large build out of distribution centres around this time  that was very expensive.This was just one more of the challenges they faced. I may not have been senior enough to be privy to all the details, but I don&#39;t think this particular migration brought the company to near bankruptcy. That&#39;s a stretch.I think the big migration was the database, and it took time, and Oracle was having some difficulties with running on Linux. But we were already using Linux boxes on our desktops since 1999. Webservers had switched to Linux around 1999. And migrating core code base which mostly C/C++ with Java starting to appear to Linux was mostly a challenge for the infrastructure teams and one of those routine large projects that every company has. I don&#39;t recall anybody talking of bankruptcy for this reason."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From replies to that thread, it looks like there are multiple errors.One reply is from one of the original engineers working on EC2 that said this swapover had nothing to do with AWS and it&#39;s origins, and another reply is from a former distinguished engineer stating that they swapped from compaq/digital tru64 alpha servers, not sun."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"No doubt Solaris on SPARC was more reliable (particularly on higher-performance boxes) than Linux on x86 at the time, but tons of decent-sized hosting-type companies were running on Linux in the late 90s, and I worked at one. Obviously at Amazon&#39;s scale this was a massive migration, and giving up the support of Sun would be hard, but, hell, Google was launched on Linux at the time too.That said, I was supporting Sparc Solaris through the late 2000s and the Oracle workloads were the last thing to move to Linux most places. The sheer power of the Sun boxes, along with the single-throat-to-choke was fairly unbeatable. No hardware vendor to look down their nose at you for using a &#34;hobbyist&#34; OS and imply that the problem must be at the Operating System level.And, of course, you couldn&#39;t really replace those huge Sun Fire 6800 type servers with Linux."</p>

&gt; No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.Wouldn&#39;t repealing Section 230 mean more censorship and restrictions as the liability would be too great to be on the hook for what some random account might decide to publish, no?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dismissive article that misrepresents both why &#34;normal&#34; people out there are unhappy about section 230 and what the higher levels of conversation about changing it really look like right now[1]. Articles like this are read meat for Hacker News. You endlessly reassert your political bias while pretending you are &#34;informing&#34; some imaginary group of stupid people (who in reality isn&#39;t even here to be &#34;informed&#34;).[1] Here is a recent discussion about 320 from a few lawyers and an YouTuber who used to work for the mainstream media:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a5H1A65wOMAs you will see if you watch the video, it is much more nuanced than the aggregate straw-man set up by the article....The crux of the issue is that Section 320 was drafted with a lot of assumptions in mind. At the time the Web was a fledgling thing. At the time Section 230&#39;s practical effect was to empower emerging platforms to do some common-sense moderation without fear of being held liable for all content they distributed.Does the law still has this effect? Yes, it does. But that is no longer the primary effect in terms of how this law affect most of the people out there. Today its primary effect is to give an impenetrable legal shield to giant tech corporations that engage in deliberate society-wide manipulation of information. That is what most people out there are unhappy about, even if they don&#39;t quite know how to phrase it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I started reading this in the smug knowledge that I knew it already, that I wasn&#39;t wrong about 230.But then I saw this passage:&gt; The &#34;user&#34; protections get less attention, but they&#39;re right there in the important 26 words. &#34;No provider or __user__ of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker....&#34; That&#39;s why there are cases like Barrett v. Rosenthal where someone who forwarded an email to a mailing list was held to be protected by Section 230, as a user of an interactive computer service who did not write the underlying material that was forwarded.I didn&#39;t know that! I guess I was wrong about Section 230 :)"</p>

The most basic procedures for classified information require that it be stored behind locked metal cages, in bank-style vaults, with encrypted hard drives, accessed via SMART cards, and transferred via an armed escort. When I left for Afghanistan there was one person carrying Top Secret information and the case it was carried in was handcuffed to him, not only was he armed but he had an armed escort as well.The notion or idea that some Congressperson has Classified+ information sitting behind a wood or glass door sounds highly suspicious.Edit: changed &#34;fake news&#34; to &#34;misinformation&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great practical information. Nice to see people who know what they are talking about putting data out there. I hope eventually these persistent HN memes about M1 memory will die: that it&#39;s &#34;on-die&#34; (it&#39;s not), that it&#39;s the only CPU using LPDDR4X-4267 (it&#39;s not), or that it&#39;s faster because the memory is 2mm closer to the CPU (not that either).It&#39;s faster because it has more microarchitectural resources. It can load and store more, and it can do with a single core what an Intel part needs all cores to accomplish."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t find any info about the memory bus of apple m1. Is it 8 channels 16 bit each? That&#39;s drastically different from AMDs 2 channels 64 bit each.It looks like apple m1 is much less eager when caching memory rows. Maybe because it doesn&#39;t have l3 cache.Edit: This test utilizes the 8x16bit memory bus of apple m1 fully. It&#39;s mostly just fetching random locations from memory, which can all be parallelized by the cpu pipeline. It explains why the results are exactly 4x slower on my ryzen 3 with 2 memory channels.So the summary is that m1 is optimized for dynamic languages that tend to do a DDOS attack on RAM with a lot of random memory access, but it might take a performance hit with compiled languages and traditional HPC techniques that tend to process data in sequence like ECS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is the article saying that the M1 is slower than we would have expected in this case?My understanding, based on the article, is that  a normal processor, we would have expected 
    arr[idx] + arr[idx+1]
and
    arr[idx]
to take the same amount of time.But the M1 is so parallelized that it goes to grab both arr[idx] and arr[idx+1] separately.  So we have to wait for both of those two return. Meanwhile, on a less parallelized processor, we would have done arr[idx] first and waited for it to return, and the processor would realize that it already had arr[idx+1] without having to do the second fetch.Am I understanding this right?"</p>

For example, I have a hard time imagining why they chose to specifically quote &#34;American Patriots&#34;, as if that somehow contributes to the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back. Perhaps they have a strategic reason for going about this how they did, but I think it will have some negative 2nd/3rd order effects. that they haven&#39;t yet realized.I imagine we are still only in the early days of the conflicts that are to come in this sphere (and I&#39;d include just about every company and political faction in them, unfortunately).(Also because apparently I have to state this explicitly in every comment related to Trump: I do not support Trump, his supporters, the recent events that occurred at the capitol, etc etc)"</p>

You should counter bad arguments with better arguments.b) There are types of speech, which are proven to lead to violence in the long-run. Also, some things can be proven as untrue. Lies are bad.I have to say, I agree with both of those points. I think group A is missing the point, that there are echo chambers and people radicalizing within their filter-bubbles up to the point of literal terrorism, while group B is missing that the power to censor can be misused by bad actors in the future and  that silenced people will not just change their mind.Is there a proper answer for someone like me?

I am leaning towards group A, while acknowledging that radicalization does happen and dearly worrying about perversion of words like &#34;truth&#34; or &#34;fact&#34; (&#34;your/my truth&#34;, &#34;alternate facts&#34;)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have been using Signal for two years now and I love it.However I really, really hope they can work on a good backup and restore process as losing my message history because I have to reinstall the app on my desktop[1] or have to reset my phone is a horrible experience.Just build an encrypted blob and zip it up and pop it on my iCloud or Google Drive or leave it local and let me deal with it but I need something. As my Signal use moves from just messages with friends and family to business contacts I need a reliable way to backup my messages![1] I should state I mean losing the desktop copy as it starts &#34;fresh&#34; and does not import any messages from the phone.Edit: I should probably clarify I am talking about the iOS/macOS applications as these are what I use. iOS does have a migration feature but that doesn&#39;t help if your phone is lost/damaged. I need a proper backup and restore process as well as the ability to import messages from the phone to the desktop app."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The issue with Signal that annoys me most is the complete lack of any meaningful backup/export on iOS. I lost my entire chat history when I got a new phone because their bizarre &#34;proximity based&#34; solution failed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot has changed since 2014, and this might actually be possible now. It could be tough to do this right and figure out what to do with the edge cases like importing a WA conversation that overlaps with an existing Signal conversation, or handling things like quoted replies, but this could be a fun project if anyone here wants to take a shot at coding it up."</p>

The way to &#34;beat&#34; piracy is to consider it as a competitor, which it is. When I was a kid, everyone downloaded raw mp3s and now that number is a fraction of a fraction because there&#39;s 1) YouTube and 2) Spotify et al. You can listen to music all day with ads and not pay a cent, or you can pay a reasonable fee and get all the HQ music you can eat without ads. Publishers continue to screw content makers, but that&#39;s another conversation.Just trying to ban pirate sources is a wonderful dream for publishers for sure, but there&#39;s no way it can work. Scientific papers are just too easy to share, the need for them high, and the current pricing too insane for it to be otherwise."</p>

These were of the Beta-M type, built in the 80s, with an activity of 1295 TBq each. The lumberjacks were scavenging the forest for firewood, when they came across two metal cylinders melting snow within a one meter radius laying in the road. They picked up these objects to use as personal heaters, sleeping with their backs to them. All lumberjacks sought medical attention individually, and were treated for radiation injuries. One patient, DN-1, was seriously injured and required multiple skin grafts. After 893 days in the hospital, he was declared dead after a fever caused by complications and infections of a radiation ulcer on the subject&#39;s back.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I work at Gumroad, mentioned in this article.Sometimes, I read things by CEOs about how a company works on the inside and I wonder if it really looks like that, or if it is a view from the top that doesn&#39;t reflect what it&#39;s really like.This article, with its discussions of the upsides and downsides, is accurate to my experience and my understanding of other people&#39;s experiences. For many people, Gumroad wouldn&#39;t be a great place to work, but for those of us who want to work like this, it is exactly what we need. Very glad to be working at Gumroad and working in the ways the article describes.Edit: Following up with a few FAQs from posts in the thread:* Health Insurance: I&#39;m personally lucky enough to still be covered on my dad&#39;s health insurance until I turn 26, thanks to the ACA, though for supplementary (vision, dental) I make more than enough to afford proper health insurance on the open market. Everyone at Gumroad is paid very well and should be able to afford the same.* Regarding overtime, benefits, etc: we make very competitive rates as contractors. I sincerely appreciate your concern, though.* On the shift from full-time employees to contractors, the company declined and was rebuilt over a period of five years. I&#39;m a relatively recent addition, so I only know Gumroad as it is now, I cannot comment on how it was. All I can say is that it&#39;s not like Sahil went out and fired everyone and then the next day it was a bunch of contractors."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work for a large SaaS company with hundreds of engineers and a very healthy revenue. It&#39;s widely acknowledged that the company would continue to function exactly as it is now for a very long time if they fired 95% of the staff. Heck stability and uptime would probably improve due to fewer deployments/no new feature adds. So the graph with declining expenses and increasing revenue isn&#39;t at all surprising.The problem with this model is that you are coasting on the work done by your full time staff in the initial few years, whom you fired and replaced with part time contractors who get no benefits. Even putting the ethical issues with this aside, if a competitor takes interest in your space and has a large war chest, you&#39;d be powerless to compete with them. And when your tech is dated and current/new customers want innovation, your low-price contracting firms working a few hours per week certainly aren&#39;t going to be able to offer that.So while I&#39;m happy things are working in this case, no new company that starts with the environment you are describing is going to be successful."</p>

I&#39;d be more than happy to work a job for 80% salary for 4 days per week...So much so, I&#39;m about to launch a website listing remote software jobs with a 4 day work week:https://www.28hrworkweek.com/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Telegram is a great IM experience. The client is good, feature set is good, the stickers are amusing (if you&#39;re into that kind of thing), the feature set is complete and everything is polished. Telegram is, I think, going to be one of the easier sells if you&#39;re trying to convince non-technical users to switch from WhatsApp or FB Messenger.The privacy, security, and governance story is not great though. If you care about such things, I think Signal wins hands down. And the UX is fine, just not quite as good as Telegram in my view.(A third option not in your poll that might be worth evaluating is Wickr. I haven&#39;t used it personally, but I&#39;ve seen it come up in these sorts of discussions.)"</p>

We can not fix closedness.- Not everyone is using it: we can fix it. We can not fix privacy abuse from Facebook.- It&#39;s work to run/manage a server: find a hosting provider (cough https://communick.com cough)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I know Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit and all the rest don&#39;t count as broadcast media but I feel like we got here in part because the 1987 elimination of FCC&#39;s fairness doctrine slowly allowed a shift in how we communicate with each other.We went from specious claims and conspiracy theories being the subject matter of newsletters to their public broadcast to millions via talk radio ~and Fox News~, thus allowing people to descend into their own bubbles without ever having their views challenged.  Now people seem to rely on social media to give them the same experience.  When challenged too much people just pull up stakes to insulate themselves: voat, parler, and private facebook groups are only three recent examples.It&#39;ll be interesting to see if whoever replaces Ajit Pai holds a different view on public intercourse over the airwaves.Edit: Well as some people have pointed out, Fox News would have been exempt from the Fairness Doctrine as a cable network, i.e. it doesn&#39;t use the public spectrum.As Wikipedia says &#34;The channel was created by Australian-American media mogul Rupert Murdoch to appeal to a conservative audience, hiring former Republican media consultant and CNBC executive Roger Ailes as its founding CEO.&#34;  So my personal view that Fox (among others) is responsible for a) exposing millions to fact-free content without opposing views and b) people got used to that and don&#39;t like it when it&#39;s challenged created the bubble we have today. I&#39;m wrong that the Fairness Doctrine would have prevented Fox, although it might have prevented talk radio."</p>

Never before in human history have we had privately operated for-profit organisations with so much power and influence over the running of countries. Social media platforms should never have been allowed to become the arbiters of democracy."</p>

I know your hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us, it was a landslide election and everyone knows it especially the other side. But you have to go home now. We have to have peace. We have to have law and order we have to respect our great people in law and order. We don&#39;t want anybody hurt. It&#39;s a very tough period of time, there has never been a time like this where such a thing happened, where they could take it away from all of us, from me, from you, from our country. This was a fraudulent election but we can&#39;t play into the hands of these people. We have to have peace. So go home, we love you, you&#39;re very special, you&#39;ve seen what happens you&#39;ve seen the way others are treated that are so bad and so evil. I know how you feel. But go home and go home in peace.&#34;I was watching a live stream from the mob and the protesters (the buffalo costume guy, in fact) were trying to get other protesters to leave on the basis of trumps message and people were believing the claim was fake because twitter restricted sharing so the only way to see it was to directly go to the page.Seems like an odd choice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Cities Skylines is very nice for such traffic simulations.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yITr127KZtQ (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17182008) (https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/7h6zr0/traf...)https://www.youtube.com/c/BiffaPlaysIndie/search?query=lane+...This is frequently posted here on HN.
E.g. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25632642."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Things like this are cool. What I would be curious to see though, rather than setting global parameters (i.e., politeness), would be to have each agent have its own politeness score (as well as other attributes). Models like the one linked to here work as if each agent is a particle, rather than autonomous decision-maker adapting to their circumstances locked in long-term, iterated games with other anonymous drivers.This way, agents would adapt their attributes to maximize their own local advantage, and therefore could see how large scale trends develop. I&#39;ve driven in many countries and regions within countries, and it&#39;s just wild how &#34;driving cultures&#34; vary so much. Some places the drivers are so polite to the point it really makes things dangerous, other places the drivers are vindictive (distinct from being aggressive driver). It would be interesting to model how driving cultures emerge.Edit: I guess the short story is I&#39;m really curious why some places, like Bangkok driving is chaotic, dangerous, gridlocked, and no one adheres to traffic laws much or yields to pedestrians, but relatively devoid of road rage (and people will let you merge over if you need to). In DC, people carefully adhere to red lights, stop signs, pedestrians, etc but will go far, far out of their way to block you from changing lanes once they see your turn signal go on.Also, exploring the game theoretic (probably prisoner&#39;s dilemma?) aspects of tailgating and how that seriously depends on the driving culture. When someone tailgates, the tailgatee can slow down (everyone loses), speed up or move out of the way (tailgater wins/tailgatee loses), etc. If everyone slowed down when tailgated, there would be no benefit of tailgating; if enough people give in when tailgated, that keeps rewarding the behavior. Anyway, that would be something fun to explore in one of these traffic simulations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love these little simulators because while they purport to show that slower more polite driving is more efficient, more often than not they show the exact opposite.  Want to shove the most cars through per hour?  Remove the speed limit.  Accelerate and brake like every intersection is a drag race.  Leave absolutely no distance between cars.  And dump any notion of polite lane changes.  NASCAR was right:  Minimize unused pavement.  The most efficient way to move large numbers of cars down a road is at 200mph with only inches between each car."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Some speculate it might descend from PowerVR GPUs, as used in older iPhones, while others believe the GPU to be completely custom. But rumours and speculations are no fun when we can peek under the hood ourselves!As per IMG CEO, Apple has never not been an IMG customer. ( Referring to period between 2015 and 2019.) Unfortunately that quote, along with that article has simply vanished. It was said during an Interview on a British newspaper / web site if I remember correctly.&#34;On 2 January 2020, Imagination Technologies announced a new multi-year license agreement with Apple including access to a wider range of Imagination&#39;s IP in exchange for license fees. This deal replaced the prior deal signed on 6 February 2014.&#34; [1]The Apple official Metal Feature set document [2], All Apple A Series SoC including the latest A14 supports PVRTC, which stands for PowerVR Texture Compression[3].It could be a Custom GPU, but it still has plenty of PowerVR tech in it. Just like Apple Custom CPU, it is still an ARM.Note: I am still bitter at what Apple has done to IMG / PowerVR.[1] https://www.imaginationtech.com/news/press-release/imaginati...[2] https://developer.apple.com/metal/Metal-Feature-Set-Tables.p...[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PVRTC"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This suggests the hardware is superscalar, with more 16-bit ALUs than 32-bit ALUsTo me, it sounds like it might mean 32-bit ALUs can be used as two 16-bit ones; that&#39;s how I would approach it, unless I&#39;m missing something? The vectorization can also happen at the superscalar level, if borrowing the instruction queue concept from out-of-order designs: buffer operations for a while until you&#39;ve filled a vector unit&#39;s worth, align input data in the pipeline, execute. A smart compiler could rearrange opcodes to avoid dependency issues, and insert &#34;flushes&#34; or filling operations at the right time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Yet Metal optimization resources imply 16-bit arithmetic should be significantly faster, in addition to a reduction of register usage leading to higher thread count (occupancy).I believe this is a difference between the A14 GPU and the M1 GPU; the former&#39;s 32 bit throughput is half its 16 bit throughput, whereas on the latter they are equal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are two interesting things in this post.The first is that a senior developer at Facebook believes every single senior developer looking for a role at Facebook can revise the same things. Clearly the author believes that Facebook are looking for programmers who fit a very specific mould, to the point that they&#39;re willing to go out in public and state exactly that. I&#39;d argue that points to a massive monoculture problem at Facebook, but I&#39;m massively anti-Facebook so I&#39;m biased.Secondly, the author believes that senior developers, who likely have 10+ years under their belt if they&#39;re senior, need to spend a solid month revising in order to be successful landing a role there. Maybe that&#39;s worthwhile as FB pay well, but that&#39;s a hell of a time investment if you&#39;re not planning to stay at FB for a long time. That would certainly make me think twice if I was going to apply."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every time I read these posts I find them very depressing. Crunch through an enormous  bunch of algorithm problems in order to perform well on some unrealistic whiteboard programming (I think the system engineering problems are actually more useful though) - as usual we&#39;ve focused on the easy to measure metric rather than anything actually useful. Maybe these things are meant to be a proxy for how good you are at other development tasks, but it has never seemed to work out that way to me. Some of the very successful people I know at FAANG companies have told me that they would not pass the algorithm interviews without months of preparation and that they don&#39;t really use those skills."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Besides the usual advice, this observation is very interesting:&gt; Applying for senior engineering positions (&gt;E4) in FANG companies is one of the best ways to get into them.This comment by a veteran senior engineer confirms to me that Facebook, just like most other FANGs, does a poor job of promoting from within.There are multiple comments to the same effect from many other FANG employees: It&#39;s much easier to get recruited for senior roles from the outside, then get promoted from the inside.The result of this failure is that job-hopping is the most valid career strategy for aspiring seniors."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a Simple customer and incredibly upset by this decision.  For those not familiar with their value add, Simple is essentially &#34;envelope budgeting&#34; built into a banking application.  Sure, it&#39;s a bank and does bank things.  What sets Simple apart is that I can allocate $n/month for an expense and it takes it out of my paycheck and puts it into that expense &#34;envelope&#34;.  When a charge comes in for that expense, it pulls from the envelope.  Other budgeting tools like mvelopes.com and YNAB are great for visibility/tracking, but they don&#39;t move your money around.  The alternative I used prior to finding Simple was having about 10 different checking accounts and manually transferring money every few weeks.  I really don&#39;t want to go back to that setup after tasting the good life.My pitch to the Simple team, or anyone interested in taking this on, is to take the app and build it on top of Stripe Treasury (https://stripe.com/treasury)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know how many Simple employees are in this thread. I&#39;m very sad to hear this news, and I&#39;m sure you were too. Just want you to know that you all made a really meaningful difference in the lives of at least my wife and I. Before I switched to Simple, I had a really hard time budgeting for things/planning for expenses, and was frequently toeing the line of overdrawing my account. I was essentially financially illiterate.Simple made it incredibly easy for me to get my shit together and start being proactive with my money, so there was really no excuse to not do so. Now, my wife and I are well on our way to an early payoff on our mortgage (~18 years early), paying off our vehicle loans early (~2 years early), having a pretty good safety net in the bank, and being otherwise debt free.So if you haven&#39;t heard it above the sadness of losing Simple: thank you. Seriously, thank you. You really did something great and you should all be proud of what you&#39;ve accomplished."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I loved Simple for a long time -- I was one of the &#34;beta&#34; customers -- but I switched away from them over a year ago. I&#39;d already been annoyed with them over something seemingly trivial; I go by my middle name and last name, not first and last, and want my credit/debit card to match that, reading &#34;Middle Last&#34;. Everyone else allows me to do this and Simple did allow that... until we all had to migrate our accounts from Simple&#39;s original &#34;banking partner&#34; to BBVA. At that point they changed my name and refused to change it back after multiple go-rounds (which ended with a rep telling me &#34;sure, we can do this, just fill this out,&#34; filling said thing out, and being told &#34;we can&#39;t do that&#34;).As with some other mentions here, though, it was killing the ability to have Simple send checks to payees that did it for me. I&#39;d been waiting for years to have Simple be able to accept ebills (e.g., receive a bill from a creditor that specifies an amount to pay and paying that, rather than just paying a fixed amount every period), and they never did; instead they regressed.But here&#39;s the thing: while I&#39;d left Bank of America because Simple&#39;s app and design was so much better, I&#39;d never closed my BoA account for the simple (ha!) reason that they could accept ebills and pay them out of my Simple account. This always left me with the niggling feeling that while Simple was better at technology and customer service, BoA was better at... well... banking. And when I checked out BoA after getting fed up with Simple, well, their app was still ugly and had bad UX design, but the functionality had mostly caught up with Simple. It even has goals built into it, if I want them. (I don&#39;t, and never cared about Simple&#39;s equivalent, so I can&#39;t compare the functionality.)And while there are &#34;bank things&#34; I only do once in a blue moon -- deposit at an ATM, get a cashier&#39;s check -- it turns out it&#39;s nice to have a bank that, well, does those things. I know there are other banks (and credit unions) that do them, too, and I&#39;m not suggesting BoA is particularly good (or bad) in this regard.Simple was a promising idea, but I think they made a serious mistake by letting themselves be bought out by BBVA. And while I&#39;d love to see someone else try again, I&#39;m going to be a lot more reticent to move to a new bank just because it gives me a terrific mobile app experience next time around. Simple was a great technology company, but at the end of the day, I just don&#39;t think they were that great a bank."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Back when I worked at Marvell Semiconductor (circa 2005), we made laser printer ASICs for HP. We did a lot of dithering in hardware. We had a hardware block that did error diffusion, we had a hardware block that did regular diffusion. We also had a hardware block that did Blue Noise. I was responsible for implementing the firmware that drove those printers&#39; scan/copy path: scan an image in monochrome, run through the dither hardware to create the bit pattern fed to the laser engine.No one could explain to me how to use the blue noise block. I couldn&#39;t understand what the blue noise block was doing. This is the first article that explained, in terms I could understand, how blue noise dithering works.I can die happy. Thank you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is such a well-written article: it describes the impetus, it is researched, it has great examples both as code and as output, and it piques interest. In the late 1990&#39;s I contracted with an embedded software company to optimize a dithering algorithm for 8-bit MCUs that was used in most laser printers &amp; copiers, and this paper is a really good overview."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; According to Wikipedia, “Dither is an intentionally applied form of noise used to randomize quantization error”, and is a technique not only limited to images. It is actually a technique used to this day on audio recordings […]Dithering as a digital signal processing technique is also used frequently in the digital control of physical systems. One example of this is in the control of hydraulic servo valves[1]; these valves are usually pretty small and their performance can be dominated by a lot of external factors. One of the biggest ones is &#34;stiction&#34;, or static friction, wherein if the moving parts of the valve are at rest it can take a large amount of current to get them going again which translates in to poor control of the valve and in turn poor control of the thing the valve is trying to move. It&#39;s common to use very high frequency/small amplitude dithering on these valves to eliminate the effects of stiction without compromising accuracy which greatly improves the control stability and responsiveness of the servo valves.1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrohydraulic_servo_valve"</p>

The examples shown are likely from a set of well-defined (read: lots of data, high bias) input classes for the model.

Another commenter here mentioned &#34;red square on green square&#34; working, but &#34;large cube on small cube&#34;, not working.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is simultaneously amazing and depressing, like watching someone set off a hydrogen bomb for the first time and marveling at the mushroom cloud it creates.I really find it hard to understand why people are optimistic about the impact AI will have on our future.The pace of improvement in AI has been really fast over the last two decades, and I don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s a good thing. Compare the best text generator models from 10 years ago with GPT-3. Now do the same for image generators. Now project these improvements 20 years into the future. The amount of investment this work is getting grows with every such breakthrough. It seems likely to me we will figure out general-purpose human-level AI in a few decades.And what then? There are so many ways this could turn into a dystopian future.Imagine for example huge mostly-ML operated drone armies, tens of millions strong, that only need a small number of humans to supervise them. Terrified yet? What happens to democracy when power doesn&#39;t need to flow through a large number of people? When a dozen people and a few million armed drones can oppress a hundred million people?If there&#39;s even a 5% chance of such an outcome (personally I think it&#39;s higher), then we should be taking it seriously."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow. This is amazing. Although I wish they documented how much compute and data was used to get these results.I absolutely believe we&#39;ll crack the fundamental principles of intelligence in our lifetimes. We now have capability to process all public data available on internet (of wikipedia is a huge chunk). We have so many cameras and microphones (one in each pocket).It&#39;s also scary to think if it goes wrong (the great filter for fermi paradox). However I&#39;m optimistic.The brain only uses 20 watts of power to do all its magic. The entire human body is built from 700MB of data in the DNA. The fundamental principles of intelligence is within reach if we look from that perspective.Right now GPT3 and DALL-E seem to be using an insane amount of computation to achieve what they are doing. My prediction is that in 2050, we&#39;ll have pretty good intelligence in our phones that has deep understanding (language and visual) of the world around us."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something that I find interesting is that career advice coming from professionals having many years of experience focuses almost exclusively on the people aspects and not the technology: communication, trust, teamwork, documentation, clarity. The advice is clear, precise and honest.This is the opposite of what you get from new hires/juniors: they tend to focus on which stacks matter, what to learn, how to develop, deploy and maintain. Not much real advice on the behavioral side, to the point that people often take trainings for behavioral interviews and memorize “leadership principles” and other nonsense."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"  3. Simplicity
  Fighting complexity is a never-ending cause. Solutions should 
  be as simple as possible. Assume the next person to 
  maintain your code won’t be as smart as you. When you can 
  use fewer technologies, do so.

This is the one I appreciate more and more as I age. Because frequently, I&#39;m the next person looking at my own code. And there&#39;s no better gift to your future self than well-written, easy-to-understand code that is straightforward to maintain."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is very wise:&#34;When I was at GM, you were a failure if your next move was not up—managing more people or taking on bigger, more complex projects. For many, this made for a miserable career path&#34;As I&#39;ve said before, I think this is a corrosive aspect of the perf/promo process at many FAANGs. The &#34;level&#34; system encourages/pushes people to &#34;upgrade&#34; in this manner, and I think contributes to a number of problems. For one, organizational incompetence when people who were valuable contributors where they were are elevated up into roles where they no longer can apply those skills as effectively (i.e. technical team lead to management or architect) leaving a vacuum below. A form of the Peter Principle I guess, except the individual may have competence in their new role but not be happy, or make the team itself less successful.And most importantly, as he touches on: being asked to &#39;level up&#39; and told that this is your mission can lead to an unpleasurable career. Either when you do get that promo and then find that you don&#39;t enjoy the new responsibilities (but become trapped by the position / upgraded compensation etc.) or when you don&#39;t get the promo (or don&#39;t try) and find that your value in the eyes of yourself and others seems less.And finally, I think this type of thing can really take hold in places with a highly academic background / focus / origin (like Google, etc.) as it mimics in many ways the grade / peer review achievement structure of academia. And that reward / grading structure may not at all correspond to either the monetary or cultural success of a corporation.Smaller companies looking to grow/formalize should exercise caution when looking at the rating/performance/promo process @ FAANGs / MS as a model for their own.(I&#39;m at 20-25ish years in the industry, but really feel junior in so many ways when I read the words of veterans like this.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Definitely beautiful and would love for something simple and clean to eat LinkedIn&#39;s lunch.I don&#39;t have much to add in addition to everyone else except this: I am really disturbed by the common meme of faces-inside-circles. Why do we need faces? It just distracts from the content. I love the idea of being able to link former colleagues together - that&#39;s neat - but I&#39;m very anti-face and  there are any number of ways to do it that does not involve people&#39;s pictures.Edit: Wow this got a lot of upvotes. So, I&#39;ll continue for a sec: There is so, so much conscious and unconscious judgment and game playing with pictures, I don&#39;t even know where to start. Let&#39;s leave this to be simple, clean and beautiful without the faces."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I started read.cv when transitioning from full time to freelance design in July. I wanted an easy to update &#39;about me&#39; page to link from my website and bio – something simpler than LinkedIn and more dynamic than a PDF.Design wise I focused on legibility and tried to give projects/side projects equal weight to things like education and work experience. A few unique features: tagging collaborators in your experiences, status updates, and print optimized profiles.It took me around three months (Sept to November) to get it out the door, and I&#39;ve been working on making improvements since. Open to any questions or feedback!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a good start, but I&#39;m not a huge fan of this the way it is now.First, the font is tiny for my old eyes.  Not all of us, especially hiring managers, are still in their 20s and can read these tiny fonts. I measured it with a ruler and the text is 1mm tall.  Also, the font is gray on white, which is pretty but hard to read. In contrast, Linkedin is three times bigger and black on white, much easier to read.Second, after looking at the example, I have almost no idea what you&#39;ve done.  All I see are job titles.  I don&#39;t see any accomplishments or even job duties.  It looks like I could add those things when I create my own profile, but having them missing on the example isn&#39;t a good look.Third, the face circles.  I see face circles under each job, but they aren&#39;t clickable nor are there tooltips.  I have no idea what those are.  I assume they&#39;re other people who worked at the same place?  Maybe connections of yours who have worked at the same place?  That&#39;s a cool idea, but it needs to be more discoverable.  At the very least a tooltip would be good.Overall, when I&#39;m looking at a professional profile, I&#39;m usually doing it because I want to hire or work with someone.  The main information I want to know is 1) Do we have anyone in common I can ask about you?  2) What did you accomplish at your previous workplaces or otherwise?  3) Have you worked anywhere that I recognize and when, so I can ask my other friends who worked there if they know you?The face circles accomplish #1, so that&#39;s great.  #2 looks possible, but the design seems to minimize the accomplishments, as opposed to Linkedin which sort of puts it in your face.  And #3 seems to be covered but again the design minimizes the information I want most.I would say a good place to start would be asking yourself, &#34;Why does Linkedin look the way it does?&#34;.  A lot of their design comes from customer feedback, and their main customers are recruiters and hiring managers.  Steal their good stuff and leave their dark patterns behind."</p>

I use waste in the sense of like trying to assemble something complicated with the instructions just out of arms reach, not in the sense of doing something pointless.In some cases all companies would have to do is not actively hide or obfuscate things. In others it may take more effort but still just a drop in the huge bucket compared to developing a system in the first place.I love Apple&#39;s hardware, I even (mostly) love the OS. If they too believe that it is solid - why prevent people from running what they want? The majority will come back anyway - I&#39;ve run Linux for years and still ended up on MacOS for simplicity. I&#39;ll still buy Macs and run MacOS because it works for me, it&#39;s not like letting me run Linux will cost them money or something. The vast majority of people don&#39;t  know what Linux even is, there is no threat there.Please note that this comment is not directed at people who choose to spend their time on projects like this.

After the street cred of getting a marginally usable OS up and running evaporates, why continue to take the effort of great engineers and waste it developing an ecosystem that doesn&#39;t care?

Not only do you have less resources to learn and grow, you have a massive handicap to find good work as most work is outside of the country.Only bet is to leave the country but even there you have a very low probability as you basically can&#39;t have a trial period for your job as most companies don&#39;t want to risk having their accounts blocked.Most of us here know how degrading and infuriating the tech recruiting processes can be and now add to it the horrors of working from Iran.Wars are not supposed to have civilian casualties but this one has a generation of civilians being starved of information and experience critical for them to grow."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25620256">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a concern about REPL driven development, which is around how maintainable the result is.The reason people like REPLs is because they can experiment to discover the right way to write the code in a very fast feedback loop. This alleviates a huge pain when you are operating with uncertainties or at the edge of your knowledge - &#39;does this function return null if no matching entries or an empty list?&#39; - etc.The problem is that the reader of your code is not going on that journey with you. They are coming in naively without knowing all of that experimentation you did. The writer now has the opportunity to create code that &#34;just happens&#34; to work by a magic of coincidences and conveniences based on very subtle non-obvious properties of the APIs and systems they are working with. The reader is severely disadvantaged and will have a much harder time to reach parity with the state of knowledge that the writer had. For example, some property of a function or object may not be documented at all, but through the REPL the writer has ascertained it is true. How can the reader know this?So its a double edged sword in that the more you empower the original creator of the code, the greater imbalance you create to the later readers and maintainers of the code. Used well and with great discipline I could see it being very powerful and positive force to make better code. But in the worst case scenario, you&#39;ll end up with extremely unmaintainable code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having used Clojure and Common Lisp professionally, I think advocates for REPL driven programming universally overstate the utility of a first rate REPL.Yes, it’s nicer than Python’s. Yes, it’s convenient. No, I never ended up doing my development in the REPL first. Why? Because editing mistakes in a REPL usually sucks, because a REPL is not a text editor.What I ended up using heavily was REPL to file integration, which gave me the ability to write a function normally, evaluate it in the attached REPL session, and then play around with it in the REPL. This is far short of the “REPL driven development” that’s commonly discussed, and frankly something that’s probably possible with the Python REPL if they wanted to.Editing data and functions in the REPL is a neat trick, but it’s a double edged sword, because a REPL can crash, and it provides incredibly rudimentary support for diffing current state and migrating changes back to permanent files. I would never start with anything more than a trivial “how do I manipulate this list” in the REPL for that reason. Oh, and we had a lot of issues with REPLs getting into a bad state with Clojure due to multi methods and protocols; if you’re doing your primary work in the REPL, then having to restart it due to it becoming unstable really sucks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"He&#39;s right to emphasize the properties of the systems that support interactive development with a long-running image. In Common Lisp, the difference between defvar and defparameter is a simple example. Traditional Smalltalk systems only supported image-based development. But I always preferred the moderate approach exemplified by most Lisp systems where the source code isn&#39;t overly entangled with the image state.As a long-time but now lapsed Lisper, I never understood some people&#39;s elevation of the REPL. A command-line REPL is a poor man&#39;s development environment. If you&#39;re doing interactive development in Lisp, you&#39;ll be far more productive if you use a normal buffer with eval-defun, eval-buffer and friends. When debugging, you&#39;ll primarily want auto-updating watch expressions and object inspectors. And when you do have good use for a REPL, you&#39;ll still want it to exist within a proper buffer with persistent history, inline object inspection, etc, instead of the low-effort rlwrap terminal experience which usually passes for a REPL.All of this holds doubly true for Smalltalk environments."</p>

We had a live session via thunderbird but there were no channels of support. Luckily we were able to register her old mobile number to achieve a password reset, thanks to a helpful phone provider and NOT google.My mailserver is marked as spam by gmail, a helpful HN commentor pointed out it may be my lack of ipv6 which appears to be the cause. I have no idea why ipv6 would indicate that I’m not a spammer, I can’t ask google because they don’t have a support line.I understand others have far more expensive (read: &gt;1m$) problems with google specifically, and I know I’m not alone here.I just hope that by continually airing grievances with lack of (useful) customer service by major providers, they end up caving and investing in customer support.Until then, fuck you google."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Taking a look at your site, it seems quite clear where all your traffic went. You have a pretty great backlink profile compared to other affiliate sites ive seen but the content is incredibly thin. Based on this, me or anyone else who visits the site just sees an advertising site. There are no personal experiences with the products, the products are not related and the UX does not make the user want to continue exploring the page they landed on. The content here seems more like a statistics site for products than it is a reviews site.The other comments here mentioning cheap as a flag word are somewhat accurate but not entirely. Its possible to rank a site using the word cheap assuming you&#39;re supporting it correctly with related content about a specific product and proper explanation as to what makes it cheap.Honestly, I am very sorry that you lost all your traffic and your revenue but this seems like a VERY fixable problem considering your backlinks. Take your best performing posts, and dramatically increase the word count, add more photos, add overviews of each product instead of just a single line or two pulled from reviews.Happy to help with additional pointers if you want to shoot me a PM."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is one of several posts I&#39;ve seen on HN lately following a similar trend: sudden and unexpected drops in search engine traffic. On the one hand it must be jarring to suddenly have a drop in traffic. But is it necessarily indicative of a bad administration of a search engine?Popularity of sites shift. People&#39;s tastes change. Even without an algorithm change we would not expect search traffic to remain constant. And algorithm changes do shift attention to sites that previously weren&#39;t getting traffic. Would the world better with static search traffic? The incumbents always win, and newcomers have a tough time getting a foothold. That&#39;s what it would take to avoid situations like these, and I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s an improvement over the status quo. Between living in constant worry that the algorithm might change and shift search traffic, and a world where the algorithm never changes and search traffic remains rather static I&#39;m not sure which is really better. In the latter goodcheapandfast.com might never even have existed.Bing&#39;s blocking mechanism seems pretty crude, though, and not sharing why it was blocked seems particularly wonky. Sure it&#39;s a cat and mouse game between scammers and devs, but it&#39;d be nice if they at least vaguely alluded to why the false positive happened."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;[Line] fixed it by adding a random number to the user&#39;s destinationThis is a imperfect solution. There&#39;s two possibilities: the offset (aka &#34;random number&#34;) is dynamic, or it&#39;s fixed. If it&#39;s the former all you have to do is sample enough times to get through the noise. If it&#39;s the latter, it&#39;s not vulnerable to the previous attack, but if you have a known point of reference (so you can deduce what the offset is), then you can still stalk them (forever?). IMO the only way to do is &#34;properly&#34; is to quantize people into map cells, like how apple does it with their coarse location feature[1].[1] &#34;Apple doesn&#39;t reduce the accuracy of location fixes by adding noise.

There&#39;s another aspect around GitHub policy that asks if an entire organization be banned for the location of one team member.4. Finally, there&#39;s the aspect of relinquishing control. Your app development is on the cloud. IDEs are on the cloud. Deployments are on the cloud.

Not only do you have less resources to learn and grow, you have a massive handicap to find good work as most work is outside of the country.Only bet is to leave the country but even there you have a very low probability as you basically can&#39;t have a trial period for your job as most companies don&#39;t want to risk having their accounts blocked.Most of us here know how degrading and infuriating the tech recruiting processes can be and now add to it the horrors of working from Iran.Wars are not supposed to have civilian casualties but this one has a generation of civilians being starved of information and experience critical for them to grow."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some truly impressive results. I&#39;ll pick my usual point here when a fancy new (generative) model comes out, and I&#39;m sure some of the other commenters have alluded to this. The examples shown are likely from a set of well-defined (read: lots of data, high bias) input classes for the model. What would be really interesting is how the model generalizes to /object concepts/ that have yet to be seen, and which have abstract relationships to the examples it has seen. Another commenter here mentioned &#34;red square on green square&#34; working, but &#34;large cube on small cube&#34;, not working. Humans are able to infer and understand such abstract concepts with very few examples, and this is something AI isn&#39;t as close to as it might seem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is simultaneously amazing and depressing, like watching someone set off a hydrogen bomb for the first time and marveling at the mushroom cloud it creates.I really find it hard to understand why people are optimistic about the impact AI will have on our future.The pace of improvement in AI has been really fast over the last two decades, and I don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s a good thing. Compare the best text generator models from 10 years ago with GPT-3. Now do the same for image generators. Now project these improvements 20 years into the future. The amount of investment this work is getting grows with every such breakthrough. It seems likely to me we will figure out general-purpose human-level AI in a few decades.And what then? There are so many ways this could turn into a dystopian future.Imagine for example huge mostly-ML operated drone armies, tens of millions strong, that only need a small number of humans to supervise them. Terrified yet? What happens to democracy when power doesn&#39;t need to flow through a large number of people? When a dozen people and a few million armed drones can oppress a hundred million people?If there&#39;s even a 5% chance of such an outcome (personally I think it&#39;s higher), then we should be taking it seriously."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow. This is amazing. Although I wish they documented how much compute and data was used to get these results.I absolutely believe we&#39;ll crack the fundamental principles of intelligence in our lifetimes. We now have capability to process all public data available on internet (of wikipedia is a huge chunk). We have so many cameras and microphones (one in each pocket).It&#39;s also scary to think if it goes wrong (the great filter for fermi paradox). However I&#39;m optimistic.The brain only uses 20 watts of power to do all its magic. The entire human body is built from 700MB of data in the DNA. The fundamental principles of intelligence is within reach if we look from that perspective.Right now GPT3 and DALL-E seem to be using an insane amount of computation to achieve what they are doing. My prediction is that in 2050, we&#39;ll have pretty good intelligence in our phones that has deep understanding (language and visual) of the world around us."</p>

I use waste in the sense of like trying to assemble something complicated with the instructions just out of arms reach, not in the sense of doing something pointless.In some cases all companies would have to do is not actively hide or obfuscate things. In others it may take more effort but still just a drop in the huge bucket compared to developing a system in the first place.I love Apple&#39;s hardware, I even (mostly) love the OS. If they too believe that it is solid - why prevent people from running what they want? The majority will come back anyway - I&#39;ve run Linux for years and still ended up on MacOS for simplicity. I&#39;ll still buy Macs and run MacOS because it works for me, it&#39;s not like letting me run Linux will cost them money or something.

After the street cred of getting a marginally usable OS up and running evaporates, why continue to take the effort of great engineers and waste it developing an ecosystem that doesn&#39;t care?

This would keep the rest of the UI snappy.  It could also tint those portions of the UI so users can see which app is the culprit of UI slowness.I hope that Rust can someday be used as the basis of an OS that does not rely on sandboxing for security, but instead uses the compiler to enforce security.  Such an OS could use cooperative multitasking and use a lot less energy and less expensive hardware than our current multi-core CPU + MMU + kernel ring model."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Welcome to Project Lightspeed. This is a project that allows anyone to easily deploy their own sub-second latency live-streaming server. In its current state you can stream from OBS [1] and watch that stream back from any desktop browser.This has been a super fun project which has taught me more than any other project I have done. It uses Rust, Go and React and can be deployed fairly easily on a very lightweight server. For example, I have been doing my test streams on a $5 Digital Ocean droplet and the CPU usage is at around 20%. Granted not a lot of people are watching however it is more lightweight than a solution such as Janus.The point of this project is twofold. First I wanted to learn more about WebRTC and real-time communication in general. Second, I wanted to provide a platform where people can setup their own little live-stream environment. Maybe you just want a place where you and some friends can hang out or you are sick of the main-stream platforms.Anyhow as of writing this post it is v0.1.0 and considered an MVP release. In the coming months I (and hopefully some of you :)) will be adding more features and trying to flesh this out into as much of a full featured platform as possible. Feel free to take a look at the repo and let me know what you all think :)[1] Open Broadcast Software (OBS): https://obsproject.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"About the choice of license (MIT): could you share your considerations about it? (if any)It&#39;s a topic I&#39;m interested in. Mainly to see examples (and learn from them) about when people prefer lax licenses on the style of &#34;do what you want with this, including a closed-source proprietary business&#34; (MIT, Apache) which has allowed in the past that big Co&#39;s. benefit from it without giving back (lots of cases in HN), vs. strong copyleft &#34;do what you want except closed-source proprietary stuff&#34; style (generally speaking, the GPL family -- EDIT: I know that this, being mainly a server-side thing, would be more affected by AGPL than by GPL. Bear with me.).If there are no business / commercialization intentions in the foreseeable future, would it make sense to use a GPL license (one of them) to build a strong open-source community?Or it doesn&#39;t matter in practice? (i.e. it doesn&#39;t really affect the chances of building a good and strong developer community)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is awesome! I wanted to make something like this too after Mixer shut down and I didn&#39;t have good options anymore to stream low latency gameplay to friends. But I was too lazy to do it properly.I ended up with this hack: https://i.imgur.com/jDeMxly.pngRedirect the &#34;Record&#34; button of obs to make ffmpeg output to an http endpoint, which is a small server that just forwards any bytes it receives to connected consumers. They can then play it back with    ffplay -fflags nobuffer -flags low_delay -framedrop -strict experimental https://stream.server/lawl

I&#39;ve found that most of the latency is actually coming from the player. I.e. VLC has way more latency, even if you tell it to not buffer. TCP is a bit of an issue since ffplay doesn&#39;t speed up playback when it falls behind, but it mostly works and you can just restart ffplay if you fall behind too far. When it works (good network conditions) it also achieves sub second latency.Will definitely have to give this a try over my hack."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reading the judgement the key points are on pages 116 onwards and the extradition is denied under section 91(3) of the EA 2003 which reads:&gt; The condition is that the physical or mental condition of the person is such that it would be unjust or oppressive to extradite him.The judge states:&gt; it is my judgment that there is a real risk that he will  be kept in the near isolated conditions imposed by the  harshest SAMs (special administrative measures) regime, both pre-trial and post-trialAnd goes on to contrast with the conditions at HMP Belmarsh:&gt; many of the protective factors currently in place at HMP Belmarsh would be removed by these conditions. Mr. Assange’s health improved on being removed from relative isolation in healthcare. He has been able to access the support of family and friends. He has had access to a Samaritans phone line. He has benefited from a trusting relationship with the prison In-Reach psychologist. By contrast, a SAMs regime would severely restrict his contact with all other human beings, including other prisoners, staff and his family. In detention subject to SAMs, he would have absolutely no communication with other prisoners, even through the walls of his cell, and time out of his cell would be spent alone.These conditions sound barbaric to me and I&#39;d go as far to describe them as torture. Amnesty International do a better job of outlining the problems with this regime than I can: https://www.amnestyusa.org/reports/entombed-isolation-in-the...Frankly I don&#39;t understand why the UK continues to maintain an extradition treaty with a country which clearly has a poor record on human rights and fails to maintain a justice system that meets the UN&#39;s Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners.She concludes:&gt; I am satisfied that, in these harsh conditions, Mr. Assange’s mental health would deteriorate causing him to commit suicide with the “single minded determination” of his autism spectrum disorder.&gt; I order the discharge  of Julian Paul Assange, pursuant  to section 91(3) of the EA 2003Whilst a victory nonetheless for Assange, it is unfortunate that the entire judgement seems to come down to this point alone. Let&#39;s hope it is not overturned."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If there&#39;s anything to learn from Assange and Snowden:1. Our western &#34;liberal&#34; democracies stop being liberal when the government gets angry at you at a personal level.2. With enough propaganda, you can make people believe anything, even that Snowden is a &#34;traitor&#34; to the US.3. Politically vociferous people (the mob) don&#39;t give a shit about you unless you&#39;re instrumental to support the cause du jour"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually don&#39;t think this is such great news for him.Extradition was specifically blocked on the grounds of a particular regime he might be subjected to (to be fair, probably the only legal grounds on which he had any chance of succeeding). That leaves the US with a way out if they want to proceed with the extradition - guarantee a different set of circumstances.If the judge had found on more substantive grounds, those would have been much more resistant to that. For instance, all the claims based on language in the extradition treaty and other international agreements failed and they failed for pretty fundamental legal reasons. English courts only have regard for domestic law and it is for parliament to pass laws consistent with the treaties that have been signed, therefore claims based on treaty language won&#39;t work.That means that none of the claims on the political nature of his activities were upheld and those would have provided a much more robust and durable bar to extradition."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I talk to colleagues in tech about unions I hear a lot of misconceptions, seemingly based in stereotypes about what unions are for and who they serve. People often seem to think of unions as being purely blue-collar operations, and this just isn&#39;t true.For example, I&#39;ve had people tell me that they don&#39;t support unions in tech because they&#39;ll be &#34;paid less&#34;, or less competent engineers will be promoted faster.And it&#39;s strange, because the other major industry in California - the film industry - is heavily unionised, and you just don&#39;t see that happening there. You have vocally supportive multi-millionaire card-carrying members of the Screen Actors Guild, the Writers Guild, and the Directors Guild to name a few. None of these unions are limiting the work their members are carrying out.This is because those unions are serving a very different purpose to the stereotypical union some engineers seem to fear. SAG, the DGA, and the WGA aren&#39;t guaranteeing hours or limiting pay: they&#39;re simply trying to curb abuse in what it a very abusive industry, and putting in place procedures to protect members and resolve grievances.And they don&#39;t always get it right, and I don&#39;t pretend that Hollywood is a perfect utopia of worker relations, but I think it&#39;s pretty undeniable that the industry is a much better place with the unions around."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever seen Hollywood in the modern era without unions, so not sure how you can claim it&#39;s &#34;undeniable&#34; the industry is better off. We basically have no clue if it&#39;s better off or not.Unions are intended for industries where a worker doesn&#39;t have a marketplace of options as there is a single or just a few employers (e.g. Hollywood, teachers, coal mining towns, hospital staff, etc.). Unionizing at Google makes no sense, as there are thousands of tech companies hiring engineers in the valley -- engineers can &#34;collectively bargain&#34; with Google by simply leaving and working somewhere &#34;better&#34;.The reality is that Google is an easy place to work relative to how much people get paid. People don&#39;t want to leave a cushy job for one where they would have to work harder for their money, so instead, they are trying other means to have their cake and eat it too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems incredibly significant that only 230 people are officially involved with these plans to unionize. As of 2019, Google had nearly 120,000 employees.[0] That seems quite small, relatively speaking.Legally (I think, just learning about this now), to form a union, a majority of workers must show their willingness to form a union. Alternatively, to choose an existing union to join, an election with 30% of the workers support is required.[1]So with that said, am I reading this right? Does this group of 230 people need to find at least ~40,000 more people for this to be a valid effort to form/join a legal union?[0]https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/02/google-employee-growth-2001-...[1]https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/how-to-form-a..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Back when I worked at Marvell Semiconductor (circa 2005), we made laser printer ASICs for HP. We did a lot of dithering in hardware. We had a hardware block that did error diffusion, we had a hardware block that did regular diffusion. We also had a hardware block that did Blue Noise. I was responsible for implementing the firmware that drove those printers&#39; scan/copy path: scan an image in monochrome, run through the dither hardware to create the bit pattern fed to the laser engine.No one could explain to me how to use the blue noise block. I couldn&#39;t understand what the blue noise block was doing. This is the first article that explained, in terms I could understand, how blue noise dithering works.I can die happy. Thank you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is such a well-written article: it describes the impetus, it is researched, it has great examples both as code and as output, and it piques interest. In the late 1990&#39;s I contracted with an embedded software company to optimize a dithering algorithm for 8-bit MCUs that was used in most laser printers &amp; copiers, and this paper is a really good overview."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; According to Wikipedia, “Dither is an intentionally applied form of noise used to randomize quantization error”, and is a technique not only limited to images. It is actually a technique used to this day on audio recordings […]Dithering as a digital signal processing technique is also used frequently in the digital control of physical systems. One example of this is in the control of hydraulic servo valves[1]; these valves are usually pretty small and their performance can be dominated by a lot of external factors. One of the biggest ones is &#34;stiction&#34;, or static friction, wherein if the moving parts of the valve are at rest it can take a large amount of current to get them going again which translates in to poor control of the valve and in turn poor control of the thing the valve is trying to move. It&#39;s common to use very high frequency/small amplitude dithering on these valves to eliminate the effects of stiction without compromising accuracy which greatly improves the control stability and responsiveness of the servo valves.1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrohydraulic_servo_valve"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Definitely beautiful and would love for something simple and clean to eat LinkedIn&#39;s lunch.I don&#39;t have much to add in addition to everyone else except this: I am really disturbed by the common meme of faces-inside-circles. Why do we need faces? It just distracts from the content. I love the idea of being able to link former colleagues together - that&#39;s neat - but I&#39;m very anti-face and  there are any number of ways to do it that does not involve people&#39;s pictures.Edit: Wow this got a lot of upvotes. So, I&#39;ll continue for a sec: There is so, so much conscious and unconscious judgment and game playing with pictures, I don&#39;t even know where to start. Let&#39;s leave this to be simple, clean and beautiful without the faces."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I started read.cv when transitioning from full time to freelance design in July. I wanted an easy to update &#39;about me&#39; page to link from my website and bio – something simpler than LinkedIn and more dynamic than a PDF.Design wise I focused on legibility and tried to give projects/side projects equal weight to things like education and work experience. A few unique features: tagging collaborators in your experiences, status updates, and print optimized profiles.It took me around three months (Sept to November) to get it out the door, and I&#39;ve been working on making improvements since. Open to any questions or feedback!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a good start, but I&#39;m not a huge fan of this the way it is now.First, the font is tiny for my old eyes.  Not all of us, especially hiring managers, are still in their 20s and can read these tiny fonts. I measured it with a ruler and the text is 1mm tall.  Also, the font is gray on white, which is pretty but hard to read. In contrast, Linkedin is three times bigger and black on white, much easier to read.Second, after looking at the example, I have almost no idea what you&#39;ve done.  All I see are job titles.  I don&#39;t see any accomplishments or even job duties.  It looks like I could add those things when I create my own profile, but having them missing on the example isn&#39;t a good look.Third, the face circles.  I see face circles under each job, but they aren&#39;t clickable nor are there tooltips.  I have no idea what those are.  I assume they&#39;re other people who worked at the same place?  Maybe connections of yours who have worked at the same place?  That&#39;s a cool idea, but it needs to be more discoverable.  At the very least a tooltip would be good.Overall, when I&#39;m looking at a professional profile, I&#39;m usually doing it because I want to hire or work with someone.  The main information I want to know is 1) Do we have anyone in common I can ask about you?  2) What did you accomplish at your previous workplaces or otherwise?  3) Have you worked anywhere that I recognize and when, so I can ask my other friends who worked there if they know you?The face circles accomplish #1, so that&#39;s great.  #2 looks possible, but the design seems to minimize the accomplishments, as opposed to Linkedin which sort of puts it in your face.  And #3 seems to be covered but again the design minimizes the information I want most.I would say a good place to start would be asking yourself, &#34;Why does Linkedin look the way it does?&#34;.  A lot of their design comes from customer feedback, and their main customers are recruiters and hiring managers.  Steal their good stuff and leave their dark patterns behind."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have many fond memories of my first real job as sysadmin/render wrangler for a small animation company about fifteen years ago.Cores and memory were indeed what mattered, and as long as frames could be fitted into memory then the machine was left to render the frame and then save it back out to shared disk. There was no virtualization, just raw compute hardware running at full capacity 24/7. The scene was already split into different layers and rendered as sequences of frames that were then composited into final products.First job, first mini-datacenter in a new building, and there I am asking contractors to knock a hole in the building to fit air handlers due to the heat we were expecting to generate. Was great fun.It taught me a lot about automated systems management."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some ideas on this topic:1. Inconvenience based solutions don&#39;t address the problem: using apps to restrict phone use, physically hiding the phone etc. Once you leave those carefully constrained conditions, you are more vulnerable than ever. Not to mention the contradiction with the core issue that it&#39;s a symptom rather than a cause.2. Turning abstinence as an ongoing status condition (e.g. &#34;X days since I did Y&#34;) is a trap. It sets you up for later failure by burdening you with a perpetually unfinished objective with psychological consequences that only increase as the &#39;highscore&#39; increases. This could work with things that are less easily accessible like heroin, but it&#39;s not going to work with something as easily accessible as a phone or computer.3. The solution that works with 1 and 2 is probably urge surfing as it tackles the issue directly4. It&#39;s easier to think of it as an addiction to browsing rather than an addiction to the phone itself. You have to catch yourself during any browsing moment in any context to eventually make progress. Be intentional in almost every action instead of going on auto-pilot, although obviously resting at the end of the day is fine. It&#39;s more a general philosophy than a hard rule meant to exhaust you.5. The eventual goal is a rich life where you no longer feel the need to distract yourself"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The paper they are basing the opening sentence &#34;phone addiction is one of the biggest non-drug addiction(sic) in human history&#34; on is written by a Doctor of Business Administration, a dean that has &#34;particular industries of interest are banks and non-profit organizations&#34; in his bio and a third researcher with 2 publications total, including the article in question (published 2011).This may in no way weaken the point that some of the brightest minds of today are working on producing digital Skinner boxes, black on top, with humans as the rats, interfaced via phones.But basing an attempt at a strong argument about the addictive nature of cell-phones on an article with low relevance in scientific fields specializing in addiction could be described as suspect (most citations on g.scholar on the piece could be delineated as in the fields of business and management )."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I basically discourage addiction by making things “difficult” for myself on my phone:- Minimal web bookmarks (i.e. I have to type in most web sites I want to visit; this is just enough of an encumbrance that I won’t flip open things like Reddit every 30 seconds).- I never install apps meant for content consumption, I use their web sites.  (This is usually a better experience anyway, since the vast majority of them are somehow worse than their web sites, packed with ads/notifications/spying/crap that no one should want anyway.)- Certain web sites I refuse to use at all on mobile.  This gives me a much larger and more useful view anyway, and I can enforce sanity with a lot more plug-ins that way.- As of latest iOS, I shove most apps into the Library so they are not even on my home screen.  That way, they are straightforward to retrieve with a swipe-down search but not as easy as just tapping them open.  I find that I use them slightly less this way.- I turn off many notifications, since app-makers have long abused them anyway (as virtual ads, or designed in some way to suck people back into their apps for no reason; I drew the line when apps started outright lying about things, e.g. red dots implying messages that were not actually there, etc.).- I set it up so that my lock screen will not show most things without an extra step."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Judge Patricia Millett characterized the DOJ’s argument as giving the government the ability to “unilaterally decide to kill U.S. citizens,” according to coverage of the argument by Courthouse News Service. “Do you appreciate how extraordinary that proposition is?”“DOJ” in this case is the defense attorney. What a shit job. Regardless, the DOJ is not giving the USG the ability to kill US Persons with no judicial review. Judge Millett’s exasperation should be an example of how preposterous this is.The way this post is titled is misleading and is intended to flame."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can someone explain to me how the headline matches up with the content?&gt;The government sought to dismiss the case, invoking the state secrets privilege because Kareem sought discovery on whether he had been targeted, the process the government used to target him, and whether the United States had attempted to kill him. A federal judge agreed with the government.The involvement of state secrets is what is preventing discovery of whether or you were targeted by the government, not whether or not they are allowed to kill you. This seems very different from the government
 provably killing someone, and then claiming &#34;state secrets&#34; as a defense for being allowed to do it.True, it may not be provable that you were targeted if &#34;state secrets&#34; prevents evidence from coming to light, but this is orthogonal to whether or not killing you is legally allowed, which is what the headline is suggesting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The incidents described occurred in Idlib, Syria between June 2016 to August 2016. This was contemporaneous with the US effort to support the Syrian Kurds around Raqqa. But Idlib is quite far away.Secondly, Airwars.org does not show US strikes in that area and the US insists coalition forces in general did not have any air strikes at Idlib during the time in question.Finally, I do not find the title to be a fair summary of their argument for dismissal:&gt;Plaintiff lacks standing to pursue this suit.  Plaintiff alleges that he was in the vicinity of five near-misses in Syria—a nation with an ongoing civil war.  But he alleges no facts specifically linking the United States to those attacks.  The most he offers is an unsupported assertion that one attack involved a type of missile used by the United States, among other countries.  And he likewise fails to plausibly allege that any of these attacks, even if attributable to the United States, actually targeted him."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am one of the few people that inspects the source-code of extensions. It&#39;s easy to do, for Firefox for example, just right-click and save-as in the extensions site, then rename your extension to a .zip file and extract e.g:    addon.xpi --&gt; addon.zip

Then manually sift through the code looking for obvious malicious intent (or not so obvious malicious intent if the author is doing obfuscation). Note: obfuscation is a red flag! A simple scan for `https://` / &#39;http://&#39;  would usually yield interesting URLs where data is sent. I have actually spotted malicious addons in the wild this way and reported them to Mozilla. They were thankfully removed.Note: Obfuscation is NOT the same as minification, and I don&#39;t mean minification when using the word obfuscation!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"We need to talk about how difficult it is to monetize browser extensions. Most of these problems occur when a reputable extension gets sold to a less reputable owner, frequently for a relatively small amount of money (4-5 figures). Even very popular extensions have a hard time monetizing. Unfortunately, Chrome has recently made the situation worse by deprecating Chrome Web Store payments, and Firefox eliminated their paid extension store several years ago.If the only way to monetize an extension is to exploit its users for data, this kind of thing is going to keep happening. It&#39;s perfectly understandable how someone who is doing a lot of work for no pay will eventually get tired of it or have other priorities in life, which is what happened in this case. Perhaps we all need to stop taking it for granted that browser extensions ought to be free? Or maybe the browser vendors themselves can find ways of financially supporting extension authors. I feel that money is essential to both the problem and the solution.Of course, paid upfront software gets sold to new owners too. But if the software is paid upfront, the expectation is that the new owner will perhaps do a better job of maintaining and marketing the software, and that&#39;s why the new owner buys it. When the software is paid, the new owner has an opportunity to make money legitimately, without secretly exploiting the existing user base."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I still remember Craig Silverstein being asked what his biggest mistake at Google was and him answering &#34;Not pushing for ECC memory.&#34;Google&#39;s initial strategy (c. 2000) around this was to save a few bucks on hardware, get non-ECC memory, and then compensate for it in software.  It turns out this is a terrible idea, because if you can&#39;t count on memory being robust against cosmic rays, you also can&#39;t count on the software being stored in that memory being robust against cosmic rays.  And when you have thousands of machines with petabytes of RAM, those bitflips do happen.  Google wasted many man-years tracking down corrupted GFS files and index shards before they finally bit the bullet and just paid for ECC."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I beg this, every time this conversation comes up it’s the same answer “I don’t see a problem”.It’s so easy to chalk these kind of errors to other issues, a little corruption here, a running program goes bezerk there- could be a buggy program or a little accidental memory overwrite. Reboot will fix it.But I ran many thousands of physical machines, petabytes of RAM, I tracked memory flip errors and they were _common_; common even in: less dense memory, in thick metal enclosures surrounded by mesh. Where density and shielding impacts bitflips a lot.My own experience tracking bitflips across my fleet led me to buy a Xeon laptop with ECC memory (precision 5520) and it has (anecdotally) been significantly more reliable than my desktop."</p>

You look at the code and say &#34;it&#39;s can&#39;t make it here, because this was set&#34; but when you can&#39;t trust your memory you can&#39;t trust anything.And as the timeline goes to infinity, you may also get one of these reports and be asked to fix it... good luck."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Apart from those benchmark games a lot of real world C is a lot less performant than people think it might be. I spent a fair amount of time reviewing C code in the last 5 years - and things that pop up in nearly every review are costly string operations. Linear counts due to the use of null terminated strings and extra allocations for substrings to attach null terminators, or just deep copies because ownership can’t be determined are far more common than exceptional. This happens because null terminated strings feel like idiomatic C to most people.Rust avoids those from the start by making slices idiomatic.Another thing I commonly see is the usage of suboptimal containers (like arrays with linear search) - just because it’s there’s no better alternative at hand (standard library doesn’t offer ones and dependency management is messy). Which also makes it less surprising that code in higher level languages might perform better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Once LLVM fixes some bugs with `noalias`, at which point Rust will begin using it again in more circumstances [1], I&#39;d expect to see Rust get even faster in these benchmarks, given that the Rust compiler knows much more about which pointers do/do-not alias than most other programming languages [2] and the myriad optimizations this knowledge allows.[1] https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54878#issuecomment-...[2] https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/aliasing.html"</p>

Try searching for Ozonetel on Google. There will be six competitor ads and then our website will show up :)In our early days we used to be scared and bid for it.Lost a lot of money doing that. Then we talked about it and stopped. Again, no change in customer acquisition. Turns out, customers scroll down the ads and still click on our website.Are our competitors getting some of our traffic?Of course.But my business is not built on the assumption that people will not find my competitors.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Stepping back a bit, I feel the argument is analogous to how music is becoming more mainstream and generic, how casual gamers &#34;corrupt&#34; the art form of gaming, how clickbait and stupit stuff is overshadowing lovingly curated independent websites, eternal September etc.One answer to all these propositions is that the valuable stuff is still there, you just have an additional flood of mediocre boring predictable stuff. You can still find enough indie music and games and movies to spend all your free time on.Similarly, if you know where to look and whose papers to watch out for, you can read more interesting stuff. The existence of more bullshit makes the filtering somewhat more effort, but it&#39;s bearable.Most papers are never deeply read anyway, outside of the reviewers. Even citations don&#39;t mean someone really read the paper in depth.So, most medíocre, boring papers get ignored.It&#39;s an illusion to expect that every researcher can pump out multiple really interesting non-boring papers every year. So we pretend. We write, we cite, we present, overiflate, overpromise etc. It must look like there is steady hard noble work and toil. It&#39;s like a ritual. The scientists are writing all these papers so tax payers can sleep well that their money is paid for hard work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing to keep in mind is that some of the papers which reviewers consider very marginal turn out to be breakthroughs. For example Jim Allison, who later won the Nobel Prize:&#34;Allison was hoping to be published by one of the leading peer-reviewed research journals. But nobody at Cell or Nature or any of the A-list, peer-reviewed journals was willing to publish the findings of this junior academic from Smithville, Texas. “Finally, I ended up publishing the results in a new journal called The Journal of Immunology.” It wasn’t Science or the New England Journal of Medicine, but it was in print, and in the world.“At the end of the paper, I said, ‘This might be the cell antigen receptor, and here are the reasons why I think that it is the T-cell antigen receptor,’ and I just listed it out, all the reasons.” It was a bold announcement regarding the biggest topic in immunology. “And nobody noticed it,” Allison says. “Except in one lab.”&#34;https://www.wired.com/story/meet-jim-allison-the-texan-who-j...So you really need to publish the marginal stuff to make sure the breakthrough stuff gets published as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"But on the other hand, with a severe replication crisis in science (https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21504366/science-replicat...), isn&#39;t it a good thing that we have a bunch of boring papers that are close to stuff that&#39;s already happened? It&#39;s not people replicating others&#39; findings exactly, but it at least gives points of comparison that can help to weed out some of the problematic work out there."</p>

Churches, charities and other non-profits are also exempt.Those seem like extremely non-negligible exemptions. Which is not to say that this law is useless, but it could use more teeth."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Funny, I actually have an open Pinetime in front of me right now. I use it for my masters thesis and it&#39;s a really nice project. If you want to try out some embedded development (that you can actually show to friends who don&#39;t aren&#39;t developers), I think this is the perfect project."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d be the perfect target for the products of a company like Pine. A long-time geek who uses open-source software on nearly all of his devices, a tinkerer who doesn&#39;t mind recompiling a kernel or picking a solderer to make things work, and someone who seeks for absolute flexibility from his devices with zero corporate compromises.Unfortunately, the mediocre hardware used in their devices keeps holding me back.First came a phone with a 9-year-old A53 Cortex chipset. Then a tablet with the same outdated chipset. Then a laptop that ships with a Rockchip RK3399 with 4GB of RAM, in an era when 4GB barely suffice to run a browser with a few tabs. And now they are releasing a smartwatch with a 64 MHz core and 64 KB of RAM - some specs you would have expected from a very cheap smartwatch released 7-8 years ago.Why should I use a device whose hardware is almost a decade old at the time of purchase? And how do they even expect anyone to actually use these devices as their primary daily drivers, and not as proofs of concept, nice toys to tinker on every now and then or show off to friends?I understand that Pine wants to use 100% open hardware, and that comes with heavy compromises, but are these compromises worth it?If you ask even the geekest user out there whether they prefer a device whose source code is 100% pure and doesn&#39;t contain any binary blobs, or a device that doesn&#39;t start freezing/lagging after a couple of minutes of normal usage, I bet that anyone would opt for the latter."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ok, just to make sure I understand this correctly.- This is basically a commercial smartwach (the Colmi P8) that is based on a well documented SOC, the nordic nRF52832- The open source version comes with an enclosure that is not glued shut, so that it is easy to access testpoints on the pcb.- Development is done by accessing the nRF51 SWD interface with pogo pins or similar. The programming interface can be a standard SWD interface such as an STLink cloneOk, sounds easy enough. It should be possible to just buy one of those smartwatches and crack them open? But OTOH the developer version is not much more expensive.The main question is now: What software to run on it, that goes beyond a few experiments? Is there any kind of open source smartwatch OS that would run on this?Edit: Corrected typo, of course I meant SWD interface, not SWM. (SWM or rather SWIM is for STM8)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Chief of Advertising Integrity&#34; does anyone take that title seriously? Forget advertising, Facebook and it&#39;s CEO himself has no integrity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a corporation, Facebook truly seems to be trying to improve its behavior for the benefit of society at large, but the company is finding it very difficult to do The Right Thing, because it would reduce future revenue growth, shrink long-term profitability, and hurt the company&#39;s competitive standing against the many other companies that are trying to eat Facebook&#39;s lunch every day.In the extreme, Facebook&#39;s choices appear to be: (a) act in the best interest of society and get f#cked by competitors; or (b) remain a dominant force in the market, but as a side effect, f#ck everybody. All options for Facebook appear to be a mix of those two horrible choices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Facebook is a company that never stood by small businesses. It&#39;s also the company that manipulated users into a free basic services just to create their own walled garden in the internet.Still, sardonically they created two ad campaigns: Apple vs free internet and vs small businesses. Their whole marketing stunt was laughably wrong. No wonder their chief left the company."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"WSL2 was promised as a good working extension for a Linux dev environment on windows by my peers. Sadly, a whole host of issues specific to my dev environment meant that it was useless as I’d spend more time fixing it than getting any valuable use out of it. More importantly, this became the very reason I switched to arch full time, and haven’t looked back since. I still hope that it becomes what it was promised to be, although I don’t see myself going back to windows any time soon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After constantly getting caught in bugs between WSL and Docker, i&#39;m now running Ubuntu Server headless with a Windows VM (with GPU passthrough) on top.The biggest issue across all these things is filesystems. There is simply no good way to share a filesystem between Windows and Linux that is both 1. fast 2. fully correct - i.e doesn&#39;t break some code.SMB/NFS just never work super well because they are slow, or programs think they are local filesystems so things break (e.g VScode won&#39;t detect new files created on the linux side of a SMB mount without a manual refresh). Plenty of details on getting permissions right too. Not to mention extended attributes which differ slightly and break stuff. Network file systems in general are just too different to local FS&#39;s for programs to work seamlessly.The 2 non-ideal solutions I&#39;ve found are 1. keep all files in linux + edit over network using VSCode Remote or IntelliJ Remote support or 2. keep a copy of the dev workspace in windows, and use something like unison (or manual git) to sync."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi everyone, OP here.I used a Seek RevealPro which outputs TIFF files that contain 32-bit floating point values. I created a script that takes in a Seek TIFF and outputs an 8-bit greyscale integer TIFF:https://github.com/dheera/iceland-thermal/blob/master/script...I then panoramically stitched those 8-bit TIFFs together (some with the help of hugin, and some manually with GIMP) and distortion-corrected them as best as I could to a black-and-white visible light image. I also created an artistically-chosen color map for each image. For the final output image, hue and saturation are fully based on thermal data, and lightness is a combination of thermal and visible data. Scripts to generate the final output images, along with the panoramically pre-stitched data, and the color maps I used:https://github.com/dheera/iceland-thermalAlso, my Instagram, which is mostly astrophotography of late, but I did post thermal images there before and I may do so in the future again if I can find another good set of interesting thermal subjects to do this in!https://instagram.com/dheeranet/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m curious what kind of thermal camera he&#39;s using.I bought a Therm-App Pro 640x480 a while back and it&#39;s quite good - and reasonably priced compared to Flir - along with a github repo for different false color palettes. But what&#39;s really weird is it seems to not be available anymore. I&#39;m guessing export restrictions or massive demand for thermal cameras during Covid along with supply chain issues. IIRC it is also 25 frames a second, which is unusually high for thermal cameras due to export restrictions.Edit: Here&#39;s a post on creating panoramic images with therm-app. https://www.flickr.com/groups/therm-app-users/discuss/721576..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cunning. He took panoramas with thermal camera and simultaneous black and white photos and coloured the b&amp;w photos with the data from the thermal camera. Interesting examples of insulation. I wonder how the result compares to the standard Flir auto blended images. Msx?"</p>
