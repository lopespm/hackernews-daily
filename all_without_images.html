								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is the best news I&#39;ve heard all week.  The more widely vegan &#34;meat&#34; is available, the more likely it is to be adopted by average people and not just dedicated vegans.Reducing the demand for real beef is probably one of the best things we can do in the short term for the environment, due to the amount of land required for cattle farming, and due to the surprising amount of methane emitted by cattle.
(see the documentary &#34;Cowspiricy&#34;, or Mark Rober&#39;s &#34;Feeding Bill Gates a Fake Burger to save the world: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-V3ESHcfA)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I enjoy eating meat and have no plans of going off of it completely. But we eat so much of it as a culture.And when you add up every hot pocket, frozen pizza, slider, hot dog, or chicken nugget, it&#39;s hard to argue that most of meat actually being consumed can&#39;t be easily substituted. For something healthier and cheaper too!And I know people blast tech companies for focusing too much on making things flashy and cool, but the people who are making electric cars and fake meat cool are the ones who are going to save our asses while we were busy scolding people for not trying harder to enjoy brown rice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This brand was tested by German magazine called &#34;Öko-Test&#34; on their ingredients. Also not for the first time. It got a BAD review again because it contains too much mineral oil in it (could have various reasons, packaging of ingredients or oily manufacturing machines) and 20g fat per 100g &#34;meat&#34;.So it&#39;s unhealthy on mineral oil (MOSH) which can easily accumulate in your body and fat percentage.One of the sources which you can Google translate:https://www.businessinsider.de/gruenderszene/food/beyond-mea...Another English article:http://www.ezineblog.org/2020/12/12/beyond-meat-fails-the-te..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"He&#39;s kind of totally wrong about the phones and thus the speed being THE killer feature. First of all, Symbian phones, which were the market leader smartphones when the iphone was released were pretty fast. So were feature phones (i.e. dumb phones).What iphone was a LOT better at than everyone else was UX. Of which speed is one component, of course. It&#39;s funny how much people never get it although it happened in front of us, it happened to us. At the time I was working at Nokia Research and I remember my girlfriend telling me how his boss got this wonderful phone that you can take photos with and you can view them, etc. The funny thing is that I had such a phone since 2001. I have been working with smartphones for 6 years then, she knew it, she listened to me when I told her or others what I was doing (and then listen to others responding &#34;yeah, but phones are for making phone calls&#34;). She saw me browsing the net on my phones (a 9210 communicator and then a 9500), send emails from the beach, etc.Still it somehow didn&#39;t register. Because it looked like something that she&#39;d never use. And then the iphone that did a lot less made her and basically everyone understand what a smartphone is. (Even though by then symbian smartphones were pretty common, most people didn&#39;t use them as smartphones.)So no, it&#39;s not simply the speed. It&#39;s the UX. And even if we talk about speed, it&#39;s still not the speed, but it&#39;s the perception of the speed, which a lot has been written about: delay (lagging) matters a lot even if speed on average is OK."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I vividly remember using a kiosk to order a sandwich at a gas station 3 years ago... Not because the sandwich was great, not because it had a great logo, or a great name...The INSTANT I hit the button to complete the order, the built in printer almost spat the ticket at me. I ordered a second sandwich just so I could get a video of that happening again.Edit: Just found and uploaded the video :)
https://youtu.be/TX_-dXIpPvAEdit2: looks like it was a soda, not a second sandwich."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This might be because I am a former semi-pro Quake3 player but these days I grind my teeth with 95% of all software. Everything feels like it has at least 200ms delay injected, on every transition.I&#39;d honestly pay extra for an iPhone where I can disable ALL motion, too. But that&#39;s the least of the problems.I don&#39;t want to become the grumpy old grandpa yelling &#34;back in my day!...&#34; but we have waaaaaaaaaaay too much young JS devs who know nothing else.We need to get back to native UIs. Is it awfully hard? Yes it is. Do the users care? No, they don&#39;t. Many people want fast UIs.But to be fair to all sides -- there are also a lot of people who don&#39;t notice certain slowdowns that I scoff at. So there is a middle ground that won&#39;t cost billions to achieve and IMO that should be chased after."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a recent video presentation by Jonah Edwards, who runs the Core Infrastructure Team at the Internet Archive. He explains the IA’s server, storage, and networking infrastructure, and then takes questions from other people at the Archive.I found it all interesting. But the main takeaway for me is his response to Brewster Kahle’s question, beginning at 13:06, about why the IA does everything in-house rather than having its storage and processing hosted by, for example, AWS. His answer: lower cost, greater control, and greater confidence that their users are not being tracked."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was a kid, my dreams was to work at Google, Microsoft, Apple or any of these big companies. Now that I am reaching 30 (and becoming very nostlagic of the old web), I think the company that would make me most happy of login every morning to get some work done would be Internet Archive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see incredible value in IA collection of books, videos and software. OTOH I&#39;m puzzled by lack of organization.Take for example this newer document: https://archive.org/details/manualzilla-id-5695071  The document has horrible name and useless tags, and the content seems to be only section 2 of some SW manual. How would I ever hope to find it if I needed that exact document?Obviously such huge archive cannot be categorized and annotated by small team, so it would make sense to crowdsource the labeling process. Yet, as registered user I can only flag the item, or write a review. Why doesn&#39;t IA let users label content and build their own curated collections of items?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Submitted title was &#34;MIT Press has granted full access to all its journals&#34;. What&#39;s the source for that? It&#39;s extremely important to be accurate with this kind of thing. The discussion below is all based on assuming that that title is literally true.The HN guidelines specifically ask you not to rewrite titles unless they are misleading or linkbait: https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html.I&#39;ve changed the URL from https://www.mitpressjournals.org/action/showPublications, which doesn&#39;t explain anything, to the press release which, although it&#39;s a press release, sort of does. Nevertheless it&#39;s hard to figure out what exactly is being announced here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To MIT Press, thank you. But without an announcement, I fear that this is just a one time, brief thing.Springer did this awhile ago for a weekend, not its entire catalog but many books were free to download. It was wonderful, but brief. From down thread, https://mitpress.mit.edu/blog/mit-press-launches-direct-openI think it is important for folks to recognize how hard this must have been and how many heated verbal battles were exchanged inside of MIT over this. Thank You. And thank Aaron, always a champion in spreading the world&#39;s knowledge to the most people possible.  We should empower everyone as much as we can with the bits we have available.Folks should check some fun journals likeComputer Music Journal https://www.mitpressjournals.org/loi/comjEvolutionary Computation https://www.mitpressjournals.org/loi/evcoAdd your own below!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems slightly weird to me that university presses and learned society journals aren’t generally open access. I thought the point was to aid the university’s research. Surely it helps the name of the university to have important widely accessible journals with the university’s name on them. Maybe the presses tend to have been spun off as commercial enterprises, or maybe the university really loves the income. Or maybe they are really expensive to run for some reason. I know the press at my university has a pretty large building but I’d figured a lot of it was a warehouse. Maybe it’s full of salespeople negotiating with librarians.I don’t think there’s much hope of the commercial journals owned by Elsevier or Springer opening up, but I do hope that the trend of journals flipping (where the entire editorial board resigns and forms a similarly named open access journal) will increase.Perhaps another problem is that in those fields that are already closest to open access (say because they use the arxiv), there is less incentive for people to jot publish in commercial journals as everyone who matters will have already read the preprint in the arxiv."</p>

				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26311522">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"More background from the point of view of Frogware:The Sinking City is Being Delisted. Here’s Whyhttps://frogwares.com/the-sinking-city-is-being-delisted-her...Without wishing to take sides, here&#39;s what seems to be at the root of the dispute, from Frogware&#39;s POV:On June 27, 2019, The Sinking City was released on Xbox One, PS4, and Epic Games Store. That was a great day for us. And once the game was released, we received a letter from Bigben/Nacon that the milestones that were previously approved are being canceled, meaning that we would not receive any profit from the sales of the game. A retroactive cancellation on not delivering a product on time that is already out in the market is not acceptable. That was when our legal battle began.We filed a lawsuit against Bigben/Nacon on August 2019 and, incidentally, only then we started to receive income reports, though incomplete and undocumented. So it was not possible for us to see if the revenue was correctly calculated or even how many units we sold. At some point we received a statement claiming that one of the console manufacturers hasn’t paid royalties for more than 5 months, while actually the same console manufacturer paid our royalties from other games without any delay in the same period of time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was working near some game publishers many many years ago, and the case when they would crack the game in order to publish/republish/rewrap installer, localize to some local market or release some critical patch, when the original team was not responsive, not experienced in certain tech issues, had no resources allocated, was drown in bureaucracy, or even was not existing anymore, was not so uncommon.The case when this is breaching original contracts is the well the separate issue. Often times the publisher and developer have different views of the world, - relationships in this industry have always been tense."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hadn&#39;t heard of this before, so maybe I am missing some context here, but something seems fishy:&gt; Steam is one of the listed platforms of commercialization in the contract between Frogwares and Nacon. But since the release of the game, Nacon’s unlawful actions have forced Frogwares to defend its property and react in front of the French Justice for lack of payments, attempts to steal our IPs, etc which we made a public letter about back in August 2020.Here&#39;s the previous statement from Nacon:https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/750130/view/30584784...I can&#39;t find any of the details about Nacon&#39;s unlawful actions, and it seems Frogware is being intentionally vague. Doing some digging, it seems like this is almost a complete retread of a legal battle they had before:https://twinfinite.net/2019/09/frogwares-games-delisted-alle...It seems like they may have a history of playing a copyright game with publishers - take their money to develop a game, then use legal trickery to take back the property outright.In this case Nacon may have felt they had a &#34;mechanic&#39;s lien&#34; on the code and felt justified stealing it back outright (probably a bad choice in the long run). But regardless, I don&#39;t get the sense that Frogwares is completely being on the up and up about the relationship with their exes.Update: Frogwares has a much more detailed list of grievances here: https://frogwares.com/the-sinking-city-is-being-delisted-her... Some seem petty and some seem serious. But it still leaves questions. How much did Nacon already pay Frogwares? Does Frogwares plan on paying it back?&gt; The agreement is, therefore, terminated without further formality. Moreover, on July 17, 2020, Nacon attempted to oppose the termination in court, but the judge rejected the demand, and the contract is now terminated in the eyes of the law.Maybe French law is much weirder than ours, but this phrasing would be highly suspect in the US. You would get a really affirmative ruling that you are still bound by contract or not."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Stuff like this is so cool, and also highlights the importance of archiving the internet.I&#39;ve never used Lotus 1-2-3, but this makes me want to try and get it running to try out older software that is brutally efficient."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think there is something kind of fun about purposefully using &#34;outdated&#34; software, and even valuable sometimes, in the same way that it&#39;s useful to use a dead language like Latin nowadays; it&#39;s not changing so there&#39;s sort of a bit of &#34;equality&#34; to it, for want of a better word.For example, I&#39;ve actually thought it might make sense for people to release new software on DOS or the Sega Genesis, simply because they&#39;re  not being updated anymore, and as a result, there&#39;s a ton of great emulators for both that can run on pretty much any modern platform under the sun.  A Linux program I write might not run under FreeBSD or AmigaOS, but I would bet that I could get basically nearly any SNES game running nearly flawlessly on them with an emulator."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m so sick of these profound-sounding blog posts that take 1 million words to say precisely jack shit. Yes, the key innovation around Bitcoin was to order events. You can call this &#39;time&#39; if you want. This is literally the most obvious thing you can say about the system. It&#39;s so obvious in fact that it&#39;s in the introduction section to the Bitcoin whitepaper. Here is the entire blog post written much shorter and more precisely by Satoshi:&#39;In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions.&#39;Not trying to be elitist but if you find this topic new then you probably also find Bitcoin&#39;s technical workings new. Since it&#39;s now more than a decade old I don&#39;t find this a very topical inclusion for a &#39;news&#39; site."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let me fix that title. Happy to be downvoted into negative territory. I only have 11 points. Go ahead.&#34;Bitcoin Is A Waste of Time (and Resources)&#34;What Bitcoin has done is that it taught people they can come together in a sustained flash mob (like an on-the-fly hedge fund operation) and manipulate the price of speculative assets by creating artificial short-term pump-n-dump type demand. Bitcoin has trained our collective neural network to do this.The huddled masses can take their new superpower and apply it to stock, crypto, commodities on the commodity exchange, and all kinds of speculative assets, especially the virtual kind.It&#39;s taken a gambling-friendly society with feverish lust for winning (think for-profit fantasy sports, online poker, day trading, Vegas et al) and turned us into a giant decentralized casino."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m ready to be downvoted to oblivion, especially by all the Bitcoin purists, but I hope my message sparks at least some curiosity.Bitcoin is getting &#34;weaker&#34; every year for several reasons:- emerging centralization due to economies of scale. If this trend continues the mining power will be so consolidated that a 51% attack will be likely. The Nakamoto coefficient is already at 4, and tending towards 3.- energy usage due to Proof of Work is growing astronomically, and the higher the price of bitcoin, the less incentive there is to use renewable energy. Bitcoin uses more energy than the country of Argentina.- transaction times are SLOW, and expensive. The lightning network is incredibly buggy and won&#39;t actually solve the problems it&#39;s promising.There is a better alternative. RaiBlocks, named nano since 2018. It got a bad rap due to the BitGrail hack, but it&#39;s picking up steam again. The developer community is great, the main dev team on the Nano protocol has been consistently chugging along regardless of the 3 years of crypto winter on a shoestring budget and the nano community is made up of users, not speculators.This article sums it up quite nicely: https://senatusspqr.medium.com/why-nano-is-the-ultimate-stor...I&#39;m happy to receive downvotes, but all I ask in return is that you give it a read with an open mind."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll admit, I didn&#39;t read all four articles. I got about half way through the first one and was just wondering &#34;I still have no idea what this is all about.&#34; Fortunately, the Wikipedia article on the author has a brief summary.In particular, I thought this quote from the Wikipedia article really summarizes the differences between older and younger generations: &#34;there is a profound difference between using a racial epithet in the course of a discussion about that racial epithet&#39;s use, and using a racial epithet to diminish or to wound someone.&#34;For &#34;socially conscious&#34; people in my generation (Gen X), I think nearly all of us would find calling someone a racial epithet abhorrent. At the same time, while I understand culture has shifted and I wouldn&#39;t do it now, I still find it quite bizarre that the mere utterance of the epithet, even in a sentence like &#34;You should never call someone a &lt;racial epithet&gt; because that is extremely offensive&#34; is considered itself racist by younger people.I recall hearing about a young popular YouTuber about a year or so ago who was accused of being racist simply for singing along to the lyrics of a popular rap song. Even more strange to me was that his defense (which was true if one looked up his Instagram video) was that he did NOT utter said epithet, in that he was singing along with the lyrics but when it got to that word he just skipped it and didn&#39;t say it.I understand culture changes, but it still bothers me that we&#39;ve gotten to the point where we completely disregard intent and focus instead just on the syntax of what was said. To be clear, I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s indeed what occurred in Mr. McNeil&#39;s case, but I certainly have seen it in other examples."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; 1. Yes, I did use the word, in this context: A student asked me if I thought her high school’s administration was right to suspend a classmate of hers for using the word in a video she’d made in eighth grade. I said “Did she actually call someone a (offending word)? Or was she singing a rap song or quoting a book title or something?” When the student explained that it was the student, who was white and Jewish, sitting with a black friend and the two were jokingly insulting each other by calling each other offensive names for a black person and a Jew, I said “She was suspended for that? Two years later? No, I don’t think suspension was warranted. Somebody should have talked to her, but any school administrator should know that 12-year-olds say dumb things. It’s part of growing up.”&gt; 2. I was never asked if I believed in white privilege. As someone who lived in South Africa in the 1990’s and has reported in Africa almost every year since, I have a clearer idea than most Americans of white privilege. I was asked if I believed in systemic racism. I answered words to the effect of: “Yeah, of course, but tell me which system we’re talking about. The U.S. military? The L.A.P.D.? The New York Times? They’re all different.”&gt; 3. The question about blackface was part of a discussion of cultural appropriation. The students felt that it was never, ever appropriate for any white person to adopt anything from another culture — not clothes, not music, not anything. I counter-argued that all cultures grow by adopting from others. I gave examples — gunpowder and paper. I said I was a San Franciscan, and we invented blue jeans. Did that mean they — East Coast private school students — couldn’t wear blue jeans? I said we were in Peru, and the tomato came from Peru. Did that mean that Italians had to stop using tomatoes? That they had to stop eating pizza? Then one of the students said: “Does that mean that blackface is OK?” I said “No, not normally — but is it OK for black people to wear blackface?” “The student, sounding outraged, said “Black people don’t wear blackface!” I said “In South Africa, they absolutely do. The so-called colored people in Cape Town have a festival every year called the Coon Carnival where they wear blackface, play Dixieland music and wear striped jackets. It started when a minstrel show came to South Africa in the early 1900’s. Americans who visit South Africa tell them they’re offended they shouldn’t do it, and they answer ‘Buzz off. This is our culture now. Don’t come here from America and tell us what to do.’ So what do you say to them? Is it up to you, a white American, to tell black South Africans what is and isn’t their culture?”I fundamentally don&#39;t understand why the Times didn&#39;t explain this early on. Not necessarily release these statements verbatim, but certainly provide some of this context."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Related to Xiaomi, the company is also doing some sketchy things in the smart home space under their brand &#34;Aqara&#34;.  I use HomeKit in my apartment and opted for Aqara branded wireless buttons and temp/humidity sensors because of the attractive hardware and good reviews.  The devices require a wi-fi connected hub, not too strange for things that use Zigbee, so I gave that a go.Well, on cursory examination, the Aqara/Xiaomi hub was talking to a bunch of Chinese servers constantly.  I didn&#39;t dive too deep into what all they were actually for.  When I blocked the device from phoning home with my router, all the connected devices stopped working!  None of the buttons or sensors would work, the RGB light on the hub couldn&#39;t even be changed.  As soon as it lost the ability to ping its servers in China, the thing actually started strobe light flashing blue.  Re-enable the outside network access on it, starts working again.  This was totally antithetical to why I use HomeKit in the first place, so I removed the hub and paired all the Aqara accessories with a generic open source Zigbee hub (ConBee II) and added it to HomeKit with HomeBridge.In the future I plan to give brands more scrutiny before investing time/money in them and granting them unfettered access to my LAN..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This paragraph stood out to me:&gt; The intention here seems to be that aigt is the timestamp when the ID was generated. So if that timestamp deviates from current time by more than 7776000000 milliseconds (90 days) a new ID is going to be generated. However, this implementation is buggy, it will update aigt on every call rather than only when a new ID is generated. So the only scenario where a new ID will be generated is: this method wasn’t called for 90 days, meaning that the browser wasn’t started for 90 days. And that’s rather unlikely, so one has to consider this ID permanent.If we assume that Xiaomi aren&#39;t literally trying to spy for a government and are in fact just poorly calibrated on what&#39;s legitimate to collect for product analytics purposes, this paragraph highlights why that&#39;s still incredibly dangerous despite &#34;good intentions&#34;.I remember the UK government investigation into Huawei concluding that not only was their security posture insufficient for critical infrastructure, but their engineering practices were likely a decade away from being at a point where they could start to claim good security practice.This paragraph seems to suggest a similar problem at Xiaomi. This should have been caught at a security review stage during design, it should have been caught at the code review stage, it should have been caught by automated tests, it should have been caught by QA, it should have been caught once live by data tests, it should have been seen once live by analysts, it should have been fixed at so many different points.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Throwaway because I don&#39;t want my co-workers to know.I was poor. My father left home when I was a kid in middle school. My mom worked part time cleaning houses and left us when she found a new husband. I dropped out of high-school in the 9th grade and went to work. Low paying jobs. I lived with my aunt on the bad side of town.Fast-forward 35 years. Today, I make about 200K per year. I got a GED, went to trade school, then got into college (full Pell Grant because I was so poor) and came out with a few degrees.Everything I own is fully paid for. House, cars, etc. because I&#39;m always afraid I&#39;m going to be poor again. Of course, I only own modest things. Nothing fancy.If you have never been poor, you may not realize how awesome Small houses and Toyota Corollas are.My fears about being poor again drive my wife and kids crazy. They think I&#39;m nuts and say I need counseling. I probably do.Anyway, people think I&#39;m &#39;privileged&#39; now because I earn a lot of money, but they have no idea that I used to sleep on the floor and eat in soup lines.I made it and you can too. Poverty has no color. It impacts everyone. You can&#39;t tell just by looking at someone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great write-up, and as someone who spent time being poor-ish, it really resonated.What I realized from my own life experience: the US sawed the bottom rungs off the ladder in the 1950s when it suburbanized. There is no affordable housing or transportation in 95% of the North American land area, and virtually every societal problem we deal with either stems from this or is made worse by it. Then the healthcare disaster is the cherry on top.The US is a great place to live and work with tremendous upward mobility —— but only if you can stay above the event horizon which is reliable car ownership and insurance coverage (health, home/renters, auto). If you fall under that, you will need help or a lot of good luck to get back out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"His point on housing is so important, and its adjacent to a lot of other poverty-related issues.It&#39;s one of the reasons advocates for the poor often seem to speak a different language to their opposition.If you live in median-and-above-land, you think of all costs existing on a spectrum.  Fancy dinners for $100 on one end. Rice and beans for pennies at the other. This is true for clothes, smartphones, furniture... lots of things. There&#39;s a spectrum with options all along it.It is not true for housing, transport and a lot of other, unavoidable expenses. Housing is the extreme example. Say an average smartphone is $350. $700 buys a luxury phone. $175 gets you an decent phone. Say median rent is $1500. Going above $3k will get you a palace and $750 probably doesn&#39;t get you anything. Quality, below median prices is on an extremely steep curve.Household economics are just completely different below and above a certain threshold... and this has gotten more pronounced over the last generation or two.Ireland has/had a whole literary genre of stories about miserable poverty-stricken childhoods. They paint a very vivid picture. If you compare it to poverty today, besides being less harsh, it&#39;s quite different.  They had housing. It was basic, often insecure, but they did have housing.Food was scarce. That&#39;s no longer the case. Stuff though... they had no stuff. No bed, no mugs, no shoes, no pencils. Getting these things was an epic mission and served as a landmark. That is all changed now. Stuff is extremely abundant. Basics like housing and transport are almost as scarce as they were in the bad old days.The upshot of all this is that we underestimate how poor poor is."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seen the GTA post already and the sscanf behavior is very surprising as one would expect it to parse the given string until the given format is satisfied or \0 is hit. Seems like this is not the case. Found this: https://stackoverflow.com/a/23924112&gt; sscanf() converts the string you pass in to an _IO_FILE* to make the string look like a &#34;file&#34;. This is so the same internal _IO_vfscanf() can be used for both a string and a FILE*. However, as part of that conversion, done in a _IO_str_init_static_internal() function, it calls __rawmemchr (ptr, &#39;\0&#39;); essentially a strlen() call, on your input string.Looks correct. Call flow:https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/21c3f4b5368686ade28d90d...https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/21c3f4b5368686ade28d90d...https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/21c3f4b5368686ade28d90d...https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/83908b3a1ea51e3aa7ff422..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found this while making a collection of what C implementation does what at https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26298300 .There are two basic implementation strategies.  The BSD (FreeBSD and OpenBSD and more than likely NetBSD too), Microsoft, GNU, and MUSL C libraries use one, and suffer from this; whereas the OpenWatcom, P.J. Plauger, Tru64 Unix, and my standard C libraries use another, and do not.The 2002 report in the comp.lang.c Usenet newsgroup (listed in that discussion) is the earliest that I&#39;ve found so far.There have been several assertions that library support for strings in C++ is poor.  However, note that the fix here was to switch from the Standard C library function sscanf() to a C++ library.* https://github.com/fastfloatOne might advocate using other people&#39;s libraries, on the grounds that they will have got such things right.  However, note that this is RapidYAML, and the bug got fixed several years after GTA Online was released.  Other third-party parsing libraries have suffered from being layered on top of sscanf() in other ways.* https://github.com/json-c/json-c/issues/173* https://github.com/kgabis/parson/commit/96150ba1fd7f3398aa6a..."</p>

Engineering diagrams, explaining concepts to other engineers who are using the diagram as a jumping off point to deeper explorations2. &#34;Business&#34; diagrams - the sort of thing we want to see in a Medium article or presentation.  The style and correct placement matters far more than engineering.The first is very amenable to markdown style production - often we want to spend no more than a few minutes creating the diagram.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Surprising how much press &#34;cancel culture&#34; gets these days as if it&#39;s a new thing or as if it&#39;s a new thing being pushed on society by the left. We&#39;ve always had cancel culture. Some might remember the Dixie Chicks. How about the Rachael Ray ad that Dunkin Donuts pulled merely because it looked like an Arab scarf? Jerry Falwell came to prominence entirely based on his pushing of cancel culture. When I lived in North Carolina, one of the things that was repeated all the time was that a newspaper editor would lose his job for publishing a story with a positive spin on free trade. You can go back further to McCarthyism, Turing being prosecuted for being gay, and on and on.Cancel culture remains a thing. Apparently now that folks aren&#39;t just being cancelled for supporting gay marriage, the free exchange of ideas is suddenly important. The outright hypocrisy of so many on this issue is the biggest story.Edit: Forgot to mention this extreme example of cancel culture:https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/professor-who-wore-hijab-...A professor was cancelled because she wore a hijab. There was no outrage at all from the usual suspects."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I genuinely wonder what cancel culture is going to look like in the next 5-10 years and beyond. Just about everyone I speak to about the subject agrees that cancel culture is bad but very few people seem willing to confront it. I sense that people hope the rest of society will come to its senses and we all stop being so judgemental.But as much as I loathe cancel culture and it&#39;s chilling effects on the free exchange of ideas, I can&#39;t help but admit that it seems to work. From a detached and objective standpoint, an ideology that utilizes cancel culture is really good at stamping out opposition. You are free to think and believe whatever you want in private and then you self-censor in public out of fear. It takes a certain critical mass of people to affect change and cancel culture excels at keeping individuals from speaking out because the consequences have the potential to ruin your life.So all that being said, I genuinely wonder if cancel culture is here to stay, because the next ideology to come along will also realize how powerful of a tool it is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find it almost funny how the media/culture/etc. seems determined to build a group of people that will react negatively to so-called &#34;cancel culture.&#34; They seem to think that people will gladly follow the ever-growing list of arbitrary rules indefinitely.If I were a betting man, I&#39;d predict a resurgence in punk attitudes in about 2025 or 2030. At some point, the dam will break and people will stop caring. I already get a sense that the 13-19 generation is a bit tired of it."</p>

I’ve accidentally reported tons of people as spam because of this stupid Messages experience, and I can only guess that I’ve reported my own wife so many times from clearing all of my Messages conversations that they disabled her Messages account.The support tech had the gall to tell me they’d reactivate her account as a one-time exception, and I practically wanted to kill the guy over the phone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Now that I work for a big evil corporation, I have some insights on why these inexplicably evil things happen. Fun at parties, I know. Not excusing it, just shedding light for anyone interested in the systems perspective.&gt;It appears as though charges from Apple are specialThis is exactly right. You offer branded cards because interchange fees are expensive. You want people who buy your stuff to pay you by ACH. That&#39;s not practical at the point of sale, but it is practical if you frame it as the monthly payment on your store-brand credit card. Charges at the store on the store-brand card are always special. That&#39;s why the cards are offered.From a merchant&#39;s perspective, anyone who buys something is really taking out a loan. In most cases such a loan will be settled by the customer&#39;s card issuer, less the interchange fee. In the case of a branded card, it will be settled by the customer directly and in full. In either case, if this doesn&#39;t happen on time, the customer&#39;s account with the merchant is now in arrears.Most of the time this happens, the &#34;customer&#34; is farming stolen credit card numbers for resalable goods. You are never going to find these people, let alone rehabilitate them and settle up. So the &#34;hey, you did a lot of chargebacks to us, what the hell?&#34; state is not user friendly. It&#39;s scorched earth. I would be cautious about signing into any other Apple accounts on devices that have been associated with yours."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked for an SVP at Apple as an “entrepreneur in residence” from 2016-2019.Apple’s best-of-the-worst products now suck in a million subtle ways; and they’ve become so complex that they suck in  different ways for each user so we can’t even band together behind a single complaint.The root cause is the lack of a “fuck no, fix that shit” product CEO who puts customer experience above all else. Without one, it has become a very typical big company bureaucracy. The engine is still firing on all cylinders but nobody is at the wheel anymore.It’s hard to diagnose from the outside with Apple because 1. there’s a shroud of mystery/secrecy, 2. boatloads of cash keep smart people on hand and create some very genuine technical supremacy (e.g. M1) and 3. even a broken “new product innovation” clock is right twice a day when it sprays $20b into R&amp;D every year (AirPods, maybe AR someday, etc).But true, earth-shattering category-defining innovation at today’s Apple is incredibly inefficient at best and structurally impossible at worst – not to mention the hardest type of innovation which consists of simplifying software, slashing the complexity of product lines, and thereby fixing whole categories of bugs with a few powerful swings of the sword. (E.g. fucking fix and unify Apple ID/iTunes/FindMy/etc ... today ... not next year).And, in my opinion, their monopoly/oligopoly/[whatever] status, cash hoarding, and domineering attitude over the devices in a billion peoples’ pockets are largely preventing the greater market from innovating and competing with them.We should break up any company in the $1T range (inflation adjust by making a rule based on % GDP?) into ten $100B companies, by force of legislation. It won’t fix the problem but it would at least create some sunlight through the canopy for new trees to grow.It’s the case at all Big Tech companies. Time to break them up. https://paygo.media/p/25171[ ... or if not that, can I at least get USB-C on my iPhone so I can stop carrying two cables? :’( ]"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is definitely the most reasonable case I&#39;ve heard made from this argument, and it&#39;s changed my stance on the issue.That said, I feel the cryptography project handled this poorly. I encountered the issue when one day, installing a Python Ansible module the same way I did the day before required a compiler for a different language that I&#39;ve never used before and that is hardly used, if at all, in the rest of my stack. The Ansible project seemed to be taken by surprise, and eventually  I found the root upstream issue, where the initial attitude was &#34;too bad&#34;. Some people making those comments worked for Red Hat / IBM, Ansible is heavily backed by that. What company cares more about Linux on S390 than Red Hat / IBM? I would suggest none. So the fact that they had this attitude and community reaction to me suggests the problem is not one of expecting free work for a corporation on a non-free architecture. It was IMHO a combination of a lack of forethought, communication, and yes, perhaps a change that is overdue and will just be a little painful. The suggestion to maintain an LTS release while people figure out how to proceed is the right move."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I do think that we&#39;re going to see more of this. This is just a relatively early example. Rust and LLVM bring things to the table that make them inevitable if we as an ecosystem, on the whole, value privacy and security. This is where the rubber of the ethos hits the road. C for all it&#39;s good work and history, is a leaky mess and the source of so many zero-days, especially the bad bad state actor level ones.If we are to move to a more abstracted and safer system, the ideas behind LLVM are just going to be a fact of life in years to come. The solution to this is to either fund greater LLVM integration (or similar that isn&#39;t on the scene yet) or accept the status-quo. I choose the former, but I sincerely hope the future direction leaves as few out in the cold as possible through the effort of smart people. But protecting hobbyists is a stretch goal in my mind compared to improving the security and privacy of the global interconnected world we&#39;re in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Don&#39;t know about crypto. But any open source package, ported to a new environment (one not explicitly tested by the maintainter) is going to have issues. That&#39;s the nature of software.E.g. I just added pnglib to an embedded assembly. Has a display among other things. Wanted to put compressed PNG images into (limited) flash, then decompress into (plentiful) RAM at boot.Of course pnglib didn&#39;t build for my environment. Never mind it has a C library. There are 50+ compile switches in pnglib, and I was setting them in a pattern that wasn&#39;t part of the tested configurations. It didn&#39;t even compile. Once it compiled (after some source changes) it didn&#39;t run. More source changes and it would run until it hit some endianness issues. Fix those, and it would do (just) what I wanted, which was to decompress certain PNG image formats with limited features, once.No problem. That was my goal, achieved. But at no time did I blame the maintainers for not anticipating my use case.I would say this: maintainers, flag compile-time options that aren&#39;t tried both ways in your test environments. To give me some chance of estimating how hard my job is going to be."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is absolutely unbelievable (and unforgivable) that a cash cow such as GTA V has a problem like this present for over 6 years and it turns out to be something so absolutely simple.I do not agree with the sibling comment saying that this problem only looks simple and that we are missing context.This online gamemode alone made $1 billion in 2017 alone.Tweaking two functions to go from a load time of 6 minutes to less than two minutes is something any developer worth their salt should be able to do in a codebase like this equipped with a good profiler.Instead, someone with no source code managed to do this to an obfuscated executable loaded with anti-cheat measures.The fact that this problem is caused by Rockstar&#39;s excessive microtransaction policy (the 10MB of JSON causing this bottleneck are all available microtransaction items) is the cherry on top.(And yes, I might also still be salty because their parent company unjustly DMCA&#39;d re3 (https://github.com/GTAmodding/re3), the reverse engineered version of GTA III and Vice City. A twenty-year-old game. Which wasn&#39;t even playable without purchasing the original game.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Holy cow, I&#39;m a very casual gamer, I was excited about the game but when it came out I decided I don&#39;t want to wait that long and I&#39;ll wait until they sort it out. 2 years later it still sucked. So I abandoned it. But.. this... ?! This is unbelievable. I&#39;m certain that many people left this game because of the waiting time. Then there are man-years wasted (in a way different than desired).Parsing JSON?! I thought it was some network game logic finding session magic. If this is true that&#39;s the biggest WTF I saw in the last few years and we&#39;ve just finished 2020.Stunning work just having binary at hand. But how could R* not do this? GTAV is so full of great engineering. But if it was a CPU bottleneck then who works there that wouldn&#39;t just be irked to try to nail it? I mean it seems like a natural thing to try to understand what&#39;s going on inside when time is much higher than expected even in the case where performance is not crucial. It was crucial here. Almost directly translates to profits. Unbelievable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is why I come to HN,  I was going to skip this because I thought it was about video games, but really glad to have read it, and loved every line of the article.So much to get from this.Even if you don&#39;t have the source, you can make a change if you are annoyed enough.If you don&#39;t like something, and the source code is out there, really go contribute.Performance matters, know how to profile and if using an external dependency, then figure out their implementation details.Algorithms &amp; Data structures matter, often I see devs talking about how it doesn&#39;t matter much but the difference between using a hashmap vs array is evident.Attentive code reviews matter, chances are they gave this to a junior dev/intern, and it worked with a small dataset and no one noticed."</p>

Although as others have pointed out I wouldn&#39;t consider it exactly elegant (IIUC basically shell script to morph it on first run on nix); Nor exactly ground breaking with the fat-binary-like concept, if you don&#39;t use platform specific libraries or calls anyway, cross compile works just fine? What&#39;s the use case here? I mean for platforms where performance or size overhead of vm-based languages is a problem, you probably don&#39;t want it to include extra code for other platforms anyway?OTOH Blinkenlights looks really nice tho. I&#39;ve see a dude live hand editing code page 417 with notepad.exe to change a jmp so it doesn&#39;t look for a CD with my own eyes ;)Always admire hackers of this rank. I think Blinkenlights could help me achieve something similar someday if I allocate bandwidth to it, would spend lots of time to play with it."</p>

Even having to wait for your TV&#39;s OS to boot up when you turn it on is a terrible UX.However, when it comes to buying a TV for your conference room where you have a TV running 12hrs/day (when you&#39;re not a small startup with 10ppl), invest in a proper commercial TV like NEC or (my personal favorite brand) iiyama: 1) the&#39;re dumb TVs from the start, 2) you get proper warranties and support, 3) you can get larger TVs without 4K HDR (which your computer may not support anyway), 4) the color grading is more apt for your PowerPoint slides, etc and finally, 5) these panels are actually rated for that kind of use and won&#39;t break after a few weeks.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s the correct decision (although Facebook likely only cares about its bottom line). the YPG is designated as a terrorist organisation by the Turkish state and it&#39;s quite obvious that Turkey will want to exercise sovereignty over its communication channels rather than letting an opposing military force broadcast freely to its citizens.It&#39;s not really the job of a private company to undermine nations in this way for simple reasons of sovereignty, and because even if Facebook were to somehow win in the short term, the five to ten year consequence would probably be that nations like Turkey decouple entirely and take control over communications back a la Russia or China."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My observation is that much of industry does not care about any of these technical or security issues.In theory microservices are technical artifacts, but what they tend to be are cultural artifacts.Microservice adoption is often driven by cargo culting, or (better) a considered decision to work around a lack of organisational cohesion.What microservices let you do is ship your org chart directly, and also map back from some functionality to an owning team. You know who to page when there&#39;s a problem and it&#39;s easier to tell who is late delivering and whose code is slow. In cultures with &#34;lax&#34; technical leadership (aka no everyone uses same thing mandate, I&#39;m not judging) it lets teams use their favourite tools, for better or worse.Other org related things are the ability to have independent (per team) release schedules. Separable billing. Ability to get metrics on performance, cost and failures that can be used as indicators of team performance and promotion material. Microservices can also act as &#34;firewalls&#34;, limiting the impact a bad hire or team can have across your codebase.None of this is intended to be negative judgement; microservices can (among other things), help teams feel a sense of agency and ownership that can be hard to maintain as org size scales up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO this is a confused take on modularity. I think isolation and security are related concepts, but not what modules are for. Those things have to follow module boundaries, but they&#39;re not the goal of modules. For me, modules are about understanding; in order to use this code you don&#39;t need to read all of it, you just need to understand the interface. Modularity is for humans, not computers.They do often follow Conway&#39;s law, but that&#39;s not a desirable thing. Most modules are outside of that kind of context -- they&#39;re in libraries written by people you don&#39;t communicate with at all!I&#39;m interested in people&#39;s opinion here. I&#39;m also planning an article on the relationship between services and modularity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found this to be surprisingly interesting and novel - usually I expect to see really low quality content when it&#39;s a post about microservices, whether for or against the idea. This boils it down to isolation, which I myself have written about in a similar vein[0].&gt; at this point security people simply don&#39;t believe that any of the following (each one the very best technology available at the time) is totally safeTo be fair, we don&#39;t think anything is totally safe :) that&#39;s the point. Actually a lot of those things listed are why Chrome is so secure. I think this is a bit pessimistic about process isolation, which is actually quite powerful, but I get the point - there&#39;s no gap like an air gap.I prefer to think of monoliths and microservices as being completely unrelated ideas - they aren&#39;t on a spectrum of &#34;big to small&#34;, they&#39;re just two totally different ways of approaching software development. I might put &#34;monoliths&#34; closer to SOA, in that they both describe a very basic approach to a problem, whereas Microservices is not &#34;small services&#34; it&#39;s about bounded contexts, patterns, organizations, etc.Anyways, I appreciated this post.[0] https://www.graplsecurity.com/post/architecting-for-performa..."</p>

Suspending trading doesn&#39;t fix the problem for that person, now they&#39;re just stuck in a bad position.  Does the SEC ever &#34;fix it&#34; for that person, or is it all damage control now to reduce the extent of the problem, and those that are already in are kind of screwed?"</p>

So, like:1. Search for something (either using / or *).2. Type ”cgn” in Normal mode (i.e. change next search match) and replace what you searched for with whatever3. Hammer on ”.” (i.e. repeat last command) to replace other matches.This replaces, like, 97% of uses of :s and is a much more convenient way to do search/replace, especially if you use * to search for the word under the cursor.

It will include key stakeholders/users/integrations, key technologies/protocols, key services/components and the high-level system landscape with key internal and external systems.Notice that a good diagram for this mixes a lot of different views and formal notations.The key idea is that you should strive to provide a skeleton on which your audience can place their understanding and fill in the blanks that they are interested in based on you explanation.If you try to put everything there or follow a formal model like UML you will drown out the key concepts in the noise of the details."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is neat.  I decided to diff two pods in a replicated Kubernetes service.  It seemed that it was going to take forever to run, so I just wrote a short Go program to do the same thing (load two JSON files into a map[string]interface{}, cmp.Diff them) while it was going:https://gist.github.com/jrockway/73982949b3d2ce9b443528042c4...My program runs in less than 10 milliseconds (/usr/bin/time reports 0.00 seconds), and graphtage takes 5 minutes and 17 seconds.  I&#39;m 317,000x faster!  (Not including the time to write the program; if you do that, then it&#39;s about even assuming graphtage took 0 seconds to write.)Graphtage prints the entire file in JQ colors, with diffs inside fields colored red and green, which I love:    ...
    &#34;hostIP&#34;: &#34;10.136.13̟9̟2̶1̶.139̟1̶&#34;,
    &#34;podIP&#34;: &#34;10.244.1.18̟6̟7̶&#34;,
    ...

(My terminal can&#39;t display the dots under the numbers and the strikethrough, but it looks great on HN!  I really love it.)My program produces relatively boring line-by-line diffs:    -               &#34;hostIP&#34;:    string(&#34;10.136.121.131&#34;),
    +               &#34;hostIP&#34;:    string(&#34;10.136.139.139&#34;),

    +               &#34;podIP&#34;:     string(&#34;10.244.1.186&#34;),

Honestly, I get what I want out of mine, and wait 317,000x less time, so... I probably won&#39;t be using this on a daily basis.  But I will be stealing those dots and Unicode strikethroughs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s insanely cool to see a non-IM use case built out on top of Matrix appearing (almost) out of the blue - congratulations :)The implementation currently freestyles a bit on the event format for the messages, which is somewhat our fault on the Matrix team for running horrifically late on MSC1767 (https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc176...) which proposes how to do rich custom event formats (e.g. blog posts) which are still renderable and visible to more generic Matrix clients (e.g. Element).  As a result, if you join a Hummingbard conversation via another Matrix client currently you can&#39;t see all the messages (or vice versa). However am hoping that Hummingbard might be a trailblazer for actually exercising MSC1767 in the wild and knocking it into shape, which would hugely benefit the whole Matrix ecosystem :)In terms of licenses, it depend on how you want the project to be used.  If you want folks to run it for personal use as a decentralised social network, I&#39;d personally go GPLv3 or AGPLv3.  If you want commercial folks to be able to build on it too, then Apache is probably the best bet.  copyleft + proprietary dual licensing is another option, but means you&#39;d need any contributors to agree to the dual licensing (could be tricky), and could be seen as not being in the spirit of the GPL.  that said, IANAL, YMMV.(At the risk of going somewhat off topic, another exciting Matrix client also appeared today: https://github.com/pixlwave/Watch-The-Matrix - the first native Matrix client for Apple Watch. https://youtu.be/Jh9iewrBdGQ)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What does it look like to actually write a program ontop of Matrix? Eg i have a key value store that i&#39;d like to use Matrix (or IPFS/etc) for the P2P layer. Is it a lot like IRC channels that you connect to, pushing data into them and getting data out from other clients in the same channel?Ie is it a series of messages? Or is it something more advanced; with built in conflict resolution or other P2P-y features?"</p>

You can have 24h clock, but then you have a comma as decimal separator, etc.Can we add a country &#34;Saneland&#34; with the sensible options for all fields? cause that&#39;s where I want to be from.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Around 20 years ago, I had the opportunity to listen to a member of Nasdaq top management talk about the stock market. It&#39;s all a _tiny_ bit blurry, being a long time ago, but I remember how he talked about three different perspectives for investing in stock:First, the &#34;company perspective&#34;. An investor would buy stock in a company they believed in. Maybe they had good products, or good management, or something else. The idea was looking at the how well the company would perform.Second, the &#34;stock perspective&#34;. An investor would ignore the underlying company, but look at the stock itself. It didn&#39;t really matter if the company was doing good, but only if the stock itself had good potential. The idea was looking at how well the stock would perform.Finally, the &#34;game perspective&#34;. An investor would not really care about the stock, but only about the behavior of other investors. Day trading would be the example here, profiting mainly on marketplace dynamics, no matter the stock. The idea was looking at how to be a better player than the others.Then he talked about how the game perspective was the only model that really matched the marketplace, and how the stock market had evolved from being place where people would invest in companies, to a place where they would play a game with other peopl."</p>

Top poker players are still gambling, but have an excellent understanding of the risks. Their skill doesn&#39;t turn them into investors. Gambling is taking a high risk bet. Whether the expected pay off is high enough to justify the risk and whether you can afford to lose the bet is a separate issue."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is only scratching the surface of the question.For interest, there&#39;s a very common negative expected value bet that almost everyone is required to make: insurance.We don&#39;t consider that gambling, in fact we often tell our parents to buy some when they fly on holiday.Why? The answer touches on the lottery.We care about not just the average case, we care about what might happen.Regarding Kelly criterion, there&#39;s a good reason why people don&#39;t used exactly the amount it says. If you look at the risk, ie the chance your probability is wrong, there&#39;s a chance you are overbetting."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the hardest thing about being a parent today is the constant shame and confusion about the “right” way to do it. We don’t live in a hunter gatherer society anymore, we just don’t. There’s lots of wisdom in that way of life, and sure we could learn from it — but there’s enough anxiety as it is, parents don’t need more of it.We have three kids and we sleep trained them. (Not a pediatrician, standard disclaimer.) This article calls it an ‘extreme’ practice. For us, ‘extreme’ was the sleep deprivation we experienced with baby number one as we tried every ‘no cry’ method in the book. The baby cried and cried and cried. Once we started sleep training, there was a bit of crying and then - a sleeping baby! Through the night! Total amount of crying went from hours to zero. The kid became happier — they weren’t sleep-deprived anymore. And neither were we. I no longer felt like I was going to drop the ball due to extreme exhaustion.Babies two and three had the benefit of our experience, and they barely cried at all. The third one would lay down eyes-open and fall asleep. “So it actually does happen! — I thought the books must be lying.”By all objective measures our kids are happy, healthy, and well-adjusted. But that doesn’t mean we still don’t get the stink eye from people who think it’s a cruel practice.Just raise your kids with love. Be compassionate, and patient. Find a doctor you trust. Don’t let people add to an already stressful endeavor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Of all the &#34;weird&#34; things we do as parents in euro/anglo nations, sleeping arrangements seems nowhere near the top.IMO, the top &#34;offender&#34; is over-scheduling kid&#39;s activities. So many kids in my area have their days booked solid with sports, academic tutoring, music lessons.  Approaching zero free time to enjoy being a kid.Edit - and this isn&#39;t really a western thing, &#34;Tiger Mom&#34; and similar probably pre-dates this behavior in the US."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Speaking as a parent of 5. Parental mental health has a much bigger effect on the child than choice of methodologies. You really need to look after yourself before you can look after them - so if you are suffering from sleep deprivation, doing what you have to do is the right thing to do.Put your own oxygen mask on first."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I commend Firefox for trying to do this... but it worries me.3 obvious holes:- Proliferation of dialogs. When you don&#39;t know whether a site will suddenly break or not, standard users will be implicitly trained to say yes to all dialogs.- Domain &#34;homogenizing&#34; (spoofing) services will win. Trackers that offer a widget you can install on your server will win. Facebook et all will still know where they sent you, and will be able to track you server side. If mozilla provide a centralized whitelist, then SSO providers who also provide trackers will win. Essentially, the big players will find a way, the little players (who users weren&#39;t worried about anyway) will still lose.- The web will break. SSO will be broken for a good couple of months on over 50% of websites using it - possibly more. &#34;This only works in Google Chrome&#34; will become more and more popular. Potentially, Firefox doesn&#39;t have the market share to make this work.Those of us who will stick with Firefox regardless are in for a world of pain, and not a lot of gain. I guess it&#39;s necessary to move the web on, but the pessimist in me doesn&#39;t see that happening any time soon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think what you want is essentially an entirely fresh browser session for every website you visit. Pretty mind-boggling to what lengths we need to go in order to prevent companies from tracking us. That said most tracking companies seem to have devised strategies to construct fingerprints from data like IP addresses, user-agent strings and any other meta-data they can get their hands on, so the next step will probably be to restrict what kind of information can be learned about the browser environment via JS (e.g. getting exact screen resolution).Also, data exfiltration via browser extensions is still not a solved problem, there are very popular extensions (Ghostery for example) that are highly privileged in the browser and often collect a ridiculous amount of data. Really can&#39;t get my head around why browser vendors still allow that while being so strict on all other forms of tracking."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This needs to be bypassed to use SSO, to bypass it the SSO providers site will need to ask for Storage Access, in some cases the user will be asked for permission…“After the user has granted access, Firefox will remember the storage permission for 30 days.”So lay users will get used to just clicking through and blindly granting the permission.The end result will be an additional step for trackers, and a bunch of headaches for all the legit services that get broken from this change.I’m all for less tracking but this doesnt seem like a good solution."</p>

I&#39;m so shocked that I&#39;m logging in to comment after 5 years of lurking.Justine has built a c library that allows you compile a binary once and have it run it on any os or baremetal. The SAME binary. Quite frankly, that sentence doesn&#39;t even make sense to me.Check out https://storage.googleapis.com/justine/cosmopolitan/index.ht...As far as I&#39;m concerned, this is literal magic. Look at the magic numbers: 
https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/37a4c70c3634862d8d...I could go on, but there&#39;s no binary portability comparison with any other language. And she has made some pretty neat optimizations.Back in the day, I saw some pretty neat stuff with the ELF format, but this takes the cake.Wow.Edit:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I absolutely love reading Justine&#39;s code. It comes up from time to time here and it just makes me happy. It reminds me of the passage from &#34;Programming Sucks&#34; by Still Drinking [1]  Every programmer occasionally, when nobody’s home, turns off the lights, pours a glass of scotch, puts on some light German electronica, and opens up a file on their computer. It’s a different file for every programmer. Sometimes they wrote it, sometimes they found it and knew they had to save it. They read over the lines, and weep at their beauty, then the tears turn bitter as they remember the rest of the files and the inevitable collapse of all that is good and true in the world.

  This file is Good Code. It has sensible and consistent names for functions and variables. It’s concise. It doesn’t do anything obviously stupid. It has never had to live in the wild, or answer to a sales team. It does exactly one, mundane, specific thing, and it does it well. It was written by a single person, and never touched by another. It reads like poetry written by someone over thirty.

Her work is always just a little bit trippy in a good way haha.[1] http://stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Unless I am reading this incorrectly, I think this paragraph better summerizes the article versus the headline:&#34;In this case, Google is accused of relying on pieces of its code within websites that use its analytics and advertising services to scrape users’ supposedly private browsing history and send copies of it to Google’s servers. Google makes it seem like private browsing mode gives users more control of their data, Amanda Bonn, a lawyer representing users, told Koh. In reality, “Google is saying there’s basically very little you can do to prevent us from collecting your data, and that’s what you should assume we’re doing,” Bonn said.&#34;It doesn&#39;t seem like the complaint is that Chrome collects data on you in &#34;Incognito&#34; mode, rather that websites (e.g. Google Analytics) still collect on you in &#34;Incognito&#34; mode."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People often defend companies with explanations of how the world is, when common folk often expect (or just want) the world to behave differently.Is it unreasonable to want, or even expect, an incognito window to disable all forms of tracking?Wouldn&#39;t the world be far better if a phone alerted me to an app scanning my local area network or contacts? Or if I got warnings when it took such actions?I think us tech folks need to, collectively, stop defending companies reasoning and explanations for the world they created, and start standing with and for a world which matches common folks expectations. It really seems like a better world.---EDIT: Ask what the layperson would think tracking is! Imagining the answer is pretty simple &#34;a website [or the web at large] learning or remembering anything about me.&#34; If we start from there, rather than the mumbo-jumbo thrown at us, we can make progress."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate tracking as much as the next person, but a simple reading of the &#34;You&#39;ve gone incognito&#34; screen ought to make obvious that its primary purpose is to hide your activity from others who use the same device. It&#39;s literally written on the first line:&#34;Now you can browse privately, and other people who use this device won&#39;t see your activity.&#34;It goes on to list other technical specifics about what is not saved, but those are pretty much just sub-points. I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s fair to expect Incognito to do something it&#39;s not meant to do."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I work on a 3-person DevOps team that just finished migrating ~20 services from GCE vms running docker-compose to GKE.It&#39;s taken us a little over a year. Partly because K8s has a steep learning curve, but also because safely transitioning services without disrupting product teams adds a lot of overhead.The investment is already yielding great returns. Developers are happy. Actual quote: &#34;Kubernetes is the biggest quality-of-life improvement I&#39;ve experienced in my career.&#34;The same is true for me as a DevOps engineer. I never have to write a script to orchestrate a rolling deployment ever again. I&#39;ll never have to touch Puppet or wrangle OS upgrades. I no longer need to use Terraform to scale out a service.Now that we&#39;ve completed this transition, one of my goals for the next year is to get the team to a place where we spend 75% of our time on higher-level projects -- working on developer tools and Kubernetes extensions and setting site reliability standards, instead of the firefighting and operational work that has traditionally taken up so much of our time. Couldn&#39;t be happier about this change.... That is until management decides we&#39;re overhead and fires us to free up budget for feature developers. ;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I understand their rationale. We manage thousand Kubernetes clusters and end-users can find lots and lots of creative way to shoot themselves in the foot:- I can store anything in a secret? Let&#39;s have thousands of cat images. Etcd then stops working because we have over 2GB of funny cats in the key store.- I can run a root Pod? Lets mount the docker socket and start building images with it. Oh and by the way, I never clean those up and my Node simply fills up. Also I add some additional docker networks that break Pod to Pod networks.- Istio is nice - why we don&#39;t add automatic injection for Pods in all namespaces? Including kube-system? And then they brick kube-proxy and the cluster stops working.- I can use validating webhooks for better security? Lets watch on all resources. To keep it more secure lets set the failure policy of the webhook to Fail, so we never admit any modification without the apiserver to make a call to out webhook. Whats that? My single replica webhook has was evicted from the Pod (we didn&#39;t add any resource requests and limits) and now it cannot even be created or scheduled because kube-controller-manager and kube-scheduler cannot update their lease and they lost leadership and now are idling, effectively bricking the entire cluster.Google would reduce the pain points with this change, however they would still face countless other issues with Kubernetes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember trying out docker sometime back in late 2013. Something about it never fully stuck with me. I always felt like the final boundary for a piece software should be the process, not the computer. Plopping an entire VM into a zipfile and saying &#34;here&#39;s your software&#34; felt like lazy engineering to many of us at the time (and still today).For our current stack, the answer has been to make the entire business application run as a single process. We also use a single (mono) repository because it is a natural fit with the grain of the software.As far as I am aware, there is no reason a single process cannot exploit the full resources of any computer. Modern x86 servers are ridiculously fast, as long as you can get at them directly. AspNetCore + SQLite (properly tuned) running on a 64 core Epyc serving web clients using Kestrel will probably be sufficient for 99.9% of business applications today. You can handle millions of simultaneous clients without blinking. Who even has that many total customers right now?Horizonal scalability is simply a band-aid for poor engineering in most (not all) applications. The poor engineering, in my experience, is typically caused by underestimating how fast a single x86 thread is and exploring the concurrent &amp; distributed computing rabbit hole from there. It is a rabbit hole that should go unexplored, if ever possible.Here&#39;s a quick trick if none of the above sticks: If one of your consultants or developers tells you they can make your application faster by adding a bunch of additional computers, you are almost certainly getting taken for a ride."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have thoughts, and I agree but also disagree a bit.We are in the dark-ages with respect to streaming sockets, and I am the architect of one of the worlds largest WebSocket and streaming services.First off, unseating the operational benefits provided by request response is a huge challenge. It&#39;s possible, and I&#39;ve done it. One of these days, my co-authors and I will present an OSDI paper with the broad strokes. It&#39;s very easy to list a lot of the challenges with scaling WebSocket, but each of them can be solved.I believe we will have a nicer world with QUIC --&gt; Http/3 and the up and coming WebTransport discussion. SADLY, that will result in a decade long &#34;caniuse&#34; issue, so we should expect to see WebTransport polyfills to arrive...Second, HTML over WebSockets is nice, but what is better is reactive data binding over the socket. Let the browser maintain a DOM tree that templates over a JSON object, then reactive-ly update and it&#39;s an amazing experience. You have minimal data transfer, and minimal rendering updates. There is a great deal of power in having your UI be a stateless function over a giant JSON object.Finally, the big challenge is dealing with the server state in a meaningful way. The exceptionally nice property of using request response for everything is the shared-nothing stateless nature of the web server. It&#39;s exceptionally forgiving in both operational and developer issues.It&#39;s very easy to fuck up the implicit state tied to the connection, and this requires discipline to get right. It&#39;s very easy to ship unreliable software that then has issues based on the connection.Now, I&#39;m a HUGE believer in that we need to use streams for everything, but it requires a mind shift. The key thing to tackle is dealing with the server side state, and this is where I have my shitty idea of a programming language for board games. In essence, I am building a DIY database such that people connect directly to the database and get that sweet giant JSON object along with a stream of updates.The DIY part is related to the fact that I invented a programming language to transact on the JSON object such that you get all the benefits of durability with the mental model of working within a single machine.http://www.adama-lang.org/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems like X Windows protocol over HTTPS with JSON as the wire encoding.It&#39;s sad to think how much effort is spent reimplementing technologies because the IPv4 address space wasn&#39;t large enough.If IP address space were larger, we wouldn&#39;t have needed to rely on Network Address Translation (NAT). NAT became a poor-man&#39;s firewall and effectively blocked peer-to-peer connections making it difficult to host a server at home. This incentivized early ISPs to offer only asymmetric connections that pushed users towards a consumer-only service that crippled early Internet protocols. With the World Wide Web being &#34;the&#34; reason people got on to the Internet in the first place, early NAT-enabled routers focused only on HTTP tunneling, so completed protocols that required inbound connections were finally killed off.Who would have thought that a small IP address space could result in a mass protocol extinction event from which only HTTP and HTML would survive...."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seams really optimistic and kind of glosses over the subject of scaling out websocket connections apart from this.Anecdotally, the typical single Rails server process seems to be perfectly happy supporting nearly 4,000 active connections. And you can easily swap in the excellent AnyCable to bump that up to around 10,000+ connections per node by not relying on the built-in Ruby WebSocket server.That&#39;s not a lot of connections on it&#39;s own.  If you are implementing a chat service you&#39;ll still need some form of pub/sub (or something) to glue all of that together when users connect to disparate nodes.AlsoHow about client-side validations? Easy. On every input change, round up the form values and send ’em down the WebSocket.That&#39;s just server side validation.As a disclaimer, I haven&#39;t used any of the HTML over WS frameworks the author discusses, but I&#39;ve spent a fair amount of time dealing with scaling socket connections.  It definitely makes the question of scaling horizontally more challenging.  I feel like this article really glosses over that aspect."</p>

You end up thinking of models like clay that you can shape and paint, not triangles with textures.Please, someone, somewhere, spend five years making that an open source project. (Realistically, it&#39;s a bit melancholy that such a project probably won&#39;t ever get made; there&#39;s no incentive to. ZBrush exists, and it has a fine price point.

It&#39;s insane to me that Visa and Mastercard have basically positioned themselves as exclusive middlemen on the vast majority of digital transactions, in an age when so much commerce necessarily is digital.It offers privacy that Visa / PayPal / etc cannot.It makes income traceable in a way that bitcoin does not, to facilitate lawful taxation.It is inherently scalable in a way that bitcoin arguably is not (bitcoin has offchain scaling mechanisms, sure, but if you&#39;re being honest it&#39;s a stretch)It&#39;s not introducing a new currency or coin that will be endlessly speculated on, unlike most every crypto solution out there (even stablecoins rely on eth or others for transaction fees)"</p>

The coin was introduced in 1518 in the Holy Roman Empire and many currencies in Europe became named after the Thaler. The Dutch brought their “leeuwendaler” (lit. lion daler) coin to New Netherlands (now New York), lending its name to the US Dollar. I presume Taler was used for this project to match modern German orthography and to avoid confusion with the English ‘th’ ‹θ› sound.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar#Historyhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A1chymov"</p>

We very much want to believe, but it&#39;s going to take a full Ars Technica teardown before we&#39;re completely convinced.Although we&#39;re skeptical, we are hopeful—the fledgling company does have a pretty solid pedigree. Framework founder Nirav Patel was Oculus VR&#39;s head of hardware from 2012 to 2017, and he was a Facebook director of engineering beyond that. The company&#39;s team also includes design, engineering, and operations people hailing from Apple, Google, and Lenovo."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t see any mention of the firmware and drivers efforts for this. Firmware and drivers always end up more difficult to deal with than expected.The Fairphone company was surprised by difficulties upgrading and patching android without support from their BSP vendor, causing many months delays of updates _and_ years shorter support life than they were planning for their earlier models.I purchased the Purism Librem 13 laptop from their kickstarter, and they had great plans for firmware and drivers, but also great difficulty following through. The trackpad chosen for the first models took much longer than expected to get upstream linux support, and it was never great (it turned out to be impossible to reliably detect their variant automatically). They finally hired someone with sufficient skill to do the coreboot port _months_ after initial units were delivered, and delivered polished coreboot firmware for their initial laptops _years_ after they started the kickstarter.So, why should we have confidence in the firmware and drivers that Framework will deliver :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interestingly it was very clear at around $10MM ARR that DO was on a trajectory to IPO. You can thank Moisey Uretsky for a fantastic product idea and his brother Ben for CEOing it for so long. Congratulations to everyone who was involved in building DigitalOcean, it was an INCREDIBLY wild ride in the early days, lots of chaos but through all the chaos and disfunction, I think everyone involved knew this day would come.Personally I&#39;m really proud of the work we did, and I&#39;m overjoyed to have been part of building a business that is going to be a public company.  Thanks to the HN community for being so supportive over the years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love DigitalOcean. The simplicity of their UI, friendly CLI tooling and (as a hosted k8s customer) the frequency of updates to their offerings.BUT:1. Their web UI stability is terrible (constantly hangs and errors out)2. Their hosted DB IOPS aren&#39;t competitive with other PaaS providers. There&#39;s also no way to scale DB size dynamically without upgrading to a new price tier which is overkill.3. Their Kubernetes Control Plane scaling is obfuscated. I had to contact support to realize that the control plane nodes are somehow tied to the size of your node pool when you create the cluster? That&#39;s not documented anywhere and was the cause of many control plane timeouts.4. No ALIAS dns record, no way to serve Spaces from an apex domain. (I know this is a vendor specific implementation but it&#39;s table stakes imo)Again, I&#39;m a (mostly) happy DO customer and wish them the best but if they really want to be seen on the same level as AWS or GCP in terms of some parity, they need to include some of these QoL features."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Congrats to DO.Really like the direction DO is going. Which is something in between millions of small VPS firm and giant like AWS. It also forced Linode to React. And proved the space in Cloud Hosting exist, which company like Vultr and UpCloud are now joining. And I think their features are finally close to hitting the perfect spot. With all the essential like DBaS, Object Storage and K8s.They have also ( finally ) introduced AMD EPYC CPU, ( no more explicit mention of Intel CPU on their homepage ). Which is good for their margin since price / core count are cheaper.So DO today is something I would like as an AWS competitor in 2016.  And they are finally here. I am not sure if there are any other low hanging fruit at all. Or what features I would want for a company competing at this space. It will be things that people dont see, like CPU performance, SSD Performance, Services Reliability, Interconnect, Better Network, More Locations, security improvement....There are only two suggestions I could think on top of my head right now.First is the pricing structure and list. It is getting very messy and AWS like. SSD Storage variant should be a simple calculable option, not an extra line on pricing table that tries to bombard me with extra information. And I know Basic Droplet are burst-able CPU resources, but not showing they are vCPU ( a Single Thread ) and calling them CPU doesn&#39;t really rhymes with me.Second is Full BareMetal Monthly option. Something like vultr [1] is offering. I am not sure if below $100 is feasible. Basically it  should be something that offer much better price / performance at a monthly payment that pushes people with low spending to metal for baseline load with headroom as insurance. Pushing up Average User Spending.  It should also be attractive to small business. ( Although arguably Linode and Vultr has yet to expand or launch Metal seems to suggest otherwise )[1] https://www.vultr.com/products/bare-metal/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here&#39;s a crazy idea: Don&#39;t use analytics at all but focus on your product. If your success relies solely on &#34;improving conversions&#34; by tracking your users and then changing the position and color of your &#34;Checkout&#34; button then maybe try setting yourself apart such that customers want to buy your product even despite an obnoxious purchasing flow. Only then start optimizing it.More serious thoughts: Google Analytics introduces performance overhead for your website and now you have to explain to your users which third party is responsible for processing their data on top of yourself. Why introduce those headaches? Are the insights from Analytics really valuable enough to justify the cost? I personally haven&#39;t seen it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After a recent story on HN about all the horrible tracking Disqus started to do after being acquired by an ad-tech company, I ditched it and Google Analytics on my semi-dormant personal website.  The process of fixing it got me interested in working on my site again and I ended up upstreaming the patches into the Hugo theme I use[1], so now everyone with that theme can benefit easily.  I ended up using GoatCounter[2] after examining several alternatives in the market, predominantly because it was free for personal sites, but also because it was very no-frills which is all I really needed.  I also appreciated that I could control retention rate and other configuration that might affect my visitor&#39;s privacy to collect as minimal amount of information as possible.I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with having basic site analytics, but I appreciate that there are now alternatives to Google Analytics that don&#39;t try to do the pervasive tracking that&#39;s become commonplace online.[1]: https://tristor.ro/blog/2021/02/05/ditching-google-analytics...[2]: https://www.goatcounter.com/"</p>

Amazon has installed a mailbox at their facility, this mail piece specifically says to use it.AND this mail piece says &#39;BE DONE by 3/1&#39; when workers have until the end of the month to vote (context: amazon must stop anti-union mandatory meetings etc during voting).This could be a legal violation &amp; is a big deal. I think at a minimum breaks the spirit of the NLRB mail-in voting ruling.HN seems to consider big tech = oppressive surveillance. I&#39;ll let you draw your own conclusions.This is also the latest in a long list of extreme tactics some aren&#39;t mentioned in this article. To name a few:Amazon also fired an activist who was speaking out. It&#39;s been reported Amzn has been penalizing pro-union employees with baseless and unfair management penalties/&#39;strikes&#39; and purposeful last minute over-time demands as punishment. Digital surveillance. Management basically stalking associates in break rooms, asking if they are only there to organize and attorneys and consultants drawing graph person relationship research charts to map their employees.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Full disclosure: I&#39;ve always been anti-union for my own personal approach to life. I do see the value in unions, I&#39;ve just always, to this point, been a go-it-alone-and-fight-my-own-battles kind of person. I don&#39;t want to be beholden to a union or their rules any more than I want to be beholden to an employer beyond my contractual obligations for which I&#39;m paid.That said, people should take note of what happened when Walmart used these tactics. Employees then went on to suffer such things as zero hour contracts, contracts where time was just shy of the legal requirement to give them benefits, pay was no more than the minimum required in any given state/province and people became slaves to their jobs because they couldn&#39;t afford the time off to find other jobs because then they wouldn&#39;t be able to make ends meet or there were no other jobs so Walmart had zero incentive to pay any more than absolutely required to by law. etc. etc. etc. because humanity is only afforded if legally required [which I personally find disgusting].These are tactics to prevent a coalition of employees from having their rights heard and maintained... even with this coalition someone is fighting to maintain and win your rights(!!!!!) There&#39;s something very wrong with anyone having to fight for their rights to be given, but that&#39;s another discussion. In a commercial environment that allow employers to behave this way, where the only advantage to winning your rights is in a coalition of the workforce holding employers to account, unions absolutely must not only be allowed but must also be protected.Its okay if you&#39;re bullheaded enough or within your means enough to walk away if your rights aren&#39;t given fair consideration and honoured, but if you&#39;re in a position where you&#39;re a prisoner to your job, i.e. can&#39;t afford to take time off to find another job/other income, or there are no other jobs in your area and you don&#39;t have the means to leave etc. you don&#39;t have any bargaining chip.No employer should ever have the privilege of keeping you prisoner, nor preventing you from having a means to bargain for your very right to fair treatment.Amazon needs to be severely reprimanded for this and taught a lesson about what it means to honour employees&#39; rights."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a Shopify partner through 3 years, paying 20% of my revenue to Shopify, and every time I have been in contact with &#34;partner support&#34; it has been, to put it mildly, an underwhelming experience.You have to argue your way through an army of outsourced supporters who are equipped with nothing but the public Shopify docs, until you get to a real employee who concludes it with a &#34;sorry, but we can&#39;t help&#34;.Some of my issues:1. If you&#39;re not American, you will be forced to hand over 3% of your 80% revenue cut to PayPal. (Unless your MRR cut is &gt;$30k)2. Sometimes Shopify just kills features, which merchants and partners rely on. Sure, we get a notice that the API will change - but how does that help, when there is no alternative way to achieve the removed functionality? I was lucky enough to get through to someone who knew someone at the dev team, but the response was once again &#34;sorry, you&#39;re not a priority&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They don&#39;t understand the model where SaaS businesses use Shopify as a billing channel on top of their own subscription model, it&#39;s all or nothing - they assume that anything in the app store can only use Shopify billing if the user installs via Shopify, which is fair but their billing API has glaring issues:- App Charges get added to clients bills, you&#39;re not getting paid right away (60+ days in some cases) vs getting paid instantly- If someone doesn&#39;t pay their Shopify bill, tough shit you&#39;re not getting paid- Got fraudulent accounts billing via Shopify? They can use your app then never pay anything - fun- Want to do refunds? Too bad there&#39;s no way to do it via the API you have to manually email Shopify then they apply an App Credit (not even a refund) for the customer, then you email them back- Uninstalling the Shopify App cancels billing, so you lose complete control of your normal downgrade process- Payments come via PayPal bi monthly :(There&#39;s plenty more, but you&#39;re basically losing all the upside of Stripe in exchange for the App Store promotion of your app."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hiii everyone, this is my first time posting here! I have read Hacker News sometimes but only thought about sharing my own post after seeing Manara&#39;s post (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25849054) last month. I asked them if I can share this here and they said it was a good idea. :)I’m a 19-year-old Gazan female who participated in Manara last year and got internships at Google and Repl.it. I’m so excited I will spend this summer at Google in Europe! I got lots of questions about my experience when people heard about it on Facebook so I wrote this blog post to let other young engineers in Palestine and the Middle East know how they can get into amazing companies like this too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I interviewed Dalia and a few other people referred to us by Manara at Repl.it. It was such a pleasure meeting kids that are so smart and have an insane drive.We have a really high bar for hiring at Repl.it, Dalia and the other youngsters from Palestine performed better than at least half the experienced engineers I&#39;ve interviewed in the past. We extended an offer to one Dalia&#39;s classmates and he started yesterday as an intern with high potential for full-time, as our internships usually are since we invest a lot in them.It was such a pleasure meeting you Dalia, wish you all the best. Hope to work with you in the future (maybe when we can offer US visas).P.S. We&#39;re still hiring"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"First of all - big props to Dalia. She clearly worked her behind off to earn those offers.Second - this definitely, to me, proves that Manara has a good business model. I actually don&#39;t think the fact that the Manara students are from MENA is all that important though. However, I do think that their extremely hands-on, and intensive &#34;bootcamp for FAANG interviewing&#34; model is clearly an advantage for early career technical candidates.Thinking back to my college days (in the US, mid 2010s) - we were not given any sort of class that focused on professional interviewing. The college career center was also very general, and not knowledgeable about the specifics of passing the coding interviews. The best advice I got was a recommendation from a guest lecturer to read &#34;cracking the coding interview&#34; (which to be fair, was better than nothing).As a result, the people from my school who did the best right out of the gate, were largely people who already knew people already in a FAANG roles and who could rely on that person for a referral, interview advice and practice feedback. Our school was not in SV (or anywhere close), so realistically, that was not an option for most of us. Additionally, I always applied for internships at FAANG companies while I was still a student - but never even got called in to interview - so it wasn&#39;t like I could practice that way either. I ended up doing fine for myself by accumulating a good base of practical experience from local non-FAANG companies before graduating, but I really believe my peers, and aspirational novice engineers of all backgrounds would have benefited greatly from having a hands-on course like Dalia described. I especially would love to see efforts like that extending out to under-served communities here in the US as well (native american reservations, appalachians, rust belt cities)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not much better if you end up being a GCP customer.My company has gone through 4 reps in 3 years. Every time we get a new GCP rep they just want to talk to us about &#34;expanding our use of GCP offerings&#34;. The only thing they want to talk about is starting to use BigQuery - not my business at all.I signed up for a Google Cloud Security summit, and afterwards a sales rep reached out me. It was obvious from the start they had no idea I was a gsuite or GCP customer. They then directed me to a NEW account manager (#4) even though I had been working with a different one. I had worked with the prior account rep going over our architecture to make sure everything was kosher (sustained use discounts etc). I even made them a schematic of our architecture on GCP at their request. Once I provided that to them I was met with radio silence.It&#39;s really insulting, and to me obvious they don&#39;t care about my company at all. We&#39;re looking at other options.I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if somehow this post leads to me getting an email from another rep &#34;Wanting to start over and doing things right&#34;, which will inevitably devolve into the discussion of how can I use BigQuery."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Title should maybe be switched to &#34;Google Cloud vs AWS Onboarding Comparison for YC companies&#34;.Not to say that isn&#39;t a useful article on its own, but it&#39;s hard to draw too many meaningful conclusions for the rest of us when the first line of the AWS bullet points is &#34;reach out to dedicated YC email&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to be a huge fan of GCP and bet on it to power my startup, and have come to greatly regret it.Recently, I needed to increase a CPU-limit quota from a small number (like 16 vCPUs to 64 vCPUs) - nothing crazy. In the past, the quota increase system was more or less automated and would only take a few minutes to process.This time, however, GCP denied my quota increase and forced me to schedule a call with a sales rep in order to process the quota increase. It was the biggest waste of time and kind of goes against the entire point of instant cloud resizing.It also feels like the velocity of new features, instance types, etc has slowed down dramatically in the past year. Also, while I&#39;m ranting, Google Cloud SQL is probably the worst cloud service I&#39;ve ever used  (and it costs an arm and a leg for the pleasure!)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The saddest thing about all of this IMO is they have been working on this for 14 years, and how much money was spent/wasted? Now, read about Skunkworks - they were able to build the SR71 (without supercomputers) in less than half that time and for a fraction of the cost.This isn&#39;t just planes, this seems to be everything nowadays. Fission was discovered in 1938/1939 and we dropped two bombs on Japan in 1945. No chance we could do something like that in this toxic environment of today.I know Peter Thiel is not popular here, but his conversations about technological progress seem to be spot on: we just cant build cool shit anymore. I really did want a flying car, and all I have is 140 characters and promises of AI that never come true.Maybe, you could say there are some exceptions like CRISPR, but that is TBD."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Putting aside the good-plane/bad-plane discussion, this program is the poster child for one of my pet wishes: that the costs of government programs would be expressed in $/tax-payer.  There are about 100M tax payers in the US; this program is expected to cost about $1,500,000M; so the F35 program is expected to cost about $15,000 per tax payer.  True: that&#39;s over 50 years; still, un-discounted, that&#39;s $300/year/tax-payer.The Covid bailout last year was about $60,000 per tax payer (https://www.covidmoneytracker.org/).  How much of your $60,000 did you see?I&#39;m not arguing for or against these programs; I&#39;m arguing for expressing them in comprehensible terms.  $6,000,000,000,000 societal total; or $60,000 for you.  Do you expect to receive $15,000 of value from the F35 program?  I&#39;m not sure I won&#39;t: perhaps it&#39;ll keep oil/energy prices stable and I spent well more than $300/year on energy..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“The F-35 has failed” is a strong statement that depends on what your definition of success is. Did it fail because it couldn’t replace the F-16? Did it fail because it’s expensive and bloated?Do those things even matter?I’m not defending the F-35 but anyone deeply and intimately familiar with the platform knows and understands that it is a Ferrari. You don’t bring your Acura TSX to a Formula 1 race track to win a race. Just like you don’t bring your Ferrari to the farm to haul material (not anymore anyways).The F-35 may be a Ferrari; but the thing about Ferraris is that their technology trickles down. Now we have electric cars with carbon fiber shells. The same is true for the F-35. The technology inside it has and will lead to the resurrection and long standing use of older planes like the B1 and U2. Where the airframe is solid but the tech and stealth is not. It will also lead to revolutionary new planes which are cheaper to make and build.Through the F35s use of distributed computing and treating hardware components and their software as services, we’re not going to be doomed to the same fate as the F16 where we can’t find hardware. Instead, we’ll have more component oriented aircraft systems where each aircraft is no bespoke and can use from a menu of technologies.So did the F35 fail because we spent too much? Depends on how much it saves us later.Did it fail because it didn’t replace the F16? What if it makes the F16 viable again? Did it still fail?Some may see this as a slippery slope. What matters is the objective outcome that comes from this project. Not the success criteria some folks have perpetuated or thrust upon the project."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lots of nostalgia about Fry’s here. Well, I have a different take. Fry’s was my first job, and my first introduction to wage slavery. They never at any point cared about employee health or well-being. Breaks were the state minimum. Pay was the state minimum. The entire staff (and there were hundreds back in the day, when the checkout line would back up into the store even with 20 registers open) shared one 7x7 beige break room. It looked like something from Prison Architect, just an old tube TV with bent bunny ears (you weren’t allowed to turn it on though, it was for training) and the stale smell of cigarette smoke. Knowledge was irrelevant, it was all about sales. SPIFs (bounty-style sales commissions) and revenue ruled the day. Aside from that, the owners didn’t care; cliques and in-groups ruled hiring and firing in the absence of leadership. Stores were always falling apart even when they were new. I don’t think anything over 7’ up was ever dusted; even 20 years ago, it was so thick in some places you couldn’t see the paint. The repair bar employees would regularly rifle through customers’ hard drivers and keep the juciest pictures.Just another cynical retail empire, pumped hard and drained dry by its owners while the foundation rotted from below. May they build condos on its grave."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m not surprised, but this makes me feel incredibly sad. I built my first PC using parts from there. I’m going to miss it.But once Fry’s pivoted to be a consignment store that was mostly empty and selling pallets of bottled water and perfume, it was obvious the business was about to die.Curiously, Microcenter has managed to live on and seems fairly robust. I can’t help but think Fry’s tried to sell too many different products and had a massive amount of floorspace to keep up. Whereas my local Microcenter just sticks to electronics and the store is much smaller and feels cramped in comparison."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I graduated college in 1985 and moved cross country to Sunnyvale for work. Fry&#39;s was a supermarket chain, and at the time there was one and only one location that was trying out carrying computer stuff, on the east side of Lawrence Ave I think, before they moved to the west side of Lawrence.They weren&#39;t yet fully committed to it. Half the store was produce and such -- milk, eggs, lettuce, etc, and the other half was rows of TTL parts, memory chips, diodes, capacitors, and resistors. It blew my mind. I bought a 68000 CPU, 128KB of DRAM chips (64Kx1 density back then), a perf board, wirewrap wire and a wrapping tool, EPROMs, sockets, and built my first computer all from parts I bought at that Fry&#39;s.About 60 seconds away from Fry&#39;s was Computer Literacy -- a really great bookstore that, as the name implies, had nothing but computer related books. It wasn&#39;t 20 copies of &#34;Computers for Dummies&#34; books. The vast majority of inventory were single copies of the most arcane stuff -- all sorts of college level CS textbooks, and you could ask the desk to order just about anything if you knew the title of it.I sent a lot of money and time in both locations. Silicon Valley felt like a magical place back then."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve always wanted to write a book. I have helped write 3  different deeply technical books (and one solutions manual), but I wanted something fun, interesting, and valuable.So I wrote &#34;Everyday Data Science&#34; which is a collection of stories, tutorials, jokes, math, and code all written to inspire people to analyze their personal data.In general, I was also inspired by the challenge to &#34;make $100 online&#34; which I have done in the past month since launching. It was daunting, and I felt quite vulnerable, but overall I&#39;m pleased with what I&#39;ve made.I wrote up this quick post to give you an idea of the process I followed to write the book, and some of the content.I&#39;d love to know your thoughts and am open to (nice) feedback :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"@andrewncThe book looks very intriguing! Before buying it, I wish I could read a bit more about what one could expect from the book. Let me explain :)&gt; This book is for people as untechnical as my Mom or as technical as my Applied Scientist friends working in big tech.&gt; ODEs On A DietDo you present an intuitive explanation of ODEs? Would both your mom and an Applied Scientist find it informative? If yes, I would love to read! A few pages from this chapter would really help in making a purchasing decision.&gt; a solution to Multi-Armed Bandit problems which are significantly more efficient and only takes a few lines of extra code.Does the book include code samples? As someone wanting to learn about, e.g., ODEs through code, I would love it code samples were present in the book.I understand that $7.99 is not a lot in the US, but it is not the case in a few other parts of the world. Given that there are no refunds, having more information about the book would be valuable for international customers.BUT... the books looks great, and big congratulations on publishing it!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you like stocks and are careful with the way you spend your money, you know how much time goes into buying shares of a stock. It’s tedious and I don’t have 24k for a Bloomberg terminal. Which led me to the idea during xmas break to spend the time creating my own terminal. I introduce you to “Gamestonk Terminal” (probably should’ve sent 1 tweet everyday to Elon Musk for copyrights permission eheh).In summary, the Terminal (https://github.com/DidierRLopes/GamestonkTerminal) has 7 distinct menus:
- Discover Stocks
Top gainers; Sectors performance; upcoming earnings releases; top high shorted interest stocks; top stocks with low float; top orders on fidelity; and some SPAC websites with news/calendars.- Market Sentiment
Scrolling through Reddit main posts, and most tickers mentions; Extracting stocktwit sentiment based on bull/bear flags; Twitter in-depth sentiment prediction using AI; Google mentions over time.- Research Web pages
List of good pages to do research on a stock, e.g. macroaxis, zacks, macrotrends, ..- Fundamental Analysis
Read financials from a company from Market Watch, Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, and Financial Modeling Prep API.- Technical Analysis
The usual technical indicators: sma, rsi, macd, adx, bbands, and more.- Due Diligence
Some features are: Latest news of the company; Analyst prices and ratings; Price target from several analysts plot over time vs stock price; Insider activity, and these timestamps marked on the stock price historical data; Latest SEC fillings; Short interest over time; A check for financial warnings based on Sean Seah book.- Prediction Techniques
The one I had more fun with. It tries to predict the stock price, from simple models like sma and arima to complex neural network models, like LSTM. The additional capability here is that all of these are easy to configure. Either through command line arguments, or even in form of a configuration file to define your NN."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The biggest thing you pay for in the Bloomberg Terminal is the chat function, which lets you talk to other people who also have $25,000 a year to spend on a Bloomberg Terminal.But this is still pretty cool :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is it just me, or is the feel of the comment on this post different than other HN posts? There are a lot more snarky jokes. A little more combative. It feels like why I stopped reading Reddit. I hope it doesn’t metastasize to posts on other topics."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For the non-lawyers: as the article indicates (but doesn’t really explain), this is a ruling on a request for temporary relief (called a “preliminary injunction”). This is not a final judgment. It can (and presumably will) also be subject to appeal. Nothing remotely final about this. The judge has simply said: “CA, you can go ahead and enforce your law for now.”Now, this does also mean the judge would quite likely ULTIMATELY rule in CA’s favor. But it is not a guarantee. And, as I said, then there’s appellate and Supreme Court review.For reference, the 4-element test/standard for a preliminary injunction generally accepted in US courts is set out here:“[G]enerally a plaintiff seeking preliminary injunctive relief must satisfy a four-factor test: (1) that he or she is likely to succeed on the merits of his claims; (2) that he or she is likely to suffer irreparable harm without preliminary relief; (3) the balance of equities between the parties support an injunction; and (4) the injunction is in the public interest.”https://www.americanbar.org/groups/litigation/committees/wom..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m hopeful as the judge seems to understand the ISP strategy:&gt; Mendez reportedly was not swayed by ISPs&#39; claims that a net neutrality law isn&#39;t necessary because they haven&#39;t been blocking or throttling Internet traffic.&gt; &#34;I have heard that argument and I don&#39;t find it persuasive,&#34; Mendez said, according to The Hollywood Reporter. &#34;It&#39;s going to fall on deaf ears. Everyone has been on their best behavior since 2018, waiting for whatever happened in the DC Circuit [court case over the FCC&#39;s repeal of net neutrality]. I don&#39;t place weight on the argument that everything is fine and we don&#39;t need to worry.&#34;"</p>

I would never work for a platform that promotes this or want to subject someone to being monitored like this.Can you really not ask the client questions before submitting a proposal either?Is all this just taking advantage of freelancers who don&#39;t know how to market themselves, or am I missing something?For all the freelance projects I&#39;ve found myself, some detailed discussion was required beforehand to check what the client really needs, and I aim for terms that don&#39;t lead to being micromanaged (like fixed price projects based on results not time) so I can&#39;t see the appeal."</p>

I&#39;m sure many people find their next job through LinkedIn, but it baffles me why LinkedIn would even exist today, being an social network, communication platform, a portfolio, and all of them in a very awkward position, and not being very good at any of them.

Top rate I’ve paid I think is some close to or just over $100/hour, so it’s definitely not just for low-end stuff.I’ve learned (the hard way) about being very, very clear with deliverables and expectations. Based on the average response I get on Upwork, it would seem the median buyer is much more susceptible to contractors blowing smoke. So one has to be careful.But overall, as several hundred thousand dollars client over the years, it’s been a godsend."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"D3.js is, to me, one of those tools that makes things possible rather than making things easy (although I only use javascript once every year or two so it&#39;s always a slog). This is big: it&#39;s like a zero-to-one step, rather than incremental progress.This fall I made an interactive visualization of the fine-grained plate tectonic model I have built for the Himalaya and Tibet for a research project[0].  The model building process (i.e., finding the relative motions of the plates) is largely solving a system of linear equations, so it&#39;s not immediately apparent what the results really mean and whether they are acceptably realistic.D3.js allows me to explore and understand my own scientific results so much more thoroughly than the static quiver plots that I was making in Matplotlib--being able to pan and zoom a globe (not just a projected map!) and see the tectonic plates move through time is phenomenal. Being able to share the results so trivially as a web page is a huge force multiplier as well.Thanks so much, Mike![0]: http://rocksandwater.net/blog/2020/11/tibet-blocks-js/"</p>

Some people just have unbelievable drive.In other news, I’ve enjoyed using D3 over the years, and always jump on visualization projects as a result.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don’t think it’s bad advice but having shipped multiple (really bad) games, I think it misses the two biggest/best pieces of advice I’ve gotten:
1. GDDs are probably a distraction if you’re a solo dev - prototyping and grayboxing a lot and looking for the fun mechanics without any art/music/story to get in the way or distract is essential 
2. If you’re truly just starting (and don’t already have a sense of fun), absolute best way to start is to carbon-copy a game you find fun, then start adding/tweaking elements. 
This both builds the mindset required to make games, and helps you get into the “fun iteration” loop quickly without getting bogged down in writing a lot of interesting technical systems that don’t end up contributing to the game in a meaningful way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve written some learnings after shipped my first game: https://ruoyusun.com/2018/06/15/guide-for-non-game-dev.htmlAs a professional software dev, I&#39;ve noticed that while both game dev and software dev are &#34;writing code&#34;, they are done in a very different way.As a software dev, the value proposition is more or less clear before you start writing code. As a game dev, you can only start to see your value proposition after you have finished your code - that&#39;s why game code, especially as an indie without clear distinction between prototype and production phase, tend to become spaghetti really quick - and that&#39;s fine. If you spend too much time to make the code look nice, then you are not spending enough time to make the game actually fun.Software usually has some logic behind it - it has to make &#34;sense&#34;. A game doesn&#39;t necessarily have to make sense - it needs to &#34;feel right&#34; and &#34;fun&#34;. That means your nicely designed abstractions actually won&#39;t be reusable - copy &amp; paste is much more pragmatic. You can start to look to refactor after your game is actually successful (or fun at least) but even then you will realize that most of the code is not reusable.A big part of your game code is actually &#34;content&#34;, instead of &#34;systems&#34; - meaning they are closer to a &#34;script&#34; than a well architectured software code. So you write more if-else and less inheritance and encapsulation (unless you are writing your own engine, then in that case, your engine code is actually close to software projects).And if you hate writing UI for software, you&#39;ll hate writing UI for games even more."</p>

When unpartitioning is taking effect, we will stop using double-keying and revert the ordinary (first-party) key.What are these &#34;certain cases?&#34;Edit 2: Reading on, there&#39;s this bit about storage access grants heuristics [2] linked from the blog. But is that really it, or is there a hardcoded whitelist as well? If so, it&#39;d be great to see it.This bit in particular is ambiguous in how it&#39;s supposed to work exactly (who&#39;s &#34;we&#34; here):&gt; If we discover that an origin is abusing this heuristic to gain tracking access, that origin will have the additional requirement that it must have received user interaction as a first party within the past 30 days.1. https://hacks.mozilla.org/2021/02/introducing-state-partitio...2. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Pri..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a lot of comments in here about how it&#39;s bad that cookies haven&#39;t always worked this way, but a significant amount of web content to this day still requires third-party cookies to work. And I&#39;m not talking about cookies that are designed for analytics purposes; the discussions here where concern is raised revolve around simple things like logins breaking.For greenhorn web developers, you could say the same thing about TLS certificates. Why weren&#39;t they always free?Well, another reason is because TLS (and formerly SSL) wasn&#39;t (weren&#39;t) just about encryption, but about a &#34;web of trust.&#34; Encryption alone isn&#39;t trust.Many things about web technologies have changed over time; and it&#39;s easy to say that any individual piece of functionality should have worked this or that way all along, but the original intent of many web features and how those features are used today can be very different.One day industry standards may dictate that we don&#39;t even process HTTPS requests in a way where the client&#39;s IP address is fully exposed to the server. Someone along the way might decide that a trusted agent should serve pages back on behalf of a client, for all clients.After all, why should a third-party pixel.png request expose me browsing another website?! How absurd. Don&#39;t you think? And yet, we do it every day."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been following Tether for quite a long time. I have no absolute proof it is a scam but the writing is on the wall. Here are some facts.- The current Market Cap of USDT is 34 Billion Dollars. It was 4B this time last year. Since the value is pegged this means there has been an influx of cash of 30 B into this shady company in the last year alone. Who invested this money? We have no idea since Tether doesn&#39;t disclose, but we&#39;re supposed to believe all this money entered USDT even with the red flags we see.- There&#39;s a correlation between Tether printing new USDT and the Bitcoin Price.- There&#39;s no way to transfer USDT into USD. The few exchanges that say they offer withdraws actually don&#39;t if you go and try.- Daily volume of transaction is in the 100 B mark. Twice that of Bitcoin and 3 times Tether daily volume this time last year.- BitFinex is included in the NY decision because it&#39;s proven now that Bitfinex and Tether are operated by the same people. Note that a few years ago this was not only undisclosed but actively denied by Tether.- Tether initially told its investors it was 100% backed by dollar reserves and that it would be subjected to constant audits. The audits never happened, and they eventually conceded only ~70% was backed by &#34;short term cash reserves&#34;.My conclusion is that the folks at BitFinex came up with a new currency, printed billions of it and used it to wash trade against itself and other crypto, creating an artificial demand that drove the prices up. It&#39;s textbook Ponzi scheme and will inevitably come crashing down, killing Tether, BitFinex and a chunk of the Crypto Market.Crypto folks will counter argue that people has been saying this for years but Tether is still chugging along and crypto is healthier than ever.Personally I won&#39;t touch any crypto with a 10 foot pole until this thing blows over. If that means missing out on a lot of possible gains so be it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m waiting patiently for the whole Tether printing scheme to fall and crush to finally purchase Bitcoin / Ether.
However I&#39;m not viewing them as inflation hedges so long as Bitfinex / etc. are allowed to continue with their obvious money printing scheme.When most crypto trading volume is traded at trustworthy exchanges which actually hold dollars as much as they say they do, I&#39;ll trust $/BTC to be a fair market.It&#39;s dumb escaping from Powell&#39;s printing machine straight into Bitfinex tether printing machine. BTC isn&#39;t the hedge people think it is so long as it&#39;s traded against fictional dollars. Tether&#39;s volume exceeds Bitcoin, so that&#39;s the scale of fictional dollars supporting Bitcoin right now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It appears from the link in the settlement agreement:https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021.02.17_-_settlemen...Tether wasn’t backed at all times. The argument was that this happened due to asset seizures in Poland and Portugal in 2017-2018.https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/95207/bitfinex-tether-ne...Seems to me they couldn’t prove malicious intent, so they suggested they stop trading. Frankly this seems a bit of a click-bait title with the whole “illegal activities”.Sure, tether wasn’t backed at all times (probably is now), due to governments seizing their funds. Also banks do this all the time, every time they issue a loan for instance. The bank only keeps 10-30% collateral on your home."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"1. At an individual/hobbyist level this is a fine thing to do, if one is already a cryptocurrency enthusiast.2. At a social/planning level it is important to remember that opportunity costs matter, and this should not be recommended as public policy. One kWh of electricity could either be used for mining bitcoin (creating at most one kWh of indoor heat), or it could be used for running a heat pump[*], yielding multiple kWh of indoor heat due to the magic of heat pumps and their &gt;100% &#34;efficiency&#34;[**].[*] Yes, I realize the OP is already using a heat pump, but assisting it with preheat is inherently less efficient than plowing the same energy into running the heat pump itself.[**] Yes, heat pumps aren&#39;t &gt;100% efficient per a physics textbook, but what most people care about is that you can use them to get &gt;1 joule of indoor heat from 1 joule of energy input, which feels magical when compared to electric heaters, gas furnaces etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I did this in an apartment I lived in years ago, and do it now in my house.My computer room in the house is the lowest point in the house, so naturally, it tends to be a couple degrees cooler than the upstairs.  This means that if I set the thermostat so that the computer room is comfortable, the bedroom is too warm.  If I run the house circulation fan constantly, it&#39;s not an issue, but that consumes a decent amount of power.If I&#39;m going to consume that much power, I might as well mine crypto and make a few dollars.  Mining for NiceHash, a service that lets people rent hashing power from miners, I&#39;ll average $100-400/month worth of Bitcoin on my RTX 3080, depending on current hashing prices, and how much of my time I spend gaming, since mining is effectively paused while gaming.  The mining happens while I use my computer with no noticeable loss in performance, and it puts a few watts of energy into the room to heat it up a bit, evening it out with the rest of the house."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Years ago when mining with a single gaming card was more common and viable, I lived in a rented room in a house owned by a live-in landlord who controlled the heating, and wouldn&#39;t turn it on for very long in the winter. Since electricity was included in my (fixed) rent, I was able to keep my room a few degrees higher than the rest of the house.However I must point out that you shouldn&#39;t do this in most circumstances, there are environmentally friendly ways of heating your house."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It would be helpful if we knew eactly what these endocrine-disrupting chemicals were. As is usually the case with such reports, this article is short on specifics.Over the years there have many reports from cleaners to plasticizers, phthalates, and various other chemicals as endocrine disruptors but no one has put a sufficient measure on the problem so that we can move foreword - put regulations in place, etc.As the article points out, what is so problematic is that many of the chemicals that are under suspicion are ubiquitous and not easily avoided.I consider it important that we act quickly for not only public health reasons but also the fact that we&#39;re living in an increasingly chemical-phobic society and worrying the public without solid evidence isn&#39;t helpful to anybody.We need need more research on this urgently.Afterthought: it is essential that we have solid evidence ASAP as billions of dollars are tied up in the plastics industry. Plastics already cause environmental problems (and I constantly curse the fact that I have to get rid of so much waste plastic) but there&#39;s no point deliberately alienating the plastics industry without good cause."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Store food in glass containers, not plastic. Above all, don’t microwave foods in plastic or with plastic wrap on top. Avoid pesticides. Buy organic produce if possible. Avoid tobacco or marijuana. Use a cotton or linen shower curtain, not one made of vinyl. Don’t use air fresheners. Prevent dust buildup. Vet consumer products you use with an online guide like that of the Environmental Working Group.I really want to do this, but it seems impossibly hard. For example, almost all the food I buy is in plastic containers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is the most important part of the essay:   Uncertainty remains, research sometimes conflicts and biological pathways aren’t always clear. There are competing theories about whether the sperm count decline is real and what might cause it and about why girls appear to be reaching puberty earlier, and it’s sometimes unclear whether an increase in male genital abnormalities reflects actual rising numbers or just better reporting.

You should maintain a very low prior probability of this being true without more information. Remember correlation usually != causationhttps://www.gwern.net/CausalityThere are a lot of other possible causes for all the these declines. (obesity and lower physical activity being only the most likely-seeming to me)"</p>

I was almost 12. School was closed for 2-3 weeks because they couldn&#39;t promise there would be electricity to heat the building. The ice kept breaking power lines or crushing the transmission towers from the weight (ice is heavy!). Imagine your car, covered in a 1-2 inch thick layer of very solid ice, encased.People died. The military had to come in to help. My family was fortunate that we had a wood stove in the basement that kept the house warm and cooked some meals on. We lost power a few hours at least every day.Crazy time.Edit: For those interested in this, the Wikipedia article (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_1998_North_American_ic...) has some great photos and description. 1,000 transmission towers/pylons destroyed, 35,000 utility poles. Whole forests devastated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Once at its destination and hooked in, its V12 had to be run at a specific, constant rpm&#39; to generate AC current at 60 hertz, the frequency used by most North American utilities.I don&#39;t think this is exactly right. I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t consistent either, but few loads really cared too much.From the article&#39;s link, about a different locomotive doing the same thing:&gt; Conrail actually had a set of standing instructions on how to provide quasi-commercial power from a locomotive.  For an SD40-2, you attach to the bus before the diodes.  Operating in notch 6 runs the generator at 647 RPM.  Since the AR10 is a 10 pole machine, that gives 64.7 Hz power.  You could tweak the governor to get it closer to 60 Hz if you really wanted to, but for powering everything but clocks, it&#39;s close enough.  I think the method for regulating the voltage was to disconnect the load regulator from it&#39;s governor-powered vane motor and dialing the voltage in manually.  The output is 3 phase power.  Max output in notch 6 is about 1000KW.  If the avg home draws 2-3 KW on the avg, that&#39;d power several hundred homes.http://cs.trains.com/trn/f/111/t/194245.aspx"</p>

It&#39;s a publicly-traded freight rail company that doesn&#39;t currently operate passenger service.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m also a solo developer and use git in a much less sophisticated fashion. I tend to use it as, &#34;freeze my code here, so in case I f something up, I can get back to a moderately clean state.&#34; It&#39;s kind like a snapshot-based local history.  And, quite frankly, I rarely revert one, but it makes me feel safer. I don&#39;t care if I have a lot of commit messages that say, &#34;interim&#34;. The good ones are clear.Is this a terrible coding practice? I don&#39;t have enough non-me experience to know what an anti-pattern this probably is. I probably won&#39;t change my process, but I&#39;m curious."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m happy for this person if this works well for them. For me, no thanks. One of the reasons I feel much more productive as on my solo project than at work is that I don&#39;t have this kind of overhead. I don&#39;t need to write tests for everything (I write them just where they add value). I don&#39;t need to follow some strict branching standard. I can commit in chunks that make sense to me, and adjust as needed for the situation.From my perspective, a lot of this kind of rigid process is important and valuable when you are working with a team, but is counterproductive when it&#39;s just me. I know the tradeoffs of the corners I cut. I have the experience to know, for example, that&#39;s it&#39;s not a safe assumption that I will understand my own code a year (or even a month) from now. But the solution to that is to throw in some freeform comments that jog my memory; not to implement a heavyweight documentation system.Everyone should work in the way that makes them the most productive and happy, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea for solo developers to bring in practices that are designed for team collaboration without really understanding what value they will get from the extra effort."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was a new developer and first learned Git, I felt compelled to use Git the &#34;right&#34; way. That is... small commits with clean messages, things described in this and other posts.But, as I spent more time programming, I developed different Git habits for different situations:- Solo explorative work: working on a feature, many small commit messages create nothing but noise. Trying to come up with wording for these commit messages is mostly a drain on my mental energy: there is an infinitesimal chance I&#39;ll need these commits later. In such cases, I prefer to maintain large &#34;checkpoint&#34; work-in-progress commits that are the result of near-continuous `git commit --amend`s so that I can use `git status` to see what&#39;s changed since my last checkpoint, and easily revert to the last checkpoint. If this fails me, I can almost just as easily refer to the reflog to find some changes. The reflog, in my opinion, is an extremely under-utilized tool. `git diff HEAD@{2}..HEAD@{0}` allows me to see what&#39;s happened in the the last two times that I updated my checkpoint. Since this is active work I&#39;m doing right now, I have a good sense of what happened and when, all without tiresomely writing commit messages that will be a bunch of gibberish in two days. When I&#39;m satisfied with with the work on a checkpoint commit, I reset the branch to the previous real commit, and then incrementally create real, meaningful commits from the accumulated work, that have some chance to be useful to me in the future.- Working on patches and bug fixes for live systems or production libraries: small, atomic commits that include tests for the patch are the only way to go. I believe the &#34;correct Git&#34; approach that is widely espouses is targeted to this use case, but not explorative feature work. Or maybe that&#39;s just me.Wondering if anyone else codes like this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I agree with the premise that making is harder than commenting, and this can be frustrating. But I don&#39;t think that telling people not to comment is the right solution.There can be a lot of value in comments, even ones that have not been thought through very deeply. In fact, casual, uninformed comments are often the most valuable as they&#39;re representative of how someone new to your product or project will perceive it.I&#39;ve found that the keys to getting value out of comments without getting discouraged are:1. Not to take comments too personally or get defensive about it. They&#39;re not attacking you. In fact they&#39;re not attacking anything. They&#39;re just making an observation. (On rare occasions, you may get a comment from an asshole who really is attacking you personally, but it&#39;s pretty easy to tell when this is the case and ignore them).2. Take a more statistical view on comments. If one person mentions something, maybe they&#39;re just an outlier. But if 10 people mention the same thing, they&#39;re probably on to something."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Roosevelt’s Man in the Area quote sums this up well.&gt; &#34;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.&#34;It&#39;s also a useful metric for deciding who to follow on social media. Is the person showing off their work or are they just commenting on the work of others? If the work/comment ratio drops too low, I stop following them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article is so vague that people can read anything they want into it, and judging from the comments here, they are. My question is, who is the target of the article, who is supposed to avoid commenting? Your coworkers? Your boss? Your paying customers? Your non-paying users? The media? Twitter/HN randos? All of the above?If you&#39;re a maker, then you&#39;re making things for someone. If you&#39;re only making things for yourself, then of course nobody else has a right to comment. But if you&#39;re making things for other people, then it seems to me that those other people have the right, perhaps even the obligation, to comment on the product, right? The article verges on the parodic idea that no maker should ever be subject to any criticism. If that&#39;s not the author&#39;s intention, then the author ought to be clearer what is intended.That&#39;s my drive-by comment."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember the electric atmosphere in the auditorium going to see the film the Epilogue video is taken from, Electroma [1], on screen. It was only playing in a single cinema in the world in Paris and only at midgnight. So glad I got to catch that.I am kind of glad to hear that Daft Pank is over and I say this as someone who their music means a lot to. The arc of their art is complete and there is nowhere left for them to go without it becoming forced, awkward or irrelevant: teenagers with attitude and samplers to elder statesmen recording with an orchestra.As this is HN, does anyone remember their more interesting dives into technology: Daft Club [2] and the multi-angle DVD of D.A.F.T. [3]?This quote [4] about Daft Club, and the state of music on the internet, from 2001 is really interesting in hindsight:&gt; It&#39;s great to find a new channel where there is an open access, open door to more, but not more than had to be done before. It&#39;s establishing a connection between people that listen to our music and ourselves. There&#39;s no limits of time, and it helps people get and listen to this music. A track that could have been done today can be online tomorrow. The other thing is to really express ourselves through the Internet.&gt; ...&gt; Napster is a cool thing with us. The important thing is to make a difference. Napster is a positive thing because it raises questions, it raises issues.[1] https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800022/[2] https://web.archive.org/web/20020804191122/http://www.daftcl...[3] https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0279758/[4] https://web.archive.org/web/20070609232158/http://music.yaho..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; “When they legislate these things, they need to be appropriating enough money to make sure they work,” a source said. They estimated fixing the SB1310 bug would take roughly 2,000 additional programming hours.40 hours a week times 52 weeks is 2080 hours.  Subtract a few weeks for vacations and holidays, and you get a little less that 2000 hours.  So, basically, this is a little more than one programmer-year of effort if the estimate is in the right ballpark.It&#39;s gross that the decision not to fix this carries an apparent implicit economic calculation that one programmer-year is more valuable than the freedom that is being denied to an unknown number of people whom society deems less important.  (Granted the actual situation is more complicated and the state is constrained by their contract with the vendor, which we can reasonably guess is going to charge as much as they can contractually get away with rather than the programmer&#39;s actual salary cost.)At least the Department of Corrections has assigned people to do the calculations manually.  That&#39;s better, but it sounds like they just don&#39;t have enough people on it to keep up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I wanted to have compiled [1] financials, PriceWaterhouseCoopers told me to pick a recognized accounting system, then change the company&#39;s business processes to match that.   They said absolutely not to go the other way, to try to customize any software to match our business.I think about that every time I read about another government (or private!) company that wastes tens or hundreds of million of dollars (or euros or pounds) on custom software.It seems like there should be 1, 2, or 3 DMV programs.   The same for building codes, tax codes, etc.   And prison software.   You can be more like Massachusetts or Mississippi or Montana (hypothetical examples) but pick one and harmonize with it.1: compiled is the lowest of 3 standards that outside accountants can do; &#34;reviewed&#34; is higher and &#34;audited&#34; is the highest.  Even at the compiled level they mailed out postcards to a certain number of customers asking if they were customers over the past year and had spent this much money.   It was fairly easy for the acquiring company&#39;s outside accountants to review PWC&#39;s work and bring it up to audited standard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow. I know firsthand from family how this can severely destroy someone&#39;s mental health in what may not be so obvious; it is extremely heavy on someone every moment past the first hour they go past their release time, then the first day followed by a variety of things that will then be taken advantage of by other inmate and guards while one&#39;s defenses are down.  The fun poked at by other jealous inmates and cruel guards constantly will also weigh down hard on another human being.  Arizona penal system puts you into almost always into very nasty and dangerous places of incarceration. frompdx made a statement that truly made my gut feel as if I was at the top of a roller coaster I did not want to get on in the first place."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s interesting, but strikes me as very unrealistic. I don&#39;t think it&#39;d go that way. In fact, it&#39;d be far more horrifying.We wouldn&#39;t bother trying to convince an image of a brain into cooperation, because we simply lose any need to do that very quickly.One of the very first things we&#39;d do with a simulated brain is to debug it. Execute it step by step, take lots of measures of all parameters, save/reload state, test every possible input and variation. And I&#39;m sure it wouldn&#39;t take long to start getting some sort of interesting result, first superficial then deeper and deeper.Cooperation would quickly become unnecessary because you either start from a cooperative state every time, or you quickly figure out how to tweak the brain state into cooperation.And that&#39;s when the truly freaky stuff starts. Using such a tool we could figure out many things about a brain&#39;s inner workings. How do we truly respond to advertising? How to produce maximum anger and maximum cooperation? How to best implant false memories? How to craft a convincing lie? What are the bugs and flaws in human perception? We could fuzz it and see if we can crash a brain.We&#39;ve already made some uncomfortable advancements, eg in how free to play games intentionally try to create addiction. With such a tool at our disposal we could fine tune strategies without having to guess. Eventually we&#39;d just know which bits of the brain we want to target and just have to find ways of getting the right things to percolate down the neural network until those bits are affected in the ways we want.Within a decade we&#39;d have a manual on how to craft the best propaganda, how to best create discord, or how to best destroy a human being by just talking to them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve often imagined what it would be like to have an executable brain scan of myself. Imagine scanning yourself right as you&#39;re feeling enthusiastic enough to work on any task for a few hours, and then spawning thousands of copies of yourself to all work on something together at once. And then after a few hours or maybe days, before any of yourselves meaningfully diverge in memories/goals/values, you delete the copies and then spawn another thousand fresh copies to resume their tasks. Obviously for this to work, you would have to be comfortable with the possibility of finding yourself as an upload and given a task by another version of yourself, and knowing that the next few hours of your memory would be lost. Erasing a copy that only diverged from the scan for a few hours would have more in common with blacking out from drinking and losing some memory than dying.The creative output you could accomplish from doing this would be huge. You would be able to get the output of thousands of people all sharing the exact same creative vision.I definitely wouldn&#39;t be comfortable with the idea of my brain scan being freely copied around for anyone to download and (ab)use as they wished though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As suggested by others the number of taxonomists, people who could accurately identify species (many of which require internal dissection, or molecular methods), who are actually working on collecting and identify species has most certainly declined.  In many groups of insects there is at most a handful of experts worldwide who can take specimens to a species-level identification.This is not to say that species richness is not declining, its to say that in the past 3-4 decades Taxonomists have done a poor (some would say terrible) job at describing to the broader world why they are important, and why they require fixed, institutionally-based funding to actually be able to provide the services that would allow us to confidently state that data like these are because of environmental change (again, they very likely are) rather than a lack of experts in the field actually doing basic research.In other words, it is extremely rare that universities (in the US) actually hire what was once known as &#34;alpha-taxonomists&#34;, in part this is a reflection of taxonomists inability to sell themselves and adapt to new tools (but note that many have evolved) in part it is a reflection of the (I would argue &#34;immense&#34;) short-sightedness of institutions. &#34;We want answers to complex questions!  We&#39;ve neglected to give scientists time to think deeply, and research over decades to answer those questions.  Oh, we see.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Last year I installed a beehive in our garden. Didn&#39;t take their honey, didn&#39;t treat them for Varroa. In the midst of winter I was sure they were all dead. Then a few days ago temperatures shot up to about 18°c and suddenly they were back, basking in the sunlight and buzzing around the hive. Made me so happy...Seriously, I&#39;ve come to understand that contrary to what most of us seem to believe, it&#39;s not about what we can do to minimize our negative impact, but rather what we can do to have a positive impact on our environment. Not just ecologically, but also socially and politically."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not sure what a thinly resourced piece like this is doing so high up on HN. There’s really very little evidence that this has anything to do with racial slurs.From a quick read: last June, the channel was banned for “harmful and dangerous” content. The ban was removed in under 24 hours. YouTube has not confirmed the reason. And yet:&gt; Experts suspect that it was the usage of words like &#34;black&#34; and &#34;white&#34; that confused the Yutube&#39;s AI filters.Well, if experts said it, it just be true! The experiment they ran is speculative as best and the article just ran with it as absolute fact. If the filter was caused by use of “black” and “white” wouldn’t every chess channel fall victim to it? The filter isn’t new, why was it triggered once last June?A lot of questions raised and an article that has no interest in answering them. It’s credited to “Buzz Staff”… I think it’s always  suspect when no one wants to attach their name to something they wrote. A smell of clickbait running all the way through this one."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"What is amazing is how there is no way to recover from all these algorithmic banning. I&#39;m getting banned on Twitter every other day from following anyone because I follow a lot of academics. It&#39;s all legitimate but algos detected some pattern and I&#39;m now toast. Twitter provides exactly zero ways to report this or fix this. They simply don&#39;t care if some monority users suffer. We see same things when Google disables account and you get locked out from your electronic life.I used to think working with governments is very hard. Getting support in places like DMVs and passport renewals is super hard.

The kit was terrible, the parts defective, and you can imagine I was pretty sick of troubleshooting it after a time. These are things happening on my workbench with a small amount of automation code. I&#39;d have been thrilled if it had just worked as designed.Now, take three robots. One is wheeled, one flies by rotors, and another is rocket powered. Put them on a rocket, fly to another planet, and land them autonomously without wrecking anything. As a hobbyist I&#39;d be beyond myself to just do ONE of those. On Earth.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Barriers to entry are invisible. They are invisible to people on the inside and most frequently invisible to people who have a hand in creating those barriers.I once had a conversation with a founder about their signup flow. This founder had aspirations to be a global player. They said that step 2 of their flow included entering a credit card number. I had to stop them. &#34;What about people who don&#39;t use credit cards?&#34; They were nonplussed. &#34;You know, China, much of Africa ...&#34; they had never actually thought about whether people had credit cards because every single person they interacted with had one.Back to languages. If you&#39;ve never taught an introduction to computer programming for a general audience you are blind to what does and does not matter about a language. You look at things like `foo.bar()` and think &#34;Yeah that&#39;s a simple method invocation&#34; and have no idea how many people you just lost.Never underestimate how much ease of use matters. We, as a community, have selected for decades against people who care about language ergonomics because they get hit in the face with a wall of punctuation filled text and turn away. We fight over where braces belong while not realizing how many hundreds of thousands of people we&#39;ve excluded.Ease of use is the most important part of a language. It&#39;s just that the barriers to entry are invisible and so the people who happen to be well suited to vim vs emacs debates get to talk while the vast majority of potential programmers are left on the outside.We create barriers to entry accidentally because we design for people like us. To us the barriers are invisible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Going by their first example, the fact that I couldn&#39;t write   list.delete(value)

without realizing it involves a linear search is considered one of the benefits of Go.That said, I agree Go could use a bit for ergonomic and handy methods, while still remaining efficient.The example on Concurrency also has a different answer. Go gives you all the tools, but there are many different ways their problem can be solved. By explicitly avoiding a &#34;join&#34; method and having any default &#39;channels&#39;, Go makes all these possible. What is missing is some of the popular patterns that emerged in the last few years need to make it to into stdlib or some cookbooks.1. If you want a worker model, I would start n=3 go-routines and they all receive from a single channel. They don&#39;t need to much around with a channel of buffer 3, as in the example.2. If the workers already return data from a compute, the read from driver serves as the wait.3. In other cases, there is sync.Waitgroup available to synchronize completion status.4. End of work from the driver can be indicated via a channel close. Closed channels can still be read from until they are empty and the reader can even detect end-of-channel.Designing concurrent system is a bit complicated. Some tutorials do make it sound like a `go` keyword is all you need. All of these can fixed by improving std-lib or cookbooks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"But no one said Go was easy. It&#39;s just simple and easy to reason about. There&#39;s a huge benefit to something doing exactly what it says. No hidden behaviours, no overly complex syntax, nothing like that.I came from C# where I have gotten increasingly frustrated with the amount of additions to the language. Like we now have classes, structs and records. We now have async/await but we also have channels. This is what having a huge toolbox causes. Some people are going to write code using channels, me others will use async. Some people will use features that others don&#39;t care about.I think there&#39;s huge benefit in a simple language. In Go I know that there&#39;s only 2 ways to do concurrency. You either use go routines and mutexes or you use go routines and channels.Generics will bring a lot of helper functions that weren&#39;t possible before which will remove a lot of repetitive code.But otherwise I am super happy with writing Go code. All my pet peeves of something like modern Java or C# are gone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Tree Sitter is amazing. The parsing is fast enough to run on every keystroke. The parse tree is extremely concise and readable. It resembles an AST more than a parse tree (ie no 11 levels of binary op precedence rules in the tree). The parse tree emits specific ERROR nodes, so you can get a semi-functional tree even with broken syntax.I can&#39;t wait for the tools to get built with this. Paredit for TypeScript. Syntax-tree based highlighting (vs regex highlighting). A command to &#34;add an arg to current function&#34; which works across languages. A command to add a CSS class to the nearest JSX node, or to walk up the tree at the className=&#34;| ...&#34; position, adding a new className if it doesn&#39;t exist.There&#39;s a nicely documented Emacs package for this [1]. The documentation is at [2]. The parse trees work great. There&#39;s syntax highlighting support and tree-walking APIs. There&#39;s a bit of confusion about TSX vs typescript langs but it&#39;s fixable with some config change [3].[1]: https://github.com/ubolonton/emacs-tree-sitter

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried to use this to ease the front end work load of students in a compiler project (building a C compiler) for a University course, so that the project could be focused on the more interesting middle and back end parts of the compiler.
However, reported bugs in the C grammar that saw no activity at all [1] made this impossible. From this small sample of experiences, I was left with the impression that Tree Sitter is great for things like syntax highlighting, where wrong results are annoying but not dramatic, but not so suitable for tools that need a really correct syntax tree.---

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m an engineer on the code intelligence team at Sourcegraph.We&#39;ve been busy building out true precise code intelligence/navigation support, but we also have a mode for zero-configuration code navigation based on text search, universal-ctags, and hand-rolled regular expressions (which works surprisingly well!). Tree-sitter would definitely give better results than our current ctags-based approach. It&#39;s been catching our attention more and more lately, and we have plans to use it to upgrade our out-of-the-box, instant code navigation experience.It&#39;s not the exact right fit for our primary goals though, since it&#39;s designed around being extremely fast while editing and robust against errors. Sourcegraph is only used for navigating committed code, so we&#39;re leveraging formats like LSIF to generate complete semantic graphs of codebases and their entire dependency tree. That&#39;ll enable a lot of features that are out of reach for tree-sitter, but is a lot harder to get working out of the box and it&#39;s a much bigger technical investment.It&#39;s very interesting to see the topological space that houses these solutions fill out. Every tool has its own set of unique trade-offs and fall somewhere on these spectrums:- fast vs slow- precise vs imprecise- zero-configuration vs configuration requiredWe&#39;ve visited a few islands in this space but still very curious to see what other islands can be discovered. We&#39;re especially excited about tools and formats like tree-sitter and LSIF around which a large and supportive community can grow so that all the products we love and rely on as developers can all make forward progress."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked on a startup that received seed funding to tackle this. I helped build the platform (using Twilio video) and then answered the first $5000 of calls. Things I learned:- Many entry level programmers at big companies (think Walmart Labs, Target, Goldman Sachs, etc) are too scared to ask managers/team for help. If you work for a large company, make sure new hires feel safe asking questions and seeking help or they will seek it elsewhere.- The really hard questions they&#39;re willing to pay $240 an hour for have too much context for you to grasp. They want you to replace their ORM layer or tell them why their 600 line test case is not working.- Getting customers is not too hard by poaching them from Stack Overflow, Reddit, CodeMentor.- Developers make good money working full time and idly sitting at their desk part of that time. Here you only get paid for active time and the idle time in-between will kill your salary. Your motivation has to come from helping other people and watching them grow, not from $$$."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You&#39;ll need some mechanism to raise rates to attract top developers.Even without the first free minute and time spent reading questions, the most a dev could hope to earn with this service is ($0.75/min)(60 min/hr) = $45/hr. Perhaps for students or devs who barely meet the 100 rep minimum requirement, that might be attractive, but for the experts who&#39;ve written the best Stack Overflow answers, that&#39;s likely to be a (small) fraction of their bill rate.Free contribution is rewarding as a means of helping.Well-paid contribution is rewarding for the $$$.Poorly paid contribution often loses both incentives."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d guess that the people at Stack Overflow might have an issue with someone using their name in this way. It should probably be clearer that this is entirely unaffiliated.100+ reputation on SO is also a ridiculously low bar, it&#39;s almost meaningless. Not that any amount of reputation by itself is a sure indicator, but 100 really doesn&#39;t mean anything at all.This kind of site also requires a pretty large critical mass to work, you don&#39;t just want a bunch of random SO users willing to participate, but you need the right users with experience in the right tags to match to the requests in a reasonable timeframe.There&#39;s a good reason Stack Overflow doesn&#39;t allow people to pay for answers, people already cheat enough for meaningless internet points, this will get much worse with real money on the line."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"With interest rates so low (and lots of headwinds for them to increase in the short-term), one has to think that this will be the new normal for a few years at least. The rise of SPACs is another sign - they are disrupting both later-stage VC funds as well as obviously vanilla IPOs.I wonder if the abundance of capital is not evenly distributed through the startup lifecycle, but more heavily-weighted towards later stages.Anecdotally, I&#39;ve heard from founders that SEED rounds are getting harder despite all the frothiness. Even back when we did our seed rounds ~2015, we already heard &#34;today&#39;s seed round is yesterday&#39;s Series A&#34; in terms of $ size but also minimum bar of progress. And these days it seems that is EVEN MORE true. It&#39;s also true it&#39;s easier to start a SaaS company than ever before. But it&#39;s ALSO ALSO true that there is less and less SaaS greenspace. Hmmmm."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree, at present, capital is abundant. That is, at the moment:  Σ(capital available) &gt; Σ(investment opportunities)

And this imbalance of demand for and supply of investment opportunities is showing up everywhere as... asset price inflation.You can see it in rising angel valuations, rising early-stage VC valuations, rising later-stage VC valuations, rising growth-equity valuations, rising leveraged buyout valuations, rising stock market valuations, rising cryptocurrency prices, rising home prices, etc. Feeding frenzies and bidding wars for high quality assets have become more and more common. Asset prices keep going up and up and up...The multi-trillion-dollar question:Is this sustainable?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps I&#39;m a minority, but I got A LOT of value from my investors (both pre-seed, seed, and series A). To the point where I&#39;d consider them core partners in my journey of building the business.I know Aaron isn&#39;t saying that the investors don&#39;t matter.But when I think about why VCs hate going through an auction-like process, at least part of it is human nature. Like, we&#39;re about to work together for a long time. Let&#39;s not start off by commoditizing what we each bring to the table. I understand the POV that 99.999% of what VCs bring to the table is the literal commodity of cash... but if you have good ones, they really can help.In our case, we had multiple term sheets for our Series A so I was able to optimize terms and get the partner/fund who I thought would add the most value but at &#34;market&#34; on the other terms. &#34;Market&#34; being what was on the other term sheets. That seemed to work OK as a softer way of actually doing the auction.The real point in all of this is that if the VC&#39;s value-add is true, then you shouldn&#39;t NEED to discount things because of that. If it&#39;s real, then they should be happy to pay &#39;market rate&#39; to invest in you, and the impact of their other value will be that together you build a better business, which is more valuable to them too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I always found it funny that companies will go to extreme Herculean lengths to hire the best programmers, and are incredibly fearful and paranoid that they could be making a &#34;bad hire&#34;, and yet once hired they don&#39;t spend a second making sure engineers aren&#39;t completely running the software product off the rails and killing the company internally. The author mentions trying to rewrite Etsy&#39;s backend in Scala and MongoDB. That probably cost the company X million dollars. Etsy could still be recovering from that.The industry constantly mints senior engineers who have been bitten by complexity, but doesn&#39;t want to hire them, or listen to them. More often than not senior engineers pretend to be excited about complecting the tech stack, because hey, it pads their resume with the latest buzzwords and they&#39;ve given up trying to fight against it anyway.The last line of defense against a rogue engineering team is managers who have studied this stuff. How many engineering managers can spot the common situation &#34;the engineers are bored and they&#39;re rewriting perfectly-good codebases in Common Lisp and OCAML for funsies&#34;? And how many know what to do about it when they see it?Anyway, this is a cool website, and it&#39;ll be useful to point people to it in the future, so thanks for that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with the non-boring technology club is that programmers see what problem FAANG companies are solving and wanting to be on the edge on new technology too. But they don‘t have the same problems. Another problem is they want to show what they can do. If they tell in an interview they are working with rails/django and a postgresql database they fear they look incompetent using those old technologies. So they try to convince their companies their products need to be rewritten in mongodb, react with graphql in a micro service stack and many more state of the art technologies.And in the end many developer years are wasted just rewriting a working an existing software in a new stack they are not yet comfortable with and the new product is much less stable than the old one.I love basecamp for their hotwired stack and showing that you can make the great software with old boring technologies and just a little bit of javascript magic pixie dust."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The way I see it is that one should master their stack.  If you work over and over again with the same stack you will know it well.  You will be able to move mountains with it.  But it takes years to arrive to that.  It takes implementing multiple projects the same way over and over again.You need the wherewithal to stick with your stack and not get lured away.  Maybe this is what boring means.  Maybe boring is different to different engineers based on their background.Sometimes you cannot select the stack cause there might be more senior engineers at a company and they have more sway.  This is fine as long as the engineers picking the stack have picked a stack they have mastered and it is boring to them.  As a regular engineer in their team I would hope to rely on their expertise and would hope to learn from them.I remember at one job a rogue engineer picked a boring backend that would have been fine.  But they fell behind because the other engineers knew their boring stack a lot better.  Ultimately the rogue engineer had to switch to the other boring stack.  The rogue engineer just was not fast enough to master it and implement the features required to keep pace with the demands of management.  These demands were trace centralized logging, security, and of course features.  So while they were still learning the ropes, we were moving on to even more advanced security, logging, and feature requirements.  They just couldn&#39;t keep up."</p>

Since NASA decided not to fund the version of the asteroid retrieval mission (ARM) that included de-spin there are no near earth asteroids that can be brought back to the proposed space station. All it can do is uselessly orbit the Moon, getting full cosmic radiation dose instead of less than half in Earth orbit in the magnetosphere.In terms of resources the moon itself only has water. But it&#39;s down in a difficult to access gravity well. There&#39;s no nitrogen. Far, far, better would be fully funding ARM and starting to despin and drag asteroids to the lunar gateway for study, resources, and eventually living space in space protected from radiation and, if you build sub-surface tracks, enough acceleration to live normally."</p>

There are lots of websites that do this very thing like whatsmyname.app.I personally like running my username through tools like this and aggregating my digital presence. When I was younger, I signed up for lots of sites that were the cool, new thing. Checking myself years later, I am shocked by the wide berth I left. Fitness accounts. Accounts from that time I was getting into studying chess. I’m the type of person who is always on to the next hobby. I go 100% in on something, then pop to the next thing. It was a big wake up call to me looking back seeing how much presence I left. Many accounts are so old I can’t even get into them anymore to clean up what’s out there. Tools like this can be used for good.That said, I totally understand the cyber stalking/bullying concerns. I am also astounded by the cyber sleuth types. In the documentary, Don’t F* with Cats, people spent 100s of hours carefully walking through streets in Google Maps to match a location to a photo they had of a guy who killed a cat on YouTube. It seems to me where there’s a will, there’s a way. It’s scary, and unfortunately a lot of tools we can use to protect ourselves are the same tools that can be used against us.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think that anyone developing a social media app for the 2020s will need to make a conscious decision to not let users pick their own unique identifiers. You can&#39;t expect users to protect themselves, because you don&#39;t know what dangers might exist in the future for them that do not exist today.The other thing you can do is not allow your API to iterate over the set of all users by user-set identifier. It&#39;s an extreme flaw of the telephone numbering system. You would think by the 2020s we&#39;d have learned to use a unique UUID designation for every user for any public facing APIs.

We’re forgetting how to unplug unless it’s a product or service that we can buy.The distraction issue is the number one issue holding back most of the young people in the mentorship group I’m part of. They’re so glued to their phones to check minute-by-minute updates about COVID death tolls, how big their stimulus checks are going to be, the value of their crypto portfolio, GameStop, and every other popular topic under the sun that they don’t have any attention left for their own lives.Bitcoin is especially distracting right now, as they’re all nervously watching the real-time changes of their $1000 portfolios to see if they need to be sad about losing money because it’s crashing or sad about not investing more money because it’s going up.These are all smart students.

Also, I remember that most things we covered in school were completely irrelevant for the real world. So a difficulty to concentrate on school stuff may actually be better than doing the homework.In short, ignoring what society considers normal and instead being super focused on your own things ... sounds more healthy to me than the average &#34;normal&#34; person."</p>

There are endpoint tools which collect MD5’s, network scanners which collect MD5s, and I have heard about actual infosec directors who, upon seeing a blog post like that, would carefully type the hashes in their endpoint management interface to make sure their org is not infected.How on earth can this be effective? It is trivial to create customized binaries in the installer, so no two users have the same file checksum. With a bit of work, one can rig their download server so each user has a completely different installer checksum as well.I remember reading about polymorphic viruses back in the 1990’s - not only those had different checksums for each  computer, they also had no long-ish substrings common between two versions, making signature analysis ineffective. Did malware authors just forgot about all those and went back to trivial “everyone gets the same image” strategy?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Mistakes I&#39;ve seen eng mgrs make:- not acknowledging obvious elephants in the room- not building enough trust early on with their reports that when a problem comes up, the information they get is biased as they are seen as part of leadership/management and not the team- applying pressure in the wrong direction (ie; if the team is moving slow because of stress or fear, making things more stressful will not speed things up)- trying too hard to be friends with all their reports, rather than figuring out the appropriate boundaries on a person to person basis- relaying anonymous information around in an effort to &#34;protect people&#34; and thus making themselves the go-between between all members on a team rather than encouraging people to work things out themselves- for ICs that then became mgrs, staying way too focused on the in the weeds details and not on the bigger picture or people details, up to an including still spending too much time coding or trying to do PR reviews that carry too much weight--I would actually go so far as to say that the best &#34;IC turned managers&#34; I&#39;ve had have been about at par with the most mediocre &#34;good people mgrs that didn&#39;t come through coding for that role&#34;, and the people in that role that excelled at it (a motley crew of former stage managers, teachers, guidance counselors, project managers, etc)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; She was on a steady track to land a senior role. Even after I decided to leave the company, I let the next manager know this person is track for a senior position in the next few months.Its very naive to think, that the manager replacing you will see eye to eye with you. I have seen countless occasions, where the engineer in the team who is ontrack for promotion doesnt get it, because the management above has changed.While being in IC role, I never relied on the company to promote me. Its better to jump ships than reestablish the relationship with new manager. It takes same amount of work anyway. At least jumping ship will give you much higher compensation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Running an alternative OS &#34;natively&#34; on a Mac doesn&#39;t seem very appealing to me. It&#39;s almost guaranteed you will never fully get Wi-Fi, audio, graphics acceleration, the trackpad, etc. working flawlessly, especially on the M1 where almost every component is Apple proprietary and it&#39;s not a matter of loading, say, some common Intel graphics driver.On the other hand, virtualization _already_ lets you run whatever arm64 BSD, Linux, or Windows that you want. The trackpad and everything else will work flawlessly thanks to guest additions. Yes, you make some tradeoffs -- you sacrifice a core, a few GB of RAM, some disk space for an OS you don&#39;t _really_ want to be running. But I&#39;m skeptical that these are not better tradeoffs than constantly using a hacked-together and half-broken OS.To me the ideal solution is not that Corellium or Marcan or whoever reverse engineers the drivers to a sufficient degree. I&#39;d rather see Apple (or the Hackintosh types) release a tiny variant of macOS that contains hardware drivers and Hypervisor.framework and not much else. It could be the next generation of Boot Camp and it would probably take less engineering effort for them to maintain while satisfying the small segment of customers interested in running other operating systems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fantastic. OpenBSD on an M1 Mac Mini would be a great home server.As for desktop, I love cwm on my thinkpads, but macbook touchpads have won me over. That said, if arcan gets to a usable state on OpenBSD, I wouldn&#39;t mind sinking a few weekends (and/or crates of beer) into helping with improving touchpad/gesture support. X11 is just too daunting to have me bothered."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So much for the many remarks made on HN claiming that Apple would use the M1 to further exert control over users’ ability to boot an alternative OS. Between this and Asahi Linux, I’d say things are off to a good start.Btw, Asahi has a Patreon page for anyone who wants to contribute. I’m tossing twelve bucks a month and recommend any Mac users with interest in booting alternative OSes support such projects.Now I’m gonna see if there’s an option to throw money at this."</p>
