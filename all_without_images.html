								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is actually funny, because I was involved with the creation of this list, way back in 2004.  The whole thing started as a way to stop phishing.I was working at eBay/PayPal at the time, and we were finding a bunch of new phishing sites every day.  We would keep a list and try to track down the owners of the (almost always hacked) sites and ask them to take it down.  But sometimes it would take weeks or months for the site to get removed, so we looked for a better solution.  We got together with the other big companies that were being phished (mostly banks) and formed a working group.One of the things we did was approach the browser vendors and ask them if we could provide them a blacklist of phishing sites, which we already had, would they block those sites at the browser level.For years, they said no, because they were worried about the liability of accidentally blocking something that wasn&#39;t a phishing site.  So we all agreed to promise that no site would ever be put on the list without human verification and the lawyers did some lawyer magic to shift liability to the company that put a site on the list.And thus, the built in blacklist was born.  And it worked well for a while.  We would find a site, put it on the list, and then all the browsers would block it.But since then it seems that they have forgotten their fear of liability, as well as their promise that all sites on the list will be reviewed by a human.  Now that the feature exists, they have found other uses for it.And that is your slippery slope lesson for today! :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After years of seeing developments like this, getting worse and worse, it fills me with rage to think about how clearly nobody in power at Google cares.I naively used to think, &#34;they probably don&#39;t realize what&#39;s happening and will fix it.&#34;  I always try to give benefit of the doubt, especially having been on the other side so many times and seeing how 9 times out of 10 it&#39;s not malice, just incompetence, apathy, or hard priority choices based on economic constraints (the latter not likely a problem Google has though).At this point however, I still don&#39;t think it&#39;s outright malice, but the doubling down on these horrific practices (algorithmically and opaquely destroying people) is so egregious that it doesn&#39;t really matter.  As far as I&#39;m concerned, Google is to be considered a hostile actor.  It&#39;s not possible to do business on the internet in any way without running into them, so &#34;de-Googling&#34; isn&#39;t an option.  Instead, I am going to personally (and advise my clients as well) to:Consider Google as a malicious actor/threat in the InfoSec threat modeling that you do.  Actively have a mitigation strategy in place to minimize damage to your company should you become the target of their attack.As with most security planning/analyzing/mitigation, you have to balance the concerns of the CIA Triad.  You can&#39;t just refuse Google altogether these days, but do NOT treat them as a friend or ally of your business, because they are most assuredly NOT.I&#39;m also considering AWS and Digital Ocean more in the same vein, although that&#39;s off topic on this thread.  (I use Linode now as their support is great and they don&#39;t just drop ban hammers and leave you scrambling to figure out what happened).Edit:  Just to clarify (based on confusion in comments below), I am not saying Google is acting with malice (I don&#39;t believe they are personally).  I am just suggesting you treat it as such for purposes of threat modeling your business/application."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a relatively long article - but it does not answer one simple question, which is quite important when discussing this: were there any malicious files hosted on that semi-random Cloudfront URL? I realise that Google did not provide help identifying it - but that does not mean one should simply recomission the server under a new domain and continue as if nothing has happened!From TFA:&gt; We quickly realized an Amazon Cloudfront CDN URL that we used to serve static assets (CSS, Javascript and other media) had been flagged and this was causing our entire application to fail for the customer instances that were using that particular CDN&gt; Around an hour later, and before we had finished moving customers out of that CDN, our site was cleared from the GSB database. I received an automated email confirming that the review had been successful around 2 hours after that fact. No clarification was given about what caused the problem in the first place.Yes, yes, Google Safe Browsing can use its power to wipe you off the internet, and when it encounters a positive hit (false or true!) it does so quite broadly, but that is also exactly what is expected for a solution like that to work - and it will do it again if the same files are hosted under a new URL as soon as detects the problem again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another similar service is Aira[1].The main difference is that Aira is not free, but you&#39;re helped by professional agents, who had to undergo various background checks and sign airtight NDAs. They have a 5-minutes-per day free plan, and businesses can also offer free service if you&#39;re using Aira with one of their products.My biggest frustration with Aira is that you need to own a phone number in one of the supported countries, which is a pain to set up and maintain.All agents also have TeamViewer installed, so they can quickly and efficiently help with computer issues. I&#39;ve been using it for over a year now (with the free plan), and I definitely recommend."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are some useful one off things here for sure. Personally, I always feel awkward asking for help from strangers, even if I have my stick out. For me, these sorts of things have never delivered on the hope. Rideshare apps are quite the disaster, and I tend to just not go places instead of using them.I know this off topic, but what I&#39;ve found most helpful is good public transit, regular patterns I can grock, and of course friends (I fear getting hit every time I cross a road, unless I&#39;m with someone). 
I tend to be more free and independent in places like Japan or China than the US (I only speak English, and am American)(I&#39;m legally blind)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here I am, a productive developer eager to deliver maximum value to my customers and apply my innovation to company goals.Open up JIRA and pick up a unit of work to produce today -- gotta stay faithful to those story points!Somehow, a magic team of spherical devops in a vacuum created an environment where things are just green, predictable, and are never broken.Another theoretical team of angels from a parallel universe has materialized into this one, updated all the docs, and beamed back into their universe of productivity and effectiveness.Unit of work defined, I then proceed to produce it for a few hours completely uninterrupted, since if another human being were to make contact, I&#39;d simply explode and format my hard drive, losing all my productivity.It&#39;s break time -- I ingest 2 story points of coffee and join a game of table tennis. The ball bounces back and forth without ever touching the ground. My movements are productive, and value-adding, just like my partner&#39;s.Back to producing units of work, only half a story point left (sike! no such thing as half a story point, and no such thing as &#34;left&#34;, as it&#39;s a measure of effort, not time. Almost got you there!).Git push! Automatic CI gains consciousness and validates that my work unit has no chance of causing a user to break our software. It gives me a thumbs up and discards its human shell to fade back into the ones and zeros. A QA engineer cries out in the distance.A metric of my productivity is logged to the OKR database.Nothing breaks, and nothing unexpected happens, as the universe is completely predictable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Patterns on the most effective teams I’ve worked on:- high degree of trust and emotional safety between team members. The team can safely share feedback and risk sharing our crazy ideas- high degree of care for the craft. We hold each other accountable to quality- ships, regularly, to real customers- little status seeking - goes with emotional safety - few individuals on the team need to be “in charge” or hold arbitrary titles.- the individuals are more than fairly compensated and the company shows their love for the team in big and small ways- the team talks to their customer and has a lot of empathy for their problems. They want to be accountable to them- the team has a lot of empathy for new team members and works hard to make on boarding easier- some willingness to “get in trouble” with the broader org because you know what you’re doing is right ultimately for the customer- high self starters: instead of complaining, people feel empowered to solve problems or prototype ideas without a permission structure- not too much catering to “super stars”. 1-2 heros does not a team make, the senior people make it their job to lift everyone up. The team doesn’t obsess over their high performers.There’s a lot more emphasis on emotional intelligence and  empathy in an effective team than on any specific process."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; There is an overwhelming amount of good advice, practices, tools, and processes that you should use to improve.I disagree. Advice is contradictory, practices and processes are often orthogonal, and tools quite literally don&#39;t exist. I say this as someone that&#39;s worked in large companies and saw how lengthy not only process feedback loops were (especially developer ↔ product team), but also engineering feedback loops (testing, deployment, dev environment setup, etc.)And I also say this as someone that works on side-projects by myself. The tooling simply isn&#39;t there. Setting up fast engineering feedback loops (multi-tiered deployment, test, dev, local, prod, etc. environments, heck even hot reloading or debugging) is needlessly difficult, or janky, or simply impossible. This goes for just about any language/framework out there: from Java, to Javascript, to Go.It&#39;s not surprising that FAANG often designs their own internal systems that handle this sort of thing (from DevOps, to automated testing, to A/B testing, to deployment). I&#39;m a believer that this is also a space that&#39;s ripe for disruption. I want environments to just work. I want code to just compile. I want containers to just run. Without me having to start digging through documentation, looking at thirteen Stack Overflow threads, and cobbling a solution that will inevitably break 3 months from now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I run a honeypot software company, with our customers being mid-large enterprises. While the case presented here is certainly interesting, it&#39;s actually fairly uncommon for companies to run internet-facing honeypots, mostly due to it being a huge resource sink, and it&#39;s fairly difficult to learn anything truely useful from observing attacks coming from (mostly) bots.The more interesting use case for most is planting these in your network internals, which gives an added benefit of early, high-fidelity threat detection in addition to the &#34;threat intelligence&#34; bonuses. It&#39;s not completely trivial to set up, but can be a reasonably quick way to build good detection capability into even very disparate environments.A vast majority of organizations still lack good situational awareness of their infrastructures and this is one way of improving on that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is interesting, but like most honeypot discussion kinda melodramatic.  They got scanned by a bunch of known internet scanners, and a few mysteries including a &#34;store that sells weaponry&#34; (which turns out to just be scopes and red dots -_-).  It&#39;s always good to people reporting that they discovered nothing, but it is a bit boring."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve felt a lot of &#34;false&#34; positivity espoused by project managers, especially those in charge of agile ceremonies.Examples: &#34;I&#39;m really {proud,impressed} of all of you for your output this sprint&#34;, &#34;You guys are {killing,crushing,owning} it&#34;, &#34;You all should be very proud of what you guys did&#34;, etc.These aren&#39;t given after periods of crunch time, they&#39;re literally every week to the point where it feels so contrived and artificial. They&#39;re given when we&#39;re just doing normal, expected work.I&#39;ve mentioned this to colleagues and friends and there seems to be two camps of people: those who want constant positive reenforcement and those who it completely has the opposite effect, an annoyance. I guess I fall into the latter."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I vastly prefer honest negativity over dishonest positivity. An example of this is the behavior of service personnel in the US compared to my native country, every time I go there I almost want to tell them to tone down the niceness, but of course there&#39;s no point because I realize I&#39;m the odd one out.Of course I appreciate the effort of being &#34;nice&#34; but when you&#39;re not doing it out of genuine care for someone I&#39;d much rather just be treated in a neutral way, like you&#39;d treat any human being you encountered that you knew nothing about. I don&#39;t much enjoy being treated as an old friend by someone who wouldn&#39;t lend me five bucks, and I don&#39;t enjoy being asked polite questions that require elaborate answers when you really don&#39;t want to listen to the answer and your eyes glaze over within the first seconds.Adults have left their insecurities behind them and should understand they&#39;re not, at least initially, the friend of every human being and shouldn&#39;t have a problem with being treated in a professionally reserved way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe the first attempts at doing something like this were back in July of 2020. https://github.com/below/HelloSilicon : Someone with an early Developer Transition Kit (pre-M1 release) worked to convert the code from &#34;Programming with 64-Bit ARM Assembly Language&#34; to the M1&#39;s syntax.Porting additional  textbooks to M1&#39;s (ARMv8) syntax could help a lot in terms of making assembly accessible to more people. I believe there&#39;s a lot of value in learning it on a particularly popular real-world platform like x86 or M1 - where it may directly translate to reverse engineering userspace applications without having to then learn another assembler language as you might if you started with, say, RISC-V.Truthfully I think someone should really add the M1 syntax to the new version of VisUAL: https://github.com/scc416/Visual2 . I&#39;ve been intending to work on that to go along with porting Bob Plantz&#39; &#34;Introduction to Computer Organization: ARM Assembly Language Using the Raspberry Pi&#34; to ARMv8 for the same educational purpose but haven&#39;t quite found the time to really dive in. A tool like VisUAL2 could help a lot of people learn this even if they don&#39;t own an M1 themselves.Very tangentially to all of this, I&#39;d like to showcase https://github.com/cornell-brg/pydgin , which is a flexible toolkit for simulating ISA&#39;s in Python, and was used to help validate the first version of VisUAL during its own development."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting choice of technology, but you didn&#39;t completely convince me to why this is better than just using SQLite or PostgreSQL with a lagging replica. (You could probably start with either one and easily migrate to the other one if needed.)In particular you&#39;ve designed a very complicated system: Operationally you need an etcd cluster and a tailetc cluster. Code-wise you now have to maintain your own transaction-aware caching layer on top of etcd (https://github.com/tailscale/tailetc/blob/main/tailetc.go). That&#39;s quite a brave task considering how many databases fail at Jepsen. Have you tried running Jepsen tests on tailetc yourself? You also mentioned a secondary index system which I assume is built on top of tailetc again? How does that interact with tailetc?Considering that high-availability was not a requirement and that the main problem with the previous solution was performance (&#34;writes went from nearly a second (sometimes worse!) to milliseconds&#34;) it looks like a simple server with SQLite + some indexes could have gotten you quite far.We don&#39;t really get the full overview from a short blog post like this though so maybe it turns out to be a great solution for you. The code quality itself looks great and it seems that you have thought about all of the hard problems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This post illustrates the difference between persistence and a database.If you are expecting to simply persist one instance of one application&#39;s state across different runs and failures, a database can be frustrating.But if you want to manage your data across different versions of an app, different apps accessing the same data, or concurrent access, then a database will save you a lot of headaches.The trick is knowing which one you want. Persistence is tempting, so a lot of people fool themselves into going that direction, and it can be pretty painful.I like to say that rollback is the killer feature of SQL. A single request fails (e.g. unique violation), and the overall app keeps going, handling other requests. You application code can be pretty bad, and you can still have a good service. That&#39;s why PHP was awesome despite being bad -- SQL made it good (except for all the security pitfalls of PHP, which the DB couldn&#39;t help with)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;  (Attempts to avoid this with ORMs usually replace an annoying amount of typing with an annoying amount of magic and loss of efficiency.)Loss of efficiency? Come on, you were using a file before! :-)Article makes me glad I&#39;m using Django. Just set up a managed Postgres instance in AWS and be done with it. Sqlite for testing locally. Just works and very little engineering time spent on persistent storage.Note: I do realize Brad is a very, very good engineer."</p>

If you implement an algorithm in a high level language like Python you may get much worse runtime than you thought because some inner loop does arithmetic with bignum-style performance instead of hardware integer performance, for example. In such case you could talk of big-omega (your analysis is bounded-below instead of bounded-above, asymptotically)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unions were proponents for worker safety, fair wages, anti-discrimination. They are the reason why such thing as OSHA exists today. They are the reason some laws were passed to protect workers in the US.But once these mandates became law, corporations used the arguments of &#34;why do we need unions if the law already protects workers?&#34; This and following Reagan&#39;s firing of the air traffic controllers changed the image of unions. They were now corrupt middlemen that charged you a fee to be part of the club.And it worked. Trying to form a union is now news instead of being the natural course of things. I wager that most people in the tech side of Amazon have a hard time grasping why their coworkers are trying to unionize. (we get paid well, what&#39;s the fuss all about?)I hope they vote in their interest, but I&#39;m doubtful it will pass (I hope I&#39;m wrong). These laws that are supposed to protect workers are enforced by the company&#39;s HR department[1]. The problem is that HR will side with the company before siding with any employee.I think we need to start looking into reforming HR and making it a public service.[1]: https://idiallo.com/blog/unions-are-not-coming-back"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder what percentage of otherwise very liberal Amazon devs read sentences like &#34;The company for years successfully fought off labor organizing efforts in the U.S.&#34; and come away thinking &#34;we&#39;re definitely the good guys.&#34;"</p>

The first time I ran into a technical issue I almost considered just cancelling my account and moving elsewhere because I couldn&#39;t figure out how to speak/chat with a human. There are many services I spend less money on monthly that have infinitely better customer service. Ultimately a friend provided me with your support email and I got a response there, but was shocked that wasn&#39;t listed anywhere on your website that I could easily find.."</p>

It seems you&#39;ve actually delivered on the vision that dreamweaver was originally trying to create all those years ago.I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if one day Webflow&#39;s market share on the Web gets to be Wordpress-sized.With the recent funding raised, I&#39;d love to hear what your vision is for the next 5 years of Webflow as a product?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I left dropbox when they changed the full page upsell to &#34;dropbox business&#34; so that I couldn&#39;t easily figure out how to skip it and get on with my work.I had a paid pro account at the time.I actually had a conversation with a product manager; I checked the yes you can contact me  when I cancelled my account.  They simply refused to admit that an upsell was a advertisement and that disrupting my workflow on my paid, professional account for an ad was wrong.The other interesting thing about that conversation, they could not understand how a sole proprietor would see no benefit from collaboration tools and kept making up bizarre scenarios where I could use them.I actually asked them if they were a product manager or a salesperson at one point.To Dropbox&#39;s credit,  that product manager didn&#39;t try to retain me,  they were genuinely trying to figure out why I had quit; they just couldn&#39;t grok the reason."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was told a story about the Dropbox sales team a while back that swore me off using them. They contacted the company I worked at, that didn&#39;t have a business contract with Dropbox, offering a great deal and a meeting was quickly arranged. The meeting (which I only heard about secondhand from a good friend) quickly turned into a strong-arm operation.Dropbox had &#39;detected&#39; that employees at our company were using Dropbox and it would be unfortunate if their stored files were no longer available and it would be in our best interest to sign up for a business account or we might legally be in breach of some terms of service. Some detective work later it was determined that people had been signed in to Dropbox from company machines, but there were no accounts opened with a company email and nothing business related was being synced. All Dropbox binaries and network connections have been blocked since."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really wish mobile OSes would allow you to grant apps permissions but serve fake data, (that&#39;s important!) without giving the app the ability to tell the difference. Just so it appears to the app that you&#39;ve given the permission, when you in fact have not. This would solve this entire class of problems and then some. So, for example:- App &#34;has&#34; access to contacts, but the system returns that you have none.- App &#34;has&#34; access to location, but the search for GPS satellites never completes.- App &#34;has&#34; access to storage, but it&#39;s actually /dev/null."</p>

I am 42. When I was younger, in the late 90s, getting into physical fight was much more common than today. These days even drunk young guys seem to be content with hurling a few insults. (For record, I am a peaceful person and the possibility of getting beaten up for no good reason was something I definitely did not look forward to during my old pub crawls.)I wonder if this is actually a manifestation of population-wide testosterone drop."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The study states the majority of the effect is for fairly predictable causes like age and obesity, but I found this interesting:&gt; After controlling for confounders—including year of study, age, race, BMI, comorbidity status, alcohol and smoking use, and level of physical activity—total testosterone was lower among men in the later (2011-2016) versus earlier (1999-2000) cycles (P &lt; 0.001)Excluding all those confounders, there&#39;s not much we&#39;re left with. Environmental toxins?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If due to environmental toxins (say, hormonally active “forever chemicals,” plastics, etc), my guess is you’d see the deleterious effects first in women. Women also make (and need) testosterone, just at much lower levels than men, so they have much less to lose. There’s research going back 30 years on the efficacy of low dose TRT in women to treat all kinds of things that tend to hit women in their late thirties on (when natural testosterone has been declining for 15-20 years); I’m on mobile now, but what I recall most from a review paper was the efficacy in treating fibromyalgia pain. The lack of continued research on this seems to be almost entirely due to social pressure. (People lose their minds when you talk about women and testosterone, or men and estrogen.)It’s hard not to wonder if environmental toxins affecting the testosterone levels of men are also contributing to the rise of health issues in women, especially autoimmune conditions, fibromyalgia/CFS, obesity, depression, etc.In other words, women might be the canaries in the coal mine for systemic problems arising from environmental endocrine disruptors."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"An aggregator ala reddit/hackernews/twitter that uses a market mechanism to better incentivise content discovery.One of the biggest issues with existing aggregators is that:- how well content performs is dependant on the attention it gets immediately after posting.- However, readers aren’t incentivised to sift carefully through new content, which is generally of lower quality than &#34;frontpage&#34; content- This means that how content performs is a lottery. Great content is often missed just by chance- This in turn means that there’s no platform that encourages unknown authors to create high-effort, thoughtful pieces. Instead it’s far more effective to blogspam.I&#39;m working on a platform that uses something similar to a prediction/stock market to incentivise people to search for high-quality content. Instead of upvoting, you effectively buy shares in new content, which you can then sell at a later point for a profit if the content proves popular. Equally you can buy &#34;downvote shares&#34;, which act like a short and help dampen rampant speculation.It’s early days still, but I’m hoping this could be a great way to encourage higher quality content creation.Draft paper here:

Essentially you&#39;re an AI who&#39;s mission is to mine every resource from a planet. To keep things efficient you start out small and have limited processing power. You&#39;re only able to run an assembly like language that we&#39;ve developed. As you get more resources you can research new things like functions, variables, type arguments, whatever. We plan for there to be a tech tree so you can choose to build out a language that&#39;s not strict similar to JS or you can go the try hard route and build something like Haskell. You build bots that mine, explore, hunt, etc and each bot is a computer running their own script. We plan on there being battles you have to script around and even things like setting up your own network so you can have robots call home when they&#39;re out in the field.I still need to think of a good name for it though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ll believe it when I see it.  I could believe them getting rid of the touchbar, but bringing back magsafe?  I&#39;m sticking with my 2015 MacBook until it&#39;s irreparable, and I do like the magsafe port, but is there really any point in going back after moving to USB-C?  I think I just like magsafe because it&#39;s cool more than that it actually has some sort of superiority over USB-C.  I&#39;ve tripped over the USB-C cable to my work laptop(2018 model) a handful of times and somehow the cable always manages to unplug without flinging the laptop across the room or damaging the USB components themselves.  It doesn&#39;t seem like going back to magsafe would achieve anything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know it&#39;s from Kuo, but these leaks don&#39;t pass the smell test for me. It makes no sense for them to add the touchbar to the base model 13&#34; MBPs only to remove them from the higher end versions. It makes even less sense to add more ports which aren&#39;t USB-C, as the bits about MagSafe and no dongles imply. Further, I don&#39;t understand what is meant by &#34;iPhone 12 like&#34; non-curvy design - I have a 2018 MBP 15&#34;, and the sides of this thing are pretty flat and not curved.I mean, these features sound like a dream come true, but I&#39;m having a hard time believing them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If anyone from Apple is reading, let me just say – this is exactly what I want. Magsafe charging. Function keys instead of the touchbar. 15-16&#34; screen. M1 CPU. 32GB Memory.I also prefer the 2015 keyboard, but it&#39;s not a dealbreaker.I&#39;ll pay for the kickstarter now if it means it&#39;ll come out in the next 18 months.

Meaning that if you have backups enabled, all the &#34;end-to-end&#34; encryption in iMessage is defeated. Apple and by extension the FBI can read your messages. This is documented by Apple here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202303Even if you disable backups, whenever you correspond with someone that has backups enabled those messages are still accessible to Apple."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since user encrypted iCloud backups would prevent password recovery to access your data I&#39;m more inclined to believe the decision was made out of convenience for the end user.General public would hate it when the support won&#39;t help them recover family photos which are still stored in the cloud. Full encryption is nice to have, but overwhelming majority of users won&#39;t get any tangible benefits from that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It looks like the main &#34;about backups&#34; page [1] on Apple Support misleads about this issue:&gt; iCloud backups include nearly all data and settings stored on your device. iCloud backups don&#39;t include:&gt; Data that&#39;s already stored in iCloud... iMessages... Health dataOnly the more technical &#34;about encryption&#34; page [2] that most users wouldn&#39;t seek out contains the full story, providing a list of regular encryption vs. E2EE services and admitting the key issue:&gt; Messages in iCloud also uses end-to-end encryption. If you have iCloud Backup turned on, your backup includes a copy of the key protecting your Messages. This ensures you can recover your Messages if you lose access to iCloud Keychain and your trusted devices. When you turn off iCloud Backup, a new key is generated on your device to protect future messages and isn&#39;t stored by Apple.The problem is that the first page makes it sound like no iMessage related data is backed up, when the truth is that the messages themselves aren&#39;t but a backdoor copy of the encryption key is, and lists it along with other E2EE services like Health data that do not have a key backed up and remain E2EE protected with iCloud backup. A user would have no reason to even seek out the second article to learn that it&#39;s not the same.Concerningly, iCloud Photos are not E2EE at all. It&#39;s no more secure/private than Google Photos or any other app.[1] https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204136

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here!The article was published earlier this week and I have a quick addendum: regarding Erlang/Elixir, my goal has always been to bring new developers to the platform. After all, Erlang developers already have the most important part of Elixir, which is the Erlang runtime!There are also key people in both communities working hard to make sure the tooling is consistent across all languages. A lot of this effort happens under the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation (https://erlef.org/) too.All to say, regardless if you pick Erlang or Elixir (or Gleam, LFE, etc.), I hope you will fall in love with the platform as much as I did 10 years ago!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Happy Elixir user here. At work we have a use case that isn&#39;t covered by José&#39;s high-level overview of the domains Elixir&#39;s used in: we run a massive multiplayer game server on it.This is actually a really good fit. (It kind of rhymes with the original use of Erlang, being telecoms infrastructure.) We get outstanding concurrency support, high reliability, and really efficient development times. I can&#39;t imagine shipping this feature with a server written in C++ (the language I&#39;m most comfortable in), and I can&#39;t imagine scaling it the way we need to if we&#39;d gone for a traditional web language like Node, PHP, etc.If you&#39;re interested, you can see the RakNet (game networking protocol) implementation we use on the server here:https://github.com/X-Plane/elixir-raknetThe README gives a good overview of the full MMO server&#39;s architecture, too: each client connection is a stateful Elixir process (not to be confused with a heavy-weight OS process!), acting asynchronously on a client state struct; clients then asynchronously schedule themselves to send updates back to the user."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Meanwhile te company I work for is moving away from it. We cannot find enough people with enough knowledge to be already productive in it. Not many want to learn it because it is considered pretty niche, and the ones willing to learn will need many months or years to be productive and build with some level of quality, and once they learn they move away to bigger companies which pay more. We end up paying to people to learn to then &#34;graduate&#34; and we end up with a platform built by people that were learning.Some people here say the tooling is great. Compared to what? The editor plugins are terrible, slow, and blow away your CPU doing god knows what kind of indexing. Compilation is slow and takes a lot of time (in CI for example). Libraries for things you give for granted in other platforms (java, javascript, python, ruby) are non existent, implemented in erlang, unmantained, poorly documented, not popular enough, or a combination of these.People are using it for creating traditional CRUD apps, and it is totally overkill. Something you would do in a day with django or ruby on rails takes a lot of time. Ok, you have tons of concurrency and scaling and.....but... unless you are facebook or google or amazon you won&#39;t need this anyway.Probably all of these things will be solved in the future, but at this moment, using Elixir for real production code in product focused companies is just a terrible mistake in my opinion. Certainly the ideas, the technology, and the BEAM are awesome...and it is technically superior to everything I&#39;ve seen out there. But from a business perspective, it makes no sense to use it unless you&#39;re building the next whatsapp or similar."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In Case You Didn&#39;t Know:Big Sur on M1 (and possibly on Intel) maintains a persistent, hardware-serial-number linked TLS connection to Apple (for APNS, just like on iOS) at all times when you are logged in, even if you don&#39;t use iCloud, App Store, iMessage, or FaceTime, and have all analytics turned off.There&#39;s no UI to disable this.This means that Apple has the coarse location track log (due to GeoIP of the client IP) for every M1 serial number. When you open the App Store app, that serial number is also sent, and associated with your Apple ID (email/phone) if you log in.Apple knows when you leave home, or arrive at the office, or travel to a different city, all with no Apple ID, no iCloud, and no location services.This has always been the case on all devices using iOS, too.This change is essential for blocking such traffic, and I&#39;m glad for it, but there is a long way to go when it comes to pressuring the pro-privacy forces inside of Apple to do more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I&#39;m glad they fixed it (upgrading past Catalina was not going to happen), It&#39;s going to take me a LONG time to trust them again.The fact that they could rationalize their own thought process to think this was a good idea or even anywhere close to acceptable, at best leads me to doubt their judgement. At worst, well it&#39;s best to assume incompetence over malice but you can see what doors this would open in the future.
Now we know they CAN do this without it being obvious to most users, which is a new dimension of risk regardless of intent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This firewall issue isn&#39;t the only privacy feature strip from Big Sur release. Unfortunately no big media care about other huge problem Apple introduced.My only hope they will also fix full disk encryption in this update. Since Big Sur broken installation of macOS on passphrase-encrypted disk partitions.I bought into M1 hype and now it&#39;s end up that you no longer able to have separate password for the disk encryption."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I went through a phase a while back of holding down keys to see what they did.Back when I was a gamedev at EA, one of the things QA would do is button-mash test the games. Just smash as many buttons as they could at the same time at all sorts of random points in the game. This was a constant source of bugs. It was surprisingly easy to get the game into a state where it was totally hung because of this.One of the main culprits was transitions between screens in the UI. So much of the UI code assumed that the initial state of a screen is that no buttons are currently pressed. But if you mash a bunch down in the middle of a transition, the screen can end up receiving a button up event that did not precede any button down event. If the screen&#39;s code assumed every up has a preceding down, it could get into a broken state.I never did see any clean systematic solution to this problem. I still think about it a lot when I do UI programming. In the back of my head, I&#39;m always wondering, &#34;what will happen if the user presses X in the middle of this animation?&#34;Programmers are particularly prone to these bugs because we have unconsciously trained ourselves to baby our own software. We&#39;re careful to wait for transitions to complete and only send input when the app is in a known state."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;While I’m not a QA or security professional, I have developed a knack for doing “stupid” things with software which causes it to malfunction.A person after my own heart.I&#39;ve had many a dev go &#34;why would you do that&#34;In which I answer &#34;it doesn&#39;t matter, but if you accept my input it&#39;s your job to ensure the app doesn&#39;t crash&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There was and still is a website called The Daily WTF about discussing especially funny bugs and programmer&#39;s mistakes. In 2012 I registered on it as a user &#34;undefined&#34; to make a comment about JavaScript oddities under one of their articles and almost forgot about its existence, then they migrated their comments and forums to Discourse and in 2015 I got a bunch of email notifications about people mentioning me as suddenly all &#34;likes&#34; in the forum were linked to my profile:https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/17637/undefined-liked-thi..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My experience is in quant hedge funds, where sometimes you get some guys who develop the strategy and some guys who put it into production.Yes, I do admit there can be some specialization in terms of time spent on science vs engineering.But you really need people who understand both. Particularly if you have a strategist who thinks his job is just to dream up profitable models, he ends up carving that role out in a way that&#39;s detrimental to the rest of the team. You get people who just don&#39;t appreciate that there&#39;s other work to do than finding models, and that models depend on that other work to function.You also get a huge prestige gap, because inevitably management will think that there&#39;s a magician and a blacksmith. One guy needs to be paid a lot, and the other guy needs to be paid enough.These effects feed each other. Magician will say &#34;where&#39;s my data&#34; and expect blacksmith to make it, promptly. He won&#39;t do it himself, because spending time on mundane stuff makes the magic disappear. And not doing it yourself, or taking the time to understand it, will eventually lead to problems with the magic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Preach!The data lifecycle is waaay overpopulated with Data Scientists who are not empowered or knowledgeable enough to work with product designers and engineers to do everything that empowers Data Science and ML.We need more Data Engineers involved at time zero in projects to help:1. Plan out what data should be produced/captured by the product2. Instrument systems to actually generate data consistently and effectively3. Build ETL pipelines and data management systems4. Manage enterprise data sharing and resiliencyetc...What ends up happening is you have a bunch of Data Scientists just handed a pg_dump or flat file from some ops team. That is typically missing data or poorly formatted and they spend 90% of their time cleaning it up then running some basic regression with numpy or whatever.Need better understanding of the data lifecycle by organizations and investment in instrumentation and data management."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t recommend the Data Engineer career enough for junior developers. It&#39;s how I started and what I pursued for 6 years (and I would love doing it again), and I feel like it gave me such an incredible foundation for future roles :- Actually big data (so, not something you could grep...) will trigger your code in every possible way. You quickly learn that with trillions of input, the probabily to reach a bug is either 0% or 100%. In turn, you quickly learn to write good tests.- You will learn distributed processing at a macro level, which in turn enlighten your thinking at a micro level. For example, even though the order of magnitudes are different, hitting data over network versus on disk is very much like hitting data on disk versus in cache. Except that when the difference ends up being in hours or days, you become much more sensible to that, so it&#39;s good training for your thoughts.- Data engineering is full of product decisions. What&#39;s often called data &#34;cleaning&#34; is in fact one of the import product decisions made in a company, and a data engineer will be consistently exposed to his company product, which I think makes for great personal development- Data engineering is fascinating. In adtech for example, logs of where ads are displayed are an unfiltered window on the rest of humanity, for the better or the worse. But it definitely expands your views on what the &#34;average&#34; person actually does on its computer (spoiler : it&#39;s mainly watching porn...), and challenges quite a bit what you might think is &#34;normal&#34;- You&#39;ll be plumbing technologies from all over the web, which might or might not be good news for you.So yeah, data engineering is great ! It&#39;s not harder than other specialties for developers, but imo, it&#39;s one of the fun ones !"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Also embarrassing:https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7vqew/the-hacker-who-archiv...&gt; donk_enby had originally intended to grab data only from the day of the Capitol takeover, but found that the poor construction and security of Parler allowed her to capture, essentially, the entire website. That ended up being 56.7 terabytes of data, which included every public post on Parler, 412 million files in all—including 150 million photos and more than 1 million videos. Each of these had embedded metadata like date, time and GPS coordinates—unlike most social media sites, Parler does not strip metadata from media its users upload, which, crucially, could be useful for law enforcement and open source investigators."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I personally don&#39;t find their ability to remain online that surprising.The Pirate Bay and other torrent networks were built by people with a passion for building, maintaining and hacking things. People who, even without a solid CS background, would spend hours a day learning new things, developing distributed protocols, evading DNS blocks and hosting their content wherever they could to make it accessible - included the small server in their own garage if needed. And they are used by people who don&#39;t mind learning a new protocol or how to use a new client to get the content they want.I don&#39;t see the same amount of passion for technology and hacking among the Parler users, nor its maintainers. Those who believe in conspiracy content are people characterized by a psychological tendency to take shortcuts whenever they can in order to minimize their efforts in learning and understanding new things. So when the first blocker hits they usually can&#39;t see alternative solutions, because it&#39;s not the way their brains are wired. They always expect somebody else to come up with solutions for them, and they always blame somebody else when the solution won&#39;t come. And even if they decided to migrate their content to the dark web or on a Tor network, not many people will follow them - both because they don&#39;t have the skills, and because they don&#39;t want to acquire those skills. Plus, they&#39;d lose the &#34;viral network effect&#34; that they get when posting click-bait content on public networks, the new censorship-proof network will only attract a small bunch of already radicalized people.And even if they wanted to hire some smart engineers to do the job for them, we all know that engineers tend to swing on the other opposite of the ideological spectrum. Those who have built systems for escaping REAL authoritarian censorship would rightfully feel disgusted if asked to apply their knowledge to provide a safe harbour for rednecks to vomit their conspiracy-theories-fueled hate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got the sense while crawling data from their API that the engineering quality is poor at Parler. Dates were represented as strings in &#34;YYYYMMDD&#34; format (so today would be &#34;20210113053923&#34;) instead of UNIX timestamps, certain fields were duplicated for no reason (e.g. every object would have an identical &#34;id&#34; and &#34;_id&#34; key), counts of impressions/comments/etc would be the display strings rather than raw numbers (so &#34;2k&#34; or &#34;5m&#34;), and various moderation flags were in place like a boolean &#34;sensitive&#34; which was always false, even for posts that had been downvoted significantly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I did some quick math, and the 240k acres it says they own comes out to about 378 square miles, which if condensed down to a square would be 20 miles by 20 miles.On the one hand, that&#39;s a lot of land. On the other, it&#39;s not really anything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bill Gates is the wealthiest person in the world (or arguably Arnault).You might say, no, Musk and Bezos are worth 50% (or ~60 billion) more. On paper yes, but that&#39;s not a great metric. When I think of wealth, I think of what you can reasonably acquire.If you multiply Musk&#39;s shares in Tesla times the current share price, sure you get 180 billion. But if he tried to sell a large number those shares, they&#39;d plummet in value as he was selling them. Without Musk, I&#39;d be surprised if Tesla is worth 20% of its current valuation. To a lesser extent, this is true of Bezos too, although Amazon without him is still a very valuable company.On the other hand, Bill Gates owns 1.6% of Microsoft, which I believe is his biggest holding, followed by Berkshire Hathaway stock. I&#39;d bet he can sell both of those holdings completely without a huge hit to either stock price (but definitely some hit). Same with his farmland and other alternative assets. On top of that, having already sold his Microsoft shares, he&#39;s not subject to as much capital gains tax as Bezos or Musk, each of whom pretty much owe 20% of their total net worth the second they want to sell.So on paper, Musk and Bezos are wealthier, but if all of them decided to Scrooge McDuck it and put all their money into a gold filled vault tomorrow, Bill Gates&#39; vault would be the fullest.EDIT: typo above... Originally said that Musk owns 180 bn in Amazon stock :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here is another article that isn&#39;t just about farmland, but about land ownership in general: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/11/25/these-people...Of note, the Gates don&#39;t even appear on this list. At first I thought it&#39;s because OP is only talking about farmland, but in the USA Today article the Simplot family apparently owns more than 400k acres for potato farming in Idaho, but doesn&#39;t even appear in the OP. I&#39;m not sure what to make of the discrepancy.Also for the sake of comparison, 240k acres is a good amount, but (as another commenter mentioned), it&#39;s also not. There are some cattle ranches larger than that. And for an example of non farm/ranch use, Bezos apparently owns over 400,000 acres in West Texas to be used for the Blue Origin launch facilities."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some good points in the article, but I disagree with the tone and the conclusion.&gt; we’ve rewarded and lauded incremental researchers as innovators, increased their budgets so they can do even more incremental researchThere isn&#39;t a scientific field where every single paper is groundbreaking. It&#39;s a Brownian motion of small incremental innovations, until eventually we stumble upon something big (like deep learning). In no way is machine learning unique in this. Sounds like the author is simply disappointed that, like in any other profession, day-to-day of a researcher is a slog and not a perennial intellectual festival. We&#39;ve been in an exciting deep learning craze for a while, but it&#39;s silly to expect it to last forever. Back to the grind now.&gt; Machine Learning Researchers can now engage in risk-free, high-income, high-prestige workNot sure what author means by &#34;risk-free&#34;. Yes, if you&#39;re not publishing enough you&#39;re most likely not going to starve. Is that a bad thing? Is the survival instinct the only good motivator for doing good research?I would argue that there&#39;s plenty of risk, in that people who don&#39;t publish good research don&#39;t get very far in their academic careers, which in my view is good enough motivation. &#34;They must do good research or starve&#34; is a rather cynical take, especially from someone who seems to not be doing too badly for themselves.I&#39;d rather more fields provided similar benefits. Maybe then going into science wouldn&#39;t be associated with so much sacrifice, so more smart people would choose science over investment banking or such, and we&#39;d make more scientific progress faster.&gt; CNNs use convolutions which are a generalization of matrix multiplication.A nitpick: CNNs are most definitely not a generalization of matrix multiplication. In fact, the opposite: you can view CNNs as a matrix multiplication with a particular matrix structure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is dead-on, but I think it is missing a fairly large segment of where ML is actually working well: anomaly detection and industrial defect detection.While I agree that everyone was shocked, myself included, when we saw how well SSD and YOLO worked, the last mile problem is stagnating. What I mean is: 7 years ago I wrote an image pipeline for a company using traditional AI methods. It was extremely challenging. When we saw SSDMobileNet do the same job 10x faster with a fraction of the code, our jaws dropped. Which is why the dev ship turned on a dime: there&#39;s something big in there.The industry is stagnated for exactly the reasons brought up: we don&#39;t know how to squeeze out the last mile problem because NNs are EFFING HARD and research is very math heavy: e.g., it cannot be hacked by a Zuck-type into a half-assed product overnight, it needs to be carefully researched for years. This makes programmers sad, because by nature we love to brute force trial-and error our code, and homey don&#39;t play that game with machine learning.However, places where it isn&#39;t stagnating are things like vibration and anomaly detection. This is a case where https://github.com/YumaKoizumi/ToyADMOS-dataset really shines because it adds something that didn&#39;t exist before, and it doesn&#39;t have to be 100% perfect: anything is better than nothing.At Embedded World last year I saw tons of FPGA solutions for rejecting parts on assembly lines. Since every object appears nearly in canonical form (good lighting, centered, homogeneous presentation), NN&#39;s are kicking ass bigtime in that space.It is important to remember Self-Driving Car Magic is just the consumer-facing hype machine. ML/NNs are working spectacularly well in some domains."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a nice talk by Yann LeCun where he goes on to explain really well why deep learning has such fast progress. [0]He goes on to explain how theory always comes later.I thought that information theory came before practice but turns out it also came after. (there was a bunch of heuristics for sending messages with teletypes)A nice example is Roman technological advances in architecture and materials that predate the use of geometry or mathematics completely. All advancements a result of tinkering and heuristics.[0]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG5NCkMerHU"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve used aquafaba in cooking a lot, mostly to avoid using so many eggs in baking. And while I&#39;ve had great results for a few specific recipes, I&#39;ve also found that it&#39;s not a universal egg replacement, and it&#39;s hard to tell which recipes it will and won&#39;t work in.I bake a lot of gluten-free and grain-free breads and biscuits, and aquafaba is a great egg replacement in these. Sometimes it even produces a better texture. But in other recipes, like cookies, it doesn&#39;t work at all; the dough loses its shape completely and deflates into a puddle.I&#39;ve also read about using aquafaba to make meringue or mousse, but I haven&#39;t had good luck with that so far. The chickpea taste is strong, and does not go with sugar at all.I haven&#39;t tried using any beans other than chickpeas. Maybe it would work better with different beans."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Aquafaba is amazing. But since we&#39;re talking about egg replacers, here&#39;s one even more remarkable:Carbonated water.No joke. Carbonated water can seamlessly replace egg in almost all things where the egg provides some rising / fluffy texture (not so much binding, like aquafaba does). It won&#39;t be stepping in your quiche any time soon, but cookies, brownies, cupcakes, anything with a fluffy inside.1/4 cup of water equals one egg. Try it, you&#39;ll be amazed.https://iambaker.net/egg-substitutes/"</p>

Is it just because Facebook has other uses, because they&#39;re bigger or because an app store that doesn&#39;t have a Facebook app will experience a huge backlash from consumers?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"On a side-note, I hate how Facebook sticks to their real name policy and does not allow for the creation of multiple accounts (I&#39;d want one for my startup / work etc. and another for my personal use case for my friends / family etc.).That said, all the mainstream social media apps - Facebook and Twitter had a hand and if Parler was de-platformed with that reason, then they should be as well.I mean, if a 700B and a 50B company can&#39;t solve this issue, than how can we expect a much much smaller company like Parler to tackle it?But it&#39;s obvious that these companies don&#39;t give a damn about the insurrection - This was entirely to pacify the dems by giving them a &#34;Win&#34; considering they have the House, Senate and Presidency.It&#39;s funny because the company I&#39;m currently consulting for a company that has a ~1B/yr account with Amazon and we&#39;ve decided to slow our cloud migration projects. We run a major media site and if AWS decides to capitulate to the pressure from essentially people on social media or the wrath of the US Govt, what&#39;s stopping them from doing the exact same from Govts of other countries?"</p>

Worse when you were planning on implementing it soon anyways, but now if you do it&#39;s &#34;rewarding&#34; their behaviour (in their eyes at least), and they become invigorated to go and spread their toxicity even further. Alternatively, you can hold off on implementing it until things cool down, but then all the nice users who have been patiently waiting get screwed.I&#39;m forever grateful that I actually get FAANG salary to do this -- I wouldn&#39;t keep it up if I was getting the little-to-noting many FOSS contributors get."</p>

I didn&#39;t know that Apple also started doing the same and hit WireGuard again. Extending the definition of an &#34;in-app payment&#34; to a link to the project homepage in the &#34;About&#34; window that doesn&#39;t buy any good or service related to the app is an overzealous restriction.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"FOSS developers should simply stop developing good software for Apple devices.The absolute opacity of Apple&#39;s technical policies and their arrogant i-dont-care/its-your-problem approach against developers are quite renewed in the community. This ends up costing a lot of development time to developers who mostly work for free, who struggle to reverse engineer or debug what happens on MacOS/iOS, and (like Wireguard&#39;s case shows) it harms the reputation of their software because people tend to blame the application rather than the OS when things don&#39;t work as intended.If people want to use FOSS software, then they should be able to do so on systems that support the FOSS ecosystem, that provide developers with appropriate tools to debug what&#39;s going on (ON ANY PLATFORM) and sufficient documentation for them to understand how a certain component of the OS is supposed to behave.I know that in the past 15 years lots of tech-savvy people have opted for Apple products because &#34;they&#39;re still UNIX under the hood, and unlike Linux they just work out of the box&#34;. But being Unix-like DOES NOT mean to be developer-friendly! Apple is still an opaque developer-unfriendly company even if it provides you with a native bash!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The iOS and macOS apps have been the biggest point of stress and frustration when building EteSync[1]. The API is buggy as hell and very limited (if at all available) and the review process is arbitrary and can cause updates to be rejected. You can never know if your workarounds will be accepted or rejected. Sometimes they can even get rejected in future app updates.The EteSync experience is subpar on Apple devices, and there&#39;s almost nothing we can do about it. We already spent countless of hours trying to fix things, but Apple just make it impossible. We have more ideas on how to fix things, and we will keep on trying, but it&#39;s beyond me why would anyone willingly use an Apple product.Edit (adding one more point): that&#39;s one of the more annoying parts about Apple being the gatekeeper to 40% of the US population and in effect, to 100% of businesses (because one bad Apple in the org is enough to spoil the whole bunch). As a developer, you are just stuck with no way out.[1] https://www.etesync.com"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s one of the most successful routers ever sold and yet network equipment manufacturers are still fighting tooth and nail to keep their devices closed source. It just doesn&#39;t make sense to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, I worked for Broadcom for some years after this went down. This post is purely descriptive to give people some insight into the history from inside the company; I&#39;m not commenting on who should have done what (although I was not directly involved, so if someone who was comments, take their word over mine).Broadcom made an error of judgement here, but this incident fostered a deep distrust of open source, at senior levels, that persisted for more than a decade after; perhaps to this day.Firstly at this point Cisco was, at the time,  Broadcom&#39;s largest customer by a large margin. This caused huge tension in that relationship that was totally unforseen, and was very painful for a while.Secondly, a at a certain point it dawned on Cisco and Broadcom that the GPL lawsuit was not like a normal business dispute , because businessmen after a certain point will settle for money even if they didn&#39;t get everything they want. Sure a few people will keep going to the detriment of their own business, but most aim to make profit, not expound a principle. Many companies in the position of the FSF would have settled for a cut of the revenue. But the FSF wanted the source code released, and they were prepared to kill the business to get it. So Cisco and Broadcom had to concede. The source code was released, and OpenWRT was born.The fallout, though was that subsequently Broadcom router ICs were designed with hardware accelerators which were separate from the main CPU. They were driven by separate CPUs on the same SoC that did not run linux and whose drivers could not be demanded under the GPL. none of the open source firmwares  can run these devices efficiently unless someone spends weeks reverse engineering them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t know why WiFi AP manufacturers don’t just give up and just use stock open source firmware on their devices. They are not even trying to get the sw right. The first thing I do when buying one anymore is ditch the built in tinker-toy firmware and install an open source one. Lots of companies that make hardware treat software as just another line item on the BOM like a bolt or a screw, and source the cheapest shit they can find, rather than treating the software as an integral part of the product that needs the same polish as the external box and marketing materials."</p>

We both worked in what was called &#34;MIPO&#34; (Microprocessor Operation) but I was in Systems Validation and he was on the customer facing side with field engineering. My career went off through a variety of engineering roles, his went into management and up. When he joined EMC, I told him I had always thought he would have been Intel&#39;s CEO. He told me, &#34;Hey, maybe I still will be :-)&#34; That was like 10 years ago, and here he is.There are a lot of things you can say about Silicon Valley, but one of the more interesting aspects of it for me has been how &#34;small&#34; it is in terms of people have an oversized impact. I have never been one of those people of course, just a part of the entourage. But it has been interesting to watch and learn from folks who are good (and bad) role models."</p>

Unfortunately given what Intel has done to Pat during his last tenure, I am not sure if he is willing to pick up the job, especially the board&#39;s Chairman is Bryant, not sure how well they go together. But we know Pat still loves Intel, and I know a lot of us miss Pat.&#34; [2] - June, 2018&#34;This is the same as Intel pushing out Pat Gelsinger.

Many more around various other forums and twitter. I am getting quite emotional right now. I cant believe this is really happening.

I guess he is pissed those muppets drove it to the ground.This is 12 years! 12 years to prove a point! Consider 4 - 5 years of work in lead-time since he left in 2009. That is 2014.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Dropbox and Evernote, for me are two very similar companies. Startups that innovated on a great user experience and had a flawless execution in the beginning.  I was an early adopter of both of them, and they worked well. Dropbox sync between different machines worked like magic. I still remember some of the nightmares my coworkers had with OneDrive in meetings when the files for the presentations were missing because of the poor sync capabilities of OneDrive. 
Dropbox is no failure. Their projected revenue for 2020 is $1.8B. This is 3x more than Slack, but their market cap is 3x smaller. 
Both Slack and Evernote are facing the most powerful companies in the world offering their products for free or at really discounted rates. What makes their situation even worse is that they don&#39;t own the content (documents, pdfs, spreadsheets). The documents will be edited somewhere else and then shared in dropbox.  On top of that many other applications like chat offer file transfer and sharing.Bottom line: I don&#39;t want them to fail ( I don&#39;t want Evernote to fail too), because it points to a world where only 5 to 10 big tech companies can survive. We need smaller innovative businesses to succeed too. It will be a sad day when a $2B business can&#39;t survive and is forced to sell."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dropbox has been hammered by Wall Street ever since it went public. On the surface it should be trading well enough given it&#39;s revenue growth from when it went public to now, however, the narrative of competing with both Microsoft and Google was a tough one to play down.Revenue growth will slow down to below 20% in 2021 which basically starts to take DBX out of the high growth tech stock focus and it is trading at less than 5x 2021 revenue when the median is somewhere closer to the 12-14x range and that&#39;s for companies below 30% growth.The same was seen with Slack. Though they had great revenue growth, the narrative was that they couldn&#39;t compete with Microsoft and so their stock never really traded at a comparable revenue multiple compared to others.It could be said that they have a heavy spend on Sales and Marketing but the same could be said of plenty of other Enterprise tech focused companies like MongoDB that still commands a very high forward looking multiple.Unfortunately from the end-user side the experience has suffered somewhat and I&#39;ve personally switched away from Dropbox so I can&#39;t really say they are doing great on the product side and the amount of &#34;Growth Hacking for Revenue&#34; that is now part of the product experience is a bit off-putting.Also shows the potential for issues if you end up solely dependent on one product and don&#39;t diversity, especially if it&#39;s seen as a commodity.The work force reduction is purely to turn the company profitable on a net basis and the trailing twelve months they&#39;ve already gotten into the black. That&#39;s down from a $400MM loss just a couple of years ago.But the belief is that there isn&#39;t a tremendous amount of profitability internally, because the expenditures are just too high, and cutting further into that theoretically will reduce revenue growth further."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is interesting because having layoffs at a company that should be going off like a rocket during a pandemic is odd.  What is going on at Dropbox that prevented them from taking advantage of the huge shift to remote work?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"After our second daughter was born with a disability and we didn’t know if she’d make it to her first birthday I threw myself into my new job utterly. I was working 7-7 almost every day, took every opportunity to travel, and in general was absent from the situation as much as my “very important job” would allow.For me I felt completely powerless at the hospital. At work I got to solve “important” problems that were trivial in comparison to the things I had no control over, and was rewarded for doing so. It felt good to be useful when my life felt in complete chaos outside of work.At one point I stayed up all night to wrap up a project that wasn’t even that important. My boss, rather than being happy with me, sat me down and said I needed to make sure to sleep and take care of myself, that I was going to burn myself out. I really appreciate him saying that in retrospect, even though I felt a little offended at the time. I try to balance work and home life, and have developed a great relationship with my daughter, now two.In retrospect I wish I’d had the emotional stability to spend more time at the hospital, and to provide more emotional support for my wife who was saddled with going to the hospital almost every day.Things are better now, our daughter is doing very well, but the workaholism can be because of external factors, as overworking made me able to ignore the other, more depressing parts of my life where I lacked control."</p>

Also the effect it has on their mood/interpersonal skills, and the pressure it puts on the rest of the team cancels it out. Seriously, one rude comment in the morning can throw a developer off for the rest of the day, it&#39;s not worth it.&#34;Man what&#39;s up with frank today?&#34;&#34;Oh he was pulling an all-nighter doing a non-urgent task.&#34;&#34;Did anybody ask him to?&#34;&#34;No. In fact we asked him to stop.&#34;I consider independent study, side-projects, reading a good book, smoking some dope, cooking a good meal with my partner, getting enough sleep, relaxing, and exercising(!!!!) part of my job. I don&#39;t care what kind of mutant you THINK you are, you will perform better if you go to bed and get a full nights rest and clean your brain out. It is just science.Finally, while it is true that &#34;work more = better review at work&#34;, it&#39;s just... not worth it. If your job is your whole life and you are not making +200k: GET A LIFE. You have better things to do with your time than make some other man money. Work is a &#34;safe place.&#34; Time goes in, money comes out.

I added a donation button only to see if someone would use it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have an interesting anecdote related to this.As it happens, I currently have COVID. When I first noticed I was getting sick, I was scheduled to fly in the near future, so I got a rapid COVID test that delivers results in 15 minutes.It was negative. I got another one, and it was negative too. I had thus intended to go ahead with the trip under the assumption I had a minor cold.Later, a few days before I was to fly, I lost all smell and taste. Now I didn’t know what to think. I wasn’t particularly congested, and the loss of smell was total. I’d never experienced this before. Could both tests have been false negatives?I delayed the flight (free of charge luckily, so no big deal) and got a test that had to be sent to a lab for analysis. A week later, the positive test result came back.Take from this what you will. I&#39;m not a scientist or a doctor and frankly there&#39;s nothing remotely intelligent I can say about the various tests out there for COVID. But if the rapid tests are as unreliable in general as they were for me, it’s sort of no wonder COVID is spreading like wildfire. I was very, very close to boarding a plane with an active case of COVID, and I would have if I hadn’t acted out of an abundance of caution."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t understand why we don&#39;t implement the isolation procedures of countries that have gotten this under control, following these procedures for both foreign citizens AND US citizens:- When you arrive in the US, you either spend two weeks at a government approved hotel, at your expense, which is monitored by federal agents to make sure you don&#39;t leave your room.  You pay for room service for two weeks to get food.  This is what Singapore does.- If you don&#39;t want to stay at the government hotel, you agree to let the government track your cell phone for two weeks to make sure you stay in your home, and randomly call you twice a day to make sure you didn&#39;t ditch your phone.  This is what Taiwan does.As a plus, all the hotels near airports would be so thankful for all the forced business to make up for the loss of travel business.They should have been doing this for the last nine months.Edit: And obviously combine these rules with a relief bill that helps the industries that are hurt by these rules, or you know, everyone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A similar requirement has been enacted in Canada and what has happened is that Canadians with covid can&#39;t return home to Canada and are stuck abroad.
It really gives some teeth to the &#34;do not travel&#34; recommendation - if you get covid abroad you can&#39;t come home until you test negative. If you get covid at home and then go abroad you can&#39;t come home until you test negative.
I think people who previously would have travelled and just risked it will be a lot more careful now since they can&#39;t get home if they are sick with covid. Instead of dozens of flights per day entering canada with covid cases we now have zero [1].[1] http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m generally anti-regulation, but one potential consideration is to apply the same standards of eviction to cloud hosts as we do to landlords.I think we agree that no private platform should be forced to host a tenant that they object to. Yet a landlord isn&#39;t allowed to arbitrarily throw you out of your house on a moments notice. Even if your lease is on a month-to-month basis, the law requires giving the tenant a reasonable timeframe to let them find new accommodations.Even if the landlord insists on a contract abrogating this, it&#39;s unenforceable. Policy restricts this because 1) landlords generally have very high negotiation power, and 2) tenants rarely read the fine print. It seems to me that both conditions are approximately true for the major cloud providers.If you agree with tenant eviction protections, then you should probably support similar eviction protections for cloud computing. AWS/GCP/Gmail/iCloud could ban you as a customer, but only with 90 days notice. Otherwise, immediate eviction could only occur if it involved legally codified egregious behavior,  and would require a court judgement.I think this would eliminate nightmare scenarios where somebody suddenly finds themselves locked out of their Google Drive and Gmail for some algorithmic mishap. But it would put very little operating burden on the cloud providers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I... don&#39;t understand? You were an unpopular speech platform. I worked in porn for 20 years. I know what it&#39;s like to get kicked out of AWS, so does John Young. Why weren&#39;t they dockerized and prepared to move containers and backups at the drop of a hat? Why didn&#39;t they have hot spares elsewhere? There are literally thousands of hosting companies running the gamut from penny-ante to larger platforms like Rackspace, operating in a hundred countries, many of which don&#39;t know and don&#39;t wanna know what you&#39;re doing. The same is true to a lesser extent of registries. And Apple/Google kicking you out of their stores? You can still bookmark a mobile-friendly web app onto the home screen of an Apple device. You&#39;re not going to lose Qspiracy fans and nazis just because they have to do an extra step to get to your site.Nevermind that maybe, just maybe, if your platform users advocate for violent revolution, you&#39;re going to have a harder go of things. Prior to approximately October, 2001, there was a taleban.com too. I didn&#39;t read any hand-wringing when they got the axe. Newsflash: At least Tor can&#39;t remove you.The simplest explanation is that they saw this coming a mile away (who honestly didn&#39;t?) and this is engineered martyrdom."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article (really it&#39;s more of a press release from the interested parties) seems to confuse the role of DNS from the role of certificate authority, making it hard for me to understand what they&#39;re talking about.These days sometimes the same entities provide both SSL certificates and DNS, but they are different services.&gt; Handshake is “is effectively a decentralized domain name server,” Roquerre said. Instead of using the web-standard certificate authority to authenticate user connections to a server, Handshake stores references to the IP address of the websites registered in its system. Namebase is a platform that offers users access to the Handshake networkThat makes no sense at all. But it sounds like handshake is simply an alternate DNS protocol?  Or does it also serve as a certificate authority somehow?  Is it actually more decentralized than DNS (which is already of course decentralized in one axis, but not the relevant one for keeping a lookup available if the entity hosting DNS decides to remove it).Very confusing.It seems like tor .onion address would be an actually mature solution to this problem, instead of this thing that seems like press release babble?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The problem with &#34;trying it with my team for one sprint&#34; is that I now need to have a long conversation with legal. How will the service provider handle the content (discussions, screenshots, code snippets) that my team will upload? Do our current customer contracts contain any clauses that complicate the use of external discussion sites? In the unlikely event that the service offers the option to host it locally -- who is going to deploy it, configure it, set up security and authn/authz around it?The real answer is: just fucking use email. Why is email not  one of the options suggested in the TFA? It&#39;s universally available, durable, allows long-form conversation and thoughtful deliberation, doesn&#39;t tell you that &#34;someone is typing,&#34; and offers you the luxury of checking it at a set interval only a few times per day.The way many organizations have collectively abandoned email in favor of instant messaging is a travesty."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t agree with this essay more.In the early days of the Ethereum community a lot of open coordination was done on reddit and a threaded forum hosted on Vanilla Forums. Initially for privacy and convenience, Skype, gitter, Discord, and Telegram began to take hold, and later became the primary place for open, public discussions and some decision-making as well.Threaded forums were still used but not central. It was a difficult era (but a lot of work still moved forward)! There emerged a kind of opacity due to ability to put attention on real-time threads, and IMO sometimes key voices were missing because they could not weigh in effectively.What changed the dynamic was the introduction of Discourse for the critical https://ethresear.ch discussions (set up by Virgil Griffith), and later https://ethereum-magicians.org (something I worked on). I was pushing for threaded at the time because of experiences I had here on Hacker News, reddit, and Slashdot. The person I collaborated with, Greg Colvin, wanted discussions like the threaded emails he was used to from the IETF and c++ communities.We each knew from long experiences dealing with coordinating on tech issue remotely that the quality of the message is the medium.From those successful experiments / re-introductions, many teams then began to adopt and host Discourse instances. Later, DeFi picked it up for their governance / coordination discussions. Of course, real-time never went away, with more gravitating toward Telegram and Discord. But tracing the emerging thinking, hashing out differences on what to do, and re-activating stale discussions improved a lot.Threaded discussions are a core part of the community and work again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not to be negative, but teamspeak and ventrilo represent some of the biggest failures of &#39;getting stuck in your lane&#39; ever. They got fat on hosted server revenue and never iterated. Both of them had years (decade?) on discord and never thought to make their product free, web based or have a better chat. Ventrilo still has no official ios/android app (lol). Both remind me of craigslist, actually- Except that craigslist is still going strong (for now).Both still exist, granted- And many still use them. Its just that discord really shouldnt exist, it should have been one of these players. The head start they had should have been insurmountable.Also, apologies for not really commenting on the subject at hand (TS supporting matrix) - Its just I so rarely hear about TS/Vent that I thought it worth me shouting into the ether my disappointment I am not talking to all my friends on vent/ts in 2021."</p>

I totally dropped it as soon as Discord became popular, not because I didn&#39;t like it - but literally everyone moved over, I didn&#39;t want to be left behind.Totally can see how some folks out here value their data a lot more and want to keep things private! That&#39;s where TeamSpeak will always thrive!Here&#39;s a little bit of a story-time anecdote: Back when I was in school, we used TeamSpeak to talk after hours, it was like the equivalent of people double (or 1.5x) my age spending hours and hours on the phone and their parents yelling &#34;GET OFF THE PHONE&#34;. 
It was a win win situation because with ADSL (3mbps lol) I could be connected all day and not hog the phone line, additionally the in-built chat to whisper things was good enough that we could exchange links for funny images/flash games etc.The voice quality was never bad, it took a little server configuration to get it just right, and the ability to record your voice and the conversation made for some hilarious clips compilation throughout the years, sometimes we still share some of those clips to remember what it was like to have a squeaky teenage voice.I spent thousands of hours on TeamSpeak and also tried Ventrilo/Mumble - but I was defo a team TeamSpeak kid...Also I really liked the fact that TeamSpeak had a public servers list that we could just join when someone forgot to pay the bill for our own server. Yep we rotated...so it wouldn&#39;t be the burden of 1 person paying for everyone!Speaking of paying the bill, it was always just a couple of dollars PayPal&#39;d over to someone who had a larger servers, basically sub-renting a whole room and subrooms...made us feel like adults paying our own bills :)Thanks for allowing me to drive down memory lane!"</p>

This implies values &lt; 0 are possible. However, since counts are lower-bounded at zero, they’re asymmetric unlike the normal. This means that practically this method would produce too many false positives for most applications. Whatever threshold is chosen, is likely to have too narrow an envelope between false negative and false positive to be reliable for count data. However, for normally distributed data, this would work perfectly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can really recommend doing this for your personal finances! Tools like ledger are really powerful, and properly accounting is a great way to save on money. I can very easily go into my personal ledger and (say) get a report on &#34;How much money did i spend daily on groceries last month&#34; or &#34;List all subscription services i pay for and how much they cost each month&#34; or whatever. It gives you a great view into where your money is going and helps you plan for the future. It&#39;s very satisfying to run the command &#34;ledger reg -Mn Assets Liabilities&#34;, which is &#34;show me my net wealth (i.e. the sum of Assets and Liabilities) for every month in the ledger&#34;, and see your personal wealth grow over time.But almost more importantly: if you&#39;re a programmer, it&#39;s really very fun! Like, i have my own system where I download my bank statement as a CSV and process it in AWK together with an org-mode table of payees that map each line on the bank statement to an account, which then generates a ledger file. Since it&#39;s just you using it, you can make it so it works however you like, and it quite satisfying to see it all come together.It&#39;s also a great way to learn about accounting. Turns out, I really kinda like accounting! It has many of the same pleasures of programming or math, and seeing everything balance is very satisfying.

I&#39;ve found that I taking the time to enter every single receipt and expense outside of my personal business accounting is largely a waste of time.For me, the most meaningful info is a markdown doc where I quarterly asses all of my investment accounts / assets and come to a &#34;current net worth total&#34;.I&#39;ve found a personal correlation between trying to minimize and track minuscule expenses and a decline in my mental health or happiness at work.  I&#39;m frugal by nature and trust myself enough to not worry too much about day to day spending."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ve been intrigued by plain text double-entry bookkeeping for a while, it looks like fun, but on the second thought I just don&#39;t see any real benefit for a regular person (probably, most IT specialists don&#39;t qualify). You get your salary, you set aside 20-75% to pay the bills, some amount you know from experience you need for groceries and other recurring expenses (like public transport and household goods) and if you happen to have anything left it goes to savings. If you&#39;re privileged, you&#39;ll also have some petty cash left for occasional lunch/night out. When you need to spend some significant unplanned sum you take it out of savings, if you have any. If not, you eat less or go into debt.What&#39;s there to track, how much you&#39;ve spent on potatoes and underwear this month versus the previous?That was the scenario for a disciplined citizen. Most just pay the bills (not necessary all of them) and then just spend what&#39;s left on their debit card until there&#39;s nothing left. It usually happens before the next salary, of course. No accounting software would help there.UPD: I&#39;m not sure it was the right place to spill my negativity, I fully understand the benefits of being organized with your finances."</p>

I also don’t agree with their equivalent person on the left. In fact I am skeptical of most “career politicians”. I really wish we could switch what politics is about. Currently we (meaning news channels and Twitter/internet folk) want to dunk on the other tribe and show them how wrong and stupid they are. Can’t we all try to find consensus and compromise? I know that I personally don’t have enough knowledge and experience to know what’s right for all people at all times. Life can be complicated.

Different people have different feelings about that, but we&#39;ve had thousands of front-page-thread comments on much more important stories than Bannon&#39;s dumb podcast channel. At some point we should just refer back to those threads.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Classic &#34;confused deputy&#34; problem. What is the current recommendation in the modern microservices world to solve it?When user agent (UA) makes authenticated call to service A, which in turn makes call to service B:UA -[user auth]-&gt; A -[????]-&gt; Bhow to pass authentication information from A,  when making a call to B? Options I can think of:- pass UA token as is. This has a problem that token becomes too powerful and can be made to call any service.- pass own token and pass user auth info as an additional field. This doesn&#39;t solve confused deputy problem, since own token can be used with any user auth and service B can be tricked to make request for data in B not belonging to user- Mint new unique token derived from tuple (A own token, UA token, B service name). B then extracts user information from the token presented by A and authorizes request. This seems to solve confused deputy problem, because A has no access to other UA tokens, so it can&#39;t mint a new token for a wrong user. Downside is that token minting should probably be done in another service and it requires making a call to it for almost every request between two microservices, making it a bottleneck pretty quickly.I&#39;ve never seen last one in real life, maybe it has some critical flaws  I am failing to see?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I kind of wonder if we&#39;re looking at solving this the wrong way. Instead of mandating that manufacturers take specific steps to fix the waste problem, maybe it would be better to tag items at manufacture and charge device makers a percentage based on how long before it enters the waste stream.Manufacturers could solve this by either:- Making their things easy to repair- Creating in house recycling programs- Making equipment more durable and longer lastingAny combination of the above. By picking one specific way of reducing waste, we are ignoring other factors. Few people care to repair Android phones because you can&#39;t upgrade the OS after 2 years regardless. It doesn&#39;t matter if the hardware is repairable, the device is greatly devalued at that point. Like wise, if it&#39;s super expensive to repair an iPhone, people aren&#39;t going to bother and will just replace it.By focusing on the end result -&gt; Devices entering the waste stream &lt;- the manufacturers are responsible for ensuring hardware gets responsibly recycled, repaired, or just doesn&#39;t break. Obviously, to make this work the cost per device entering the stream would have to be significant compared to the cost of the device.Also, the cost should be the responsibility of the maker. Currently in some place in the US, consumers pay the cost to dispose of/ recycle televisions. The result is we end up with TVs on the side of the road. Often on the way away from the dump where people refuse to pay the disposal fee then toss the TV out the door on the way home."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t describe how much I hope something comes out of it. Not because I have some illusion of this tackling corporate greed, or helping the environment - devices will likely become more expensive and bulkier as a result, supply chain of replacement parts is generating heaps of waste too.I simply am surrounded by tens and hundreds of sort-of-broken devices that don&#39;t force me to replace yet, but are not fixable either. The laptop overheats, phone compass never works properly, one port in the TV is dead, there is no light in the fridge (but it still works). The list goes on. I just want a world where stuff lasting a lifetime exists."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just yesterday my SO told me the subwoofer was broken. It&#39;s a wireless unit, which pairs with the soundbar, which I got with my TV about 5 years ago.I quickly come to the conclusion the power supply is broken. And of course the power supply is internal.I tried to open up the thing, being fairly competent with electronics. But try as I might, I just couldn&#39;t figure out how this thing comes apart. I don&#39;t want to brute force it, thing is stylish and my SO likes that about it, but also a lot of plastic so easy to break.Ok, I searched the web for a service manual. Nothing. Not even close.In contrast, the DVD player my mom uses (mostly as a glorified CD player) died before xmas. It&#39;s an old Sony unit, bought in 2000 or 2001, and been on ever since (standby or active). I searched and I found a beautiful service manual, with detailed schematics and instructions for disassembly and reassembly. Even the PCB itself has lovely markings making it very clear what is going on where.Quickly discovered the issue in the power supply and ordered some replacement parts (still waiting).Sure I could probably have found a second-hand DVD player for cheap. But yeah it just seemed so senseless to toss away a perfectly good unit when by all accounts it just needs $3 worth of parts."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I see a number of people here describing Parler as &#34;unmoderated&#34;, but it turns out they do have extensive moderation [1] that they use to ensure ideological conformity in their posts. Then the most active users were paid for their content too [2]. This really makes it more of a propaganda weapon than a free speech platform.[1] https://twitter.com/donk_enby/status/1347939939120533506
[2] https://twitter.com/donk_enby/status/1346565749977051136"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This story truly terrifies me: my team owns my company&#39;s sign up page. (I speak for myself and not them, of course).Sounds like Parler, fearing that their OTP provider might go down, decided to fail-open, ie: if the dependency throws an exception, presume there&#39;s something wrong with the dependency and that the code provided is acceptable. It never occurred to them that the dependency could be down permanently, or that malicious actors[0] would be able to realize it and exploit to quickly.Lesson learned: do not fail open where security matters, where authentication matters. Failing closed prevents new users/customers from signing up, but it protects your existing users/customers.[0]From a security standpoint, these are malicious actors. I would also probably buy said malicious actors a beer if I met them, accompanied by a high five.Edit: this is a hypothesis of course. Maybe the bug was somewhere else in the system- it could be in Twilio&#39;s provided integration library where the fail-open occurred."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;In a press release announcing the decision, Twilio revealed which services Parler was using. This information allowed hackers to deduct that it was possible to create users and verified accounts without actual verification.&gt;With this type of access, newly minted users were able to get behind the login box API used for content delivery. That allowed them to see which users had moderator rights and this in turn allowed them to reset passwords of existing users with simple “forgot password” function. Since Twilio no longer authenticated emails, hackers were able to access admin accounts with ease.So these &#39;security researchers&#39; are random hackers that illegally gained access to accounts and servers are actively doxxing people and this behaviour&#39;s now being praised?Apart from being illegal, I seem to recall severe backlash against several instances of doxxing in the past, which is exactly what these people have done.I wonder if people would still be cheering this on if 70TB worth of twitter information had been leaked instead."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m struggling to try to understand what this means for the risks of running a business in the cloud going forward. It was not just AWS dropping them, but many of their other vendors dropped them too, essentially killing their business overnight.Granted, for this first case the bar was extremely high. You needed literal storming of the Capitol and a platform seemingly specifically targeted at those people for this to happen. However, now that the precedent is set, I would expect the bar to be lowered going forward. That creates risks that need to somehow be mitigated (and reflected in valuations).Even for businesses that are not in such politically charged areas, I can easily imagine getting inadvertently tangled up in some popular issue and having vendors become targets of online activist (whether it&#39;s your own vendors, or whether you are a vendor to a target).What are the best mitigations here, both technical and social? Vocally side with the popular issues, or try to stay completely out of them, to try to avoid becoming a target (e.g., social media presence)? Try to reduce dependence on cloud providers and vendors by building more in-house? How far would you have to go, since a colo or an ISP can drop you just as AWS can?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"All I’m going to say is that I’m all for free speech and setting fair rules for everyone to play by (ie regulation), but looking at the examples provided in the buzzfeed articles this is beyond simple free speech. I hear a lot of people saying this is just another example of the left trying to shut down free speech but there are clear threats being made on the platform. If Parler doesn’t want to do any content regulation then fine (though this should be any easy place to draw the line), but I can’t blame Amazon for saying “we don’t want that here”."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a former Ubiquiti employee, I&#39;m sad to watch the slow decline of the company. There was a steady exodus of engineering talent through 2020. The CEO was focused on moving to countries where engineering was cheaper and employees complained less about constant crunch mode. If you search around, you can find interviews where he brags about closing the San Jose office because he thought everyone there was too entitled.The saddest part is that we had many good engineers who could have continued to do amazing things with the UniFi momentum.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regarding authenticity, from the TechCrunch article about this:&gt; The networking company quickly followed its email with a post on its community pages confirming that the email was authentic, after several complained that the email sent to customers included typos.Indeed: How am I supposed to know whether this email is really from Ubiquiti?* There was apparently no official press release.* All links in the email, including the &#34;Change password&#34; button, are to e.g. `https://ui.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=somehexnumber&amp;i...`.* The delivering server is `mail42.atl11.rsgsv.net`, which the TLD of which doesn&#39;t seem to resolve in my browser to provide hints.* Various news sites that reported this either just referred to &#34;emails people got&#34;, screenshots random people got via Twitter, or link to the Mailchimp site, for which I&#39;m not sure how to verify whether the &#34;ubnt&#34; account actually belongs to Ubiquiti.Given this, how shall the normal affected user figure out that this isn&#39;t well-executed phishing?It seems companies could do a much better job making it obvious that their emails are legit.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I mentioned this on Twitter[1], the reason to encrypt before sending over SSL is not about double encryption, it’s about how a large backend system is designed.Often, you have load balancers that are SSL endpoints, so the data is decrypted at that point.You can start to see the problem already. What if there is a different bug, and so a dev starts logging requests somewhere down the line? You accidentally start logging cleartext passwords. Oops. Facebook was fined for this not that long ago.But if the password is encrypted, then it’s not really an issue, and the black box blob can be forwarded to a login microservice. There, the team decrypting will be on higher alert.So depending on the structure of various teams, you now have fewer teams that need that kind of security oversight and can move faster.Smaller blast radius of something goes wrong.[1] https://twitter.com/sroussey/status/1347688753221931010?s=21"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve heard about the security of a mobile banking app about eight or so years ago, when mobile banking was still very much a new thing and trust was a big issue. They too opted to write a second encryption layer on top of TLS / SSL, fearing MITM attacks. That was also when iOS didn&#39;t support SSL pinning yet.It seemed to work for them, security researchers went to town on it and while they quickly discovered there was a second encryption layer below SSL, they were unable to determine what it was and how to crack it.IIRC their encryption was never broken, and thanks to that track record, they slowly increased daily spend limits over the mobile app.Long term, because they were very forward-thinking and they had competent native app developers (as opposed to the competition who struggled for years with mobile web / crossplatform tech), they increased their market share by a lot, now being the largest bank in NL; can&#39;t find historical data, but they went from 37% in 2016 to 40% in 2018."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I keep being somewhat baffled by Steam&#39;s login process every time I&#39;m forced to go through it. Apparently Steam is such a cesspool of (pre)pubescent teenagers, with rampant account hacking and theft of funds, swag or whatever, that they feel the need to fortify the process if only to make it more inconvenient for the hackers.- “Remember the password” barely ever works, even on desktop. Since I don&#39;t quite log in every day due to being too old for that, I have to redo the process every time—on a machine that I bought with my own money just for myself and intend to protect with both technical means and physical force.- Somehow copy-pasting passwords from KeepassX/XC doesn&#39;t work on Mac, with the shortcut. Not sure if this is a misfeature of Steam, but I have to paste the password to an editor first and then copy out of there into Steam. (Seems though that ‘paste’ in the context menu does work—this might&#39;ve changed since I first noticed the issue.)- And of course, the weird variation on 2fa, via email, instead of the good regular TOTP. As is tradition by now, I&#39;m also given the choice of installing yet another app on the phone, which somehow doesn&#39;t quite seem to serve my interest."</p>

They could say that in iOS those are the rules but if you want to do something else with the device you own you can install something else. It might even win them some customers.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m just going to come out and say something that I&#39;ve had a hard self reflective time coming to the conclusion of. I don&#39;t believe in free speech without limits.I have strongly felt that the actions taken by these companies is morally and ethically the right thing to do, for any business and that is inconsistent with believing in true free speech. My line for free speech seems to lie in speech that incites violence or speech that discriminates against people for immutable characteristics of their person, both of which I know Parler harbors in abundance. I think there are simply some ideas that are too repugnant to not rebuke.That said I don&#39;t like how centralized we&#39;ve become on these existing platforms either. Monopoly on communication means it&#39;s too easy to let that window slide on what is acceptable speech to limit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It must feel pretty surreal to be someone that is constantly moving to different communication apps and instantly finding them pulled by anyone and everyone.We&#39;ve seen an escalation of this from higher-level platforms (obviously Twitter can ban an account if they desire) to medium-level platforms (I suppose Apple gets to pick what I can do on my own phone even if it feels a bit wrong), but I&#39;m curious if this will also escalate to low-level platforms (will hosting companies, registrars, or even ISPs start taking similar actions on a regular basis?).At this point it appears to be in a bit of a feedback loop as well, since it&#39;s obvious that deplatforming groups will make them feel persecuted and even more upset, which then makes them more likely to be deplatformed by whichever platform they move to next.Could this escalate even past low-level companies and result in decentralized, uncensorable, and end-to-end encrypted technologies having action taken against them (as more users, including some that are radicalized, seek them out)? I certainly hope not, but I have no faith in our government&#39;s various administrations here to begin with, especially given that we are likely only at the beginning of these types of conflicts.(Obligatory note that I am not defending any given platform, group of people, or anything of that matter, as I find it much more interesting to talk about how systems like this may play out instead)"</p>

Open a directory that loads slowly (e.g. one with thousands of files on a smb3 mount)2. While the list is loading, select a file (but do not open it)3. Wait for the whole list to loadOnce the list finishes loading, the file on the very top of the list gets automatically selected (discarding your selection).Thus, if you select a file and click open, in the time between you select and click open, the selection can auto-change and you&#39;ll end up opening something else than what you&#39;ve selected.It is this bad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You will find lots of such examples of a feature which you personally find very important and wonder why such a simple thing is not supported yet. I guess everyone has such examples. And you will also find such examples for MacOSX or Windows.For me personally, I wonder why mouse wheel/scroll acceleration is still not implemented. I implemented it a while ago for Xorg, which is outdated now, and also the maintainer was not happy with my approach. It&#39;s now a long outstanding proposal for libinput, https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libinput/libinput/-/issues/7 / https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/-/issues/405 (original bug report from 2010: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29905).Anyway, I guess there are actually not too much people caring about this feature. And the intersection of those who do and those who have enough free time and knowledge to implement this is just empty.Btw, I don&#39;t quite understand the comment about KDE. It sounds like the the author claims that KDE lacks other relevant features. But comparing Gnome vs KDE, it is quite clear that KDE has much more features. This is never a complaint I heard about KDE."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has somehow gotten worse in recent years.  When saving, it used to be you could use the mouse to navigate to a directory, then type the desired filename, and press enter.Now, typing the filename initiates a contextual search within the current directory.Clicking in the filename textbox and starting to type doesn’t work either.  You have to highlight the base (not the extension or “.”) of the filename.  At that point, you can finally start typing the name of the file you want to save.The same problem occurs if the file chooser happens to already be in the directory where you want to save the file."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am surprised that the comments haven&#39;t mentioned the role of SEO in Wikipedia&#39;s growth and defensibility.Wikipedia&#39;s habit of deep interlinking helped it rank back in the early aughts when the SEO rules were rather simple. Add to that the subdomain-driven localization strategy and many other moves that were considered SEO best practices back in those years when the on-page factors used to matter.But that was just the start. Wikipedia killed it in SEO when it was easy to do so, but it also did one other thing that most SEO-driven sites (eg: About) didn&#39;t do correctly - it cared deeply about the content quality and also resisted to run ads (anyone remember Jason Calacanis&#39; articles on how they are leaving $100m on the table? See [1]). So when Panda came around, Google correctly rewarded Wikipedia with #1 rankings for over 50% of its terms (!!), and Jason Calacanis had to shut down Mahalo which got destroyed by Panda.Wikipedia&#39;s dominance continues because it&#39;s basically impossible to overcome its lead in inbound links and domain authority. Add to that a surprisingly under-the-radar company culture which has avoided any major blow ups despite its community wielding so much leverage over the world&#39;s education and having to make a lot of difficult calls on a daily basis.Well done.[1] https://calacanis.com/2006/10/28/wikipedia-leaves-100m-on-th..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In grad school back in like 2007 I took a 2-credit class called &#34;The History of Nuclear Enterprise&#34; taught by one of those long white-haired Doc Brown type professors. The final project was for each of us to make Wikipedia pages describing some important topic that wasn&#39;t covered yet. I made one on the university&#39;s nuclear reactor which had just been shut down. I dug through many linear feet of archived info, scanning photos and collecting various info for the page. It was super rewarding. I was hooked.Variously since then I have gone deep into some fringe but important-to-some topic and found hard-to-find sources. I&#39;ve found it effective to collect and present this information in Wikipedia pages.Like a few months ago I made the page for the Aircraft Reactor Experiment [1], the world&#39;s first molten salt-fueled nuclear reactor, built and operated with intent to make nuclear-powered long-range aircraft. I&#39;m pretty proud of the page, and go back to use it somewhat regularly. Having the platform of Wikipedia inspires me to go the slight extra mile in personal research in a way that can be used by everyone.Thanks Wikipedia, for existing.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_Reactor_Experiment"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ah good stuff - I love Wikipedia more than almost any other non-living thing that has been created in my lifetime. If you had told me the idea as a pitch 20 years ago I would have assumed you were capital I insane for thinking it would work.It was pretty fresh when I was in college and I remember my professors all being pretty explicit about not using it as a source. Thought I had figured out the world’s biggest life hack when I started using the sources listed on Wikipedia as my sources for papers."</p>

The field of control theory has some really simple and really robust methods for getting a system from state A to state B. If you aren&#39;t trying to learn how the system works simultaneous to your algorithm being deployed, it can be a really a good fit.This book and control theory solve different problems. I&#39;m just commenting because I sometimes see modern ML folks trying to apply super duper general techniques to problems that are easily solved specifically with simple undergrad-level techniques from the specific fields (including this material to control problems).

Spam is the original sin of the open internet and the unwillingness to get to grips with this is a big part of why we can&#39;t have nice things.Context: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Canter_and_Martha_Sie...On Usenet, which ran on NNTP, every user could maintain their own killfile, which would allow people to hide spam. But it wasn&#39;t easy to share killfiles, and while the more technically capable people would easily filter it out they were also blinding themselves to a problem that eventually choked the life out of the community. Similar observations could be made about advertising on the web, from standardized banners leading towards today&#39;s web horrible mess.The basic problem is that the costs of spamming and lying are generally a lot lower than the potential profits, so the more opent he system the more spam it tends to attract. Try looking at used car adverts on Craigslist for example, dealers in busy areas tend to run a hundred ads a day with 500 keywords. Some people flag them, of course, but most don&#39;t bother and the profit in selling a single car is worth the minor downsides."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve worked at both SV and traditional companies, and I feel like this very closely matches my experience.One of the things I worry about is that even at companies that are doing &#34;Agile transformations&#34; and adopting methodologies like Scrum, in practice have &#34;Product Owners&#34; who are there to give instructions via Jira tickets. Other roles like &#34;Business Analysts&#34; are there to ensure that lowly developers never have to worry about things like understanding the business themselves.So I get funny looks when I suggest that engineers should go talk to people in the business, and write design docs. Silicon Valley engineering practices can look very non-Agile to a lot people from traditional companies that are doing Agile."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have noticed that as SV companies get larger they tend to adopt the more &#34;old school&#34; approach. Not that it&#39;s a binary - it&#39;s a spectrum, and depending on management chain/how an org runs, people can have different experiences.I think it&#39;s caused by1. When you have very deep management chains you start to have lots of people with opinions on what you should do, how you should do it, who you should do it with. Even if on average most of them aren&#39;t micromanagers, it only takes a few.2. As you grow you start pulling in more people with experience outside of SV who bring in culture with them. Note that &#34;SV&#34; is also not monolithic here. Companies like Microsoft (ok, technically not SV) are farther to the &#34;traditional&#34; side of the spectrum.3. &#34;Horizontals&#34;"</p>

From tiny things like how to name the downloaded security files.. should we have the app name in the file or not - otherwise how would IT admin locate the file when they search, should file have time stamp because later we discovered that these d**n things expire, is there a &#39;standard&#39; to begin with that defines the naming convention of these things, and so on..All this because? The detailed level of spec is never written by product managers. Which I think is a very foolish culture, particularly in enterprise space."</p>

Core to the latter is the freedom not to assemble. This freedom is regulated. You can’t refuse to do business with protected classes. But political affiliation is not a protected class.There are utilities, which have limited freedom not to assemble. Then there are private persons and private businesses. Stripe and Twitter are clearly the latter. AWS and Visa feel like the former, though they are legally the latter.The cost of switching private activity to a utility model is a loss of innovation and an increase in political involvement. We are re-evaluating, as a society, the balance between the freedoms of speech and assembly.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was on the fence about this, but reading the comments convinced me it was the absolute right decision.The fact that all these institutions just allowed this horrible hateful speech for four years, in the name of free speech etc, despite all the harassment, harm (mental and otherwise) it caused to so many people in America actually emboldened so many to the extent that now that they crossed this invisible line, they can&#39;t even really understand the ramifications of what happened. That what gets me.To be hyperfocused on the free speech or &#34;big brother&#34; aspect of these bans, not the fact that a small group of rioters were just a few feet away from irreversibly staining American history with the blood of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th in the chain of command of the United states of America, as well as overrunning the seat of power of the most powerful nation in the world, on national TV ... just tells me that things really went too far and should have been shut down much sooner.I&#39;m sure a lot of the people at the capitol that day have the narrative running in their minds that they are the heroes of America democracy, but the reality is that there is simply no justification for any of this, that can be told. A smarter group of individuals would take all this on the chin, make penance in some way while staying under the radar to regroup and reconfigure their message/approach instead of citing private business overreach as some sort of justification for what happened"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There isn&#39;t exactly a shortage of examples where mmap() was in the short-term quite convenient to get to market quickly with something Good Enough to appear production ready, that in the long-term proved to be rather problematic.Mongodb&#39;s original mmap storage engine (32-bit support anyone?), ultimately required replacement (wiredtiger was purchased in part for this reason IIRC).systemd-journald read side (journalctl, `systemctl status`, sd-journal API), performance/scalability definitely suffers from the decision to use mmap for all IO.mmap IO is extremely seductive in terms of programming style/convenience as it facilitates writing procedural, IO-naive code that assumes file-backed memory accesses Just Work.  But this is transparently blocking, synchronous code.Since your program isn&#39;t explicitly scheduling IO and continuations for execution upon completion of IO, there&#39;s zero application-level IO parallelism.  The only asynchronous IO possible is what the kernel can automagically perform using relatively dumb page fault heuristics and madvise() hints.When your process triggers a major fault on an mmap region, everything comes to a grinding hault; no speculative execution past that point, no potential for triggering other page faults in other files or independent regions of the same file, it all stops until the data is read from the backing store.  Not without the use of threads, which brings a host of other issues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Claiming &#34;mmap is faster than system calls&#34; is dangerous.I once worked for a company where they also heard someone say &#34;mmap is faster than read/write&#34; and as a consequence rewrite their while( read() ) loop into the following monstrosity:1. mmap a 4KB chunk of the file2. memcpy it into the destination buffer3. munmap the 4KB chunk4. repeat until eofThis is different from the claim in the article -- the above monstrosity is individually mmaping each 4KB block, while I presume the article&#39;s benchmark is mmaping the entire file in memory at once, which makes much more sense.After I claimed the &#34;monstrosity&#34; was absurdly stupid, someone pointed to a benchmark they made and found that the &#34;monstrosity&#34; version was actually faster. To me, this made  no sense. The monstrosity has triple the syscall overhead vs the read() version, requires manipulating page tables for every 4KB block and as a consequence had several page faults for each 4KB block of the file. Yet it was true: their benchmarks showed the monstrosity version to be slightly faster.The idealist in me couldn&#39;t stand this and I reverted this change, using for my own (unrelated) experiments a binary which used the older, classic, read() loop instead of mmap.Eventually I noticed I was getting results much faster using my build on my single-socket Xeon than they were getting on their $$$ server farms. Despite what the benchmark said.Turns out, the &#34;monstrosity&#34; was indeed faster, but if you had several of these binaries running concurrently on the same machine, they would all slow down each other, as if the kernel was having scale issues with multiple processes constantly changing their page tables. The thing would slow down to single-core levels of performance.I still have no idea why the benchmark was apparently slightly faster, but obviously they were checking it either isolated or on machines where the other processes where running read() loops. I guess that by wasting more kernel CPU time on yourself you may starve other processes in the system leaving more user time for yourself. But once every process does it, the net result is still significantly lowered performance for everyone.Just yet another anecdote for the experience bag..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not sure the conclusion that vector instructions are responsible for the speed-up is correct. Both implementations seem to use ERMS (using REP MOVSB instructions)[0]. Looking at the profiles, the syscall implementation spends time in the [xfs] driver (even in the long test), while the mmap implementation does not. It appears the real speed-up is related to how memory-mapped pages interact with the buffer cache.I might be misunderstanding things. What is really going on here?[0] Lines 56 and 180 here: http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=sysdeps/x86_..."</p>

As a person of logic and reason and based on multiple sources of information that I consider reputable, I strongly believe this did not take place, and I would need multiple, reputable sources of information and likely trusted peer acceptance before I would change my mind to believe it did.My way of trying to only accept what I believe to be accurate information will always be imperfect, and, at times, fail me. But I believe it is only shades different from what someone who believes in election fraud does. Their sources include the content of speeches made by the President of the United States, news anchors and journalists of conversatively-biased news, and perhaps most importantly, peers they trust liking and sharing those same speeches and articles with them as a stamp of acceptance.That&#39;s a complex and very human problem that is not readily solved with gut reactions, broad strokes and absolutes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The bigger question I have is when will we be ready to confidently claim that the vaccine doesn’t just prevent symptoms but also prevents spread? (Edit: at the same or nearly the same 95% rate)I can’t see a human trial being able to show this, and contact tracing is overall so poor how long will we have to wait to not see a case that can be tracked back to a vaccinated individual before we are willing to agree that the vaccine is highly effective at stopping transmission?For example, by Feb 1 we will have millions of people who are effectively protected at least from symptoms due to vaccine. So e.g. by March 1, if we have no, or single digit, reported cases of 2-week post-jab transmission?The corollary is how durable is the effect?To fully reopen the economy you need some kind of consensus on where the truth lies to these two questions.I wonder if public health agencies will never really admit, but just the case count will start to dwindle and mitigations will start to lessen, without ever really coming out and admitting vaccinated people don’t need mitigations 2-weeks-post-jab.Similar to how we’ve never really admitted that people who’ve had COVID are immune and can no longer spread it.I think fundamentally gov’t is too afraid of having two classes of citizens, and mainly, that one class (the antibody negative class) lying that they are actually the other."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What worries me is that there doesn&#39;t seem to be some global coordination in the distribution of the vaccines. It looks more like an individual race, than a synchronized collective effort.In the scenario where only the old accept to get vaccinated, and the vaccine doesn&#39;t reach the required threshold to stomp the virus. The virus become manageable, the economy reopen but the virus run rampant in the asymptotic population slowly mutating over-time until it finds a variant that is resistant to the vaccine by successfully infecting a vaccinated person.And it just needs for this to happen in a large population cluster where the vaccination doesn&#39;t reach the threshold, either because they do not have access to the vaccine yet or because some fraction of the population decide to  not get vaccinated, for everyone to get screwed-up again.Then we get a new vaccine every year."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Okay. I was at Amazon too in that time frame, and I don&#39;t recall the Sun to Linux transition to be all that big a deal.Amazon was always at that time facing challenges on every front, the dot-com bubble breaking etc. There was a large build out of distribution centres around this time  that was very expensive.This was just one more of the challenges they faced. I may not have been senior enough to be privy to all the details, but I don&#39;t think this particular migration brought the company to near bankruptcy. That&#39;s a stretch.I think the big migration was the database, and it took time, and Oracle was having some difficulties with running on Linux. But we were already using Linux boxes on our desktops since 1999. Webservers had switched to Linux around 1999. And migrating core code base which mostly C/C++ with Java starting to appear to Linux was mostly a challenge for the infrastructure teams and one of those routine large projects that every company has. I don&#39;t recall anybody talking of bankruptcy for this reason."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From replies to that thread, it looks like there are multiple errors.One reply is from one of the original engineers working on EC2 that said this swapover had nothing to do with AWS and it&#39;s origins, and another reply is from a former distinguished engineer stating that they swapped from compaq/digital tru64 alpha servers, not sun."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"No doubt Solaris on SPARC was more reliable (particularly on higher-performance boxes) than Linux on x86 at the time, but tons of decent-sized hosting-type companies were running on Linux in the late 90s, and I worked at one. Obviously at Amazon&#39;s scale this was a massive migration, and giving up the support of Sun would be hard, but, hell, Google was launched on Linux at the time too.That said, I was supporting Sparc Solaris through the late 2000s and the Oracle workloads were the last thing to move to Linux most places. The sheer power of the Sun boxes, along with the single-throat-to-choke was fairly unbeatable. No hardware vendor to look down their nose at you for using a &#34;hobbyist&#34; OS and imply that the problem must be at the Operating System level.And, of course, you couldn&#39;t really replace those huge Sun Fire 6800 type servers with Linux."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dismissive article that misrepresents both why &#34;normal&#34; people out there are unhappy about section 230 and what the higher levels of conversation about changing it really look like right now[1]. Articles like this are read meat for Hacker News. You endlessly reassert your political bias while pretending you are &#34;informing&#34; some imaginary group of stupid people (who in reality isn&#39;t even here to be &#34;informed&#34;).[1] Here is a recent discussion about 320 from a few lawyers and an YouTuber who used to work for the mainstream media:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a5H1A65wOMAs you will see if you watch the video, it is much more nuanced than the aggregate straw-man set up by the article....The crux of the issue is that Section 320 was drafted with a lot of assumptions in mind. At the time the Web was a fledgling thing. At the time Section 230&#39;s practical effect was to empower emerging platforms to do some common-sense moderation without fear of being held liable for all content they distributed.Does the law still has this effect? Yes, it does. But that is no longer the primary effect in terms of how this law affect most of the people out there. Today its primary effect is to give an impenetrable legal shield to giant tech corporations that engage in deliberate society-wide manipulation of information. That is what most people out there are unhappy about, even if they don&#39;t quite know how to phrase it."</p>

Rosenthal where someone who forwarded an email to a mailing list was held to be protected by Section 230, as a user of an interactive computer service who did not write the underlying material that was forwarded.I didn&#39;t know that! I guess I was wrong about Section 230 :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great practical information. Nice to see people who know what they are talking about putting data out there. I hope eventually these persistent HN memes about M1 memory will die: that it&#39;s &#34;on-die&#34; (it&#39;s not), that it&#39;s the only CPU using LPDDR4X-4267 (it&#39;s not), or that it&#39;s faster because the memory is 2mm closer to the CPU (not that either).It&#39;s faster because it has more microarchitectural resources. It can load and store more, and it can do with a single core what an Intel part needs all cores to accomplish."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t find any info about the memory bus of apple m1. Is it 8 channels 16 bit each? That&#39;s drastically different from AMDs 2 channels 64 bit each.It looks like apple m1 is much less eager when caching memory rows. Maybe because it doesn&#39;t have l3 cache.Edit: This test utilizes the 8x16bit memory bus of apple m1 fully. It&#39;s mostly just fetching random locations from memory, which can all be parallelized by the cpu pipeline. It explains why the results are exactly 4x slower on my ryzen 3 with 2 memory channels.So the summary is that m1 is optimized for dynamic languages that tend to do a DDOS attack on RAM with a lot of random memory access, but it might take a performance hit with compiled languages and traditional HPC techniques that tend to process data in sequence like ECS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is the article saying that the M1 is slower than we would have expected in this case?My understanding, based on the article, is that  a normal processor, we would have expected 
    arr[idx] + arr[idx+1]
and
    arr[idx]
to take the same amount of time.But the M1 is so parallelized that it goes to grab both arr[idx] and arr[idx+1] separately.  So we have to wait for both of those two return. Meanwhile, on a less parallelized processor, we would have done arr[idx] first and waited for it to return, and the processor would realize that it already had arr[idx+1] without having to do the second fetch.Am I understanding this right?"</p>

We&#39;re aware of continued posting in the Parler app that seeks to incite ongoing violence in the U.S. We recognize that there can be reasonable debate about content policies and that it can be difficult for apps to immediately remove all violative content, but for us to distribute an app through Google Play we do require that apps implement robust moderation for egregious content.

For example, I have a hard time imagining why they chose to specifically quote &#34;American Patriots&#34;, as if that somehow contributes to the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back. Perhaps they have a strategic reason for going about this how they did, but I think it will have some negative 2nd/3rd order effects. that they haven&#39;t yet realized.I imagine we are still only in the early days of the conflicts that are to come in this sphere (and I&#39;d include just about every company and political faction in them, unfortunately).(Also because apparently I have to state this explicitly in every comment related to Trump: I do not support Trump, his supporters, the recent events that occurred at the capitol, etc etc)"</p>

You should counter bad arguments with better arguments.b) There are types of speech, which are proven to lead to violence in the long-run. Also, some things can be proven as untrue. Lies are bad.I have to say, I agree with both of those points. I think group A is missing the point, that there are echo chambers and people radicalizing within their filter-bubbles up to the point of literal terrorism, while group B is missing that the power to censor can be misused by bad actors in the future and  that silenced people will not just change their mind.Is there a proper answer for someone like me? Where should I stand on this? I am leaning towards group A, while acknowledging that radicalization does happen and dearly worrying about perversion of words like &#34;truth&#34; or &#34;fact&#34; (&#34;your/my truth&#34;, &#34;alternate facts&#34;)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have been using Signal for two years now and I love it.However I really, really hope they can work on a good backup and restore process as losing my message history because I have to reinstall the app on my desktop[1] or have to reset my phone is a horrible experience.Just build an encrypted blob and zip it up and pop it on my iCloud or Google Drive or leave it local and let me deal with it but I need something. As my Signal use moves from just messages with friends and family to business contacts I need a reliable way to backup my messages![1] I should state I mean losing the desktop copy as it starts &#34;fresh&#34; and does not import any messages from the phone.Edit: I should probably clarify I am talking about the iOS/macOS applications as these are what I use. iOS does have a migration feature but that doesn&#39;t help if your phone is lost/damaged. I need a proper backup and restore process as well as the ability to import messages from the phone to the desktop app."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The issue with Signal that annoys me most is the complete lack of any meaningful backup/export on iOS. I lost my entire chat history when I got a new phone because their bizarre &#34;proximity based&#34; solution failed."</p>

It could be tough to do this right and figure out what to do with the edge cases like importing a WA conversation that overlaps with an existing Signal conversation, or handling things like quoted replies, but this could be a fun project if anyone here wants to take a shot at coding it up."</p>

Publishers continue to screw content makers, but that&#39;s another conversation.Just trying to ban pirate sources is a wonderful dream for publishers for sure, but there&#39;s no way it can work.

The lumberjacks were scavenging the forest for firewood, when they came across two metal cylinders melting snow within a one meter radius laying in the road.

For many people, Gumroad wouldn&#39;t be a great place to work, but for those of us who want to work like this, it is exactly what we need. Very glad to be working at Gumroad and working in the ways the article describes.Edit: Following up with a few FAQs from posts in the thread:* Health Insurance: I&#39;m personally lucky enough to still be covered on my dad&#39;s health insurance until I turn 26, thanks to the ACA, though for supplementary (vision, dental) I make more than enough to afford proper health insurance on the open market. Everyone at Gumroad is paid very well and should be able to afford the same.* Regarding overtime, benefits, etc: we make very competitive rates as contractors. I sincerely appreciate your concern, though.* On the shift from full-time employees to contractors, the company declined and was rebuilt over a period of five years. I&#39;m a relatively recent addition, so I only know Gumroad as it is now, I cannot comment on how it was. All I can say is that it&#39;s not like Sahil went out and fired everyone and then the next day it was a bunch of contractors."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work for a large SaaS company with hundreds of engineers and a very healthy revenue. It&#39;s widely acknowledged that the company would continue to function exactly as it is now for a very long time if they fired 95% of the staff. Heck stability and uptime would probably improve due to fewer deployments/no new feature adds. So the graph with declining expenses and increasing revenue isn&#39;t at all surprising.The problem with this model is that you are coasting on the work done by your full time staff in the initial few years, whom you fired and replaced with part time contractors who get no benefits. Even putting the ethical issues with this aside, if a competitor takes interest in your space and has a large war chest, you&#39;d be powerless to compete with them. And when your tech is dated and current/new customers want innovation, your low-price contracting firms working a few hours per week certainly aren&#39;t going to be able to offer that.So while I&#39;m happy things are working in this case, no new company that starts with the environment you are describing is going to be successful."</p>

I&#39;d be more than happy to work a job for 80% salary for 4 days per week...So much so, I&#39;m about to launch a website listing remote software jobs with a 4 day work week:https://www.28hrworkweek.com/"</p>

The client is good, feature set is good, the stickers are amusing (if you&#39;re into that kind of thing), the feature set is complete and everything is polished. Telegram is, I think, going to be one of the easier sells if you&#39;re trying to convince non-technical users to switch from WhatsApp or FB Messenger.The privacy, security, and governance story is not great though. If you care about such things, I think Signal wins hands down. And the UX is fine, just not quite as good as Telegram in my view.(A third option not in your poll that might be worth evaluating is Wickr. I haven&#39;t used it personally, but I&#39;ve seen it come up in these sorts of discussions.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the listed alternatives, only Matrix is the one that actually solves the issue of not having to trust our communications to any single monopolistic entity.You could add XMPP there as well, but it really doesn&#39;t matter. What does matter is for us to start pushing for openness and start evangelizing/helping others to adopt anything that puts us back in control of our communication.This is the one thing to fix, and the one opportunity that we are getting now to do this right.- Element&#39;s client is not &#34;nice&#34;: we can fix it. We can not fix closedness.- Not everyone is using it: we can fix it. We can not fix privacy abuse from Facebook.- It&#39;s work to run/manage a server: find a hosting provider (cough https://communick.com cough)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I know Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit and all the rest don&#39;t count as broadcast media but I feel like we got here in part because the 1987 elimination of FCC&#39;s fairness doctrine slowly allowed a shift in how we communicate with each other.We went from specious claims and conspiracy theories being the subject matter of newsletters to their public broadcast to millions via talk radio ~and Fox News~, thus allowing people to descend into their own bubbles without ever having their views challenged.  Now people seem to rely on social media to give them the same experience.  When challenged too much people just pull up stakes to insulate themselves: voat, parler, and private facebook groups are only three recent examples.It&#39;ll be interesting to see if whoever replaces Ajit Pai holds a different view on public intercourse over the airwaves.Edit: Well as some people have pointed out, Fox News would have been exempt from the Fairness Doctrine as a cable network, i.e. it doesn&#39;t use the public spectrum.As Wikipedia says &#34;The channel was created by Australian-American media mogul Rupert Murdoch to appeal to a conservative audience, hiring former Republican media consultant and CNBC executive Roger Ailes as its founding CEO.&#34;  So my personal view that Fox (among others) is responsible for a) exposing millions to fact-free content without opposing views and b) people got used to that and don&#39;t like it when it&#39;s challenged created the bubble we have today. I&#39;m wrong that the Fairness Doctrine would have prevented Fox, although it might have prevented talk radio."</p>

I know your hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us, it was a landslide election and everyone knows it especially the other side. But you have to go home now. We have to have peace. We have to have law and order we have to respect our great people in law and order. We don&#39;t want anybody hurt. It&#39;s a very tough period of time, there has never been a time like this where such a thing happened, where they could take it away from all of us, from me, from you, from our country. This was a fraudulent election but we can&#39;t play into the hands of these people. We have to have peace. So go home, we love you, you&#39;re very special, you&#39;ve seen what happens you&#39;ve seen the way others are treated that are so bad and so evil. I know how you feel. But go home and go home in peace.&#34;I was watching a live stream from the mob and the protesters (the buffalo costume guy, in fact) were trying to get other protesters to leave on the basis of trumps message and people were believing the claim was fake because twitter restricted sharing so the only way to see it was to directly go to the page.Seems like an odd choice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Cities Skylines is very nice for such traffic simulations.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yITr127KZtQ (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17182008) (https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/7h6zr0/traf...)https://www.youtube.com/c/BiffaPlaysIndie/search?query=lane+...This is frequently posted here on HN.
E.g. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25632642."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Things like this are cool. What I would be curious to see though, rather than setting global parameters (i.e., politeness), would be to have each agent have its own politeness score (as well as other attributes). Models like the one linked to here work as if each agent is a particle, rather than autonomous decision-maker adapting to their circumstances locked in long-term, iterated games with other anonymous drivers.This way, agents would adapt their attributes to maximize their own local advantage, and therefore could see how large scale trends develop. I&#39;ve driven in many countries and regions within countries, and it&#39;s just wild how &#34;driving cultures&#34; vary so much. Some places the drivers are so polite to the point it really makes things dangerous, other places the drivers are vindictive (distinct from being aggressive driver). It would be interesting to model how driving cultures emerge.Edit: I guess the short story is I&#39;m really curious why some places, like Bangkok driving is chaotic, dangerous, gridlocked, and no one adheres to traffic laws much or yields to pedestrians, but relatively devoid of road rage (and people will let you merge over if you need to). In DC, people carefully adhere to red lights, stop signs, pedestrians, etc but will go far, far out of their way to block you from changing lanes once they see your turn signal go on.Also, exploring the game theoretic (probably prisoner&#39;s dilemma?) aspects of tailgating and how that seriously depends on the driving culture. When someone tailgates, the tailgatee can slow down (everyone loses), speed up or move out of the way (tailgater wins/tailgatee loses), etc. If everyone slowed down when tailgated, there would be no benefit of tailgating; if enough people give in when tailgated, that keeps rewarding the behavior. Anyway, that would be something fun to explore in one of these traffic simulations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love these little simulators because while they purport to show that slower more polite driving is more efficient, more often than not they show the exact opposite.  Want to shove the most cars through per hour?  Remove the speed limit.  Accelerate and brake like every intersection is a drag race.  Leave absolutely no distance between cars.  And dump any notion of polite lane changes.  NASCAR was right:  Minimize unused pavement.  The most efficient way to move large numbers of cars down a road is at 200mph with only inches between each car."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Some speculate it might descend from PowerVR GPUs, as used in older iPhones, while others believe the GPU to be completely custom. But rumours and speculations are no fun when we can peek under the hood ourselves!As per IMG CEO, Apple has never not been an IMG customer. ( Referring to period between 2015 and 2019.) Unfortunately that quote, along with that article has simply vanished. It was said during an Interview on a British newspaper / web site if I remember correctly.&#34;On 2 January 2020, Imagination Technologies announced a new multi-year license agreement with Apple including access to a wider range of Imagination&#39;s IP in exchange for license fees. This deal replaced the prior deal signed on 6 February 2014.&#34; [1]The Apple official Metal Feature set document [2], All Apple A Series SoC including the latest A14 supports PVRTC, which stands for PowerVR Texture Compression[3].It could be a Custom GPU, but it still has plenty of PowerVR tech in it. Just like Apple Custom CPU, it is still an ARM.Note: I am still bitter at what Apple has done to IMG / PowerVR.[1] https://www.imaginationtech.com/news/press-release/imaginati...[2] https://developer.apple.com/metal/Metal-Feature-Set-Tables.p...[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PVRTC"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This suggests the hardware is superscalar, with more 16-bit ALUs than 32-bit ALUsTo me, it sounds like it might mean 32-bit ALUs can be used as two 16-bit ones; that&#39;s how I would approach it, unless I&#39;m missing something? The vectorization can also happen at the superscalar level, if borrowing the instruction queue concept from out-of-order designs: buffer operations for a while until you&#39;ve filled a vector unit&#39;s worth, align input data in the pipeline, execute. A smart compiler could rearrange opcodes to avoid dependency issues, and insert &#34;flushes&#34; or filling operations at the right time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Yet Metal optimization resources imply 16-bit arithmetic should be significantly faster, in addition to a reduction of register usage leading to higher thread count (occupancy).I believe this is a difference between the A14 GPU and the M1 GPU; the former&#39;s 32 bit throughput is half its 16 bit throughput, whereas on the latter they are equal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are two interesting things in this post.The first is that a senior developer at Facebook believes every single senior developer looking for a role at Facebook can revise the same things. Clearly the author believes that Facebook are looking for programmers who fit a very specific mould, to the point that they&#39;re willing to go out in public and state exactly that. I&#39;d argue that points to a massive monoculture problem at Facebook, but I&#39;m massively anti-Facebook so I&#39;m biased.Secondly, the author believes that senior developers, who likely have 10+ years under their belt if they&#39;re senior, need to spend a solid month revising in order to be successful landing a role there. Maybe that&#39;s worthwhile as FB pay well, but that&#39;s a hell of a time investment if you&#39;re not planning to stay at FB for a long time. That would certainly make me think twice if I was going to apply."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every time I read these posts I find them very depressing. Crunch through an enormous  bunch of algorithm problems in order to perform well on some unrealistic whiteboard programming (I think the system engineering problems are actually more useful though) - as usual we&#39;ve focused on the easy to measure metric rather than anything actually useful. Maybe these things are meant to be a proxy for how good you are at other development tasks, but it has never seemed to work out that way to me. Some of the very successful people I know at FAANG companies have told me that they would not pass the algorithm interviews without months of preparation and that they don&#39;t really use those skills."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Besides the usual advice, this observation is very interesting:&gt; Applying for senior engineering positions (&gt;E4) in FANG companies is one of the best ways to get into them.This comment by a veteran senior engineer confirms to me that Facebook, just like most other FANGs, does a poor job of promoting from within.There are multiple comments to the same effect from many other FANG employees: It&#39;s much easier to get recruited for senior roles from the outside, then get promoted from the inside.The result of this failure is that job-hopping is the most valid career strategy for aspiring seniors."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a Simple customer and incredibly upset by this decision.  For those not familiar with their value add, Simple is essentially &#34;envelope budgeting&#34; built into a banking application.  Sure, it&#39;s a bank and does bank things.  What sets Simple apart is that I can allocate $n/month for an expense and it takes it out of my paycheck and puts it into that expense &#34;envelope&#34;.  When a charge comes in for that expense, it pulls from the envelope.  Other budgeting tools like mvelopes.com and YNAB are great for visibility/tracking, but they don&#39;t move your money around.  The alternative I used prior to finding Simple was having about 10 different checking accounts and manually transferring money every few weeks.  I really don&#39;t want to go back to that setup after tasting the good life.My pitch to the Simple team, or anyone interested in taking this on, is to take the app and build it on top of Stripe Treasury (https://stripe.com/treasury)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know how many Simple employees are in this thread. I&#39;m very sad to hear this news, and I&#39;m sure you were too. Just want you to know that you all made a really meaningful difference in the lives of at least my wife and I. Before I switched to Simple, I had a really hard time budgeting for things/planning for expenses, and was frequently toeing the line of overdrawing my account. I was essentially financially illiterate.Simple made it incredibly easy for me to get my shit together and start being proactive with my money, so there was really no excuse to not do so. Now, my wife and I are well on our way to an early payoff on our mortgage (~18 years early), paying off our vehicle loans early (~2 years early), having a pretty good safety net in the bank, and being otherwise debt free.So if you haven&#39;t heard it above the sadness of losing Simple: thank you. Seriously, thank you. You really did something great and you should all be proud of what you&#39;ve accomplished."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I loved Simple for a long time -- I was one of the &#34;beta&#34; customers -- but I switched away from them over a year ago. I&#39;d already been annoyed with them over something seemingly trivial; I go by my middle name and last name, not first and last, and want my credit/debit card to match that, reading &#34;Middle Last&#34;. Everyone else allows me to do this and Simple did allow that... until we all had to migrate our accounts from Simple&#39;s original &#34;banking partner&#34; to BBVA. At that point they changed my name and refused to change it back after multiple go-rounds (which ended with a rep telling me &#34;sure, we can do this, just fill this out,&#34; filling said thing out, and being told &#34;we can&#39;t do that&#34;).As with some other mentions here, though, it was killing the ability to have Simple send checks to payees that did it for me. I&#39;d been waiting for years to have Simple be able to accept ebills (e.g., receive a bill from a creditor that specifies an amount to pay and paying that, rather than just paying a fixed amount every period), and they never did; instead they regressed.But here&#39;s the thing: while I&#39;d left Bank of America because Simple&#39;s app and design was so much better, I&#39;d never closed my BoA account for the simple (ha!) reason that they could accept ebills and pay them out of my Simple account. This always left me with the niggling feeling that while Simple was better at technology and customer service, BoA was better at... well... banking. And when I checked out BoA after getting fed up with Simple, well, their app was still ugly and had bad UX design, but the functionality had mostly caught up with Simple. It even has goals built into it, if I want them. (I don&#39;t, and never cared about Simple&#39;s equivalent, so I can&#39;t compare the functionality.)And while there are &#34;bank things&#34; I only do once in a blue moon -- deposit at an ATM, get a cashier&#39;s check -- it turns out it&#39;s nice to have a bank that, well, does those things. I know there are other banks (and credit unions) that do them, too, and I&#39;m not suggesting BoA is particularly good (or bad) in this regard.Simple was a promising idea, but I think they made a serious mistake by letting themselves be bought out by BBVA. And while I&#39;d love to see someone else try again, I&#39;m going to be a lot more reticent to move to a new bank just because it gives me a terrific mobile app experience next time around. Simple was a great technology company, but at the end of the day, I just don&#39;t think they were that great a bank."</p>
