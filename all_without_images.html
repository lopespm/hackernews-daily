								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As others have said, there are more cost effective options than just getting your attorney to do a patent search for you. There are definitely plenty of companies that will do it for you for far less. But the quality is... variable, to say the least.As a point of shameless self-promotion, I&#39;m the founder of a company seeking to improve the patent system, starting with prior art search [1][2]. We&#39;re not one of those companies that will do it for you for less. Instead, we empower you to do it yourself, then have your attorney go deeper if needed. The idea being that you don&#39;t need to be a patent expert or lawyer to do it; anyone with knowledge of their technical area can search effectively.  Plus we&#39;ve got some collaboration features so when you&#39;re ready to hand off to your $500/hr attorney, you can. And not just hand off -- collaborate.If a patent troll is shaking you down, reach out to us and we&#39;ll do you a generous deal, no strings attached. We very much do not like patent trolls.[1] https://www.amplified.ai/[2] https://www.amplified.ai/en/blog/22062020/introducing-amplif..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hooray for him.Patent trolls have a business model, which he&#39;s disrupted:1) buy a patent, the broader and better-tested the better2) start threatening the easy marks; the ones who roll over and write you a check right away.  Their trick is to ask for a settlement small enough to say &#34;hey, it&#39;ll cost you more than that for attorney&#39;s fees!&#34;

3) use that money to threaten the harder targets: the ones who will fight back. Those people get asked for much larger sums.4) maybe actually go to trial with a very big target, one that&#39;ll get dinged for a 9-figure judgment if the troll wins. In the Eastern District of Texas, juries tend to do that.Researching the validity of a patent does not require $400/hour attorneys. Anyone with a basic knowledge of patent law and computer science can do it. (And no, I&#39;m not advertising for myself. I&#39;m retired.) Do you think those expensive attorneys do it themselves? It is to laugh -- they assign it to a junior who knows technology."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Every time a company settles it just funds the trolls to wreak more havoc. This is especially true for companies larger than $100 million in revenue. I’m looking at you Texas Instruments, VIA Technologies, Renesas, ASUS, Caterpillar, Nuvision International, and Netgear, just to name a few of the companies that have dealt with Jason Nguyen’s Altair Logix. When you roll over and pay the trolls it hurts smaller companies terribly.I wonder if those companies consider this a &#34;feature&#34;?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Worldcoin issues tokens to people for scanning their retinas. Their magical orb device sends a biometric hash to their network.Here&#39;s my take on it: You can possibly replace their biometric device with a random hash generator.* If it works, it means the currency is not fairly distributed, but anyone sending valid hashes to their network is issued tokens, irrespective of whether the eyeballs described by those hashes exist. This is called a Sybil attack.* If it doesn&#39;t work, it means there is some secret or centralized check that the network performs, which means the currency is not open.This is why we still use proof-of-work in spite of its energy expense: it is simple to understand, it can not be faked, and it can be openly verified.So, do not support this biometric-gathering enterprise."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As I understand it, the distribution mechanism of Worldcoin is not part of the protocol. The protocol does not know anything about eyes.So the distribution seems completely centralized. A central authority distributes the coins however they wish.Today they might use a process involving eye scans. Or maybe not. There is no way to check. Tomorrow they might change their approach however they like. And we would have no way of knowing.The issue that seems to be overlooked is that there is no way to look at a hash and decide if it was created via scanning an eye. The hash is signed via some key that - according to the makers of WC - sits in an eye scanning device which behaves a certain way. But we have no way of checking that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; It’s also worth noting that end-to-end encryption is necessarily broken as messages to (and from) WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram pass across the bridge(s). The bridge(s) operates in Element’s trusted EMS environment, with no content scanning or datamining, but currently bridged conversations are not stored end-to-end encrypted in Matrix (they will be in the future).As a Signal user, I kind of don&#39;t want this to take off. I like knowing that when I message someone on Signal, it&#39;s for their eyes only. It feels like this service starts fragmenting some of the privacy guarantees of the bridged providers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Back in the day before the rise of Facebook, there was an open source service that combined all the popular messaging protocols - MSN, AoL, IRC, etc.It was called Pidgin[0], and it never got particularly big.I see the same thing here. While it&#39;s interesting, I&#39;m failing to see what the use case is. What&#39;s the niche that needs this solved in a big way?[0] https://www.pidgin.im/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is nicely timed.Brief history: when Hangouts was going away and Google Chat coming in, I pitched Matrix to my friends as a better alternative that didn&#39;t require unique phone numbers, awkward desktop limitations, and a better federated future. We stuck with Google Chat because inertia and networks suck that way.I revisited the instance I had setup and got the mautrix-googlechat bridge working. It&#39;s pretty nice but one friend lamented that he did not have the technical skills to self-host such a thing. And here comes this announcement! Sadly, there is a major hurdle: neither Google Chat nor SMS/GVoice are listed here and those are the major protocols that my social group uses.At the same time, my social group is conservative in adopting new core technologies and wary of cloud lock-in for critical roles (Google being both an unfortunate anchor and precipitator of that). I&#39;m not sure adding those protocols would tip the balance."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just upgraded to Monterey on my Macbook Pro 2018 15-inch and after rebooting, all of the USB-C ports stopped working, including the power adapter. I spent some time on the phone with Apple Support trying to figure out how to fix it. After about an hour and a half there was about 18% battery left before I started to panic and figure out how I was going to back everything up.After panicking, the 3rd Apple Support Representative and I endeavoured to try and reset the System Management Controller (SMC) [1] once again. At this point I had realised that the first few times that I tried this with a previous support representative would not have worked, as I was holding shift on the left-hand side of the keyboard (the previous support representative did not specify) and not the right-hand side as outlined in the support article for Macs with the T2 chip.Good luck!1. https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201295"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I haven’t seen this anywhere when I’ve looked, so I’ll ask here on the slim chance maybe they really added something I badly want and somebody knows…Is there any application forced sandboxing feature yet?Something users can control to forcibly stop bad behavior from certain “must have” apps. Chrome, for example, has been caught doing entire drive scans on Windows, and I’m not sure I entirely trust Zoom either. So I’d like to lock down what they can access in terms of files, paths, devices and so on and be fully confident that even if my employer demands I run some software installer provided by their “partners” that it hasn’t installed some creepy daemon and configured launchd to keep it running after I kill the app or even kill -9 the process.Yes we can use VMs for this, but Mac laptops aren’t generally beefy machines, so that’s not an optimal solution.There used to be sandbox_exec, but I’ve heard they removed it entirely from this version. We’re now supposed to get things from the (cr)App Store, which guarantees the app will only have entitlements that Apple approves. But vendors are abandoning the App Store in droves for many good reasons, and after recent events I don’t totally trust Apple to prevent malicious use piggybacking on top of a legit entitlement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SharePlay to Mac (I tested audio) is utterly broken. Shockingly so. I just tried it again, and my music isn&#39;t paused, yet is stuck at 0:02. Pausing and unpausing it, and the song starts ticking, 0:03, 0:04, and so on, but you can&#39;t hear any audio. Pause it again. It goes back to 0:02. Now try this with AirPods connected to your Mac. Connect your iPhone&#39;s Apple Music to AirPlay to Mac. The YouTube video you had playing on your Mac gets paused, for no reason. But at least you hear your iPhone&#39;s audio on your Mac. Now pickup your iPhone. Your AirPods have now switched to your iPhone, that&#39;s still AirPlaying to Mac. You can&#39;t hear your music anymore. You reconnect the AirPods to your Mac. You can hear your iPhone music for a few minutes. Suddenly you can&#39;t hear anything. Pick up your phone, the volume slider in the Music app went all the way to the left. You can&#39;t move the volume slider to the right, like it&#39;s frozen; but the song is still playing. You go to Control Center, and finally manage to increase the volume. A minute later, the volume goes to zero again. If you were hoping to compensate for Spotify Connect not being on Apple Music, you&#39;ll be disappointed.Also, Safari has a bug that ignores your setting to not reopen non-private windows, and reopens them anyway, so if that&#39;s important to you, you may want to temporarily switch to another browser.And yes, it still has the &#34;occasionally laggy trackpad cursor&#34; bug on M1 for me.But other than that, it seems quite a bit faster than Big Sur, and so far (past 2 weeks), very stable on the core stuff."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The best agrument is that privacy is power.[0] It is the power to influence you, show you adverts and predict your behaviour. Our personal data is being used as knowledge against us - as power against us. It is used to make us do things we otherwise would not do: to buy a certain product or to vote a certain way.As companies share more information with governments, they are able to learn more and more about their citizens. Take Facebook, a company that Laura Poitras described as &#39;a gift to intelligence agencies&#39;[1]. Facebook allows governments to arrest people planning to participate in protests before they have even begun. This is just the tip of the iceberg.Our privacy is eroding. As a society, we are beginning to accept this lack of privacy as normal: and this is extremely dangerous. Privacy provides a place for us to be ourselves, to express ourselves in new ways without fear of being watched by preying eyes. If we lose privacy then we lose this ability to experiment, and, more importantly, we lose our power.[0]https://aeon.co/essays/privacy-matters-because-it-empowers-u...[1]https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/10/23..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is actually more than that. Privacy is exclusively cast as an individual / personal concept. But that is just the basis. If people have no privacy, any organizations, or enterprizes they form have no privacy either.Privacy is one of the very foundations of social and economic organization. It is deeply connected with ownership and agency. Holding on to a private piece of the information universe is what underpins also all civic and commercial activity.It is not clear why we still just talk about privacy instead of actually doing something meaningful about it [0]. This is maybe the most glaring example of how modern society has degenerated / cannot solve any of its self-inflicted diseases.[0] That&#39;s obviously not a critisism of the tor project :-), these early pioneers are the saving grace of our society."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So glad to see PouchDB included. We use it and have generally had a great experience! We use it with CouchDB on the backend, and Couch seems like a fantastic way to go for use cases involving syncing data between devices with an offline mode and syncing between clients. It was built from the ground up with replication in mind.Biggest bummer of CouchDB? If you’re not hosting it yourself, there’s only one major player in the market that I know of: IBM Cloudant. They contribute much to Apache CouchDB though, and hosting it yourself doesn’t seem too difficult, especially for small, simple use cases.Anyone else using CouchDB?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Last write wins is not a strategy for conflict resolution, it&#39;s a surrender.So I&#39;m glad to hear something else apart from Pouch actually handles it. Anyone familiar with rxdb and can chime in on how they do it?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not directly related to the post (which is focused on which database to host for your app), but I&#39;m writing desktop apps (think DAWs) in C++ and Rust (not JS), and want to synchronize settings through a Dropbox or Google Drive (so I don&#39;t have to host my own cloud sync servers). What&#39;s a good library or schema to achieve this?Personally I usually don&#39;t have multiple instances of the same app open on multiple machines, but other people might open the same or different files on their desktop and laptop.- Not all settings should be synchronized (don&#39;t include machine-specific &#34;recent files&#34; paths).- How should settings be stored locally (if I may have multiple instances of my app open on a single machine)? Registry (Windows-only)? INI with atomic saving (requires care and locking to prevent multiple instances from trampling or racing with each other)? SQLite?IMO Stylus is a pretty good implementation of offline-first cloud settings sync over Dropbox/etc. It&#39;s currently based around one JSON file per CSS file (Dropbox/Apps/Stylus - Userstyles Manager/docs/uuid.json), and what appears to be a transaction log (Dropbox/Apps/Stylus - Userstyles Manager/changes/number.json). Cloud sync has been 100% reliable in my experience, though I do notice temporary file lock errors when switching between different machines in my dual-boot setup (but sync seems to be eventually consistent nonetheless).uBlock Origin is worse. Instead of merging settings, it expects the user to upload and download the entire settings blob at once (and pulling an old blob can erase changes you&#39;ve made locally). And in the past it&#39;s entirely failed to sync because the blob was too big to upload to Mozilla&#39;s servers. (Right now it &#34;works&#34; but takes several minutes for one computer to see a config uploaded from another computer.)"</p>

Quantity: 2
Ingredient: Scallions
Preparation: Finely Chopped

I know if I can&#39;t find scallions, I can replace it with garlic and onions.3. Variants. Often I have the same core recipe in my recipe book with just different variants. Meringue cookies with different flavors. 90% of the recipe is all the same, but it&#39;s duplicated a dozen times for a dozen specific flavor add-ins.

Google certainly has the resources to take the case that far.AFAIK a warrant usually is tied to a specific person or a specific crime. In other words, if an explosion killed Harry McHarryface, then it would be constitutional to ask for names of people who searched for Harry.Or if the fertilizer used in the bomb was shown to have been purchased on March 10, then maybe a search for &#34;fertilizer&#34; in the weeks before March 10 would be allowed.But not a generic search.Just my opinion that&#39;s not legal advice."</p>

					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28985169">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My experience is, # of engineers is directly related to # of product people, which is in turn related to quantity (not quality) of ideas that the founders/leaders are desperate to try out.Higher quantity of ideas == More engineers. Higher quality of ideas == Fewer engineers.WhatsApp success is not about what WhatsApp did, it&#39;s about everything they didn&#39;t do. No desktop, no browser (until after reaaaaaaallly long), no account creation (your phone number is enough, thanks), no hidden ad engine, no hundreds of stupid features that product people stuff down in the name of experimentation.There are some leaders who want anything and everything: Throw 100 darts in the wall. Leave what sticks (don&#39;t touch or nurture it). Go back to throwing 100 more. The other guy does that? We want that too. Mobile? Yes. Desktop? Yes. Browser? Yes. Different affiliate channels? Yes. Custom features for B2B partners? Yes. Merchandizing? Yes. Build a mini Ad engine? Yes. Multi user profile management systems? Yes. Yes, yes, yes, every requirement is a go.The crucial difference is: What happens when you have a restricted pool of people, but insist on doing 100s of things? Some leaders simply treat this as an &#34;org structure&#34; problem, not a problem of focus. They slice and dice the org until the 30 people become split into teams of 2-3 with a manager for each, running into coordination hell on each step – just so that more quantity of features can be seen on paper. This is how most startups are, except for those rare few which don&#39;t &#34;talk&#34; about focusing, but actually focus."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m honestly not that surprised about the size. In my experience, efficiency and the number of engineers have not necessarily correlated.For example, I used to work for a company with about 500 employees (relatively large by German standards) and now work for a competing company in the same industry with less than 150 employees. The core engineering team only consists of a dozen engineers.The output is noticeably larger. The number of new features and especially the stability is significantly better. It is noticeable that due to the small team, each project has one or two &#34;heroes&#34;. They are responsible for most of the commits and know the system inside out.These &#34;heroes&#34; have been working on the same or similar systems for over 30 years in some cases and have experienced a lot in their careers. As such, they can bring experience and advice that is just out of reach for others.Given the choice, I would always prefer a small team over a large team."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I looked at it this way. The thing most engineers, hero&#39;s or not, want to work on is new projects and to build products customers enjoy. The last thing they want to work on is maintenance. In my last personally owned company, small as we were, the engineering team and I documented how things worked as part of what we did every day. We found that by having the inner workings documented so that anyone in the team could effect a repair or update a piece of code freed us to work on new products and services. Just having the system continually documented freed our minds and kept us mostly happy (everyone has a challenge from time to time) and productive.The documentation, not that it really matters, was done in a MoinMoin wiki. It was written by engineers, for engineers. We didn&#39;t stop marketing or sales or anyone else from reading it, but the target audience was the engineering and operation staff thus no one had to over-explain the vocabulary of our architecture."</p>

				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28986229">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here. I&#39;m surprised to see my hobby project on Hacker News.I know this kind of stuff spark the ``it&#39;s meaningless to rewrite everything (especially Linux) in Rust&#39;&#39; debate. I agree 100% that rewriting Linux in Rust (or your favorite language) is just a waste of time and such a project won&#39;t live long.That said, what I&#39;d say here is that it&#39;s fun. Really fun. Implementing ABI compatibility requires you to understand under the hood of the kernel. You can learn how printf(3) works. You can learn what happens before main().Especially, in Rust, it&#39;s inspiring to explore ways to write a kernel safely and expressively. One of my favorite part is the implementation of read system call [1].Lastly, You can try this OS on SSH. Hope you enjoy :)    ssh root@kerla-demo.seiya.me

[1]: https://github.com/nuta/kerla/blob/main/kernel/syscalls/read..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just to clarify goals of the project:&#34;I completely agree that rewriting existing large, feature-rich, and robust operating system kernels is not a good idea. However, a question came to my mind: what are the pros and cons of writing a practical UNIX-like OS kernel in Rust from scratch? How does it look like? This is why I started this project.&#34;[1][1] https://seiya.me/writing-linux-clone-in-rust"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Rewriting the Linux kernel in rust would be a rehash of why we ended up with Linux in the first place: rewriting an older OS from scratch.I would love to see a solid implementation of a real micro kernel based OS based on a message passing core in Rust to become a viable alternative to the now 50 year old Unix architecture. This would give us a possibility of some real progress on the security and process scheduling front, both of which are severely lacking in the Unix model."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For C++ many standard library functions can&#39;t be implemented in standard C++. And it not only shows some very obvious compiler built-ins in the library, but the library can depend on behavior guaranteed by the compiler which is otherwise undefined by the standard. Therefore it&#39;s not always wise to learn techniques from the standard library, as it can depend on implementation defined behavior, and this dependence can be subtle too.Not too long ago it was impossible to implement std::vector in standard C++, as constructing objects next to each other formally did not create an array. Therefore pointer arithmetic on the resulting pointers were undefined behavior, as pointer arithmetic is only defined within an array.This was fixed by the array being implicitly created in certain circumstances."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My advice would be: to learn a new language, simply start writing some non-trivial projects in it (a few thousand lines of code or so). In some languages (like Python), the standard library is the actually important feature, in other languages (like C), it&#39;s better to mostly ignore the stdlib. Example: I started learning Zig by writing a Pacman clone (https://github.com/floooh/pacman.zig) and a home computer emulator (https://github.com/floooh/kc85.zig), the Pacman clone doesn&#39;t use any Zig stdlib features at all, and the emulator only minimally for memory allocation, parsing command line args and loading data from files.Zig&#39;s stdlib is much more useful than C&#39;s, but it&#39;s still entirely possible to write useful programs without it and instead focus on learning Zig&#39;s language features first.But on the other extreme, the whole reason why I learned Python was its &#34;batteries included&#34; standard library."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; To learn a new language, read its standard libraryTo learn a new language, read its standard libraryYes, but also no.The standard library is often more complex and uses more advanced features then you often need for most projects. I.e. collections in std are supper general purpose, but if you need to write a collection it&#39;s normally specific to the purpose you need it for.I.e. std is the &#34;most&#34; general purpose library you normally find so even if it&#39;s written with &#34;KISS&#34; in mind it&#39;s still often not so simple.Then it sometimes uses unstable language features you normally can&#39;t use (as it&#39;s often made &#34;in sync&#34; with the language) and/or optimizations which in most other cases would count as &#34;pre-mature&#34; optimizations.Through without a question you can learn a lot there, you just should be aware of the points above."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was at Lambda when they announced the switch from 9 to 6 months and the elimination of paid team leaders. The feedback was universally negative. In a channel for open student discussion, Austen Allred deleted a poll from Slack because of how lopsided the reaction was. He explained the deletion by saying the poll was &#34;misleading.&#34;Students then got a survey &#34;explaining&#34; why the change was actually a good thing by asking questions such as &#34;Do you understand why companies value mentoring experience?&#34; Not just failing to reveal the truth (these were cost-cutting measures), but not even taking the effort to come up with a convincing lie.It was destabilizing: Austen&#39;s twitter account would read ambitious, hyperoptimistic; meanwhile, drastic changes would be made within the program with vague rationales (&#34;after speaking with hiring managers, we&#39;ve made these changes...&#34;), and probing further simply got deflections or gaslighting surveys.There were a ton of good people in the program, and I learned a lot there. But fundamentally there needs to be trust between institution and student when you&#39;re asking people to make this level of time and financial commitment. And at no point did I feel like Lambda at its top level prioritized student wellbeing over PR, costs, or metrics to be sold to investors."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It isn&#39;t just Lambda School. I mentor for [insert large coding bootcamp here] and I will say things have been going badly across the board for more than 50% of students. They recently had to cut a lot of staff, and completion rates seem to hover around only 50-60% when you take into account all the students they remove from this calculation when they withdraw for &#34;personal reasons&#34;. The employment numbers I don&#39;t have as much insight into but I have definitely had students who I don&#39;t think will get hired easily, and students reach out via LinkedIn 6th months later still looking for a job and wondering if they can work for me.That said, two of our best junior devs (at Arist YC S20) are Lambda School and Ironclad grads respectively, and neither of them had any background in programming and went right from bootcamp into their current positions. So it definitely works for some people.One thing I&#39;ve tried to emphasize with my mentees is the need to go beyond the curriculum (because it simply doesn&#39;t cover enough) and do personal projects. I always tell them the narrative about how back in the early 00s, the only resources available were things like w3schools.com, documentation, and the occasional dubiously accurate blog entry. I was able to learn almost everything I learned not for the sake of learning it but because I wanted to build X or Y. Bootcamps will teach you a vertical slice of some skills that are relevant in [current year], but they do not do a very good job of getting you started on a lifelong process of self-learning and side projects, which is the only way you get anywhere in this industry. Plus the only way to stand out when you went to a bootcamp anyway is having a very exceptional github profile with open source contributions that demonstrates you actually have an interest and do things beyond what is required by the bootcamp."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really wish we had less kneejerk cliche-recycling (eg &#34;don&#39;t be evil&#34; comments) commenters here just looking for confirmation bias because this is a difficult issue.First, kids use sites and apps when they&#39;re below the ToS age (usually 18 or sometimes 13, at least in the US). How are you meant to know that as a service provider? Don&#39;t get me wrong: it doesn&#39;t excuse you from doing due diligence. There&#39;s such a thing as wanton disregard for the truth. But we all know under 18s use IG, Snapchat, Tinder, etc. I&#39;m not sure fining a company billions of dollars and putting executives in jail is the outcome anyone really wants if a 17 year old uses Tinder.Second, what is personal information, exactly? It&#39;s not as obvious as you might think to the point where lawyers who work for these companies can&#39;t agree among themselves. There are obvious things (eg IP addresses, dates of birth, SSNs, addresses, names). But what about media? Photos, videos and sound files may all contain PII, technically.Third, some will say &#34;well don&#39;t store anything&#34;. Well, if a photo contains PII (which it can) then you can&#39;t operate a photo-sharing service at all for risk of storing PII of children. Also, this ignores legal obligations. If the Feds show up with a warrant about a particular user&#39;s actions then the argument &#34;we log/store nothing&#34; won&#39;t get you as far as you think.So I&#39;m not saying Google didn&#39;t do wrong here but knowing the complexities I am sympathetic to the idea of resisting broad legislative overreach as you can end up with bad laws that do just that.And if we&#39;re going to start singling out tech giants for lobbying Congress, my question is why them in particular? We currently have a Senate that is essentially beholden to the personal interests of one unelected rich guy: Charles Koch. Koch lobbies against health care, taxes on the rich and infrastructure in the Senate. Around the country, he has been instrumental in defeating public transit and many other initiatives in many cities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; A week before the meeting, the Federal Trade Commission announced that it was considering making changes to its interpretation of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, which prohibits companies from collecting information about kids under the age of 13 without parental permission.How would that work in practice? A lot of us here operate websites. Your website gets a request. How are you supposed to tell the age of the person that request came from? Maybe Google / Facebook have enough data to identify the person and their age, but ironically, they would have to collect information about them to determine that it&#39;s a person they shouldn&#39;t collect information about.Certainly no child in the history of the Internet has ever lied to a website when asked their age."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;We have been successful in slowing down and delaying the [ePrivacy Regulation] process and have been working behind the scenes hand in hand with the other companies,&#34; the complaint quoted Google executives as saying in a memo ahead of the meeting. The August meeting could &#34;find areas of alignment and narrow gaps in our positions and priorities on child privacy and safety.&#34;This sounds like a starting point for further investigation.Perhaps the litigation will reveal more about what is going on inside Big Tech."</p>

I mean we have all seen bug reports like: “it crashes for me after a few hours”. Do you know what a developer can do with such a report? Feel sorry at best. You can’t really fix any bug unless you can replicate it, see it with your own eyes, peek inside and finally see that it’s fixed. And with bug reports from Linux players is just something else. You get all the software/os versions, all the logs, you get core dumps and you get replication steps.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yep we find a variant of this with our python open source data science users who normal businesses would hate:- Across all Python envs (Jupyter, streamlit/plotly, flask/Django, ...), they report way more bugs, and often from our free tiers, which sounds low ROI.. but our community caught all but ~2 significant bugs we fixed this year that our internal automated testing missed and would have otherwise gone to our Enterprise and gov users . They are happy to exchange a tiny bit of GPU or viz burps for new features faster, as long as we are responsive to their reports! That also pushed us to a better dev cadence which wouldn&#39;t have worked for our Enterprise users. More subtle, we have more confidence for deploying wider features/APIs which would otherwise be too underused + risky for the same reason.- they are often doing innovative new things with our stack, which originally meant feature requests for non-repeatable sales.. but ended up stretching our flexibility into wider applicability, and they can clearly tell us areas to advance the visual, analytic, etc sides of our R&amp;D and package it up for the rest of their internal analysts. Almost like a multiplier for conversations with our more operationally focused no-code/low-code users, and helps us see around the corner for them in the AI+API+customization sides!- most of our technical partnership discussions now go through our OSS client repos. Rather than PowerPoints with BD people that don&#39;t have staff to do things, a product dev or sales engineer/architect or devrel blogger will think, &#34;oh our customers would benefit from better interactive visuals on our data, let me whip something up quick with that package&#34; and we help them take it from there- open source data users like PyData developers and data scientists, compared to say the # of SMBs out there or general enterprise employees, is small and almost by definition doesn&#39;t pay for most software... but they end up being attached to projects that do, and influence much of their organization that definitely does!"</p>

The Linux users there are decidedly less technical, but still doing it themselves.What I got for &#34;bug reports&#34; was mostly terrible, few details/logs/etc.  And a weird entitlement thing where people had really high support expectations over something that was open source and free. Even a few expletive-laden emails.  I did receive a few really helpful reports, pull-requests, and thank you emails...but they were very much the exception."</p>

Google throttles the load time of non-AMP ads by giving them artificial one-second delays in order to give Google AMP a “nice comparative boost.” Throttling non-AMP ads slows down header bidding, which Google then uses to denigrate header bidding for being too slow. “Header Bidding can often increase latency of web pages and create security flaws when executed incorrectly,” Google falsely claimed. Internally, Google employees grappled with “how to [publicly] justify [Google] making something slower.”I’d be seriously ashamed at this point if I was a Google employee assigned to AMP."</p>

For example, quoting from the document:&#34;Google likes to claim that it will “never sell your personal information to anyone,” with Google CEO Sundar Pichai deceptively claiming that such a policy is “unequivocal.” But Google leverages  intimate  user  data  and  personal  information  to  broker  billions  of  daily  online  ad  impressions between publishers and advertisers that target individual users based almost entirely on  their  personal  information. Internal documents  confirm  that  Google  knows  its  users  are  deceived by its misrepresentations, even as it reaps billions from ads that use personal data to target those  users.  In  Orwellian  terms,  it’s  a  beautiful  thing  for  Google,  the  destruction  of  words  like “sell” and “personal.”&#34;Or:&#34;Google presents a public image of caring about privacy, but behind the scenes Google coordinates  closely  with  the  Big  Tech  companies  to  lobby  the  government  to  delay  or  destroy  measures that would actually protect users’ privacy. Of course, effective competition is concerned with both price and quality, and the fact that Google coordinates with its competitors on the   quality metric of privacy—one might call it privacy fixing—underscores Google’s selective promotion of privacy concerns only when doing so facilitates its efforts to exclude competition.&#34;"</p>

To make this happen, Google first introduced the ability for users to log into the Chrome browser. Then, Google began to steer users into doing this by using deceptive and coercive tactics. For example, Google started to automatically log users into Chrome if they logged into any Google service (e.g., Gmail or YouTube). In this way, Google took the users that choose not  to log into Chrome and  logged  them  in anyways.  If  a  user  tried  to  log out of Chrome  in response, Google punished them by kicking them out of a Google product they were in the process of using (e.g., Gmail or YouTube). On top this, through another deceptive pattern, Google got these users to give the Chrome browser permission to track them across the open web and on independent publisher sites like The Dallas Morning News. These users also had to give Google permission to use this new Chrome tracking data to sell Google’s own ad space, permitting Google to use Chrome to circumvent reliance on cookie-tracking technology."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article mentions Process Explorer. Since Sysinternals were bought by Microsoft many years ago and the tools are distributed directly via Microsoft, such tools are unlikely to have an issue being signed.A brief history of the process for those not following it. Originally for kernel-mode drivers, you needed a code signing certificate cross signed by Microsoft&#39;s root. This means that the certificate follows a chain up to a standard CA _and also_ one Microsoft use to approve that CA to issue kernel-mode certificates. It was not sufficient to have a certificate capable of signing code, even with MS&#39; OIDs for that.Then, around Windows 10 I think, Microsoft announced that one would need to acquire an EV certificate. You would then be required to submit the driver package via sysdev.microsoft.com and after spending time in Ballmer&#39;s Brewery, it would come out signed by Microsoft.It was technically possible to use the old mechanism at this stage too, provided the end user did not have UEFI secure boot enabled. IF secure boot were enabled, the kernel would: a) if the driver was signed pre-Win10, accept it, b) if it was signed post win-10 RTM date and by Microsoft, accept otherwise reject.Thus the only mechanism to realistically get your driver working on all Windows out of the box is to submit via sysdev. You can&#39;t realistically ask users to disable secure boot, even if this is entirely possible on all x86 motherboards.Finally, the cross signed roots expire soon and I think some already have. Microsoft have decided that this mechanism will now be retired, and all drivers must be signed via sysdev from now on. You still require an EV certificate as well, to sign the package.This is a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, Microsoft have repeatedly signed the shim maintained by redhat in order to allow Linux distributions to boot directly on secure boot-enabled hardware (UEFI binaries also go through this process and always have). Microsoft have their keys in the default keychain because they bothered to be involved in the process, unlike linux companies like Redhat. So on the one hand, they&#39;re being quite friendly to open source.On the other hand, the push to EV certs rules out individual developers like myself[1]. I could register a company but... that entails effort and expense for a hobby project. And now hobbyist projects like this run the risk of being rejected by MS.I mostly believe this is an attempt to reduce the number of code signing cert leaks that result in people writing malware, and lock down the Windows kernel a bit more, but still. It is a shame.[1] This is because most CAs won&#39;t issue EV certificates to individuals, even if those individuals happen to have detailed knowledge of cryptography and all the pkcs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An immensly powerful and useful tool. Can&#39;t live without it. Hopefully the situation resolves soon.What is it with MS these past few months? It&#39;s like they&#39;re trying to throw away the little community goodwill they managed to build up over the years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Keep in mind this has happened because people agreed that they can&#39;t (normally) run code not singed by someone else (Microsoft) on their own system for “security” reasons. Well, it was not security, it actually was a way to keep keys to themselves, and hold the user system as a hostage. And it has been explained many times by many people.If you care about software freedoms, even just a tiny bit, you wouldn&#39;t touch “Microsoft open source”, and you wouldn&#39;t be happy about your friends using any of it, like you wouldn&#39;t be happy about seeing them with a heroin syringe. That is going to explode spectacularly one day."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a member of ILWU 13. A couple thoughts after reading the comments:The zoning change is for TEU storage outside the port. The port itself was not subject to that rule.The Port of Los Angeles is a landlord and is not directly involved in operations.Private companies, such as APM, EverPort, and others, rent piers/berths and are responsible for the actual operations and logistics.Some speculation: recently I’ve heard of some ships not even waiting to load empty TEU’s as they normally would and instead they are immediately leaving for China, literally empty. I suspect this behavior is what turned the congestion we had before into the quasi deadlock we have now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everyone&#39;s focused on Ryan&#39;s comments about stacking, and the subsequent win there. Amazing job, Ryan, and thank you Robert Garcia for being a man to take one on the chin (for this solution not coming from your team) and for then doing the right thing. I am seriously impressed by not seeing any NIH (not invented here) behavior here.But why stop there? Ryan suggested 5 courses of actions, and made it clear that we need to act on all of them at the same time. So far only the first of those 5 steps have been acted on. The rest of the steps are likely either bad or the people needed to act on them are doing that NIH bullshit (which I can understand to some extent given how much negativity is being directed at Robert Garcia). But negativity or not, if those are good suggestions, we need to act on them. Would love to hear any thoughts on how to mobilize support for quickly validating/invalidating those suggestions, and then acting accordingly.If it&#39;s possible to cancel brands and individuals, it should be possible to do the same with politicians as well. I hope it doesn&#39;t turn out that we care more about certain individuals&#39; views than the prevention of a nationwide and potentially even global crisis [1].[1] From Ryan&#39;s tweet:&gt; I can&#39;t stress enough how bad it is for the world economy if the ports don&#39;t work. Every company selling physical goods bought or sold internationally will fail. The circulatory system our globalized economy depends has collapsed. And thanks to the negative feedback loops involved, it&#39;s getting worse not better every day that goes by.."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I joined in 2010 and left in 2019. The company I joined was very different than the one I left. Every single one of Google&#39;s problems can be traced back to scale. Loss of trust, distance to top leadership, tone-deafness, repeated failures, escalating surveillance dystopia, perf management overhead, leaks...all of them are fundamentally due to scale. And scale is simply because greed. Gotta make that 23% YoY revenue growth. That is Google&#39;s true mission. Eat the world. It&#39;s now $180 billion in revenue. In five years, that will need to be $400 billion. And five years after that, it will need to be pulling close to a trillion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it’s interesting that the good things about working there had nothing to do with the employer and the bad things had everything to do with the employer.Indeed, this line is the takeaway, in my opinion: “…is because we&#39;ve been at least a little brainwashed into thinking a job at Google is the pinnacle of employment.”I haven’t worked for one so this take might be quite hot, but I get the sense that big tech companies do a great job selling you on the idea that they’re elite and therefore you must be elite too if you get the job. But then you’re really just another fungible developer in a pool of tens of thousands. There’s exceptions of course."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m generally weary of MS having too much influence over open source with Github and VSCode, particularly due to their history.My creep alarm went off a bit when I recently started a project to test the waters with TypeScript.  I was asking on a forum how to deal with native JS dependencies without types, and he answer I got was &#34;Are you using VSCode?  It will just find the community maintained type packages for you&#34;.It seems to me that VSCode&#39;s &#34;just click the button to solve my problem&#34; style of UX makes it very easy for developers to become reliant on proprietary workflows without even realizing it.  If one were to pursue an EEE strategy, this would not be a bad way to start."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think Microsofts&#39; long-term plan is to get most developers to use cloud-based coding environments, which is not unlikely given that software stacks become more complex to the point where setting up a local development environment is really hard. Once they achieve that they&#39;re in a very good position to sell their own cloud services by making the integration into the development workflow really smooth.So their acquisition of Github and the large effort invested in VSCode as well as privileging their own software stack over competing solutions makes perfect sense, business wise. It probably won&#39;t be good for free software though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Microsoft promising `dotnet watch` for a while and then dropping that certainly doesn&#39;t help with the already pretty damaged view of Microsoft not caring about open source developers. Here is the gist of the situation from Microsoft&#39;s point of view:&gt; Throughout the last year we’ve been working to enable the best possible Hot Reload experience in Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6. Part of our goal was to also explore making this feature available to customers through a variety of mechanisms such as bringing the full power of Hot Reload to as many .NET and C++ developers as possible when running through Visual Studio 2022 debugger, supporting Hot Reload when running .NET 6 apps without the debugger, and the very basic Hot Reload support we added to the .NET SDK tools through dotnet watch.&gt; As we reflect on what was accomplished, and what is still in front of us, the backlog continues to grow. This includes many high value scenarios that will benefit the broadest number of developers, including focus areas such as .NET MAUI, Blazor, adding support more types of edits, more optimized experience when working with XAML apps, and much more.&gt; With these considerations, we’ve decided that starting with the upcoming .NET 6 GA release, we will enable Hot Reload functionality only through Visual Studio 2022 so we can focus on providing the best experiences to the most users. We’ll also continue to pursue adding Hot Reload to Visual Studio for Mac in a future release.So, first they wanted &#34;bringing the full power of Hot Reload to as many .NET and C++ developers as possible&#34; but now they shifted to &#34;focus on providing the best experiences to the most users&#34;.Best part of this whole thing is the pull request which was opened (https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/22217) but &#34; locked and limited conversation to collaborators&#34; straight after opening it as Microsoft anticipated the backlash but still went ahead with the change.Seems they still have a lot to learn before they can indeed be trusted."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a common technique in embedded products, but I should point out that it&#39;s not useful for general purpose Raspberry Pi work.The author disables several important kernel features to boot faster, including network support and USB support. Obviously, if you plan to use network or USB then it&#39;s not an option to disable those. You can disable some of the other debugging features and little extras for a slight boost, but it&#39;s going to be negligible (&lt;1s, in my experience).The biggest change comes from removing the init system entirely and replacing it with the user-facing app. This is the fastest way to get your app started, but now you&#39;re responsible for doing everything that was previously handled by the init system. The author can do this because they don&#39;t have any network, timekeeping, or other system functions normally handled by the init system. They only needs to mount filesystems, which is easy to replicate inside of the app.Anyone planning to ship a Raspberry Pi based product should read this article carefully as a great starting point. Anyone who wants to use their Raspberry Pi for general purpose use or even with network connectivity or USB devices will be disappointed if they try these techniques. Great article, but it&#39;s a narrow use case."</p>

I am building a CNC router in my spare time and I ended up using a raspberry pi 3 since I want to cram in a ton of features and esp32s and stm32s are simply not cutting it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; allowing for a randomly discovered shrink wrapped headset twenty years from now to be able to update to the final software version, long after over-the-air update servers have been shut down.This resonates so much with me. Each time I setup a new device that requires an Internet connection, I think about how we can enjoy booting 30 years old retro computers and how the next generation will not be able to do the same because of locked down hardware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Massive props to John Carmack! We also need laws to protect consumers when they don’t have an enlightened champion on their side.Part of the reason I buy Apple devices is because Apple is unlikely to get acquired or go out of business for the foreseeable future. I wish there were viable alternatives. Android devices are not an option for me, as they are more likely to be abandoned and/or contain Google/manufacturer/carrier malware, and I need to use banking and work apps.In that same vein, I have a preorder for a Framework Laptop because, at least for actual computers, I have the option of not splurging on a non-upgradeable, non-customizable Apple device.We really shouldn’t have to wait for Librarian of Congress-granted exemptions, which can be rescinded at any time and are meaningless with locked-down devices anyway."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is tangential, but I really wish that their would be legislation, valid retroactively, to enable old unsupported devices to still be utilized. I think this goes somewhat beyond right to repair?Take for example digital backs for medium format cameras - these things are built in low numbers, with high end FPGAs and camera sensors, with JTAG interfaces ready to go and everything - but then forgotten about a few years later. Why not enforce the creation of some document on how one would build their own OS for it? Or how the bus from the sensor ADCs works? This all existed at one point internally, but now is lost, and most of this backs will slowly die and go to waste, even though they could easily be repurposed or repaired."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Magit is such an unbelievably good piece of software. If you haven&#39;t used it, please at least take a look. It seems like &#34;just a GUI for git&#34;, but that&#39;s missing the point — many operations suddenly become frictionless, so your entire workflow changes.I regularly do things like &#34;stash some of my changes, switch branch, cherry pick a commit, switch branch, do an interactive rebase reordering commits and dropping one, pop one of my stashes&#34;, and they become routine, so working with code becomes a fluent experience, rather than fighting with your tools.I would say that Magit and structural editing using Paredit are the two most important technologies that make programming great."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Magit is an exceptionally well made interface to Git. Yes, it’s built on top of Emacs, and that might stop many from even looking into it. - I am glad I made a deep dive into Emacs last year, and although I stopped using it as an IDE (VS Code is just too good), I still come back to it because of Magit (and macros, general text editing and org-mode). Yes, I have an interface for Git in VS Code as well, but it‘s very rudimentary compared to Magit, and it’s limited to the narrow left bar. And to give an example: Making „micro commits“ by staging various lines of changes is super easy in Magit, but I still haven‘t found out how to select several disconnected lines for staging in VS Code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Magit is insanely ergonomic. Like how easy is it to selectively stage portions of files in the git CLI? In magit it is usually just a few keystrokes.I wish magit-forge [0] had more features though - like I cannot create new labels from it.Please consider donating [1] to the developer if it has made your life any easier.[0] https://github.com/magit/forge[1] https://magit.vc/donate/"</p>

Then they threatened my wife and I gave up my password to stop them from hurting her.The password was suppressed by the court, but they let the police use it anyway because one of the officers (with no formal computer qualifications) testified he could have broken 2048-bit AES encryption without the password. And worse case he said he would unsolder the chips off the circuit board and put them onto another board and that would fix it. The judge allowed the testimony and believed it.Make sure you always use a password on your devices though.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; this case turns on one of the most fundamental protections in our constitutional system: an accused person’s ability to exercise his Fifth Amendment rights without having his silence used against him.A very interesting tidbit I learned here on HN a couple years back — the Supreme Court ruled in 1992 that you have to declare out loud an intent to invoke your Fifth Amendment rights, if you haven’t been formally arrested yet. Literal “silence” may be acceptable after being Mirandized, but not necessarily before.https://harronlaw.com/blog/miranda-rights-texas/https://www.oyez.org/cases/2012/12-246“Question: Does the Fifth Amendment&#39;s Self-Incrimination Clause protects a defendant&#39;s refusal to answer questions asked by law enforcement before he has been arrested or read his Miranda rights?”No, by 5-4 vote."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sortof off topic question.  I&#39;ve never owned a smart phone but might get one soon assuming I can find a decent one that will run grapheneOS.Is there an app that can be given permission to intercept the unlock code and upon receiving the panic/under duress code, discretely put the phone into a &#34;parental controls&#34; configuration that sandboxes all your data and only presents the storage you want the law enforcement children to see?  Some cops use a USB device that pulls all the data from the phone.  Is there a way to sandbox that data so they only get the data from approved apps and the forensics USB device does not know any better?  i.e. not denied data, but rather can only see what you want it to see.  Or should this be a feature request to the alternate phone operating systems developers?Maybe this duress code should also activate a timer.  If the all-clear code is not entered in a user-defined period of time, the phone wipes all user data in the background resetting it to a brand new phone.  Or maybe wipe the data for specified applications to not appear to destroy evidence?  Maybe also send network notifications(s) to specific in case of mission compromise destinations?[Edit] Feature request update.  This duress system should also log all the data that was added or planted after the duress code was entered, to log people planting evidence.  Upload encrypted manifest,timestamps and checksums to remote site in  the event law enforcement tamper with evidence."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The world wide web is only 28 years old.We&#39;ve had computers for 76 years at this point.We&#39;re discussing this topic in modern English, but if you look back 500 years William Shakespeare wouldn&#39;t be born for another couple of generations: vocabulary and grammar have changed a lot since then, and if you look back a further 500 years (to 1021AD) the &#34;English&#34; spoken in those days was a lot closer to Frisian than anything we&#39;d understand.To get the big picture of what 500 years means ... the oldest surviving writing is roughly 5500 years old. We&#39;ve had agriculture for roughly 11,000 years. And you&#39;re asking for a personal legacy to be legible and usable after surviving a span of time 10% as vast as the existence of writing itself?Think archival grade materials and ink, then add translations into Mandarin, Arabic, and Spanish -- there&#39;s a much better chance of it being readable if you have more than one language. Then maybe add a dictionary, just in case words have fallen out of use. Make multiple copies and distribute them around the world, including tectonically stable desiccated regions that are currently lightly- or un-inhabited and likely to remain so: the criteria for deep disposal nuclear waste repositories are applicable (minus the &#34;deep&#34;) bit, so Yucca Flats would do, or the Atacama Desert or the McMurdo dry valleys in Antarctica."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Other comments have given ways to physically archive the webpage. Continually hosting it is a much trickier endeavor. Beyond just keeping the servers up, technologies will shift such that eventually html webpages, servers that talk using tcp/ip, datacenters that connect via fiber cables, etc will all be deprecated.That said, if we have a very liberal definition of the word &#34;website&#34; to include any successor technologies where a device can be used to request a document, given an identifier, that looks recognizably like your webpage, this is doable. What you really need is an institution that you can trust to keep existing and to keep the necessary upkeep of your website as part of its mission.The main institutions I can think of that have lasted for 500 years unbroken are churches and elite universities.  If you were able to convince the Pope to decree that the church should keep hosting your webpage in perpetuity, that would likely work, but persuading him of that sounds very challenging.  That said, universities are used to accepting gifts with sometimes eccentric strings attached.  The gift will probably need to be large; but I imagine a $1B donation to Harvard under a condition that they continue to host and update the page as needed would likely work. Getting that sort of money is quite hard, but tbh probably easier than coming with a way of guaranteeing that your direct descendents keep the webpage up."</p>

  Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
  Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,
  Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
  And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
  Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
  Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
  The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
  And on the pedestal, these words appear:

  Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
  Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;“We used a special cable device which I built in Moscow before going to Cuba. We planned to fly the camera between two big buildings in a major street. Because of security and insurance problems we used it in a little street. We used two cables and a small cart with eight wheels and a fork underneath where the camera was placed at the [end] of a handheld move. The secret of how we attached the camera to the cart was a magnet, part of which was in the cart and part of which was built on the camera. From the window the camera moved out about 100 feet.&#34;[1]The camera was an Éclair CM3 Camiflex, which is a beautiful little camera first built in 1945. There are still some for sale.[2][1] https://ascmag.com/articles/flashback-soy-cuba[2] http://www.visualproducts.com/storeProductDetail02.asp?produ..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Soy Cuba contains lush and gorgeous B&amp;W cinematography. The film opens up with the camera flying over the waters of Cuba; the reflection of the water is glistening in a way unlike other films. I believe they used an X-ray film strip to achieve this shot.Mikhail Kalatozov has included another impressive shot at the end of his previous work, &#34;The Cranes Are Flying.&#34; (Palme d&#39;Or at Cannes 1958) The camera follows the protagonist, then gets seamlessly lifted up by a crane to depict the entire street parading.While Soviet-era films does not have much exposure in the English-speaking world, there are so many gems, critically and technically. The filmmakers were acutely aware of great filming techniques.Also check out:Walking the Streets of Moscow (1964)
- B-roll scenery contains another lush reflection of the Moscow watersIvan the Terrible (1944/1958)
- Eisenstein is an ardent practitioner of the montage, and prefers to static camera shots. However, his compositions are very imaginative, and there is no shot you want to miss. His film also briefly experiments with color, and he exploits colored lighting to emphasize the characters&#39; psyche.Anything by Andrei Tarkovsky
- Tarkovsky is indisputably a master of Russian cinema after Eisenstein. He often shoots in nature, but no director shoots with such rich texture of the mud. His long shots emphasizes the bleakness inherent in the Russian psyche.The Ascent (1977)
- Set in WWII, the film shows the resistance escaping the Nazis covered in snow and panting in the cold. Great snow photography.Hard to Be a God (2013)
- A sci-fi story on the immigration of humans to a different planet, the colonizers inhabit the inhospitable environment. Like Tarkovsky, the slow dragging in the mud conveys the dreary lives.These are recommendations I came up off the top of my head relating to cinematography, but there are definitely many more to appreciate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Personal anecdote: This was the first film I ever projected in 35mm. Our university theater obtained a print from the national film archive of Venezuela; it was a copy of the 1995 restoration. Incredibly striking, lush visuals, and partially responsible for my continued personal and professional interest in screening archival film. Six years later, I still remember the joy of projecting this exact sequence. I&#39;m glad the film survives."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This has the same kind of relaxing vibe as Stardew Valley. A very rare instant purchase for me once it is released.For me personally these games stand out in a huge way in the sea of generic AAA micro-transaction &#34;games&#34;. If anyone wants to drop some more SV-like game recommendations I&#39;d love to hear them.I am in continued awe ConcernedApe was able to accomplish all this largely on his own.And beyond this that he continues that approach with his new game even though he could surely afford to just bring on as many developers/designers as he needed. He could even churn out a new game on a yearly basis and &#34;milk&#34; it all to maximize profit. The fact he is doing none of this speaks volumes (at least to me).Eric if you somehow happen to stumble upon this comment know you&#39;ve brought one couple many many happy hours together. We wish you all the best, and much love!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I learned today that Eric (ConcernedApe) does the music for his games too... Music, art and graphics, storytelling, and game development all in one dude, what a talent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been amazed of what Eric has created single-handedly already, and am so pleased he&#39;s doing something new! Stardew Valley is a prime example of what I want in modern games and so often find lacking. No microtransactions, single-player-friendly, not graphic-intensive. Not every game needs to or should be Stardew Valley, of course, but there&#39;s not enough Stardew Valleys out there.Few of us are as talented as Eric is, but I wish more of us tried a little harder to create what we wish existed, and not fall into the trap of what&#39;s popular. To bastardize legend, &#34;If I were not [me], I wish I were [ConcernedApe].&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Biggest advice I can give is you probably don&#39;t need search if you&#39;re indexable by search bots.No really. Look over people&#39;s shoulders sometime.They&#39;ll just go to Google and type in their search followed by terms such as Wikipedia, imdb, Stackoverflow, YouTube, Bandcamp, Amazon, eBay, Yelp... all sites that spent a lot of time on their search and have done quite a decent job. Oh well.So unless you really need it for some critical reason where you know your users aren&#39;t going to do their regular patterns of going through one of the general engines, close the ticket as out of scope and go home early.Don&#39;t bother implementing hard to do and expensive to maintain features that nobody will use. It&#39;ll become more headache than fun real quick."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A problem close to my heart. Good search is certainly still too difficult to pull off for small teams, and this was one of my motivations for building and open sourcing Typesense[1].Most people think of search and immediately think of large data sets, but the problems that plague smaller datasets are equally interesting. It&#39;s less about performance and more about relevance. For e.g. searching across multiple fields for a compound query like &#34;taylor swift style&#34;, requires breaking the query into segments (taylor swift | style) before searching for the appropriate fields. There are also a class of problems that traditional search engines that rely on BM25 or TF-IDF for ranking cannot reliably solve (e.g. searching on small texts like titles) where you have to consider distance between matching words (which TF-IDF and BM25 miss). Lastly, there is also personalization which is almost always left as an exercise to the reader :)[1]: https://github.com/typesense/typesense"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The simplest advice to engineers would be to not think elastic search as some black box that will solve all of your search problems. In fact, if you&#39;ve never implemented search before it&#39;s the last tool you need. Postgres full text search is all you need. The most important thing in search is to surface relevant results and no one can quantify relevancy. It&#39;s as unquantifiable as it gets in technology. You need to understand what results are relevant for your users and find a metric that would work to rank accordingly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So does this functional SQL just get &#34;transpiled&#34; into analytical SQL? If so, where does &#34;transpilation&#34; occur, in the client, intercepted before hitting the query engine, etc? Or has the query engine itself been modified to handle functional SQL?If the query engine itself has been modified, are there any performance gains or losses?This is a pretty interesting and compelling idea. I do wonder if the functional SQL approach might entice developers to write very bad/expensive/ineffective queries. Then again, nothing is stopping developers from doing the same with analytical SQL."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is immediately useful. The number of awkwardly nested subqueries that I write because I don&#39;t have this kind of functionality in BigQuery is a huge bummer.I am curious, how many Haskell programmers do you all have? And more seriously, do you have any plans to help provide this functionality to non-Postgres SQLs, or at least help those trying to take inspiration from it?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Database researcher here.This is really cool! I wonder what was the initial drive for this new feature?Is this meant to be a &#34;short-cut&#34; to express complicated SQL queries, or is this meant to adding new semantics beyond SQL? While I like the idea of custom data types with dataflow-like syntax, implementing a whole new query processing engine for the new data type seems like a lot of engineering work. Also you now have to handle many edge cases such as very very large time series -- I wonder if you have efficient lookup mechanisms on timevectors yet, and various timestamp and value types. If all these new syntax can actually be expressed using SQL, however complex, I think a &#34;lazier&#34; approach is to write a &#34;translator&#34; that rewrites the new syntax into good old SQLs or add a translator at planning stage. This way you can take advantage of Postgres&#39; optimizer and let it do the rest of heavy lifting.Kusto has a similar data type &#34;series&#34; that is also created from aggregating over some columns (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/q...)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"An especially novel aspect of this lawsuit, quoting the press release:&gt; This approach makes it the first legal case that focuses on the rights of individual consumers as third-party beneficiaries of the GPL.&gt; “That’s what makes this litigation unique and historic in terms of defending consumer rights,” says Karen M. Sandler, the organization’s executive director.In the past, GPL enforcement has been a cause of action brought by the copyright holder. This suit is on behalf of users, as beneficiaries of the GPL. If this suit is successful, it&#39;ll no longer be necessary to prove sufficient standing as a copyright holder of GPLed code in order to enforce the license; it&#39;ll suffice to show that you&#39;re a user who wishes to make use of the rights provided under the license."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks to be a major change in the legal strategy behind GPL. In the past the focus has been on copyright claims by copyright holders, but as recent cases has shown in Germany and France, those has faced some rather strange setbacks. Germany don&#39;t seem to want to recognize copyright holders that only contributed a part of a larger work, which is basically all copyright holders for larger FOSS projects. In France they seems to define GPL as being under contract law and not under copyright law.In this new case, the SFC is arguing a case in the context of third-party beneficiary which is under contract law and not copyright law. It seems like a bit of an long-shot, but if won it could mean a major change in interpreting GPL as a contract rather than a copyright license. I would guess that it also would change their strategy in other countries if won."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Long time lurker here, first time poster. I got pulled into the rabbit hole of building guitars at home during the covid lockdowns. My first build used traditional &#34;tonewoods&#34; (mahogany, ebony, rosewood etc.) and while purchasing materials for my second build, I stumbled upon bamboo boards on a German wood retailed shop.Compared the properties to the wood I wanted to use for parts of it (mainly the core/neck and fretboard) and decided to go for it.So the second build [1] is 40ish % bamboo with purpleheart veneers in between layers of bamboo and purpleheart/olive for the body. Next build will be around 80% bamboo. Trying to source some strand woven bamboo boards to try them out as fretboards as well, but for a part time builder like me, getting such small quantities of bamboo boards is rather hard.But yeah, fascinating material even outside of construction use. The boards I used for the guitar builds were nice to work with, easy to sand and finish (using wipe on poly).[1] https://i.imgur.com/fUyxd7n.jpg"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was interesting in light of an interview I was just listening to yesterday, a CBC podcast [1] talking about the benefits of mass timber (glued wood) for large highrise building construction.There were two guests on, both sounded like environmentalists, with the first one (Michael Green) saying that mass timber was&#34;currently the best tool we have to address climate impact and in the building materials for a large building&#34;while the second guest (John Talberth) was arguing:&#34;The idea that we can cut down our forests and turn them into two by fours and build our way to a stable climate is absurd, and it&#39;s just another one of these false narratives of big timber corporations are using to get us to buy more of their product and continue to subsidise their record profits&#34;,and Talberth advocated Bamboo, mentioning it multiple times as an alternative.  It kind of went back and forth a bit with Mr Green saying&#34;Bamboo, for instance, is not structurally a material that can actually satisfy the demand of three billion people that need a new home because it doesn&#39;t build large buildings&#34;and Mr Talberth saying&#34;Believe it or not, bamboo can actually be put together in the structurally with high structural integrity beams to make taller buildings&#34;It kind of left me wondering who was right... though Mr Green (an architect) sounded like someone with actual experience making buildings, where as the Mr Talberth (an economist) sounded like he might have been doing a bit of ill-informed wishful thinking about Bamboo.Seeing the process here gave me a bit more perspective on the discussion.   Given the labour involved and the fact that you are working with 20mm x 5mm cross-sections of bamboo, I can see how it would be extremely expensive to build a large building out of bamboo, and the $300 euro price tag on a sheet of plywood at the bottom of the page added more confirmation that it&#39;s not going to be a practical replacement for large-scale building.[1] https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-oct-20-2..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really neat article, love things like this on HN. I thought this was really interesting:&gt; A bamboo stem reaches its maximum height in just a few months and shall not grow taller or thicker over time. In the following 4 years the fibers will &#34;lignify&#34; and get their extraordinary mechanical properties in terms of hardness, strength, density.That seems pretty fascinating to me. Are there any other plants/trees that grow like that? I mean, from my naive knowledge, trees go wider with a new ring every year."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This has happened to me frequently at my current company. I get pulled into a meeting about something that I have no context on because it touches my area of expertise, and the discussions have apparently been stalling out.I brace myself to be the idiot. I&#39;m going to waste everyone&#39;s time asking questions that everyone knows the answer to, and I just got looped in, so everyone&#39;s going to feel like they need to walk through all the super-obvious stuff to satisfy the one guy who didn&#39;t do his homework.So I start asking questions, and slowly begin to realize that nobody in the room has any idea what they are talking about. That there are fundamental misunderstandings and misconceptions about existing systems. And, naturally, it turns out that the questions I have are questions that other people have.This has happened to me so often now that you would think the sinking feeling I get before I brace myself to look stupid would go away, but it never does."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was younger, I often met people who seemed kind of dim to me, at first, and later found the majority of them to be orders of magnitude brighter than me.
It was not hard to connect the dots, the reason they were so much brighter was (in part) exactly because of what made them initially seem dim.. They asked questions, honestly. Not the showoff kind of question you ask to show how much you know, but real, honest questions that not only showed how little they knew, but importantly, allowed them to actually learn and understand, rather than just nod and not get it.My intuition has changed from this, I find it that most times, when someone shows genuine interest and asks honest, revealing questions about some new topic, they often excel at many other things (and will likely on the new topic as well).I&#39;m adapting this myself, being honest, asking honestly, and sometimes looking really stupid (because, in that context, I am!), and I appreciate greatly both the wealth of information that allows me to access, and that almost anybody worth their salt recognizes this trait as well.Failing an interview due to looking stupid is probably a blessing in disguise, you don&#39;t want to be hired by people who can&#39;t see this, and you don&#39;t want to work next to people who&#39;s just pretending to understand, not learning because they can&#39;t afford to look stupid when they are (and thus stay stupid, and be much more inclined to try to pass blame to someone else, like you, who look stupid)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One way to prove that he truly doesn&#39;t mind looking stupid would be to list times when he risked looking stupid... and it turns out he actually was.It&#39;s happened to all of us though we dont like to admit it.I&#39;m sure it&#39;s happened to him too  and I looked but I didn&#39;t see any of those examples listed.Giving only examples of when people thought he was dumb and it turned out he wasn&#39;t... that&#39;s kind of just a roundabout way of humblebragging that you&#39;re an unrecognized genius.Sadly I think this undermines the point of the article which otherwise makes a good point."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The thing that burns out web developer is web development. The constant shift of technologies (just for the sake of it) and the nerfed (to oblivion) environment is hell. As a web developer, after you learn the basics (~5 years)  there is no feeling of where the &#34;up&#34; direction is. Everything feels like sidesteps. There is no feeling of permanence to your knowledge, unlike a lawyer or a doctor. The knowledge feels like water pouring into a full container - as much of it goes out, as it goes in.Switched to embedded systems 7 years ago to avoid the burnout. It is better, in my opinion. Funny enough, there is a natural barrier to entry that keeps most programmers away - You have to understand how computers work, how operating systems work and you have to be able to code in C/assembly. I have a lot of fun and actually picked up electronics as a hobby, which will help me better myself professionally.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice read. I&#39;ve been doing web dev for 15 years. What has got me burnt out now:-Spend most of my time dealing with tooling issues.-Increasingly complex demands. Even the simplest problems now seems to be multi layered with dozens of edge cases to be accounted for. It&#39;s seemingly impossible to get anything right. You can spend hours testing a responsive design on every browser, every viewport - send it to the client and you&#39;ll get after 5 minutes a list of 50 issues, half of them totally asinine.-Lack of respect/authority/autonomy. After 15 years I&#39;m considered a subordinate to a PM with 6 months experience and zero technical knowledge. This one can be improved a little by working remotely I think. But it just comes down to how management view or value different roles. We are a liability to them, something to be managed, coerced and controlled.-Oversaturated market, learntocode, let&#39;s be honest and say for 95% of companies, web devs are a commodity. I don&#39;t have an issue with people who are excited and want to learn coding, but the reality is the job market is over stuffed.-Leetcode interviews. I just don&#39;t have the energy, desire and sometimes specific knowledge to deal with these interviews. Its a straight no from me now, if i get contacted by a recruiter requesting I do one of these.I can see clearly that other people in non technical fields are getting paid better or the same as me and dealing with far far less work and far less stress.It&#39;s like there are two type of work category: &#34;reviewers&#34; and &#34;implementers&#34;. Reviewers are the stakeholders, they make all the demands and do none (or very little/superficial) of the actual work. Implementers, well we are the ones who do the heavy lifting and deal with all the real problems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel pg’s point is similar to musicians. As an example, Glenn Gould was a classical pianist and renowned Bach interpreter. He had awesome technical ability at the piano, and a fantastic memory. But lots of incredible pianists have these abilities. Go to any university or observe any competition and you’ll plainly see awesome talent. These qualities are analogous to “being smart”.However, what set Gould apart from his colleagues was his innovative and iconoclastic interpretations of well-known works with “standard” prescriptions. He had fundamentally different, but wholly consistent, ideas about musical interpretation, recording technology, presentation of music to audiences, and so on. He’s remembered as a pianist not because his fingers were quick and sensitive, but instead because he pushed boundaries in completely original ways.Leonard Bernstein—a noted conductor and pianist—quips about this when he conducted the Brahms Concerto in D minor, with Gould at the piano [1]. I recommend listening but I’ll copy his words (from [2]) for posterity.&gt; Don&#39;t be frightened. Mr. Gould is here. He will appear in a moment. I&#39;m not, um, as you know, in the habit of speaking on any concert except the Thursday night previews, but a curious situation has arisen, which merits, I think, a word or two. You are about to hear a rather, shall we say, unorthodox performance of the Brahms D Minor Concerto, a performance distinctly different from any I&#39;ve ever heard, or even dreamt of for that matter, in its remarkably broad tempi and its frequent departures from Brahms&#39; dynamic indications. I cannot say I am in total agreement with Mr. Gould&#39;s conception and this raises the interesting question: &#34;What am I doing conducting it?&#34; I&#39;m conducting it because Mr. Gould is so valid and serious an artist that I must take seriously anything he conceives in good faith and his conception is interesting enough so that I feel you should hear it, too.&gt; But the age old question still remains: &#34;In a concerto, who is the boss; the soloist or the conductor?&#34; The answer is, of course, sometimes one, sometimes the other, depending on the people involved. But almost always, the two manage to get together by persuasion or charm or even threats to achieve a unified performance. I have only once before in my life had to submit to a soloist&#39;s wholly new and incompatible concept and that was the last time I accompanied Mr. Gould. (The audience roared with laughter at this.) But, but this time the discrepancies between our views are so great that I feel I must make this small disclaimer. Then why, to repeat the question, am I conducting it? Why do I not make a minor scandal — get a substitute soloist, or let an assistant conduct? Because I am fascinated, glad to have the chance for a new look at this much-played work; Because, what&#39;s more, there are moments in Mr. Gould&#39;s performance that emerge with astonishing freshness and conviction. Thirdly, because we can all learn something from this extraordinary artist, who is a thinking performer, and finally because there is in music what Dimitri Mitropoulos used to call &#34;the sportive element&#34;, that factor of curiosity, adventure, experiment, and I can assure you that it has been an adventure this week collaborating with Mr. Gould on this Brahms concerto and it&#39;s in this spirit of adventure that we now present it to you.Because some took this as an attack on Gould, Bernstein followed up with the remark:&gt; Any discovery of Glenn&#39;s was welcomed by me because I worshiped the way he played: I admired his intellectual approach, his &#34;guts&#34; approach, his complete dedication to whatever he was doing.Anyway, it’s an interesting parallel in the arts world. Jacob Collier is a musician of today that has similar qualities of “being smart with good ideas”.[1] https://youtu.be/SvWPM783TOE[2] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Philharmonic_concer..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another way to frame this topic: intelligence doesn&#39;t always lead to impact, and impact is what matters.Example: I met a ton of trivia &#34;nerds&#34; through a friend a few years ago. They had all met at an Ivy League college, they were clearly &#34;smart&#34; in that they knew a lot of information and could follow a logical argument but somehow none of them were able to use their smarts for anything practical. They had jobs you didn&#39;t need to be that smart for, and their personal lives were sort of messy. I didn&#39;t really know what to make it them at the time, now I think they had the &#34;smarts&#34; but they didn&#39;t have the &#34;drive&#34; so their brains sort of did them no good.Another example: Plenty of people are constantly frustrated that they are misunderstood. &#34;I am so smart but I can&#39;t get anything done around here because everyone&#39;s an idiot.&#34; Some people go through their whole life believing this. Luckily I had a job that disabused me of this and taught me to communicate my ideas clearly and persuasively to others. But without that, without the ability to persuade people of your ideas, you might as well not have them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hamming (of Hamming codes) has a famous Bell Labs talk &#34;You and Your Research&#34;, describing how to have a large impact. It covers a lot of the same ground, but in more detail:https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.htmlA few points from it:You&#39;ve got to work on important problems.How about having lots of `brains?&#39; It sounds good. But great work is something else than mere brains.The people who do great work with less ability but who are committed to it, get more done that those who have great skill and dabble in it.The prepared mind sooner or later finds something important and does it. So yes, it is luck. The particular thing you do is luck, but that you do something is not.One of the characteristics you see, and many people have it including great scientists, is that usually when they were young they had independent thoughts and had the courage to pursue them."</p>

The economy is riddled through with people who do nothing, but get paid because structurally that’s who gets paid.Intuit is one of those companies. They produce a few real products, QuickBooks for businesses and Mint, but overwhelmingly their money comes from the fact that they charge rent on filling your taxes. They’re a parasite on our society.Fortunately the podcaster wasn’t talking about the US; their country was worse off than America in this area by far.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I served in the Georgia legislature during a portion of a similar story. Without a doubt, the calculations throughout the story were political not technical.In the Georgia version, the technical details of the exposed information in the Secretary of State&#39;s office were facepalmingly simple (misconfigured apache directives) yet the story dragged on politically for years.Quickly, a hired security researcher for a corporate client found all registered voters info and instructional pdfs with credentials for the elections system publicly indexed by google. They responsibly disclosed. The apache configuration was updated to &#34;use encryption&#34; (moved from http to https) but still left the info indexed by google over https vs. http.    Eventually, this information became public.The state attempted to prosecute the security researcher but found no state statutes they could use. They then used this incident as a base to create a bill to criminalize the security researcher&#39;s actions.As a state rep, I worked very hard to push back on a bad bill spawned by the incident that would&#39;ve criminalized responsible disclosure.Only due to bi-partisan efforts from technically versed people were we able to get the Governor at the time to veto the bill.https://www.snopes.com/ap/2017/06/15/researcher-finds-georgi...https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/comp..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find the article title kind of curious, given that it states Parson has &#34;doubled down&#34; which suggests that the video the article references is an active effort on Parson&#39;s part. It then goes on to state that the video was produced by a PAC Parson created but doesn&#39;t give direct input to. Comes off as unnecessarily inflammatory to me I suppose.Having said that, this situation in particular really tests my willingness to assume good faith on the part of the governor and his body of advisors. Is he legitimately without a single person close to him that could inform him of how misguided this line of aggression is, and how fortunate it was that the individual who identified the security problem acted in such a helpful manner? On top of that he assigned the Missouri State Highway Patrol to investigate, because given his perceived severity of the situation that&#39;s the best agency at his disposal? It all just seems bananas.I try not to assume that totally inane actions from elected officials are exclusively the result of political calculus, and I suppose I don&#39;t have any evidence to assume that&#39;s the case here either. But I&#39;m at a loss as to how this situation could blossom into something so ridiculous."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is pretty good overview. One fun tricks we would regularly do was move all the background audio off the disk and into GPU ram. We&#39;d stream just enough that we wouldn&#39;t saturate the bus but could get back 20-30mb of system memory.There was also that time we ran out of open file handles ahead of key demo at one of the tradeshows. I remember rewriting the whole audio streaming subsystem to piggyback on the seekfree texture loading system so that we could use the that single big file as a source for both streaming texture and audio data. Did that in 24 hours less than 2 days ahead of the show, fun times.[Edit]Another fun thing from that era was that almost no one other than the in-house Sony Studios used the SPUs well. X360 came out just ahead and had tooling that was miles ahead(PIX!) so everyone started from the X360. None of the workloads we&#39;re vectorized so it was absolutely brutal to get them to fit into the SPUs. For a long time a good chunk of that silicon was just idle. If you did start from the PS3 though because of the vectorized workloads you had insane cache coeheranch and usually ran better on the X360/PC as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was a fantastic read; thank you for sharing.I saw escorts for a couple of years.  It was often weird, when I just didn’t click with the woman, but I met a few really awesome people.There are other down sides to escorting.  One of the women I had seen a couple of times, was later murdered. They ended up catching the killer- another escort, I don’t know why.  It was hard to grieve; we were not real close; her family probably didn’t want clients showing up at the funeral or any other reminder like flowers.I ended up falling in love with one of the women I met and we dated for a while.  It was a serious emotional roller coaster being in love with someone who was having sex with other men until she was ready to “go exclusive”.  But in the end we got married after she retired.Now it’s ten years later. We have a son and are still happy as can be.If you’re thinking about seeing escorts, remember that since intimacy with other people is involved, there are often strong emotions as well."</p>

And that this market also happens to be less likely to be time-suck jerks about little issues, or constantly asking for product changes/features?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very cool stuff.I remember being at Build 2018 and asking the PM on the Live Share team if they had any plans to bring VS Code to the browser. Maybe do managed environments for labs and companies (what GitHub code spaces now is), would be great for education. Lots of students (especially non-CS nerds, like the physics kids with a CS requirement) find environment setup to be one of the hardest parts. He seemed to think I was a piece of shit for not ‘getting’ what Live Share was all about and how those other offerings (code spaces, running in the browser without install) were bad ideas not worth considering.I think the moral of the story is, if you’re a PM, don’t treat your most enthusiastic customers like shit. Or maybe do, because it won’t actually have business impact."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems really cool, and seems like it took a lot of man hours to put together.However, I&#39;m not sure who this is for. Downloading and installing an application is not a particularly big ask for the type of people who use VSCode. The browser version will always be a compromised experience, given the inherent limitations of browser applications. Even if it works 99% of the time, that 1% would add enough friction to make it more of a hassle then it&#39;s worth.The post gave some use cases involving hardware that can&#39;t easily run Desktop VSCode (e.g. iPads and Chromebooks). I just don&#39;t see that being much of a use case though, except in desperate circumstances where a more capable dev machine isn&#39;t available.If there are some use cases I&#39;m missing, I&#39;d love to hear about them! This is a pretty new concept, and I certainly don&#39;t know how everyone likes to code.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ve been using Brave search for several months now. I switched the day that it was announced. The quality is fairly good, but I’m having troubling telling whether it’s just my own halo effect or if the initial quality that experienced has started to slip a little as it indexes more widely or something. At first I was impressed with how little spam ended up in top results, but lately exact queries for Python functions or prominent API functions have lots of spammy content above the actual documentation. Talking about sites that just republish GitHub issue threads, republished StackOverflow questions, w3schools-likes, etc.I’m still rooting for them, but in general
I continued to be baffled why such blatant spam can consistently make it into top results on Google, DDG and now Brave. I really wish a search engine would empower me to provide a URL ban list that gets applied server-side instead of filtering on the front end (if anything)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You know what, I welcome a new search provider, even if it&#39;s by a cryptocurrency company. I&#39;d rather see Qwant succeed, but their search is having trouble competing with even duckduckgo.What I don&#39;t see is where Brave gets its image search results from. After Microsoft blatantly started serving the CCP by blocking queries for &#34;tank man&#34;, which as far as I know they&#39;ve never actually apologised for, just explained it as &#34;a filter with more impact than expected&#34; or some BS like that, I found out that most &#34;competing&#34; search engines bought all of their image search from Microsoft, leading to the same kind of censorship on platforms such as duckduckgo.Brave says it&#39;s using &#34;third parties&#34; to generate the results but I can&#39;t easily see which third party that would be. If they are using Bing like all the others, I wouldn&#39;t trust their image search engine in the slightest.Personally, I&#39;ll just assume they are for now, because they don&#39;t seem to clarify this further anywhere else.From what I can tell, there are four image/video search providers in the world: Google, Bing, Yandex and Baidu. The rest all seem to license their results from one of the big four, mostly from Bing. When I need to pick from those four, I&#39;ll stick with Google; their censorship is relatively mild. I was hoping Brave Search would prove to be an alternative in this area, but that doesn&#39;t seem to be the case."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For non-technical searches, mostly stuff relating to news, politics, or Covid, Google is next to useless at this point due to their attempts to combat misinformation. Even their autocomplete functionality guides potential search queries in an entirely unorganic manner. For instance, something may be trending according to google, while simultaneously being blacklisted as an autocomplete option- if it has Any elements of wrongthink about it."</p>

Recent data from the Norse Greenlandic population, however, show no evidence of the last of these.Is it possible the Vikings were not in that location long enough for populations to mix?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"No idea why you would write this up or share it honestly. Call me old fashion but I wouldn&#39;t want to do business with someone who scream irrationally as loud as they can in response to simple questions or during business meetings. Especially since the outcome didn&#39;t lead to anything, just was &#39;something different&#39;. Truly what is the message here?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What is telling about this example is that what seemed to have made the biggest impression was the least rehearsed, thought out, planned answer he could give, but rather the one that was the most sincere and most &#34;down to earth.&#34;I think there is so much about the YC format which really hints at that strategy likely being your best route of success -- the time constraint, the lack of pitch deck, etc. I mean, these are people who quite literally go through thousands of these. I can&#39;t really see any other way to possibly stand out than to try to be radically genuine and sincere, even when that seems (as the author seemed to have thought!) that it is the &#34;less fancy&#34; or &#34;not the thing you are supposed to say.&#34; Quite literally anything else will be something they will have heard, at a minimum, dozens of other times."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice story, but I think people here have the wrong takeaways from it. Having an outburst or sharing personal anecdotes isn&#39;t going to help you in an investor pitch. Had it happened earlier in their YC interview things wouldn&#39;t have gone any different, as they make it seem. The fundamental questions and doubts would have all been the same.If you don&#39;t have solid differentiators, growth charts, revenue models a touching story will not help your startup."</p>

Early this year I switched to a brand new M1 mini and this this is slower and less reliable than the thing I built myself that runs Ubuntu. My Ubuntu machine had a few little issues every no and then. My Mini has weird bugs all the time. e.g. Green Screen Crashes when I have a thumbdrive plugged in. Won&#39;t wake from sleep. Loses bluetooth randomly. Not at all what I&#39;d expect from something built by the company with unlimited funds.

It&#39;s not a lot of work or very difficult (I&#39;m an idiot at graphics editing), but you do need to spend the (small amount of) effort. I embed it as a data URI and it&#39;s just four lines of (col-80 wrapped) base64 text, which seems reasonable to me.Haven&#39;t managed to get my headshot down to less than 10k without looking horrible no matter how much I tweaked the JPEG or WebP settings, and thought that was just a tad too big to embed. Maybe I need to find a different picture that compresses better.I got that 280k Discord favicon down to just 24K simply by opening it in GIMP and saving it again. I got it down to 12K by indexing it to 255 colours rather than using RGB (I can&#39;t tell the difference even at full size). You can probably make it even smaller if you tried, but that&#39;s diminishing returns. Still, I bet with 5 more minutes you can get it to ~5k or so.It&#39;s very easy; you just need to care. Does it matter? Well, when I used Slack I regularly spent a minute waiting for them to push their &gt;10M updates, so I&#39;d say that 250k here and 250k there etc. adds up and matters, giving real actual improvements to your customers.The Event Horizon Telescope having a huge favicon I can understand; probably just some astronomer who uploaded it in WordPress or something. Arguably a fault of the software for not dealing with that more sensibly, but these sort of oversights happen. A tech company making custom software for a living is quite frankly just embarrassing to the entire industry. It&#39;s a big fat &#34;fuck you&#34; to anyone from less developed areas with less-than-ideal internet connections."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The difference between the Apple “precomposed” and standard icons had to do with the gloss effect on icons on pre iOS 7 home screens.When adding a website/webapp to these earlier home screens, the OS would apply a gloss effect over the icon in order to match the aesthetic of the standard apps.
The precomposed icon was a way for the developer to stop the OS from applying this effect, such as if their logo already had a different gloss effect already applied (i.e “precomposed”) or other design where adding the glossy shine wouldn’t look right.
The standard icon allowed the OS to apply the gloss effect - which was a timesaver as Apple did tweak the gloss contour over the years: hence using a standard icon ensured that the website/webapp always matched the user’s OS version."</p>

Everything was backed up on backblaze, but the internet connections they had available was simply too unreliable to get the backup down. They contacted backblaze and for a price that was high (but not insane for a company) backblaze actually flew a guy with a physical hard drive to their location.Saved ~5 gigs from being canceled, and my friend has been a die hard backblaze evangelist ever since."</p>

I hope they do well, and I hope they don&#39;t change too much in the pursuit of a profit. Not being profitable in the SaaS business is not necessarily the scarlet letter that it is in other fields, so I&#39;m optimistic for their future.Also, congrats Backblaze!

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I believe the thing we often need to learn is the thing we&#39;re afraid of learning. We often (always?) have weaknesses that can/do jeopardize our strength and closing those weaknesses is crucial.The famous Scott Galloway (whom I had as a b-school professor) made this point like this: if you are a great guy, great father, great boss, etc, but once in a while you get violently drunk and hurt people in your life - THAT thing offsets everything else. You won&#39;t become better by &#34;doubling down&#34; on what you&#39;re already good at, but by fixing this flaw.Another case - I used to manage a C++ developer. If you gave him a tight spec, he&#39;d implement it perfectly. But the world we lived in required him to go talk to people to figure out what the real needs are, and he was bad at that. So his code always solved the wrong problem unless someone was helping him with this stuff.Every year, his own developmental goal was to go learn the next C++ standard. And that would have been useless because he was already a great C++ programmer. Going from 97th percentile to the 98th wouldn&#39;t matter. The much bigger bang for the buck would be figuring out how to go sit down with a sales rep and say &#34;OK, what&#39;s our client actually trying to do here?&#34;It sounds simple but I believe this held him back not just in work but in life. I happen to know that he didn&#39;t have great communication with his wife and kids either - solving this thing would make him so much better at all parts of his life.The thing is - we all have glaring things like this - obstacles in our own trajectory that if we fix, our existing strength would really shine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can relate to the “looking at data” as a skill bit, especially the part where he mentions that it’s not a skill most data scientists necessarily have. I have observed that too. (I’m one myself)Many data scientists like to jump into feature extraction and modeling the data with ML/DS tools because for us that’s the fun part. (we might look at some plots and summary statistics but we don’t dwell there for too long.) Few have the patience to just sit with the data for a week just to look at it, checking it against our intuition about the real world and the domain and basically just trying to put 2 and 2 together without models (except a mental model of the world) and just turning the data over in Tableau (or Excel). It’s actually not an easy skill to learn because it requires other meta skills. For one it requires an ability to match numbers to the real world — and for that you need experience and a good intuition of how the world works.My first manager was exceptionally good at doing this. I’ve noticed too that folks in senior management — at least competent ones — tended to be good at looking at data and picking out things too. I suspect this is actually a make or break ability to get to senior management at most companies.Data scientists, not so much. (Unless they worked in the field or came from the business side of things.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The bit about compilers reminds me of this quote about Feyman, but sorry of the inverse where you hold tricks in your head instead of problems.Richard Feynman was fond of giving the following advice on how to be a genius. You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say, &#39;How did he do it? He must be a genius!&#39;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We are seeing a long term consolidation between hearing devices and headphones.On the headphones side, we are getting smaller, truly-wireless headphones with some ambient sound features (such as noise cancellation, and iOS hearing features). New trends like AR would just accelerate the change due to the need to solve all day worn audio devices.On the hearing aids side, almost every hearing aid today acts as an always connected set of headphones for your mobile phone (and has been like that for years on iOS).Deregulating this could bring the tech industry innovation to hearing aids through natural progression of headphones technology.This trend would make hearing aids not just target hearing impaired people, but also individual with normal hearing. For example, features such as protecting your ears against a sudden loud noise, silencing a loud restaurant so you can have a quiet conversation or improving the audio of a soft speaker could be useful for everyone."</p>

At that time all the above was included for every hearing aid we sold (Prices varied from $750 / ear - $3600 / ear.When I was in that field many companies tried &#34;pay as you go&#34; models, instead of bundles.You know what happened?

Sadly, most people wait too long before trying a hearing aid, and give up because they hear too much noise.Imagine returning your eye glasses because you still see ugly people.I truly wish hearing aids were far cheaper, and that was a very hard part of my job and one of the reasons why I changed careers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are a number of healthcare areas in the US that have been protected by regulation, but it’s increasingly unclear if this is good for patients, consumers, or public health at large. The increasing sentiment seems to be probably not.Vision care is another area I’d expect to see more changes and disruption coming down the pipeline. Vision care is very important and advanced cases require special skills, but it’s also unclear why many routine checks couldn’t just be done by a family doctor.The US requires one to see a “doctor of optometry” to get a basic single vision prescription. That industry used to make its money turning around and selling you glasses from the same office but that whole industry has been turned upside down by online retailers like Warby Parker and such. Why the US can’t follow the models followed most elsewhere in the world is unclear, but it would remove a lot of extra steps and costs in getting a basic care of glasses. Ophthalmology (medical doctors) are still very much a thing but most countries don’t have this model of needed a “prescription” from an optometrist for a basic pair of single vision specs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just as important as recycling these batteries is making it possible for older EVs to have their batteries replaced years down the road with 3rd party batteries.In 2031, it should be possible to by a long-past-warranty 2021 EV, replace the battery pack (with one made from recycled EV batteries!), and have it just-work.   Just like you can replace the engine of a classic car today if you are so inclined.It should be possible because the electrical connection of the batteries to EV drivetrains are relatively simple - although I&#39;m sure that will take a lawsuit (like was launched against Nespresso to allow 3rd party coffee pods) for EV manufacturers to release the specs required for this to happen.It would be unfortunate if EV batteries were non-serviceable except by the manufacturer after they were out of warranty, like phones are today.   Instead, battery replacement would potentially allow the tertiary used EV market to flourish, and make them more accessible to people of modest means."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We need to design devices such as batteries for recycling and long life from the design phase of the products. Solid-state Lithium batteries will probably be easier to recycle due to no sandwiching. &#34;The immediate benefit of switching from a liquid to solid electrolyte is that the energy density of the battery can increase. This is because instead of requiring large separators between the liquid cells, solid state batteries only require very thin barriers to prevent a short circuit.&#34; This separator material complicates recycling in conventional Lithium ion batteries.Instead of assuming we have endless resources we should design all products to recyclable from the start design phase. This is to lessen global warming and environmental impact."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The team tested batteries with recycled NMC111 cathodes, the most common flavor of cathode containing a third each of nickel, manganese, and cobalt. The cathodes were made using a patented recycling technique that Battery Resources, a startup Wang co-founded, is now commercializing.That seems like a waste of cobalt.  I think modern cells are usually something more like NMC811 (80% nickel, 10% each of manganese and cobalt).  You could use the cobalt from the old cells to make more than three times as many new cells, though you&#39;d need a lot more nickel.I&#39;m hoping most mass-market EVs switch over to using lithium iron phosphate, which doesn&#39;t use nickel or cobalt.  Supposedly there are some major LFP patents expiring soon; maybe that&#39;ll increase the number of factories outside of China producing them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thanks Google. Think I’ll be buying this.I want as little to do with Google’s services as possible in my life, but they really deserve credits for making a modern usable smartphone that is reasonably open. There is just one single feature I will be buying this for - the 5 years of software updates. While good image processing is definitely a pro, all of these software you’re presenting features I really don’t give a damn about. Just give me a phone that is meant to last a little while - and allow me to run what I damn please. This looks to be like a continuation of the Pixel 5, which allows you run your own software like /e/OS and CalyxOS aside to just being a lot less of a walled garden on the stock ROM.The Android market is completely dire, and no vendor can be trusted to provide openness, reasonable taste or security updates. They sell you a phone, and once you’ve clicked buy they’ve already stopped caring. So last year I switched to an iPhone 12. I needed to vote with my wallet to get a phone that lasts. But although I get what’s appealing about iPhones and the walled garden, I started feeling claustrophobic. Feeling claustrophobic about what I can tailor about my browser, how easily I can run Game Boy games, what ads I can block, and Apple’s stated intents to actively incriminate you by scanning your photos on a personal device. I will continue to recommend those phones for most people (pending what they’re going to do with trying to incriminate you), but it’s not for me.Finally here’s a seemingly good Android phone with 5 years of support - from the only phone vendor outside of Apple who appears to give a damn about that aspect. Don’t get me wrong: 5 years is still too short in my view, and not as long as Apple provides support for on their stuff [1]. But the market needs change, and I’ll put money towards that.[1]: The iPhone 5S has just hit 8 years of _kernel_ security updates last month with iOS 12.5.5. One can dream on the Android side, but I’ll take 5 years in the current market."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate the trend that the &#34;pro&#34; versions of all these flagship phones need to be an XL Phablet monstrosity. Human hands haven&#39;t gotten any bigger. I have owned most of the Nexus &amp; Pixel phones throughout the years. After having the Nexus 6 as my daily driver for 2 years, I have always opted for the smaller option ever since.I would totally pay flagship prices for a regular ~5.5-6&#34; phone with flagship specs, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one. Make it 50% thicker if there are space/heat concerns, but making it wider and taller just makes it super difficult to use consistently with one hand. I also say this as somebody with larger-than-average hands!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google seems to have for some reason requested a very/overly broad embargo from reviewers which does not let them show any photos taken with the device or software features for now.MKBHD mentions this (and shows nothing from the phone really) @ https://youtu.be/roWxo6jWoYw?t=140
And Mrwhosetheboss said he refused to cover these phones due to the embargo.
The Tech Chap mentions he can&#39;t show anything apart from the home screen. Can&#39;t even swipe down to show notifications @ https://youtu.be/aLr7eCsY6Cg?t=191Wonder what made them think that that&#39;s a good idea. Especially because Android 12 is not exactly a secret."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve always felt like there were two types of frameworks. Both types make the first x% of work relatively easy, but then the two types differentiate based off of how easily it is to drop down and go custom.A framework with strong primitives makes it easy to create custom functionality that is still consistent with the framework&#39;s conventions. But a framework that relies too much on magic makes this much harder. It&#39;s like all of a sudden you&#39;re surrounded with old Mainers saying &#34;you can&#39;t get there from here&#34; while you desperately try to cobble some kind of solution using ancient lore documented once long ago in a forgotten scroll."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The hammer analogy breaks down from the get-go for me. The main distinguishing factor between a framework and a library is the classic &#34;you call a library, but a framework calls you.&#34;A better (but still imperfect) analogy might be buying a timber frame (with plan) versus home-rolling a stick frame from the ground up. With the planned timber frame house, the rough layout of the rooms and plumbing and such is somewhat predetermined, and as such it &#34;calls you&#34; in the sense that you&#39;re building out the amenities, but with the ground-up stick frame, you&#39;re explicitly making all the framing decisions too.Like all things, there are bad frameworks, but scoped appropriately (simply) they can be incredibly useful. Just like houses, it turns out there are many ways in which web services are similar to each other and can benefit from a common framing."</p>

Hindenburg is the real deal.One challenge may be that, like the Mafia, Tether keeps its inner circle and employs family members. They have ~15 employees for a 70 billion dollar operation.The CTO’s wife is a manager, and the CEO’s daughter works for an unnamed crypto family office, which may be related.Their counterparties in Chinese commercial paper may not know they are counterparties due to proxies.Still, the statements are out there. Zeke Faux from Bloomberg got a copy of their records somehow. They’ve had to give them to the New York Attorney General, and their accountants in the Cayman Islands, among others. And other counterparties may have bits and pieces.Someone may be tempted by this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It may be counterintuitive, but the best thing that could happen to Bitcoin would be for Tether to collapse in a cloud of dust. Tether is continually cited as a large risk factor to Bitcoin by people who have gotten past the &#34;it&#39;s not real money&#34; objection.But I think it&#39;s worth considering what happens if the collapse never comes. If government investigation, findings of wrongdoing, admission of lies, and punishment aren&#39;t enough to shake Tether users out of their trees, then what would, exactly?Ethereum allowed a claw-back of funds lost fair and square to a defective contract. Where is Ethereum now? Oh yeah, near an all-time high and a market cap approaching half a trillion dollars.What non-users don&#39;t get is the fanatical level of devotion by users. It waxes and wanes with the Bitcoin halving cycle, but always comes back stronger than before.If Tether did somehow implode and users left in droves, something else would come along to take its place and within a year or two and the entire Bitcoin ecosystem would come roaring back stronger than ever."</p>

You slice them into junior and senior claims.3. You sell the junior claims to people who want levered Bitcoin: people who want margin loans against their Bitcoins, etc., who want to gamble on Bitcoin without putting up too much cash.4. You sell the senior claims as stablecoins: “Even if Bitcoin drops by 50%,” you say, “these coins will still be worth $1, because they are backed by $2 worth of Bitcoin.”"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Since the article mentions it, the amount of carbonation in any given beverage actually varies by a lot. The traditional measurement of carbonation is in &#34;volumes&#34;, which is the amount of space the CO2 would take up at standard temperature and pressure (32F and 1 atm). Coca Cola is usually packaged at 3 volumes; if you took all the CO2 out of the soda it would occupy 3x the volume of the soda it came from.Alcoholic beverages on the other hand have a pretty wide range of regular carbonation levels. On your lower end you have stouts and Scottish ales at 1.9-2.1, and on the high end you get your dubbel and heffe weisen at 3-3.5 volumes. Champagne is regularly in the 4.5-6 range, which necessitates a different bottle and closure design to handle the 2-3x pressure it contains compared to beer.On a particularly dumb note, ciders are limited by law to 0.64g per 100ml, or 3.2 volumes. Above that level they cease being ciders and instead become a sparkling wine. This is very important because natural cider is taxed at $0.226 per gallon, while sparkling wine is taxed at $3.30 or $3.40 per gallon depending on how the carbonation is added. This is a difference of roughly 30 cents per standard bottle, or $1.79 per six pack; enough of a difference to make similar products more attractive on the market place shelf.https://www.ttb.gov/tax-audit/quick-reference-guide-to-wine-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Putting gaps in is also a useful trick to have up your sleeve if you&#39;re 3d printing internal threads.  If you print threads as continuous bodies, the filament on each layer is effectively a ring which is (because of thread geometry) less supported for part of its length. When it contracts slightly as it cools, it can pull the overhang section of the thread away from the body of the object, and you end up with loose filament strung across the gap.If you cut gaps along the thread, when it prints you&#39;re effectively building a lot of small separated ledges out from a side wall. You don&#39;t have that cooling/tensioning effect and there&#39;s nothing to pull the filament away from where it&#39;s laid down so you end up with a cleaner thread.That&#39;s as long as your retraction settings are well tuned, mind - continuous thread is one long extrusion with no retractions, whereas thread with gaps is potentially lots of islands, depending on how your slicer reacts to the geometry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My country&#39;s national library used to provide a service in the 70s/80s where you could send a letter or telegram with a question, any question, and they&#39;d do their best to answer it.My Mum was a big fan of it, I&#39;ve still got a copy of their telegram response to her question of &#34;Why don&#39;t we see birds flying overhead with a penis flopping around?&#34;The answer was simple.&#34;Most birds don&#39;t have penises. They press cloaca to cloaca. Birds that do have penises store them in their bodies when not mating. Please stop sending questions about penises&#34;...it wasn&#39;t her first animal penis question submitted, and I&#39;m assuming she&#39;d developed a reputation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great article.I was actually responsible for invalidating another maps-related patent from the 1990s, in Germany. I was in Patent Litigation and I also remember having a &#34;ART+COM&#34; folder in my email, but that&#39;s about all I can remember. I don&#39;t think the case was very active by 2014.Anyhow, there&#39;s something Avi said that I have to comment on:The test for patent-worthiness is: “would it be non-obvious to someone who is skilled in the art?” I’d been doing “stupid programmer tricks” like this since high school, as have many others in my field.If only it were so simple! You would think that &#34;hey, that&#39;s just a stupid programmer trick!&#34; would be enough to render something obvious, but you&#39;d be wrong. That&#39;s what my paper [1] is about.No, to call &#34;obvious&#34; the combination of references A and B, there usually has to be some &#34;teaching, suggestion, or motivation&#34; in the literature that it would be a good idea to combine A and B. There are nuances to this statement, in case anyone&#39;s feeling pedantic.[1] https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2399580"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A Jury in Delaware decided already that Google Earth doesn&#39;t violate the 1995 Art+Com patent. So the thing is settled.But the fact remains that Art+Com had a working system in 1994 and the Keyhole founders had learned about it working at Silicon Graphics.As it looks like there were multiple teams in the US working on something like or comparable to Terravision. Heck, I wrote a program in 1984 showing the world as a ball with the contours of the continents at the ZX Spectrum. I bet hundred&#39;s if not thousands of people did that as well, it is not that hard and requires only a little trigonometry.I have no further insights into the story, but folks here should at least respect that a small group of hackers and and artists build a working system a good decade before Google Earth was published. I have yet to see any demonstration or video that comes near to Art+Com&#39;s TerraVision in 1994. There are papers written at the same time, a DARPA project working for a single military installation and a lot of work done shortly after TerraVision had been publicly demonstrated, but so far I have yet to see a video from 1994 or before comparable to Art+Com&#39;s TerraVision."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This post is quite nice in naming the people who did all the improvements. During this time, I was at a company trying to fit browser tech into consumer electronics, so we had to build the technology to run on actual inexpensive and cheap systems. Which became a core unmentioned technology, now called AJAX. Several engineers went to keyhole right at the time of the Google purchase, and did very well. Also remember Earth did little for Google, it was all maps - which had no flying demo, it was just 2d (ish) and useful."</p>

Which I think vast majority of people were happy with.Edit: Both 14&#34; and 16&#34; have 254 PPI, up from ~220. Apple tends to stick with same PPI for a very long time. So this is interesting. 3456-by-2234 or 3024-by-1964 is 14:9 Ratio. So somewhere in between the old 16:10 and 3:2 which is current trend of Lenovo and Surface Laptop."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is about the processors, not the laptops, so commenting on the chips instead. They look great, but they look like they&#39;re the M1 design, just more of it. Which is plenty for a laptop! But it&#39;ll be interesting to see what they&#39;ll do for their desktops.Most of the additional chip area went into more GPUs and special-purpose video codec hardware. It&#39;s &#34;just&#34; two more cores than the vanilla M1, and some of the efficiency cores on the M1 became performance cores. So CPU-bound things like compiling code will be &#34;only&#34; 20-50% faster than on the M1 MacBook. The big wins are for GPU-heavy and codec-heavy workloads.That makes sense since that&#39;s where most users will need their performance. I&#39;m still a bit sad that the era of &#34;general purpose computing&#34; where CPU can do all workloads is coming to an end.Nevertheless, impressive chips, I&#39;m very curious where they&#39;ll take it for the Mac Pro, and (hopefully) the iMac Pro."</p>

This also means that every chip Apple creates, from design to manufacturing, will be 100 percent carbon neutral.But what they won&#39;t do is put the chip in an expandable and repairable system so that you don&#39;t have to discard and replace it every few years.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good article, thanks for submiting!The challenge for AWS is one lots of incumbents have experienced: they created a market and it&#39;s economics 
and now they&#39;re being attacked by the next generation of market entrants who&#39;ve structured their businesses to _specifically_ attack those economics.What&#39;s interesting is that challenge can be a really big problem for incumbents, as those economics can form a core (very rigid) part of their operating model; it can make it VERY hard to address without fundamental (read: risky) change to a business. There aren&#39;t many examples of incumbent businesses doing it successfully, as it needs a kind of &#39;self-inflicted disruption&#39; that&#39;s very hard to do in large organisations where politics and empire building can make it difficult.If someone could do Managed NAT Gateway next I&#39;d appreciate it!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; So while AWS has 17 ways to run containers and 7 ways to do async message processing, all overlapping and reinforcing and supporting each other, Cloudflare will tend toward introducing singular primitives, stuff them in a box, and try to ship those boxes to as many places as will possibly take them. If they could install Cloudflare on your mobile phone, they would (this gets them dangerously close to being a real life Pied Piper).I think this statement resonates with me the most - it feels a lot like how I prefer to design systems (ahem, thanks Unix!): simple pieces or types, chained together into systems that are easy to understand, maintain, and scale.We&#39;re still only using Cloudflare&#39;s workers and it&#39;s integration with caching, but it&#39;s getting close to the point where I&#39;d have enough primitives to ship some of the functionality of our system architecture to Cloudflare and gain a net-win for latency and simplicity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Minor quibbles about game remarks:Contrary to what the article claims, draws in chess are very common (on the other hand, they&#39;re exceedingly rare in Go, and often impossible due to fractional komi).Sente in Go does correspond to having the initiative, but a move that compels a player into a particular follow-up move should be called a &#34;kikashi&#34; (forcing move)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Shame what happened to Terrahash (previous owner of L0phtCrack). As someone who has purchased several Brutalis cracking rigs, those things were the most badass machines on the market.Looks like they sold and committed to a bunch of cracking rigs before sourcing enough GPUs right before prices skyrocketed, and were suddenly on the hook for a lot more than they could realistically pay for. Hopefully Jeremi manages to pull through. It&#39;s a fantastic company that makes a fantastic product. I&#39;d love to buy some new rigs when they get their supply chain issues figured out.https://terahash.com/letter-from-ceo"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I haven&#39;t thought about Mudge in a long time. If you&#39;ve ever worked cybersecurity for the government, or in general, you owe him, Brian Oblivion, Space Rogue and the other members of L0pht for opening the door. They were pioneers of responsible disclosure, and brought the problem to light when they testified to Congress in 98 that in 30 minutes they could shut down the Internet. He and the others had uncovered DoS, specifically a BGP DoS that would automatically cascade across the Internet.Mudge was a musical prodigy and an alum of BBN, one of the key players in creating ARPAnet. His bio is fascinating, and you can find a good treatment of it here: https://www.cybersecurityeducationguides.org/peiter-zatko/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;From now on I will stay 100% with Vimeo but, as we know, they have a fraction of the viewership of You Tube – primarily because so few people know they even exist.Websurfer awareness is not the primary reason Vimeo has less viewership.The cause &amp; effect before the buildup of awareness is the incentives that prevent content creators to upload videos to Vimeo in the first place:- platform membership fees:  Youtube is $0 to upload and host, Vimeo used to be $240 and now has some new pricing plans[1] with a low-use free tier (too limited for high-res 4k uploads)- no advertising partners : Youtube enables monetization without content creators asking audiences to pay for subscriptions.  This financial model covers a wide variety of videos especially for unknown creators.The financial model of Vimeo is fine but its inherent costs will keep it smaller than Youtube because both the uploaders and the viewers don&#39;t want to pay.[1] https://vimeo.com/upgrade"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"YouTube seems to have three main priorities with their copyright system:1) Eliminate legal liability and risk of lawsuits. Technically all they need to do is comply with DMCA requests, but YouTube would rather not be sued by a major record company or film studio, even if they could win the case.2) Become friendly with major content creators (record and film labels, television studios). YouTube wants a good working relationship with these companies, to ensure that these companies post their content on YouTube. YouTube really wants the views they get by hosting SNL clips and Beyonce music videos.3) Actually help the independent content creators deal with copyright claims. This is a very, very distant third.Because of these priorities, YouTube has decided their best course of action is to offload all of the work on copyright claims onto the independent content creators, in order to keep the big media giants happy. After all, NBC doesn&#39;t need YouTube, but a solo channel with 50k subscribers absolutely does."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a music producer myself who makes music for film, I haven&#39;t had too many problems with use of my music in the work I do despite being distributed on all the usual major platforms. This is usually because content ID on YouTube gives credits and royalties to the original music creators, and most of my (remixed) uploads are not monetized once I publish them on YT. My distributer handles royalties for my all original music and pays me based on streams. I also make more money off spotify than YouTube even though I&#39;ve been on YouTube for a lot longer than on Spotify... Overall though, the best comes from licensing my music in films outside of Internet platforms.I gave up caring long ago about gaining money from views, my most profitable upload was in 2015 when I filmed my parrot falling off my kitchen counter... That video likely succeeded because it wasn&#39;t something that would provide me residual success that overshadowed YouTube&#39;s normal (controlled) revenue pipelines.I do however mysteriously get my own music blocked frequently on uploads to TikTok, and there is only complete and demoralizing frustration in trying to report the issue, because they don&#39;t care about small creators like me because we don&#39;t make them enough money probably.... TikTok and many social platforms keep support only as an afterthought, and finding the right place to get problems solved on most platforms is damn near impossible.The social media creator economy is dismal and highly competitive for musicians and film makers right now. One of the biggest copyright issues is people who completely hijack and fake &#34;original content&#34; as their own in order to get views in order to profit or sell popular accounts to influencers later.I&#39;d recommend primarily pursuing contracts with Amazon Prime or Netflix for independent films, rather than trying to battle YouTube because there is simply too much content ID activity on YouTube that is out of control, whereas on the alternate streaming services, they&#39;re geared more towards movies than to managing creator communities.If you are a film maker who needs music for a film project, contact music makers directly (producers that don&#39;t use samples in the work you need) in order to generate new, original, and exclusive music that they won&#39;t license or release anywhere else perhaps, make them sign a contract too... That might help in the future...?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"MuJoCo is the standard in much of robotics, and recently in the Deep RL space.When I was learning Deep RL, I edged on what could be done through OpenAI gym, or self-made environments, I decided to begin working with MuJoCo.But for an undergrad student from a developing country, the fees were extremely high.So, I just didn&#39;t go forward with Deep RL much. I dabbled for a while and tried using PyBullet. Did not go that well.Also thought about creating custom environments in Unity and then apply Deep RL in there. But it took too much effort.Creating a complex enough environment and getting used to it were, in themselves- full projects that took long term commitment.As a result, I did not learn much Deep RL to be able to apply it to complex, real-world-like scenarios.I think that it is going to change.I am excited about books, blogs, and videos that are going to be created as MuJoCo is open-sourced and available for free.I, personally, will get back into Deep RL the next opportunity I get."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tend to be more than a little skeptical of organizations like DeepMind and (especially) OpenAI lately, when it comes to their pledges to democratize their advances in AI/ML/robotics. This, however, is 100% a great move by DeepMind in the support of the community as a whole. Kudos to the team, and a big thanks as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great news! It was a real issue that so much RL research relied on non-free software. It was a problem that a big pile of money could solve, so I&#39;m glad someone with a big pile of money did :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an incredible time for knowledge management tools. Just a couple of years ago I was pulling my hair out trying to get a local wiki to feel like a native app, and now we have a dozen great options to choose from.I started using Obsidian when it came out last year, and it instantly clicked for me. I immediately migrated 20 years of notes to it.What differentiates Obsidian from all of the other tools in this area, is that they have made extensibility a top priority. The sheer breadth of plugins, themes, and other community-driven tools that have been generated in 18 months is spectacular. It makes it easy to recommend Obsidian because you can shape it into whatever you want.There are a handful of plugins like Dataview, QuickAdd, Kanban and Periodic Notes that make Obsidian an incredibly powerful environment for thought.I made a theme for Obsidian called Minimal that attempts to make the app feel more native, especially on Mac:
https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal...and published a couple of my own plugins and a Web Clipper bookmarklet: https://gist.github.com/kepano/90c05f162c37cf730abb8ff027987...The Obsidian community is just so fun, friendly, and collaborative, that you can&#39;t help but get involved and work on making the ecosystem better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I built a simple journal solution for myself two years ago. It sends an email every day and I can reply to it, and the response is stored in an SQLite database, in plain text. The db is on a remote server but copied to Dropbox every day (and in any case all the emails also exist in my sent folder).It is surprisingly effective at storing not just what I did with my day, but random thoughts and ideas, solutions to bugs, etc. All I have to do is type something every day.In 2 years I have typed around 150k words. For reading he whole thing is just one plain html page, searchable in the browser.I&#39;m currently experimenting with documenting my reading, while the book is being read (instead of a summary at the end). We typically forget what we expect while we read, and only remember the final impression. Taking notes at the end of each reading session, not just about what I just read, but also about what I think will happen next, and revisiting that later, is surprisingly interesting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My biggest protip for Obsidian would be to never look at the connections graph. If you&#39;ve got any kind of &#34;completionist&#34; mindset, it&#39;s easy to waste a bunch of time trying to perfectly format your notes so every node has a bunch of connections to other nodes. Once I got out of the habit trying to maximize the amount of backlinks in each note, it became a useful tool instead of a chore."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"IPFS needs to decide what it wants to be. Is it about being a decentralized caching layer? Is it about permanently storing content? Is it about replacing my web server? Is it about replacing DNS? Is it about censorship resistance?Right now it does none of those things well. The client chews through CPU and memory when seemingly doing nothing. If I try to download content, it is far slower than BitTorrent unless I go through a centralized gateway. If I add content it takes ages to propagate, making it utterly unsuitable as a replacement for a web server. There is no system to keep content alive so links will still die. The name system is byzantine and I don&#39;t think anyone uses it.Unfortunately, they are now unable to pivot because they did that asinine ICO. The right thing to do is to give up on the FileCoin nonsense and build a system that solves a problem better than anything else, but that is no longer allowed because they already sold something else to their &#34;investors&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like IPFS, I really do, but whenever I try to use it, it&#39;s either too slow to become usable or sometimes it plain doesn&#39;t work. I pinned a whole bunch of files on IPFS a while back to experiment with it and the system seems to work, but every time I try to fetch those resources from a location that hasn&#39;t cached the content yet, it takes several seconds to show me the HTML/JSON/PNG files.HTTP may be inefficient for document storage, but IPFS is inefficient for almost everything else.I like the concepts behind IPFS but it&#39;s simply not practical to use the system in its current form. I hope my issues will get resolved at some point but I can&#39;t shake the thought that it&#39;ll die a silent death like so many attempts to replace the internet before it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pretty interesting. A lot of people here are focusing on permanence, but for me the main difference on addressing by content vs by host name is the loss of authorship it opens up for the web. Since a research paper of essay is referred to by its hash, the owner effectively gives away all control of the work when it&#39;s first published. There will be no editing, no taking down unwanted work, and no real way to build an interactive website that allows dynamic linking to other materials by the author.It&#39;s interesting how the same people promoting the &#34;creator economy&#34; also tend to promote the cryptocurrency space and IPFS without an ounce of self-awareness. IPFS sounds awful for creators of all kinds in the same way as BitTorrent was awful for artists. I can definitely see a use case for IPFS as a file storage for trustless systems such as smart contracts, which are designed as immutable, trustless systems."</p>

The scenes at the end of the book with the Golfrinchans is a masterclass in humourous writing with a truly nasty vein of bleakness.It also features the ultimate question, of course."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Schopenhauer used an equation with the answer of 42 to make a metaphysical point in “The World as Will and Idea.” I suspect this is the meaning Adams had in mind:As time has only one dimension, counting is the only arithmetical operation, to which all others may be reduced; and yet counting is just intuition or perception a priori, to which there is no hesitation in appealing here, and through which alone everything else, every sum and every equation, is ultimately proved. We prove, for example, not that (7 + 9 × 8 - 2)/3 = 42; but we refer to the pure perception in time, counting thus makes each individual problem an axiom. Instead of the demonstrations that fill geometry, the whole content of arithmetic and algebra is thus simply a method of abbreviating counting. We mentioned above that our immediate perception of numbers in time extends only to about ten. Beyond this an abstract concept of the numbers, fixed by a word, must take the place of the perception; which does not therefore actually occur any longer, but is only indicated in a thoroughly definite manner. Yet even so, by the important assistance of the system of figures which enables us to represent all larger numbers by the same small ones, intuitive or perceptive evidence of every sum is made possible, even where we make such use of abstraction that not only the numbers, but indefinite quantities and whole operations are thought only in the abstract and indicated as so thought, as [sqrt](r^b) so that we do not perform them, but merely symbolise them.I tried to add this on Wikipedia a while ago, but was overruled by an editor.Source: https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/38427/pg38427-images.htmlMore on Schopenhauer: https://www.locserendipity.com/TitleSearch.html?q=Schopen"</p>

And it left me feeling as ambivalent as I felt before reading it.As the comments here evidence, people read much into it, and the number 42. This is great. I felt books like The Ugly American [0], Honey Badger (Robert Ruark) and King Rat [1] had more to offer. My opinion hasn&#39;t much changed - but I feel the problem lies with me, in that depth and meaning are what I value.Is humour the entirety of the draw for Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide, or  (probably more likely) have I missed something?[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ugly_American[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Rat_(Clavell_novel)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of his memorable blog posts was on generating permutations in array languages[1]. In his spoiler explanation he comments about generating permutations of 0..4 starting from permutations of 0..3 and a &#34;magical matrix&#34; to do that, and then discusses:&#34;What is the “best” perm function I can write in APL? This “best” is a benchmark not only on my own understanding but also on advancements in APL over the years.&#34; and then shows one he wrote in 1981, one from 1987, then &#34;I worked on perm from time to time in this period [1990-2007] but in J rather than in APL&#34;, then one from 2008, and one from 2015, and where future improvements might be found. In a video talk on it he says &#34;some of these sub-expressions can be improved, but the APL language cannot yet express the thought that I have&#34;[2].

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I suspect the dissenters and Dan are not as far apart as one would expect. What I see in the dissent is a rejection of the specific brand of Silicon Valley rah rah productivity cult. There&#39;s a lot of mysticism in SV style productivity, whether it&#39;s the new hottest app or the latest lifestyle craze. It&#39;s also almost always directed at squeezing more work out of someone who&#39;s already working far too much. What Dan&#39;s proposing is a much more concrete, much more grounded sense of productivity. It&#39;s the difference between trying to get an overworked line cook to fulfill the job of 3 regular workers and watching a master chef work with no extra movements, no wasted energy.I&#39;m sympathetic to the analogy of practice. Too many people are extremely static in their assessment of their skills. They make overarching claims like &#34;oh I&#39;m just not good at cooking&#34; or &#34;I just can&#39;t type very fast&#34;, when they can remedy these issues with practice. Of course they aren&#39;t obligated to do so, but it&#39;s a useful mindset to see weaknesses as potential places of improvement instead of permanent failings. It&#39;s also true that if you&#39;re racing against someone who doesn&#39;t see it as a race, you&#39;ll win. Granted they probably won&#39;t care, but sometimes people get to the end, realize they did care about the race, and were just never clued into the fact that it was a race."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem I have with discussions about “productivity” (including 10x engineer chest-beating) is that no one ever defines what they mean by the word. Is it lots of lines of code? Is it clean design and architecture that’s easy to maintain and extend? Responding quickly to business needs? Making a lot of money in a short time?Too often, people arbitrarily choose what they’re good at, or what someone else they admire is good at, call that “productivity,” and then come up with a post-hoc rationalization of why that’s good.Note: I only skimmed the article, so consider this a comment on productivity discussions in general rather than the specific article.(Oh, and a pet peeve: the agile concept of “velocity” originally introduced by Extreme Programming is absolutely not a measure of productivity. It’s a way of predicting your capacity for the next iteration. I’ve taken to calling it “capacity” instead of velocity for that reason.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who also tracks time in some amount of detail (to bill clients for it), communication, and _written_ communication in particular takes a surprising amount of time. All those Slack threads you might not even think twice of engaging in can easily destroy half your working day, even if you ignore the cost of context switching. Emails take longer than you think. Design docs take _much_ longer than you think. Code reviews take longer than you think also.For me at least coding seems to take less time objectively than subjectively, but it&#39;s also quite obvious that most of my time is not spent on coding, sadly. A good chunk of it is completely unproductive bullshit that simply has to happen because that&#39;s how the company chooses to operate. I tell them it&#39;s not the only way to do things, but they insist on wasting ~1.5 person days a week on &#34;standups&#34; and &#34;scrum&#34; (the team is 12 people, excluding me). They could _easily_ move 50% faster if they shed that bullshit and just gave people sizable tasks and some degree of autonomy and personal responsibility. Instead it&#39;s down to who can _appear_ the busiest during standup."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Going to give a guess as to more pragmatic reason this came about: they don&#39;t have a requirement or test for it.Some engineer was asked to make a feature. That feature happened to break 3rd party seeking. It probably wasn&#39;t intentional, just incidental.Because they have no internal requirement to support this, nor anyone/anything testing for it, it silently broke.It was probably not malicious, even if it feels like a step backwards to this extension developer.Whether it _should_ be fixed of course, is a different matter, but when I see statements like &#34;DRM vendors REALLY want you to buy a smart TV&#34;[1] I frown, as it is contains an assumption of intent that I suspect isn&#39;t there.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28896614Edit: The title of the article (and original title here) is &#34;Netflix&#39;s new player is an open web nightmare&#34;. My response is written in response to this sort of inflammatory language."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sorry, a little off topic gripe about the article itself. I have gigabit internet and still noticed the two images for this article loading line by line, top to bottom. Upon inspection I see they are using massive (5.67mb &amp; 3.6mb) .png images with a resolution of 2832x1838. However, the maximum size they are ever displayed is 836x546.It took me less than 1 minute to do a quick and dirty optimization bringing them down to less than 100kb each. Here you go author:https://i.imgur.com/WGk8dBS.jpg

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The boolean tracking appears to be something like an asset state machine / tracking running in the virtual player. Manually seeking the video tag is likely an unexpected change triggering an exceptional transition in the logic.The thing to keep in mind here is that the seeking timeline of a video tag element does not need to represent the actual media timeline when you are using MSE. It can represent any time the virtual player running in JavaScript wants to maintain and is usually more related to the buffer timeline and ensuring pts continuity across segment appends. Netflix has historically had relatively simple streams which may have allowed this to be the actual seek time, but looks like some deeper streaming changes are landing. For a more complicated example take a look at how multi-asset vod and live streams in a single video tag surface times.I don&#39;t work for Netflix, but do work in the field and since it&#39;s relatively small know some of the folks over at Netflix. They definitely aren&#39;t out to break things purposely, it&#39;s more likely not a case they exercise and broken by a change like someone else has said. If you want to patch the functionality it may be worth exploring the dispatch of mouse clicks on the seek bar. That probably does a translate to time and then calls the virtual player seek API which would be the new hook point you want."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can&#39;t help but be heavily skeptical of approaches to a (traditional) roguelike that use ECS. The idea is very entrenched in the rust gamedev community, but for a turn based tile based game there&#39;s extremely little benefit and a lot of added complexity. Bob Nystrom has an excellent talk on roguelike architecture [0] and rust as a language itself doesn&#39;t prevent any of these approaches. If anything, the existence of sum types as enums make many of them all the more powerful.[0]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxI3Eu5DPwE"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I started reading this book a few months ago. It is pretty good, I really like learning while working on a &#34;sort of real world&#34; project.However, being completely new to Rust I find that the author doesn&#39;t spend enough time discussing the language, it&#39;s syntax and nuances. It is hard to talk both about rust alongside video game design techniques.I put it down after reading 1/4th of it. I&#39;m planning to spend some time on a book that focuses on the language first and then get back to it ;)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"1. S3 Standby/suspend support.If your laptop supports that, you can close the lid and it will power ~everything except the RAM down (sometimes a USB port still charges). In &#39;new&#39; laptops, including almost everything Tiger lake and Intel, S3 is being phased out for Microsoft&#39;s &#34;Modern Standby&#34;, known as S0ix (or sometimes InstantGo). This is much more like a mobile phone, where it stays on but attempts to use as little battery as possible.So, peripherals might shut down, but you might still be able to get critical Windows Updates or receive an important notification -- all while your laptop is unplugged, lid closed, in your bag overnight. This is pretty bad for heat, battery, and often not what you might expect. My new laptop uses about 15% battery overnight, just doing nothing.In the future, perhaps this mode will work as well as S3 used to for battery life, but finding your laptop fans on while it&#39;s closed inside your bag and getting really hot is not fun. This applies to lots of laptops currently.2. A good screen. Brightness that goes high enough to be seen outside (400, or more) - and it&#39;ll usually auto turn down the rest of the time to save battery. Hard to go wrong on a Mac, but really variable screen quality across other brands and models. You&#39;ll spend a lot of time looking at the screen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; if I&#39;m missing on any new developments since 2015Yes, you missed something huge.Apple Silicon M1 or nothing.  It&#39;s just too good.  Low power consumption allows the laptop to actually be used as a laptop.  The power use-to-performance ratio is unmatched by anything on the market. Apple is breaking us free from decades of stagnation on the hardware front.Nothing else on the market comes close. I expect this to change in the future. Will happily switch to a linux laptop once an energy efficient alternative to x86 becomes mainstream for linux.  There&#39;s just no way I can go back to x86 after tasting the sweet nectar of M1."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"0. Linux compatibility, I am not super picky about getting everything to work perfectly but I should be able to trust that the software I prefer to use will run and my laptop will connect to wifi and play audio properly and so on.1. IPS screen (mostly a given nowadays, but this wasn&#39;t always so)2. Trackpoint, I hate trackpads. Pretty rare option so I could possibly be convinced otherwise if the trackpad is particularly good.3. Decent keyboard, any laptop will always be primarily a text processing machine for me.
 (tablet version)
4. User serviceability, with battery and RAM being highest priority but expandable storage is nice too, and all other replaceable parts are a nice bonus.5. General ruggedness, the whole point of a laptop is being able to travel with it and it&#39;s the kind of tech I expect to last me for years.6. Battery life, though I am not super picky about this.7. Everything else including performance, higher resolutions than 768p, thinness, appearance, touchscreen (roughly listed in order of preference).Posted from my trusty Thinkpad X230t which is the only laptop I&#39;m aware of that ticks nearly all my boxes. It&#39;s bulky and makes a vacuum cleaner noise when compiling and the battery only lasts 4-5 hours of normal use, though. Still, good enough for web browsing, various forms of text processing, watching videos, listening to music and the vast majority of what you might use a computer for.I did look into the Framework laptop recently but while it&#39;s probably the closet things in a long time the keyboard doesn&#39;t look good and there&#39;s no trackpoint (nor even physical mouse buttons)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked in Python for years and while I suppose I&#39;m glad for any improvement, I have never understood the obsession with true multi-threading. Languages are about trade-offs and Python, again and again, chooses flexibility over performance. It&#39;s a good choice! You can see it in how widely Python is used and the diversity of its applications.Performance doesn&#39;t come from any one quality, but from the holistic goals at each level of the language. I think some of the most frustrating aspects from the history of Python have been when the team lost focus on why and how people used the language (i.e. the 2 -&gt; 3 transition, though I have always loved 3). I hope that this is a sensible optimization and not an over-extension."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder how many folks think they&#39;re writing thread safe software with ease, and are unaware that they are leaning on the GIL?Could be that the impact of this change is far broader than just a few key libraries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; These changes are major enough that a fair number of existing Python libraries that work directly with Python’s internals (e.g., Cython) would need to be rewritten. But the cadence of Python’s release schedule just means such breaking changes would need to be made in a major point release instead of a minor one.Maybe time to rethink? https://www.techrepublic.com/article/programming-languages-w...If this is as promising as it sounds, it seems Python 4 now has its &#34;thing&#34; and is on the horizon. Or at least may become a serious thing to talk about"</p>
