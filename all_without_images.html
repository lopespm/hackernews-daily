								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"*Technically*, this is very cool, impressive, and generally an elegant work of art.*Pragmatically*, I see 2 flaws in their thesis (as explained on the about page):&gt;&gt; &#34;The entire network already consumes 10% of global electricity production with traffic doubling roughly every 2 years&#34;I think the implication is electricity consumption will also double roughly every 2 years, but Moore&#39;s law actually operates on approx. same timeline, so traffic can continue doubling at this rate without an increase in energy consumption. *This is why technology is brilliant.* It allows us to do much much more with the same resources. We should want more technological innovation.&gt;&gt; &#34; These black-and-white images are then coloured according to the pertaining content category via the browser’s native image manipulation capacities&#34;This essentially shifts some of the burden of computation from the server (PNG compression) to the browser (dithering interpretation). This may save some energy, or it may increase energy as most personal computer processors are much less efficient than server processors, and don&#39;t benefit from energy savings from caching. I&#39;m not sure where it nets out, but just solely focusing on reducing server compute time isn&#39;t necessarily a path toward sustainability if it shifts more computation to the client.Very happy to hear if I&#39;ve misinterpreted the thesis. Again, I commend the technical work itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Small technical nit: I love the dithered images and the retro feel, but their CSS should specify `image-rendering: pixelated` to make sure browsers don&#39;t interpolate the pixels."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this also shows how inefficient modern website hosting is. The fact that this person was able to get a raspberry pi to host the #1 website on HN powered by a small 50 watt solar panel is very cool (meaning maybe 10w average power budget), but also shouldn&#39;t be as uncommon as it is today. To put this in perspective, a modern server uses 50-100 watts idle doing nothing, and many more under load. To handle the top of HN, the developer probably would use load balancing and other tech, multiplying the power usage accordingly.
Edit: fixing typos."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I once used PuTTY as the base for an internal SSH tool. We needed to provide data entry teams with access to a green screen but didn’t want to expose any more servers than what they were authorised to use and a simple interface because a lot of the data entry guys were technologically illiterate.After spending hours looking for solutions that were purpose built for this kind of thing I gave up took PuTTYs source and made some tweaks to the UI.The source was so easy to work with and I was so grateful that the license allowed me to do this.The custom client only ran for a couple of years because the web replaced green screens. And being a *nix guy I don’t get much need for PuTTY in my day to day. But I’ll always be grateful for PuTTY for making that particular job possible (and secure)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Someone I know met Simon one day and thought I’d like his autograph, since I was working in security at the time. I had in fact introduced that team to PuTTY, though this friend didn’t know that.So I own a postcard that says words to the effect, “nobody has ever asked me for an autograph before”. It is framed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I thought this was such a fantastic response, particularly the sections where he talks about how he responds to companies demanding he reply as if he has a contract with them.The main point being that, with the log4j issue (and others before that), the thing that&#39;s struck me when maintainers complain about not being appreciated or that they are working as hard as they can, unpaid, is that maintainers are under no obligation to respond at all, and that you can&#39;t control how other people will react.As someone who&#39;s dealt with anxiety for a long time (and as a former opensource primary maintainer), I can most definitely commiserate with feeling burdened by the expectations of others, but one of the best things I learned from therapy is that you can&#39;t control others emotions, you can only attempt to understand why you react as you do in certain situations."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"1. Removing senescent cells extends life by 30-40% with huge quality of life improvements in the last 25% of the life (relative to control), in mice. This isn&#39;t an elimination of all aging, but quite a valuable thing regardless. Eventually, other causes of aging would kick in and still cause death, without a single senescent cell in your body (e.g. DNA methylation).2. I believe all governments should create Warpspeed for this approach. At the depths of covid lockdowns, GDP was down 20%. Imagine the massive GDP creation from making every 65+ year old feel 40 again. They&#39;d work, consume, and generally flourish. Even if it&#39;s only 10 more years of quality life, this is the  greatest good that could be done for humanity. To avoid another 10 years of my parents death is something I&#39;d do a lot for. Economically and ethically, we should prioritize this research above most else.3. This approach is scientifically sound. Certain aspects of aging cures are approaching engineering levels of work rather than pure science. We simply know that many diseases are caused or amplified by senescent cells. And we have ample evidence that elimination of these cells reverses diseases in complex mammals, as long as you don&#39;t remove too many, too quickly. The rest, is the engineering problem of how to remove the right cells at the right cadence.4. This is the kind of thing biohackers should hack on. Find an aging part of your skin, and attempt to convince your body to kill the senescent cells. If you succeed, you will have benefited humanity, become beautiful, become wealthy, and be remembered forever (is there any other fundamental need humans have, not covered)?Let the race begin!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note that these mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD), essentially toxic fat overload to generate disease phenotypes that one can demonstrate an improvement in. Mice normally eat a mainly grain based diet, so getting 45% of calories from fat is as you can imagine pretty bad for them.This is a common theme in anti-ageing research. When you administer some cariacature of poor lifestyle, it is much easier to find ways to improve things. The long running calorie restriction experiements in monkeys illustrate this well [1,2] - in monkeys being fed a bad diet, calorie restriction works great. In monkeys eating a kinda normal monkey diet, calorie restriction doesn&#39;t do much (and the unrestricted healthy eating monkeys live longer than the calorie restricted junky monkeys). Peter Attia had a good podcast with Steve Austad where they discuss this, albeit paywalled.Unfortunately the style of experiment in the OP is good for publishing papers but hardly advances knowledge or helps us to explain anything.It is much more difficult to demonstrate improvements in healthspan in animals that are living well. The ITP experiments have shown a few drugs can do this, with rapamycin being the most broadly effective.[1] Junky monkey: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2812811/

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The team, including Juntendo University professor Toru Minamino, confirmed that mice administered with the vaccine showed decreases in the zombie cells, medically known as senescent cells, and in areas affected by arterial stiffening.By now this has become a trope. &#34;Researchers develop new treatment for {UNTREATED_DISEASE}&#34; ... in mice.Mouse models of human disease are very limited in their predictive ability. There&#39;s a lot of research that needs to follow this before there&#39;s even a hope of a human trial, let alone vaccine. And the failure rate for treatments at the mouse stage is quite high.Some of the comments on this thread treat this research paper as the announcement of an an imminent anti-aging vaccine. It&#39;s not."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well, it&#39;s basically malicious compliance. They&#39;re supposed to be super annoying because the people which need them do things which have been deemed unacceptable from the legislature. Instead of complying, they choose this obnoxious practice so they could continue with what they&#39;ve been doing for years, which is monitoring every action a visitor does.You don&#39;t need a cookie banner to be allowed to create Cookies. You only need them if you&#39;re using them for something like tracking.A session cookie, selected theme etc is all fine without that banner"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There already is a better solution and always has been, it&#39;s called setting cookie preferences at the browser level and then leaving it.Trying to regulate the option for cookie preferences at the individual site level was always a stupid idea. The average person visits thousands of websites every year. Of course nobody is going to take the time to do that.If the lawmakers in the EU were intelligent, they would have created a law that forced all web browsers to provide &#34;X&#34; privacy setting features for EU-domiciled users (where X is what they were aiming to achieve).In addition to not burdening the entire world with time wasting popups all day, this option would have also had the bonus of not burdening millions of small businesses around the globe with complex regulation and legal liability.Not to mention the total lack of enforceability of the current law when it comes to websites operated outside of the EU.If done at the browser-level you really only have to police &lt;10 companies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Laws that require software companies to implement a user choice should really contain some wording against dark patterns. EU lawmakers could have been warned: A similar thing happened back when Microsoft was forced to give users in the EU a choice of browsers, when they created the most confusing dialog possible and hoped that users would just click OK to Internet Explorer out of desperation.For me personally, when those data protection laws where implemented, seeing the extent of the market for user tracking was a shock to me. The respect that I lost for actually quite a lot of companies as a consequence has informed some purchasing decisions. And I don’t think anybody would mind those banners if the opt-out option you want to click is reachable with a single, easily visible button.Edit: Responses suggest that the GDPR already contains something to that effect. Glad to know. If that’s true, then I guess it’s time for court cases to sort this out."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unpopular opinion: native GUI app development on most platforms is a shitshow. Huge toolkits, copious amounts of boilerplate, and a huge amount of dev effort thrown at the platform just to get it working.Meanwhile, say what you will about the web ecosystem, I&#39;ve given interns/jr devs tickets like: see if you can get this webapp running in electron, and maybe figure out how to do push notifications and save data locally. Two days later the project is done. A week later, the app is ready to install.I think the real reason I quit doing meaningful amount of native GUI development a decade ago was velocity. The developer experience with iOS is probably about the best of the major GUI platforms, but even that is rife with tarpits of tribal knowledge and gets really complicated to release an app due to the whole App Store experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a lot to untangle here.Point 1 is largely true, Microsoft builds too many competing UI toolkits.Point 3: You can slim down Visual Studio&#39;s install a lot if you&#39;re more selective during installation. For example if I only wanted to do .Net desktop application development it is closer to 4 GB and under 10 GB on disk.Point 4: Is actually the end of the original synopsis on the topic and after it veers off. You successfully built the application.Now it goes a little off the rails:Point 5: &#34;The app is extremely resource heavy and way too over-featured.&#34; Ok? You didn&#39;t say which toolkit, guide, or similar you used nor what you define as resource heavy or in what way it was &#34;over-featured.&#34; This is too vague to discuss meaningfully (e.g. Win32 applications built in C++ definitely aren&#39;t resource heavy or over-featured for example, and since you didn&#39;t clarify even what tech stack was used let alone guide/template this isn&#39;t constructive at all).Point 6: I&#39;ve read this sentence several times but seemingly you opened an executable in a text editor and that somehow broke your build process? Or something? Was it write-locked by the editor?Point 7-10: You had a working build pipeline, you broke the pipeline, then decided to start again from scratch in an editor that doesn&#39;t have native desktop development support on Windows (because the old editor was &#34;bloated&#34;). You found this process problematic.So in answer to:&gt; Why is building Windows apps so complicatedYou made it complicated by using unsupported workflows and introducing arbitrary limitations on what was a successful outcome. There&#39;s a lot you can legitimately criticize Windows and even its desktop application development workflow for, but this isn&#39;t that."</p>

				</div>
				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29531947">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Readers who are interested in the actionable aspects of this topic should probably read the last instalment in this series: https://commoncog.com/blog/accelerated-expertise/The basic idea is this:1. Deliberate practice only works for skills with a history of good pedagogical development. If no such pedagogical development exists, you can’t do DP. Source: read Peak, or any of Ericsson’s original papers. Don’t read third party or popsci accounts of DP.2. Once you realise this, then the next question you should ask is how can you learn effectively in a skill domain where no good pedagogical development exists? Well, it turns out a) the US military wanted answers to exactly this question, and b) a good subsection of the expertise research community wondered exactly the same thing.3. The trick is this: use cognitive task analysis to extract tacit knowledge from the heads of existing experts. These experts built their expertise through trial and error and luck, not DP. But you can extract their knowledge as a shortcut. After this, you use the extracted tacit knowledge to create a case library of simulations. Sort the simulations according to difficulty to use as training programs. Don’t bother with DP — the pedagogical development necessary for DP to be successful simply takes too long.Broadly speaking, DP and tacit knowledge extraction represent two different takes on expertise acquisition. For an overview of this, read the Oxford Handbook of Expertise and compare against the Cambridge Handbook of Expertise. The former represents the tacit knowledge extraction approach; the latter represents the DP approach. Both are legitimate approaches, but one is more tractable when you find yourself in a domain with underdeveloped training methods (like most of the skill domains necessary for success in one’s career)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO Tacit knowledge is what we used to call judgement.Judgement is basically knowing a bunch of things but having a good idea of which things are more important than others, and especially knowing which things are worth spending time on any which aren&#39;t.It&#39;s like when I see someone talking about financial options and they put everything on the board at once: what are puts and calls, what&#39;s an iron butterfly and other strategies, do they need to know the payoff diagram, what about black scholes, what are the Greeks, when should I exercise, and so on. They are all things that a professional option trader knows, but when you&#39;re a pro you reduce your cognitive load because you know what actually matters and you are not juggling all these concepts at the same time.It&#39;s also the source of frustration when interviewing. Say you&#39;ve written CPP for many years, you&#39;re probably not prepared to answer questions on all corners of the language, even though you&#39;re an expert in some sense. Someone relatively newer might be better at that task, because they&#39;re thinking a lot about everything, including things they haven&#39;t decided are unimportant yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Tacit knowledge cannot be externalized&#34; is a cruel thing for me to hear when it comes to social skills.Ty Tashiro writes about how &#34;awkward&#34; peoplehttps://www.ted.com/talks/ty_tashiro_why_we_re_socially_awkw...need things to be spelled out and made explicit.  With that,  we can function as well as anyone.  Without that we suffer when we get advice like &#34;be yourself&#34;,  &#34;read Dale Carnegie&#34;, etc.Ty was lucky to have parents that understood that he needed this and made sure he got it.  I didn&#39;t.  Often it would take me a while to get what came naturally to the other kids and adults never seemed to recognize that,  which made me feel really lonely."</p>

Individual stills taken from the video are pretty convincing.The motion version definitely still exhibits uncanny valley, though—lights that are too hard on flesh, tightness and sharpness where there should be softness. That I have to resort to hand-wavey descriptors is cool; they’re getting close! But crossing uncanny valley is HARD.What this demo convinces me of is not that we’re there; we are not. Claiming that we are is disingenuous, and makes me distrust the claimant. But it makes apparent that we will get there. And that’s impressive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Meh, these guys are still stuck in the uncanny valley.Objects are often absolutely beautiful and realistic, but interactions between objects are ridiculous. Some of this is probably just &#34;not enough processing power&#34;, but it is also due to where the rendering bumps up against the primitive controls. For example, you have a very realistic human. But then the human walks against an object, and she does this standard video game 0 mph duck-walk. Part of the problem here is that real humans don&#39;t bash into walls. So how do you realistically represent that, when in fact it&#39;s just Johnny pressing forward on his controller?"</p>

I think a sweet spot is 16-bit address and 8-bit data, with register pairs for 16-bit operations, much like the popular Z80 and the 8080/8085 that preceded it.The DEC Alpha is a real architecture that made a similar mistake and later had to be extended to fix it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEC_Alpha#Byte-Word_Extensions..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really cool!I&#39;ve never understood why modern software projects use names like `mw` or `mr`? What&#39;s wrong with `memory_read` / `memory_write`? Or `opcode_execute_fn opcode_executers[NOPS]` is magnitudes clearer than `op_ex_f op_ex[NOPS]`, and the only advantage of the latter is less time to write.You will spend at least twice as much time reading your code as writing it, just take the extra time. Nobody needs another `vsnprintf_s`.ETA: I have to repeat this is an insanely cool project idea, and very good execution"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Granular control over requests is completely lost in Manifest V3.For example, with Manifest V2 we can initiate a request from a content script after we begin listening for it from the background script, pass a single-use token in the Accept header, identify the request from the background script based on the token, remove the token from the Accept header and edit other headers before the request is sent to the server, then manipulate the response for that single request and stop listening from the background script.I use this workflow in Search by Image to grab an image from the page context when no CSP headers are present for the asset, and the image is only served if a certain cookie and referrer is sent. This will no longer be possible to achieve with the current API of Manifest V3. Extensions used for page archival will also be impacted.Manifest V3 removes a robust toolset that content blockers can use the react to all evasion techniques ad companies implement, and the rest of the extension ecosystem will be part of the fallout."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the interesing things about this story is that there appears to be no consideration of not &#34;updating&#34; to a new Chrome version.  The idea of user choice in &#34;updating&#34; is completely absent.  Why cannot a user say, &#34;V3 sounds wonderful but I will stick with V2, thank you.&#34;  A user has a version of a program that works for that user (e.g., with uBlock Origin), and Google can apparently forcibly stop that user from using that working version, through a process of &#34;automatic updates&#34;.  Users must &#34;accept&#34; updates which makes one wonder Google can pull this off.  Does it not rely on user behaviour.  By accepting every &#34;update&#34; without question, the user is effectively consenting to being controlled.Perhaps users will someday &#34;wake up&#34; to realise that so-called updates are not necessarily being remotely installed for their benefit, but for the benefit of someone else.  No doubt Google has some parallel construction type explanation why users need V3, but how many folks cannot see that they are letting the fox guard the henhouse.Perhaps if ads can be blocked, so too can updates.  (IME, it&#39;s possible.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Now is the perfect time for Open Source maintainers to become legible to the big companies that depend on them—and that want to get more out of them—and send them five-to-six figure invoices.Well, this is exactly what I&#39;ve been doing around VideoLAN (VLC, x264) and FFmpeg for the last few years. In order to do that, I&#39;ve created 2 official companies Videolabs and FFlabs (besides the non-profit orgs) and I&#39;ve gone through all the hoops to get paid (PO, billing, invoices, registering to large companies is a lot of paperwork, tbh, but well..) and we try and bill small to large companies that depends on those projects.And FFmpeg and x264 are the core of the online video.So I did exactly what Filippo is saying we should do.But the result is really not impressive. Seriously, asking for money for support from those companies feels like we&#39;re pulling the nails, even if their full business depends on it. Getting 30-50k$ from those companies for support for one year can be very challenging, long or leading to nowhere at all.So, large SV companies and startup should also start agreeing to pay for open source, when it&#39;s the core of the tech."</p>

If organizations who use it got together and chipped in some non-negligible amount, I would be much more serious about keeping up with it, but $0, or $5-20/month, is just not realistic incentive to compete with other priorities in my life.

Junior devs would search (sometimes in vain) for issues where they could contribute a few PRsNow the best way to get a job is leet code, leet code, and more leet code.  Rather than spending  &lt;5 hours a week working with real code and producing real value on open source projects - most career minded engineers will simply focus on leetcode.Not many people patch esoteric software that&#39;s been around for 10+ years because it&#39;s particularly fun or because there is specific business value in it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a project I&#39;ve been working on to create decentralized, peer to peer, &#34;serverless&#34; websites using several technologies including webtorrent, dmt (mutable torrent BEP-46), and handshake decentralized domains.You can create either an immutable (uneditable) torrent site, or you can create a ed25519 keypair and create a mutable (updatable) torrent site.This is great for blogging, whistle blowing, and other things.  It also scales well since torrent technology is great although it had previous been pigeonholed to other use cases.Please give it a try and let me know your thoughts!  I don&#39;t take any credit for this since I just weaved the great technologies others already made together!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a fantastic work!The best part of Federalist is reading and displaying the websites from BitTorrent using BEP-46. The Handshake part is less impressive for me personally, since it basically reads Handshake values from a service (query.hdns.io/dns-query).If Federalist adds a Handshake daemon, it will be much more decentralized, but at the same time much heavier on resources.For historical perspective, decentralized websites (or p2p websites) are here since like 20 years. Here&#39;s a super concise list of what I recall off the top of my head.- Freenet is the first project I&#39;m aware of doing that- ENS+IPFS websites is a strong movement now (see esteroids.eth.limo, I&#39;m a co-creator of this)- ZeroNet was going strong like 5 years ago, and even though it&#39;s less popular now it&#39;s still functional and a nice project.- Agregor browser brings decentralized website the Hypercore (a successor of DAT protocol)- BitTorrent was supposed to have a project especially for decentralized websites (Maelstrom web browser), but it didn&#39;t took off eventually- Magnetico is a search engine built on top of BitTorrent, very similar to Federalists, but without the Handshake part.- Skynet is a project meant almost only for decentralized websites, based on Sia. They have integration with ENS, and afaik, also with Handshake (check it out!)- Swarm, Namecoin etc. could also be used for decentralized websites. I saw some people doing demos with it, but can&#39;t recall any links/names atm."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ironically, on a previous team I had switched our log4j2 log formats over to %m{nolookups} like 8 months ago... I didn&#39;t realize the whole jndi issue, what we ran into was the O(n^2) behavior of its string substitution.While deploying an ancillary change, our jvms started locking up for minutes on end. What was happening was that we were logging customer input, and the change caused it to run certain things in parallel, which ended up logging the data multiple times. Normally the extra logging didn&#39;t matter but one customer had data like &#34;${foo} ${bar} ${baz} ...&#34;. Even when the ${foo} portion is replaced wothout modification, this triggers quadratic behavior. So we were already potentially vulnerable to the DOS but it was rare enough that we never got locked up until logging the string multiple times, which then overflowed log4js internal buffer and blocked worker threads.You can try this yourself by just logging a string like &#34;${}${}${}...&#34; And in fairly short order it starts taking forever. I&#39;m very glad the fix in 2.15 is to disable lookups by default.I hope that in the time after I left, the security org at the big tech company I worked at and reported this to (as I thought it was - a dos vector, not the complete pwnage it actually was) forced teams to switch to nolookups. Otherwise a lot of people had a bad week forcing updates through..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There seems to be a misunderstanding here. We have on the one side a garbage feature that should never have been implemented - but if you want to keep it for backwards compatibility, sure. But then we have log4j scanning all values instead of only format strings - I think it can be argued that this behavior is a critical bug and was never intended to begin with. It seems to have only come about because whoever implemented the JNDI stuff lost their bearing in the absurd class hierarchies and abstractions in log4j.Of course the last part holds the solution for our backwards compatibility issue. Remove the JNDI nonsense from the default package and move it into an extension package. Whoever wants to keep it can just add that to their dependencies and continue to enjoy logging functions that sometimes also make network connections and block your program."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; for a feature we all dislike yet needed to keep due to backward compatibility concerns.It&#39;s logging. While logging is extremely important, I think we could all tolerate removing a vulnerable feature. Or, just move the feature to a separate package.I have made bad decisions, we have all made bad decisions. Own them, improve, and celebrate the opportunity to learn and improve. Keeping this around, as a default, was a bad decision. If your enterprise contracts don&#39;t want to turn a flag on, then they can always skip upgrading (they generally do regardless)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You need to speak with a qualified domain name attorney, not just any attorney or solicitor.As Director of a domain name protection company (and not an attorney) I can offer this:If you registered the domain name before the other party files for a trademark, then there is no way you would have known that they would file for the mark. So, in most cases you probably don’t have to give up the domain name. It comes down to whether or. Or you registered the domain “in bad faith” or not. And again, how would you know they would start their business and get a trademark? You wouldn’t.Are you in the same industry and compete with each other? If so, there might be an issue, but I’d your site offers different products and there would be no confusion between companies or websites, then there may not be an issue.The best way to handle this is to get a domain name attorney to respond to their letter to you, essentially telling them to go away, and that you plan on keeping the domain name.If you cannot afford an attorney, look for a company that offers domain name insurance or a domain name warranty, if you have an issue like this with your domain name, your legal fees to defend the domain are covered.As you have described the situation here, you bought the domain before they filed for their trademark, and you’re not pretending to be them. So you should be able to keep the domain. They are just trying to “ strong arm” the domain away from you with a threatening letter. If they do sue you or file a udrp, defend yourself with the help of a good domain name attorney."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a 4 letter domain name. A stock photo company trademarked the name and then threatened to sue to force transfer. However, I registered the domain before they registered the trademark. I looked up the ICANN rules and saw I had priority. Pointed out the ICANN rule and told to go away. They did.IANAL; this is not legal advice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While this is definitely a bunch a hot air, unfortunately they could frivolous sue you to simply win on financial grounds alone (in particular they could sue you in a location where the cost of travel would be expensive and if you ignored it they get a default judgement, or sue you in both state &amp; federal courts for slightly different things and drown you in legal costs).I&#39;d evaluate what your endgame is. If your endgame is to keep the domain then I&#39;d get a lawyer in order to make it clear that you will respond to legal challenges (and, yes, the bill is going to run up). If you were willing to sell, for a price, then you should try to figure out how much a legal challenge would cost them and set a price a bit higher than that.Is it fair? Absolutely not, but the US legal system is set up so that those with the deepest pockets often win. It isn&#39;t a fair fight for normal citizens, and even having the law on your side is often not enough because it is a financial battle more than a legal one.Either way may be wise to lawyer up today, either for a better selling price, cause them to back off entirely, or move it into the &#34;bury you with costs&#34; phase of bullying."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article&#39;s framing of the problem (increased authoritarianism, decreased tolerance for reporting) leaves a lot to be desired without more evidence. The evidence is:- A small increase in total jailed journalists (roughly matching world population growth, and the delta is a small discrete count which would yield large error bounds)- Specific examples of horrific events (matching atrocities that governments have been more than willing to commit in 2020, 2019, 2018, ...)Without looking at longer time scales (e.g., over the last 10-20 years journalist jailings significantly outpace population growth) or providing some justification for why circumstances have changed and we would expect journalist jailings to not pace population growth (e.g., if there are significantly fewer journalists per capita (not sure if that&#39;s true, just hypothetically)), a story that matches the evidence better is that lots of countries were horrible to journalists in years past and they&#39;re repeating that bad behavior now.To be clear, that&#39;s not saying that the overall problem shouldn&#39;t be fixed or even that their framing isn&#39;t correct, but...it&#39;s not exactly hard to provide evidence that _actually_ backs up their claim; why wouldn&#39;t they?"</p>

The final IRL reconstructed device is very nice. It&#39;s a long serie (10 episodes of 15 minutes each + some additional videos with even more details in other playlist) but it&#39;s worth watching."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think we tend to underestimate what ancient technology could produce because we forget that in ancient times they often operated on longer timescales than we do.With our technology for example we could make all the parts for the Antikythera mechanism in a short time. The ancient Greeks definitely had no technology that would have allowed them to do that, so we see the existence of the Antikythera mechanism as a great mystery.But I don&#39;t see any reason to believe that the Greeks built it in a short time. It could easily be the lifework of the builder, or even the lifework of successive generations of a family of builders.If you need to make a very precise gear in a day you need our technology. If you need to make a very precise gear in 50 years you just need someone with an abrasive that is harder than the material you are making the gear from."</p>

If the seller is not using Amazon for their logistics then they simply can&#39;t guarantee the time window so they don&#39;t add a prime badge?From a customer point of view it would make for a worse shopping experience if Prime items weren&#39;t  fulfilled by Amazon"</p>

I feel like it steals your attention and mindshare day after day. The ads I see on TV now (rarely, as I don&#39;t watch live TV much) are just so horrible. Dripping with emotions and trying to tug on your heartstrings to sell some toilet bowl cleaner or some other garbage.Social media.

I wish more social media could be like HN and allow a diverse set of opinions, but ban the name-calling and such that really take things into a bad place.Most products today are less durable and are generally worse than &#34;yesterday&#34;, in my opinion. Perhaps it&#39;s the old man in me coming out, with a rosy view of yesteryear, but I think that the quality of things are just lower, in general. I do think that things &#34;look nicer&#34; and are more consistent, but at a lower level of quality. 20 years ago, I had only 5 or so choices for any given product, maybe a curtain rod for example (because I just bought some). Today I can go down to several stores and pick from hundreds of curtain rod designs that look really nice, but half of them break after a few years or less. I still have some shitty looking but sturdy curtain rods from 20 years ago, no joke. Electronics are worse in some ways, but faster and more complex, so maybe that complexity is the source of the decrease in perceived quality. I can say that computers are way faster now, and it&#39;s easier to do many things, but I have less freedom than I had with older computers for sure.This is just about the end of my old man rant. Thanks for listening.&#34;The important thing was that I had an onion on my belt...&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think there is an &#39;optimum&#39; level for technology of all kinds, below that you really want more and it is clear that there is room for improvement. But once the optimum has been reached any further additions will degrade the experience.Examples:Car controls:  pre: direct taps and gauges plumbed into engine parts and such, real switches and levers. 
  optimum: does what it should, not more, not less, more reliable than the old stuff, easy to fix and relatively cheap to fabricate
  too much: touchscreens. For everything.

(ICE) Car electronics:  pre: carburettors, bad winter starts, bad fuel consumption, pollution
  optimum: EFI, highly reliable, aftermarket parts interchangeable between brands
  too much: DRM on everything, parts won&#39;t even fit same model a year older, are ridiculously expensive and unreliable to boot

TV:  pre: two channels, black and white, bad image quality, crappy small screens
  optimum: 20 channels or so, in a way already more than you can consume, good quality color image, fairly easy to see screens (say, up to 3&#39; across).
  too much: wall-to-wall screens that intrude on your privacy every chance they can, inability to build up your own collection of content (DRM), pay *for ever* for the same stuff
  way too much: youtube.

CPUs:  pre: 8 bits, too slow for many applications, nice and better than an abacus though
  optimum: 1990s OS, very little eye candy, just enough to take the edge off, fast, and enough horsepower to do meaningful work
  too much: 2020 OS, nothing but eye candy, reduced functionality, telemetry, spyware, forced updates that are just as likely to improve things as they are to leave you stranded

and so on, you get the idea.Technology has and always will have a place in my life. But my car is a 1997 model that doesn&#39;t phone home to the factory, has buttons instead of menus, my phone is a Nokia, and so on. Technology is my slave, not my master."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Algo-paranoia.Every time I interact with a remotely &#34;clever&#34; system, I keep thinking how my input will feed some machine. How fast do I scroll, what is in my viewport. What do I listen to and when. Is this an A/B test? Will something I do on a whim affect that machine to predict something incredibly stupid tomorrow?It only became obvious recently, as I was readying an actual, physical book. The relief to realise that the publisher won&#39;t optimise the font based on how fast I turn the pages. And the disgust at that aspect of tech.And to what end?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This should be a sobering view of how the world really works. Above a certain threshold, every veneer of civilization vanishes no matter what the country (some have a higher threshold than others).At this level, only power matters. And the first rule of power is: Don&#39;t embarrass the powerful unless you can call on a lot of power to defend yourself.Laws can&#39;t protect you; they can be thwarted and bent, and the legal process &#34;guided&#34; to the required outcome.International organizations can&#39;t protect you; they can only register complaints that will be duly ignored by everyone if the champion is important enough.Even countries can&#39;t protect you at this level; they&#39;re beholden to power themselves after a certain point.This is the message to would-be activists anywhere: Stay out of the big boy pool or we&#39;ll make you regret it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Surprisingly few technical people understand the extent to which the CFAA charges he faces are bullshit.It all goes back to a jabber log that they got from Manning. The gist of it is as follows:Manning: &lt;some bytes from a hexdump&gt;Manning: can you guys crack NTLM?Assange: we have rainbow tables. I’ll forward it onto someone on our team.Few days later,Manning: any update on NTLM?Assange: no luck so far.And this is computer conspiracy. No additional access to any machine was had, and there’s no real evidence that any cracking was attempted at all. He merely agreed to take a look and reported no progress on it. It’s been a while since I looked at the details but I seem to recall that the pcap hexdump manning sent wasn’t even the correct bytes to do an attack — it wasn’t even possible.There are so many explanations for why Assange could have said this while plausibly not attempting to crack the hash. Manning put him in a strange position to become complicit and he had to strike a balance between not saying to his source, “lol that’s illegal no way, you’re on your own dude” while simultaneously saying exactly that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Complex systems are really really hard. I&#39;m not a big fan of seeing all these folks bash AWS for this, and not really understanding the complexity or nastiness of situations like this. Running the kind of services they do for the kind of customers, this is a VERY hard problem.We ran into a very similar issue, but at the database layer in our company literally 2 weeks ago, where connections to our MySQL exploded and completely took down our data tier and caused a multi-hour outage, compounded by retries and thundering herds. Understanding this problem under the stressful scenario is extremely difficult and a harrowing experience. Anticipating this kind of issue is very very tricky.Naive responses to this include &#34;better testing&#34;, &#34;we should be able to do this&#34;, &#34;why is there no observability&#34; etc. The problem isn&#39;t testing. Complex systems behave in complex ways, and its difficult to model and predict, especially when the inputs to the system aren&#39;t entirely under your control. Individual components are easy to understand, but when integrating, things get out of whack. I can&#39;t stress how difficult it is to model or even think about these systems, they&#39;re very very hard. Combined with this knowledge being distributed among many people, you&#39;re dealing with not only distributed systems, but also distributed people, which adds more difficulty in wrapping this around your head.Outrage is the easy response. Empathy and learning is the valuable one. Hugs to the AWS team, and good learnings for everyone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This resulted in a large surge of connection activity that overwhelmed the networking devices between the internal network and the main AWS network, resulting in delays for communication between these networks. These delays increased latency and errors for services communicating between these networks, resulting in even more connection attempts and retries. This led to persistent congestion and performance issues on the devices connecting the two networks.I remember my first experience realizing the client retry logic we had implemented was making our lives way worse. Not sure if it&#39;s heartening or disheartening that this was part of the issue here.Our mistake was resetting the exponential backoff delay whenever a client successfully connected and received a response. At the time a percentage but not all responses were degraded and extremely slow, and the request that checked the connection was not. So a client would time out, retry for a while, backing off exponentially, eventually successfully reconnect and then after a subsequent failure start aggressively trying again. System dynamics are hard."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow. I didn’t know this, but I was actually able to observe this state on myself. When going to sleep, my mind is wandering. But at one point it drifts from real world thoughts to completely abstract concepts and wild imagination that sometimes makes no sense. It’s almost like a hallucination. What’s most interesting is that sometimes I am able to notice the transition to this state and consciously observe it. Usually it makes me happy because I know I’m about to fall asleep within the next few seconds (which I often have problem with, writing this comment at 1:26am again..). I am also able to consciously observe the images being generated. It’s very weird, because it feels like one brain looking into someone else’s brain to the extent that is impossible by any technology or in any other way. Sometimes I’m able to consciously wake up from this state, because I have weird “sleep phobias”. Sometimes I am fascinated by the idea generated at that stage. But unless I write them down or really get up, they are typically lost if I fall asleep within next 5 minutes - maybe I’d have a Nobel prize already, if only I kept a pen and paper ready next to my bed. Or apartment full of crappy kitch paintings.."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anecdote: I distinctly remember being on the edge of sleep writing a song one night in 2019. I was about to fall asleep on the floor with a notebook in my hand, and just at that moment, the music came into my mind. For whatever reason, I was able to stay awake and flesh it out as a recording. After reflecting on it the next day I realised I had written an acoustic fingerstyle piece that moved across keys as if there were multiple voicings in the accompaniment all moving independently in polyphony. Far more harmonically complex than anything I had written before, or since.Three weeks later my partner and I played it for the first time in a pub, and the normally cosy and laugh-filled room fell silent. We had the exact same experience in another open mic night a couple of weeks afterwards, where we took the first-place prize before the competition even finished. It was as if people were moved by it without any effort or coercion, like we cast a spell over people.Now it makes sense! I’ve heard music play in my mind as I’ve fallen asleep before; this news explains this story almost perfectly. Unreal. Live on the edge of sleep and magic can happen. I wonder what health risks there are with prolonged use?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think I once got into this hypnagogic state by accident. I was having a nap and my dogs woke me up because it was time for their walk.I felt sleepy while walking the dogs but also had a clarity regarding anything I examined in my mind. It&#39;s as if my regular state of mind was like walking in a forest with limited visibility, and now I could see the territory from a bird&#39;s perspective.This lasted for about 15 mins maybe. I&#39;ve never been able to experience this again. Maybe I should try this technique :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I suspect this is to foreclose against a future option for Google to monetize ‘free’ content in the play store without compensating the developers much as they do people’s videos on Youtube.For those who aren’t aware, in the games industry the distributor has been in the role of adding DRM to games on the pretense that they are “protecting their interests and channels”. As the distributor, Google may feel empowered to make these sort of “protective” changes, and the one that would be most likely (in my estimation) would be wrapping the APK such that it played a pre-roll ad before your free game started.I could be completely off base here but to my way of thinking it would be consistent with Google’s moves in the past."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, let&#39;s be clear here.  The problem is not that they&#39;ve prohibited people from putting this information in the app title.  The problem comes if they&#39;ve done so without introducing another way for the user to express their preference for ad-free apps.  E.g. it should even work better if, hypothetically, the search function prioritized ad-free apps anyway when the user puts &#34;no ads&#34; in the search box.I can&#39;t tell if this is the case right now because, well, the store is still full of apps with &#34;no ads&#34; in the title.

Each serum was tested simultaneously for its neutralizing antibody titer against the wild-type SARS-Cov-2 spike protein, and the Omicron spike variant. The third dose significantly increased the neutralizing antibody titers against the Omicron strain spike by 25-fold. Neutralization against the Omicron variant after three doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was comparable to the neutralization against the wild-type strain observed in sera from individuals who received two doses of the companies’ COVID-19 vaccine: The geometric mean titer (GMT) of neutralizing antibody against the Omicron variant measured in the samples was 154 (after three doses), compared to 398 against the Delta variant (after three doses) and 155 against the ancestral strain (after two doses).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Based on my anecdotal experience this seems to very much understate inflation. 
How is housing up only 3.8%? This site says over 17% rent increase nationally over the last year: https://www.apartmentlist.com/research/national-rent-data which seems to be more accurate.  Anyone with a web browser knows that home prices have experienced a monumental increase.Also a trip to the grocery store appears to cost me 50% more now for essentially the same goods. Every trip to the store pre-covid cost me around $100, now its $150. I do buy primarily proteins so that is the source of the increase but to ignore that seems ill advised.Not generally a conspiracy theorist but unless the people that built this report are using some accepted formula that is very different than the real world this report seems to be intentionally underselling inflation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Fed was initially saying the inflation was transitory, but have recently dropped the &#34;transitory&#34; label.Back in July, Siegel pointed out that the M2 money supply is 30% over pre-pandemic levels and predicted that would translate into 20% cumulative inflation over the next 3 years.  Here are my talk notes / video links if you&#39;re interested: https://neapowers.com/investing/jeremy-siegel/In July Siegel said &#34;There is zero need for the Fed to be buying $120 billion in bonds every month given market conditions.&#34;  I don&#39;t know why the Fed is buying mortgage backed securities in the midst of an apparent housing bubble.Larry Summers was voicing inflation concerns back in March: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBnaahSe7JU&amp;ab_channel=Bloom...The main macroeconomists I follow (Siegel, Gundlach, Summers) are all puzzled by the Feds actions recently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of this is due to fuel prices. The price of fuel affects the price of everything else. It&#39;s a benchmark since everything requires fuel. Manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, etc. It all requires fuel. It doesn&#39;t help that OPEC refuses to increase production in order to make up for their budget shortfalls last year. Also doesn&#39;t help that the US government is sending signals that it is no longer on board with fossil fuels. The shutting down of pipelines, ending of fossil fuel leasing, etc. sends a market signal to producers and traders that the US is hostile towards the industry, leading the producers to cut production and maintain their profits.Best option would be to have a diverse portfolio of energy production: oil, natural gas, solar, wind, hydroelectric, and nuclear. Don&#39;t go all in on one, that&#39;s how you arrive at the situation we are currently in."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I first encountered quaternions in the concept of abstract algebra. It&#39;s interesting to think of it as part of a spectrum starting with reals and continuing to octonions (and beyond). Interestingly with each extension we lose something:Complex numbers (2-dimensional): No more orderingQuaternions (4-dimensional): No more commutative multiplicationOctonions (8-dimensional): No more associative multiplicationSedenions (16-dimensional): We lose the alternative property, i.e., with octonions its still true that x(xy) = (xx)y but with sedenions it is not.We can continue this process indefinitely, although I know nothing of the characteristics of trigintaduonions or what comes later. I suspect that it might be the loss of the flexible identity next, a(ba) = (ab)a but I don&#39;t know for sure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"W.R Hamilton&#39;s discovery of the Quaternions is semi-famous itself, with the story being that after the critical flash of insight he carved the equation describing quaternion multiplication into a bridge in Ireland with a penknife.A interesting read is this letter [0] written the following day, where he explains his ideas in his own words. It&#39;s a great (and accessible!) look into his thought process.[0] https://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Hamilton/QLette..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One interesting thing about quaternions that’s almost never mentioned anywhere on the internets, there’re two conventions for them.The convention in that article is known as “Hamilton&#39;s quaternions”. There’s another incompatible one usually called “JPL quaternions”, for some American Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Authors of 99% articles about the quaternions, and software libraries implementing quaternions, are assuming exactly one of these conventions, and almost never mention which one that is.More info there: https://fzheng.me/2017/11/12/quaternion_conventions_en/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used the JIT version recently on a new landing page with code completion for class names in my IDE and found it great. The distance between what I&#39;m picturing in my head and what I have to type to see that on the screen felt so much shorter and less fatiguing than the standard CSS approach.With the regular way, to style something that&#39;s probably not going to appear elsewhere, I&#39;m having to: come up with class names, annotate the HTML with them, repeat some of this annotating in a CSS file, jump back and forth between files to tweak the styles, use the web inspector to figure out which CSS class is overriding another then jump to the right CSS file to fix it etc.Tailwind classes are also faster to type and flip between when you&#39;re experimenting (e.g. editing &#34;mt-5&#34; to &#34;pb-3&#34; vs &#34;margin-top: 4.25em&#34; to &#34;padding-bottom: 2.75em&#34;) and you get less distracted because it has sensible defaults and helpful guardrails (you rarely need all the possible attributes and range of parameter values CSS has available).I also rarely had the super irritating and common CSS scenario where you edit a style and it doesn&#39;t change and you have to go investigate to find out why e.g. something is overriding something, your selector is wrong, and even after all that maybe you undo the edit because it doesn&#39;t look good. Plus you no longer have the fear that tweaking a shared class to going to break some completely different page.I feel that beyond some building blocks, trying to create reusable CSS classes with cascading styles has similarities to using excessive abstraction and deep OOP class hierarchies in regular programming languages to avoid a little duplication.I also don&#39;t have a problem with styling stuff appearing in my HTML files either as long as the right HTML tags are used around the data. HTML files are already full of class annotations and divs that are only there for styling yet this doesn&#39;t cause a problem to e.g. browsers, screen readers or crawlers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried Tailwind (and a similar project Windi) on a few projects now and have some findings.Tailwind aggressively speeds up development time of components by allowing me to stay in the same cobtext when styling things. The brevity of class names also dramatically shortens the time spent writing styles. While working on the projects I&#39;d setup with Tailwind, I felt far more productive.However, those were new projects. After completing them and needing to go back and modify or maintain them, the experience has been horrible. The resulting style declarations (as class names) are completely unreadable and unmaintainable. I&#39;ve tried organizing them and splitting class names onto multiple lines, but it has only cluttered things.In my experience, Tailwind (and similar projects) produce styles that are effectively read only. They are superb when writing a new component and styling things from scratch, but maintenance is nonexistent.Because of this, I&#39;ve now switched to using a CSS-in-JS solution to gain the benefits of in-context styling and still have the ability to write CSS declarations in a structured and maintainable way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not sure I get Tailwind still. Doing everything with utility classes and OOCSS / BEM are things we stopped doing literally decades ago. CSS modules still seem to solve every problem Tailwind solves, and better. CSS modules combine the power of global utility classes with locally styled components/locally scoped classes, and compile to static stylesheets, a requirement for performance. I&#39;m not sure how Tailwind works, but any CSS that&#39;s built at runtime and JS and inserted into the DOM dynamically should be avoided, and is an example of favoring developer experience over end user experience. It&#39;s always surprising to me when the build process isn&#39;t front and center of any CSS framework, since that&#39;s the most important performance aspect. I&#39;m not concerned about Tailwinds verbose CSS use since that&#39;s gzipped away, but the static stylesheet compilation aspect worries me if it&#39;s not front and center of the framework.CSS modules let you use the full power and control of vanilla CSS, without having to worry about styles bleeding across components. Sprinkle in your global utility classes for your design system and you&#39;re good to go. Or sometimes even better, abstract design into components like `&lt;grid&gt;` `&lt;column&gt;` etc and not even worry about the classname implementation.I know I&#39;m missing part of the picture, because of the hype and joy that people report from Tailwind. What part(s) am I missing that move folks from the power, beauty, and simplicity of CSS modules, to all-utility-classes-all-the-time Tailwind?"</p>

Companies can sometimes change their culture, but it usually requires replacing the CEO.This has come up a few times in military history. &#34;L&#39;audace, toujours l&#39;audace&#34; was a WWI French slogan. It took a huge number of casualties before high command got it that charging into machine guns does not work. Courage does not help.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From Bloomberg:&gt; Bondholders of $19.2 billion in Evergrande dollar notes face deep haircuts as the company overhauls its mammoth balance sheet without a government bailout -- a process that promises to be long, contentious and potentially risky for Asia’s largest economy.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-09/evergrand...It might seem odd that a Chinese company would have taken out dollar loans, but the practice is common around the world. One reason is that the borrower can get lower interest rates because they assume the exchange rate risk themselves. If that bet goes sour, though, the borrower faces higher costs to service the debt.Of course the thing about dollar bonds is that even if the national government were to intervene, those dollars can&#39;t be printed by Beijing.The only way to service a dollar debt is to raise dollars. One path to doing that is to sell dollar-denominated assets. US Stocks and bonds in other words. So the pressures in China can spill over into the US economy through forced asset sales of dollar-denominated assets.This is another angle to the contagion idea. Organizations around the world have taken big short position on the US dollar. As those loans come due, dollar assets are sold. Which drives the dollar higher. Which makes the dollar loans even more unsustainable. And so on.It has been called the global dollar short squeeze:https://www.lynalden.com/global-dollar-short-squeeze/And if you&#39;re really adventurous, there&#39;s something called the &#34;dollar milkshake theory&#34; which predicts the uncontrollable rise of the dollar as (maybe counterintuitively) a wrecking ball for the world economy:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qTOWuL7Zco"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I use Dracula for pretty much everything. Code editors, terminals, browsers, Slack, and even CSS skins for Tailwind, Wordpress, and more, if I&#39;m installing an application, there&#39;s a pretty good chance there&#39;s already a theme for it.But there&#39;s an interesting side effect of having a theme repository with over 200 applications: app discovery! Whether it&#39;s learning about interesting projects (BetterDiscord, MatterMost, Obsidian) or blasts from the past (I hadn&#39;t thought about BBEdit in a long time! And does anyone remember Brackets?), it&#39;s kind of a cool spot to find and remember things.Good work and thank you to everyone who has worked on these themes, I use them every day for a lot of apps :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a hard time seeing why this is such a popular theme.. maybe it&#39;s just because it is available for so many different editors. On the other hand, would be cool to have an application / database that could convert any theme to another editor.Although that would take a lot of work to figure out the compatibilities, if somebody would do that well enough so that other people can configure input output configs for that, I bet that program could become very popular among developers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dracula is a fine theme, however, I feel like it&#39;s more convenient than it is pretty. I admire Dracula, Nord, and Gruvbox and how committed they are to their own aesthetics - my personal favorite, similar to Gruvbox, is Alduin[0] but sadly it&#39;s for Vim only.I only wish popular themes didn&#39;t feel like they had to use every primary color for the text. I wish we took the popular themes and made them even more opinionated, fewer colors with greater emphasis. At the end of the day most themes nowadays are just different shades of all rainbow text over your choice of a light or dark background. Dark or light... It reminds me of that theory about how early humans, before having words for different colors, only had light and dark to describe things.Does anyone have any recommendations for opinionated color schemes with limited palettes with emphasis on particular colors instead of just dark/light?0. https://github.com/AlessandroYorba/Alduin"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To folks wondering what the issue is about, I&#39;ll give a short summary that I myself needed.Typically a logging library has one job to do: swallow the string as if it&#39;s some black box and spit it elsewhere as per provided configurations. Log4j though, doesn&#39;t treat strings as black boxes. It inspects its contents and checks if it contains any &#34;variables&#34; that need to be resolved before spitting out.Now there&#39;s a bunch of ways to interpolate &#34;variables&#34; into log content. For example something like &#34;Logging from ${java:vm}&#34; will print &#34;Logging from Oracle JVM&#34;. I&#39;m not sure but you get the idea.One way to resolve a variable using a custom Java resolver is by looking it up through a remote class hosted in some LDAP server, say &#34;${jndi:ldap://someremoteclass}&#34; (I&#39;m still not quite sure why LDAP comes into the picture). Turns out, by including &#34;.&#34; in some part of the URL to this remote class, Log4j lets off its guard &amp; simply looks up to that server and dynamically loads the class file.The fix has introduced ways to configure an allowed set of hosts/protocols/etc and forces Log4j to go through this configuration such that these dynamic resolutions don&#39;t land on an random/evil server."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This exploit is quite severe on Minecraft Java Edition. Anyone can send a chat message which exploits everyone on the server and the server itself, because every chat message is logged. It&#39;s been quite a rollercoaster over the past few hours, working out the details of how to protect members of servers, and informing players (many of whom uses modded clients that don&#39;t receive the automatic Mojang patches) of how to protect themselves. Some of the major servers like 2b2t and Mineplex have shut down, and larger servers that haven&#39;t shut down yet are pure chaos right now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On one hand I want to be more forgiving of this, because log4j is very old, and likely this feature was introduced well before we all had a collective understanding of how fiddly and difficult security can be, and how attackers will go to extreme effort to compromise our services.But at the same time... c&#39;mon.  A logging framework&#39;s job is to ship strings to stdout or files or something.  String interpolation should not be this complicated, flexible, whatever you want to call it.  The idea that a logging framework (!) could even have an RCE makes me want to scream... the feature set that leads us to that even being possible just weeps &#34;overengineered&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, that is a bummer!Alexa is my go-to place to get a first impression on how much traffic a website gets.I have never looked into how they get their data, I always assumed they get it from internet providers?Is there an alternative? SimilarWeb publishes their data with a huge delay, so it is not of much use for me. From my experience, it is also less reliable.It is crazy how valuable internet properties get closed down when they are owned by giant companies. According to Alexa, Alexa is still a top-5000 site:https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/alexa.comIt seems insane to just close it down."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s sort of wild to think that Amazon purchased Alexa.com in 1999 for ~$250M in stock, and that stock would be worth more than $7B today, if my math is correct.Bought a website ranking company, used the company&#39;s name as the name of a consumer electronics assistant, and then shuttered the company 22 years later to (presumably) be able to use the domain name for more consumer electronics."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A very helpful summary from r/rust on the same topic [1]&gt;A few notes for people who haven&#39;t been tracking the Rust-in-kernel situation. Drivers especially have been targeted for a few reasons. First, drivers are isolated, with abstractions that don&#39;t require interaction with the rest of the system. Second, Linux is available on more systems than the Rust compiler has been ported to. Because drivers are inherently system-dependent, it is not an issue to introduce a dependency on rustc on compatible systems. Third, bugs tend to arise more in drivers than other parts of the codebase, so Rust can do the most good starting there.[1] https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/rb50yn/comment/hnmshs..."</p>

Try your state&#39;s office of emergency services.There&#39;s something called &#34;Kari&#39;s Law&#34; that may apply here. This was passed in 2018 after someone was being attacked in a hotel room and their 9 year old daughter tried to call 911. She couldn&#39;t get through because the phone system required dialing 9 for an outside line. So, now, all business phone systems are required to recognize and pass through 911 to the main phone network. There are criminal penalties. (Microsoft might argue that &#34;Teams&#34; is not a &#34;multi-line telephone system&#34;. That probably wouldn&#39;t go far with a jury. The clear intent of the law is that if you interpose something between a phone handset and the 911 network, it has to pass through 911 calls.)The whole 911 area is heavily regulated, since it requires that so many things interoperate reliably."</p>

Every year they change some colors and rounded edges (it&#39;s starting to get hilarious seeing the design of their apps being revamped over and over again), and add features invented by their designers nobody asked for. But the keyboard lag, the storage footprint (why must an ever so slightly older phone with 16GiB internal memory be discarded because His Majesty Android demands almost all of its space for itself?), those will only get worse every release. I think they simply don&#39;t care. It&#39;s all about futuristic colorful stuff that sells. Android will never be a humble, efficient, reliable platform.As for this issue. All I can think of is the tragedies it may cause. It&#39;s a cliché: software developers are not responsible, except when their PR forces them to take action."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an excellent article, a good insight into the particularities of the hardware. I particularly admire the explanation of why the polygons snap to the pixel, and why that&#39;s not the fault of floating-point mathematics but rather the rasterizer itself. One thing the article approaches, but doesn&#39;t really quite get to the bottom however, and which is the crux of all the ps1&#39;s &#39;flaws&#39; is that its GPU was 2-dimensional fundamentally. That&#39;s why things snap to pixels, that&#39;s why the textures do not have a depth component and are thus not perspective-correct, that&#39;s why there is no z-buffer, because it had no z-coordinate. Essentially, every single PS1 game &#39;faked&#39; 3D by using the GTE (which was separate from the GPU) to project 3D points and polygons into a 2D rasterizer. And it worked quite well! For the time.Another thought - I also wrote a similar renderer under similar constraints a while back, just for funsies, and I&#39;m wondering what would have came if I thought &#34;I should write an article about this&#34;. I generally don&#39;t think to write articles over every side project I do, what&#39;s the impulse for when someone decides to detail their work to the internet?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Love these &#34;tiny&#34; 128x128 textures when meanwhile, anyone doing development for the contemporaneous Nintendo 64 gets something like 44x44@16bpp color, or 64x64@8bpp grayscale. The maximum texture size is 4 KB with some major caveats (e.g. it drops to 2 KB if you use indexed color).The N64 is, in a lot of ways, on paper, a more powerful system than the PS1. Better CPU, depth buffer / Z test, perspective-correct texturing, antialiasing, subpixel precision, etc. And yet the PS1 completely dominated the N64 in the marketplace and in terms of longetivity--a big part of that how cheap it is to manufacture CDs. And so people lovingly remember PS1-style graphics, but there isn&#39;t as much of a resurgence of N64-style graphics.Another cute thing to note about PS1 is how it renders dark clouds on-screen. You might be familiar with the &#34;add&#34; blend mode for things like lens flares. Well, the PS1 also had a subtract blend mode, which has some unusual effects... basically, anything partially obscured by a dark cloud gets darker but also more colorful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked on the MGS port to PC (from PS1), and I did little restoration trick to remove the &#34;jittering&#34; - I would save into a huge table of float `float gte_results[65536]` - any calculation from the GTE (our emulation) there. For example if after some translation the x was 123.43 - I know that it&#39;ll use only 123, but I would save gte_results[123] = 123.43 - and later when the triangle is drawn (with integer coordiantes, I&#39;ll lookup back as gte_results[123]). So ... it worked kind of :) - https://youtu.be/Fpep7oOGNfU?t=1442"</p>

He wanted to avoid that mark any way possible.YMMV, of course. Amazon is a big company and I&#39;ve had other friends work there in different departments who said this wasn&#39;t common at all.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"OK...So, I&#39;m the tech lead for Cloudflare Workers. In complete honestly, I did not even know we ran some sort of comparison benchmark with Compute@Edge until Fastly complained about it, nor did I know about our ToS clause until Fastly complained about it. I honestly don&#39;t know anything about either beyond what&#39;s publicly visible.But as long as we&#39;re already mud slinging, I&#39;d like to take the opportunity to get a little something off my chest. Fastly has been trumpeting for years that Compute@Edge has 35 microsecond cold starts, or whatever, and repeatedly posting blog posts comparing that against 5 milliseconds for Workers, and implying that they are 150x faster. If you look at the details, it turns out that 35 microsecond time is actually how long they take to start a new request, given that the application is already loaded in memory. A hot start, not a cold start. Whereas Workers&#39; 5ms includes time to load the application from disk (which is the biggest contributor to total time). Our hot start time is also a few microseconds, but that doesn&#39;t seem like an interesting number?We never called this out, it didn&#39;t seem worth arguing over. But excuse me if I&#39;m not impressed by claims of false comparisons...On a serious note, I&#39;ve been saying for decades that benchmarks are almost always meaningless, because different technologies will have different strengths and weaknesses, so you usually can&#39;t tell anything about how your use case will perform unless you actually test that use case.  So, I would encourage everyone to run your own test and don&#39;t just go on other people&#39;s numbers. It&#39;s great that Fastly has opened up C@E for self-service testing so that people can actually try it out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was expecting a point-by-point comparison from Fastly. Instead, this comes off incredibly defensive and evasive, basically boiling down to two irrelevant points:* Rust compiled to WASM is faster than Javascript (ok, but I&#39;m not going to switch my entire stack just to use your CDN)* Fastly performance throttles their free accounts (ok, but not Cloudflare&#39;s fault, and I definitely don&#39;t want to get into your pricing game if you&#39;re going to start offering different tiers of serverless workers... part of Cloudflare&#39;s allure is its simplicity in pricing).They do have two good points:* Benchmarks between CDNs should be done from the same client locations (fine, but why did you then use your own set)* Cloudflare should not prohibit benchmarking of their products (fair)But this whole post read like a feeble attempt at misdirection, and made me distrust Fastly as a company. The complaints about their methodology aren&#39;t solved by using your own, even more flawed, methodology that doesn&#39;t even use the same language. You could&#39;ve just emailed them and asked to work together on an apple-to-apples test instead of creating an even more flawed benchmark."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As mentioned in the article, Cloudflare expressly prohibits benchmarking their services in the tos.I think it&#39;s rather disingenuous for Cloudflare to publish their own benchmarks calling out competitors when they won&#39;t allow anyone to run their own tests and comparisons."</p>

If you have tens of thousands or millions of images, keeping within their single digit per second rate limit, which appears to be totally non-negotiable, makes it impossible to add images at any scale.They have another product called Cloudflare Images which can work from Workers: but here the pricing is almost absurd and from the data they show on their dashboard, they only cache a tiny percentage of the requests. This means you end up paying a lot more than makes sense."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thanks for the feedback. I&#39;m on the CF Images product team.
We will allow the download of the original images, it is actually one of the next features coming up. Also we will introduce webhooks and Images Analytics next."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I thought Cloudflare was going to win the image hosting/serving/resizing game based on their original blog post, but that doesn&#39;t seem to be the case.I kept getting frustrated with the complexity and changing costs of solutions out there, so about a year ago I launched https://www.simplefileupload.com. It&#39;s a super easy, flat rate cost solution to quickly allow users to upload images and files. It provides a customizable upload widget and serves files via a CDN and firewall to protect against attacks. It doesn&#39;t have query param image resizing yet, but it&#39;s coming!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Django has allowed me to enjoy some side entrepreneurship. I have released three products as a solo part time dev that I would never have been able to do in a reasonable time using Java/Spring (my strongest stack). My first project went nowhere, but the second generated 1k+ a month and sold for 50k, and the third one is following a similar trajectory.My advice - keep it simple- function based views- centralize access to the ORM (avoid fat models, use a service layer)- responsive bootstrap template with crispy forms- minimal js- 12 factor type setup - django-environ or similar- be aware of n+1 select problem (I use django debug toolbar but looking into django-zen-queries)- plop it on heroku, AWS lightsail, Digital Ocean or if containerizing use AWS Fargate- avoid celery unless you are at a scale you need it - use django-cron, django-db-queue or similar- use a managed database and managed email serviceI have had zero scalability problems. People say Django is slow but it handled 10k active users on a small EC2 instance without any issues (static stuff served via cloudfront)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Django is the nicest framework I&#39;ve come across! For some context, my favorite overall programming language is Rust. Despite Rust having several web frameworks, I use Python the server due to Django being so nice.In Python, there are micro frameworks like Flask, and whatever new ones claim to be &#34;Blazingly fast!&#34;, async etc. Once you get over the learning curve, Django seems the nicest to use, due to including features like an auto-updating ORM, email, authentication, admin page etc. None of the Rust frameworks, in contrast, come close to feature parity.Django&#39;s feature base is vast, and I admit I don&#39;t understand much of it. You can choose the feature sets you need. The template language is inflexible, but you can smooth this over using JS instead A/R."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"OK. The reason all this happening is that Bitcoin really did go to the moon. That&#39;s what powers all this speculation. If the price of Bitcoin had been stable for a decade, and it worked reliably, it would be a useful medium of exchange, but nobody would care. This is all about MAKE MONEY FAST.Bitcoin found some early use cases. Drugs first. Then getting money out of China. Money laundering. Tax evasion.  Scams. Bitcoin is the scammers dream - remote, anonymous, irreversible transactions. Much less risk of the mark coming for the scammer with a baseball bat.Then China cracked down on cryptocurrency, shut down all the miners, and arrested a few hundred of them. Financial regulators in the more legit countries started regulating Bitcoin exchanges, so the operators couldn&#39;t just steal the money. Know Your Customer became a thing. In the US, the IRS, FinCen, the FBI, and the SEC all started paying attention to what was happening on blockchains. Cryptocurrency crime was no longer risk-free for the crooks.But by now, sheer momentum kept Bitcoin going up. That&#39;s a powerful force. It&#39;s not forever, though. Check out meme stocks a few years later. Remember, all this stuff is zero-sum. For every winner, there has to be a loser.That&#39;s what provides the engine behind &#34;Web3&#34;, NFTs, DAOs, and whatnot. It&#39;s not the technology."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I completely agree with the author. I&#39;ve been reading a lot about the EVM, and while there&#39;s some interesting technology involved, it feels unlikely to be able to support any worthwhile applications outside of blockchain finance or moving $ around the world[0] (since the code can really only directly reference the blockchain itself).It&#39;s a bit like playing with a programming language in a sandbox that has (1) has no I/O functions[1], and (2) has enormous costs associated with even the most basic of computations. Ok, it&#39;s not like that; it is exactly that.Sure, you could build a crypto toy and convince some suckers to transfer some of their wealth to you, but calling it an app platform or the next evolution of the web is definitely a stretch. I sincerely wish that wasn&#39;t the case (I&#39;d love to find an exception), but that&#39;s what I&#39;ve come to conclude.[0] Don&#39;t get me wrong, there&#39;s tremendous value in being able to move money around the world without the blessing of governments and central banks![1] Any interaction with entities outside the blockchain require oracles, and at that point, you might as well throw away the other benefits of being on a blockchain."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find both the evangelism of and the hostility towards “Web 3” kind of silly. Obviously there’s some amount of interesting stuff and obviously there’s some amount of tech bro assholes getting rich who “shouldn’t”.Just like ~2008-2012, ~1999-2002, ~1994-1996, ~1982-1986, etc.On the technology side: distributed Byzantine consensus is an open problem with some promising prototypes. It would have very cool use cases: remittance is huge, ENS is fucking cool, Brave/BAT is cool, NFTs for e.g. concert tickets or restaurant reservations or whatever would be cool, IPFS is cool.The technology isn’t there yet. POW doesn’t scale. Ouroboros Praus/Genesis needs a clock oracle (see: Spanner), Tendermint/Algorand/PBFT are too slow (global 3-phase. commit, right). Solana/ICON/etc. are expensive cloud databases. L2 rollups/Lightning/sharding are “kick-the-can” exercises. But it took time to go from the Paxos paper to Chubby as well, maybe someone solves it.Yeah, it’s mostly scams today. But it’s always been mostly scams. Microsoft bundling IE was a scam. Pets.com was a scam. Path was a scam. Uber and AirBnB were (are?) illegal as hell. Third-party cookies powering Google and FB is a scam.When the dust settles some amount of this stuff will have been worked out technically, legally, and financially, and the rest will be “lol do you remember when…”.This time some people will be rich who neither had rich parents nor knew Bay Area royalty, but YC wasn’t always part of the machine either. I’m sure Goldman and YC will eventually embrace those people with open arms.I for one look forward to us collectively getting our knickers untwisted about it so we can go back to rewriting every calculator app on earth in Rust (I kid! Don’t hit me! Doofy Haskell is better than no Haskell!).;)"</p>

Yet, when I opened a ticket, I was told it was the fault of the other providers, despite the mtr traces showing otherwise, and not having issues outside Hetzner.Hopefully more IPv6 users means that I won&#39;t be the only one impacted by those networking issues.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is still the strongest apple advantage: design, engineering and build quality.Recently I wanted to buy a second notebook so I could leave my MBPro at home in trips where I didn&#39;t want to work, but still had a machine that run linux and windows for some quick idea or even some light gaming.Decided for a Samsung Galaxy Book Pro. Expensive machine, but slightly cheaper than a MacBook Air. good i7 11gen processor, excellent battery life, very light but with surprisingly good thermals, 1tb SSD, but unfortunately no option to have it with more than 16GB RAM.Anyway, was very satisfied with it, and it was so light that I was even booting it with linux and doing some programming on it.But, one day I just opened the lid by the sides, heard a crack, and the gorgeous OLED screen had cracked.Of course I didnt abuse it, I just opened it, without excessive force or speed. But the screen is very fragile, the lid is paper thin, but not rigid enough, it seems, to avoid this problem.And of course, Samsung says it was my fault, and I will have to pay the fix.And yes, I know people have plenty of complaints about apple, but I never had encountered such an obvious problem with an Apple product. Have they not stress-tested this stuff?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the AirPods Pro were a regression from the OG AirPods for four reasons:- Idle life took a huge dive from the originals. My OGs haven&#39;t been charged in something like six months, and the case is still at something like 20%. Meanwhile, the case holding the APPs would die in less than a week and the buds inside of them a week after that.My wife&#39;s APPs have been lost for a while because of this.- Noise cancellation performs worse than the original firmware. They have actually been outclassed by other offerings, such as the Sony WF1000XM4.- The buds themselves have a design flaw wherein earwax will accumulate in its inner grille severely enough to significantly compromise bass response. There&#39;s a thread in MacRumors that&#39;s something like 36 pages long acknowledging this. Apple quietly fixed this in version 2 of the APPs (with the MagSafe case).- The mic isn&#39;t as good. The original APs performed extremely well in wind and loud surroundings. I think the downward beam-forming mics were a big part of this. The mic on the APPs perform worse in these scenarios IMO.I&#39;m glad that Apple went back to beam-forming mics.Regardless, I&#39;m thankful for Apple for lighting up the true wireless headphone industry. The APs were a dream come true when they came out; nothing before it compared (and I had $600 custom IEMs that were waterproof and had a control scheme controlled by head nods). The APPs accelerated the creation of noise cancelling true wireless. I&#39;m excited for the next iteration of these products."</p>

It&#39;s only on mobile that Fandom has seemingly made a deliberate effort to make the user experience as frustrating as possible.  And not once has the video had even a tangential relationship to the article being viewed.The worst part is that uBlock Origin&#39;s element picker doesn&#39;t work on Firefox for Android (or if it does, I haven&#39;t figured out how to use it), so on the one platform where it&#39;s maximally annoying I can&#39;t do anything to block it."</p>

Profit?In reality, at least in my case, what happens is: (1) I say “WTF!?!?”, (2) I make a mental note to never ever visit the site again, and (3) (sadly) I see it again and again at different sites."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here. I forgot to mention:With a Wemos D1 mini (ESP8266) MCU that costs around USD 2.00, you can pretty easily make the Vindriktning WiFi connected and get the data to a backend [1].You just need to solder three wires, and there is enough space within the enclosure to fit the D1 mini inside.This would then allow you to get the exact measurements and to better understand if the &#34;green&#34; is more on the lower end or the higher side.[1] https://github.com/Hypfer/esp8266-vindriktning-particle-sens..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Informative article with fair, fact based, conclusions.I&#39;d like to add that:- The VINDRIKTNING is extremely consumer accessible ($11.99, good build, simple traffic light system).- It may be put into spaces that previously had no particulate air quality monitoring.- The spouse-acceptance-factor is extremely high (unlike e.g. a couple of circuit boards wired together off of Aliexpress).There are other consumer friendly offerings, but they aren&#39;t affordable (e.g. Amazon Smart Air Quality Monitor 4x cost, Airthings 10x cost). That being said, IKEA could fix their traffic-light system&#39;s cut off points for free and should consider it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would be very careful with this kind of evaluation. There are lots of sensors that perform well vs reference instruments but not in the field.If you want real evaluations, SCAQMD (the folks in charge of air quality for southern california) do evaluations of commercially available, low cost sensors, both against reference instruments and the lab.See http://www.aqmd.gov/aq-spec/evaluationsYou can see what i said is true from the table - lots of sensors that are very well correlated with reference instruments in the lab, but suck horribly in the field.I would think you would be better off submitting the sensor in question to them, and letting them put it through its paces.(They publish within a month of finishing testing, and testing takes ~8 weeks)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m your age and of similar profession with a known history of doing software development. Having been a nerd since very early age I come to the conclusion that0) I am growing older and I may get more conservative  
1) I used a lot of products that evolved to a local optimum but I see a lot of them being thrown back into a evolutionary state they already passed a decade ago. Maybe to eveolve better, but I have my doubts. 
2) Everything is bloating now. Instead of a collection of good tools interacting I have now 3+ ways of opening an Excel-File someone shared in Teams. All of them are broken and Teams is broken, too.I feel as if the excellent wrenches I have been using for 20+ years are growing tumors in the form of a can opener. All to please people who never used a wrench or a can opener before. And production of the original wrenches is cancelled. Over night.Next time I need a wrench it may be made of felt, because fedoras are en vogue and the mad hatter has to sink venture capital into expanding his business.(Funfact: In German you could make up the very valid and understandable, but still strange word “dosenöffnerförmige Tumore” )"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think there at least 3 things at play here:#1) Software used to live on a disk you buy. That software doesn&#39;t change, until buy a new disk. Then it lived in apps, where you can update or not. Now often, it lives in the mythical cloud where changes can happen all the time.Now, even on the disk front, things were always changing. Often for the better, sometimes for the worse. In the OS world Dos-&gt;Windows-&gt;Windows 95 were big changes, and the OS9-&gt;OSX change also huge! But now the changes are always.#2) The entire software world is built on VC money. VC money is not looking for slow and sustainable growth. Or a happy userbase of 10k people. The VC world doesn&#39;t mind if 99 companies crash and burn trying to harvest the wind while building their sails if one takes off.#3) Out of the VC/startup world, large companies must justify their existence and every team and every programmer on that team must justify theirs. No one ever stuck around by saying &#34;everything is good, we literally don&#39;t need to do anything or acquire another customer, let&#39;s all cut out hours to 2 days a week, keep patching bugs and making security updates, be happy with our current level of subscriptions, and spend a bit of time in R&amp;D to make sure we have other bait in the water too if for some reason our users stop liking this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMHO the answer is the tech version of bullshit jobs.You know the concept - jobs that exist just to exist and pay for someone&#39;s living, though they produce nothing of actual value, and it takes effort to actually remove so no one does.With software it goes something like this:1) A  product is built, something that solves a real issue. It&#39;s new, rough around the edges and has only the basic critical features.2) Funding is found and a large team is hired to implement what&#39;s needed and fix all the rough edges.3) The team comes up with good, new ideas that actually improve the product experience for everyone, so in the eyes of management and the investors they have merit.4) After the first 10 good ideas are implemented, the next ideas are... not as helpful, but some users still like them and nobody wants to fire anyone who&#39;s been doing really good work so far.5) Fast forward a couple of years, the team is huge and there is really no headroom to improve the product. Everyone tries to come up with bullshit ideas and force their ideas through, just to have something to show come performance review time. The users stay with their tried and true product, and they&#39;re so invested at this point that a few regressions make them bitter - but not enough to leave.6) Rinse and repeat.I&#39;ve been on that team. The engineers there are often mentally older, comfortable, and smart - or at least were smart.  Many of them are sure what they do is important. But they&#39;re wrong. They now hold bullshit jobs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know it’s just an anecdote but as a customer I kind of believe this.I just completed a transaction with them that had to be extended beyond the rate lock window. For about 10 days there was a daily back and forth where they asked me to provide some documentation. I would provide the requested documentation and about 12 hours later I would receive a task of uploading the same required documentation.The document was a 50ish page legal document that required someone to look at it. It’s clear nobody was actually spending any effort on it. Even calling my loan officer wasn’t getting me anywhere. It wasn’t until the deadline approached that they called me and wanted to get it all sorted out and they extended my rate lock.The way management handled this looks horrible but if there’s any truth to these employees essentially stealing wages from their employer then they’re lucky they’re just being fired and not being prosecuted."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The funny thing is that krebsonsecurity.com are the ones that published the false information in the first place.Good summary of the whole saga by Crosstalk youtube channel which covers mostly Ubiquiti: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paLm0tP5GbI"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me a company of their size and, what I would expect, maturity, this new announcement does not satisfy me or provide me much assurance. Consequently I am still happy I have been recommending people against Ubiquiti since the original announcement from Krebs.* Why was it so easy for a lead engineer to get access to a root AWS user without anyone else being notified? I.e. AWS GuardDuty provides FREE alerting for when an AWS root IAM account is logged in or used, this account should be under lock and key and when used, confirmed and audited by relevant persons or teams.Start edit/* Furthermore on the root account being easily accessed, the root account in the companies I&#39;ve worked at had MFA enabled, and the QR code is locked in a safe only accessible by two people agreeing it needs to be accessed in a break glass situation, where warranted./End edit* Why was he also able to delete critical CloudTrail logs and reduce their retention to 1 day? I.e. These logs should be in a S3 bucket or other environment where such changes cannot be made. Alternatively, they should be shipped to a redundant service that manages this risk to prevent data deletion* Why did Ubiquti not announce they were compromised sooner? The hack started in early December, Ubiquiti noticed the compromise on Dec. 28. Ubiquiti told the market on January 11th. Is that a satisfactory turn around? Giving them some credit for the XMas break I&#39;ll say this partially understandable.All the AWS configuration I&#39;m speaking of above, I would describe as Security 101.Most of these settings can be set and managed from AWS Organisations for free, and backed up with alarming and alerts for Guard Duty trivially. That a company of Ubiquiti&#39;s size and maturity had such basic risks not managed is still a concern.I understand AWS Organisations can be difficult to set up for legacy AWS accounts, but even with that said, setting the alarms and monitoring up that would help manage the risk associated to the questions above is not difficult and should have been in place.That Ubiqitui would only find relief ultimately from the developers poor OpSec rather than Ubiquiti&#39;s own security policies and procedures provides a commending perspective of their internal security posture."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Investigators say they were able to tie the downloads to Sharp and his work-issued laptop because his Internet connection briefly failed on several occasions while he was downloading the Ubiquiti data. Those outages were enough to prevent Sharp’s Surfshark VPN connection from functioning properly — thus exposing his Internet address as the source of the downloads.Not the first time I’ve read about a VPN unable to mask someone’s ip when they were on a wonky connection."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"WebAssembly is kind of a hack here (although a clever hack that saves a lot of effort) - the essence of what the Mozilla folks have done isn&#39;t WebAssembly, it&#39;s a trusted compiler - by which I mean a compiler that emits trustable code, regardless of how untrusted the source is. It&#39;s a really neat idea that I hope to see more adoption of, because our current security models for software suck.Security based on process isolation is extremely inefficient and coarse-grained - having a trusted compiler could (eventually) massively increase performance by removing processes entirely (no more virtual memory! no more TLB flushes and misses! less task switch overhead!) and eliminating the kernel/user mode separation, with an increase in security.&#34;Could&#34; because it&#39;s not clear to me if the reduction in expressiveness from our languages now to future languages with a theoretical trusted compiler (all jump targets have to be known at compile-time?) will be accepted by the majority of the populace. Look at how hard it is to get people to accept borrow-checkers..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This sandboxing is achieved via RLBox[0], which is a toolkit for sandboxing third-party libraries. It comprises of a WASM sandbox and an API which existing application can leverage. The research paper[1].[0]: https://plsyssec.github.io/rlbox_sandboxing_api/sphinx/[1]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00572"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So if I&#39;m understanding this correctly, Firefox compiles its dependencies as WASM, effectively blocking function calls to things it shouldn&#39;t and illegal memory access, and then translates it back to C so it can compile it normally? Sounds neat!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something very similar happened to me with Amazon. I used a new debit card from an online bank to purchase an expensive item and deliver it to a foreign address (which is admittedly suspicious). The payment bounced, Amazon immediately locked my account and requested to see a card billing statement sent to my home address to reactivate it. Upon login I am presented with a stern request for documentation, a pdf upload field, a tweet-sized text field for comments, and all communication comes from a noreply@amazon.com address. All my kindle/audible/etc media immediately became inaccessible.I went through every possible channel to explain that the card does not send me a billing statement and I cannot possibly produce one, requesting to be called or at least emailed by a human, to no avail. After spending tens of thousands of dollars on Amazon over the course of fifteen years I couldn&#39;t even get a personal call from the case manager, and all my purchased media is gone.To this day I have found no resolution, and the only next step is to contact them through a lawyer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of people in this thread talking about losing their store credit and app/content purchases. I&#39;d imagine the worst case scenario could be much worse.  Apple runs fairly popular cloud storage services that are strongly encouraged to you for your photo storage and files.  The photo storage especially has an option to automatically delete your local media because it&#39;s already backed up on Apple&#39;s servers.  Will these all be locked out without warning or recourse for a miscellaneous card whoopsie?Even standard files on iCloud.  Who knows how important the average users&#39; cloud files are to them?  (I don&#39;t use public cloud storage at all anymore because of this exact fear - what if some arbitrary billing/transaction error locks me out of everything without recourse?).To be fair I&#39;ve no idea what the person in question got their account locked for and if there was any shadiness involved but I doubt they&#39;d write about it publicly (or get access restored) if there were, which implies that at any time your account and your data can be taken away for something entirely mundane.It makes me really concerned in fact how Google would handle something similar to this - given that for Chromebook users everything (literally EVERYTHING you would normally do locally on a computer) is in/via your Google account."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every company (Apple, Google, Amazon, etc) is guilty of pulling this non-sense on customers. It is too easy for them to wipe out thousands of dollars of value with no meaningful explanation (read the Terms and Services and go away? seriously Apple?) and no accountability.IMO, states should enact laws where you can take the company to court in your local county and no contract can override that right. If the termination is found justified, the company must refund all account assets at fair market value and any remaining balance. If it was not justified, the company must reinstate the account, pay all court and legal fees, and a reasonable amount of mandatory punitive damages.Also, I don&#39;t get why Apple et al pull these stunts anyways. They already have a huge &#34;regulate me&#34; post it on their back."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The new worldgen is incredible, both above and below the surface. Hats off to everyone at Mojang that worked on this!One of my favorite game memories of all time was the first time I played Minecraft during the alpha days and immediately got lost in the world. For me, going into a 1.18 world and finding a giant mountain chain and then finding a cave on the peak of the mountain that falls all the way into a giant underground ocean at the bottom of the world in a huge cavern complete with underground vegetation… it brought me right back to that sense of exploration and wonder that I remember from the very first time I played Minecraft.Also, I found this datapack (sort of like a mod but doesn’t require patching the game since the game natively supports loading datapack files) called Terralith [1] that extends the 1.18 worldgen with even more cool stuff. Wandering around the new 1.18-style mountains is incredible, and then stumbling across something the resembles Yellowstone National Park added by Terralith is even more incredible. It’s worth a try if you like just wandering around in Minecraft marveling at the scenery.[1] https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/terralith-overworl..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Man. I really do want to like it, but this update is the first one that gives me the Microsoft-finally-took-over vibes. Traversal and with that exploration just became so much harder. The landscape is now riddled with holes that you either build scraggly bridges over, or lead to massive detours. The sides of bodies of water are much higher and steeper on average, making it impossible to see the landscape you&#39;re passing, and getting up there to take a look is tedious.So you&#39;re basically stuck near spawn unless you want to spend much more time getting around.A lot of surface iron was replaced with copper, which is useless, meaning progress is now slower than ever, and grinding becomes even more of a necessity. Generally, many of the items that now clutter the inventory are mostly useless, and the inventory needs constant attention.Minecraft is a fantastic game that I have spent well over a thousand hours on over the last decade, with many more to come very likely. That being said, with the account transition to Microsoft/Xbox and this update that gives me personally the &#34;Microsoft knows whats best for its users&#34; vibes that I still distinctly remember from WLM and Skype, I am definitely less optimistic about the game&#39;s future than I was a few years ago. I do hope my caution proves to be unwarranted."</p>

This looks very polished and much more approachable compared to Ardour or LMMS, and seems like a good candidate. But one feature I really wish my dream &#34;Blender for audio&#34; had would be the convenient device view that Ableton and Bitwig offer for working quickly with effects. It&#39;s so much faster than the type of effect chains offered by DAWs like FL and makes it fun to mess around and experiment with effects-based synthesis. Looking at the screenshots and videos it looks like Zrythm doesn&#39;t have this feature, although I understand how tedious it would be to implement because you would essentially have to write your own effects or create wrappers around others to expose an interface that can fit in a device view. Probably not high on the list of priorities for a work in progress DAW"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks nice, particularly the piano roll.Do any Free DAWs have Ableton-like VST &#34;hiding&#34;? I can&#39;t leave Ableton because of how insane window management gets on complex projects when 10 different VSTs are all fighting for screen space. Even the screenshots for this app look chaotic from all of the VSTs covering the screen at the same time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not the only approach that&#39;s possible. There&#39;s quite a few lifts in France that pull a similar trick, but with only one cable.They solve the problem by having the bar below the clamp be a flexible section, as the bar approaches the turn, a section a static rails forces the bar to rotate 30-40 deg around the cable, moving the protruding part of the clamp out of the horizontal plane. Then the cable passes around a large diameter wheel, also 30-40 from vertical, to create the turn.Because both the bar and the wheel are both 30-40 degrees from vertical, the wheel meets the top of clamp, rather than the side, but cable can still make a turn in the horizontal plane. They&#39;re a little uncomfortable for the rider, because the bar you holding onto gets jerked left and right, but you make around the bend just fine, and without an elaborate 2 wire system.I think the Chardonnet ski lift at  Val d&#39;Isère is an example of this type of lift, but I can&#39;t find any photos of the corner unfortunately.For chair lifts, the lift at Ski Dubai has turn half way up, and their chairs are permanently clamped to the cable. For going up the chair just goes around the outside of normal wheel. For going down, to passes around an elaborate wheel with cutouts to make space for the chair clamp and bar. The running surface of this wheel is made up of smaller rollers, and there&#39;s a big friction break on hub. So a computer watches for incoming chairs, then slows the big wheel down as needed to align the chair with a cut out. You can catch a glimpse of this here (best video I could find)[2].[2] https://youtu.be/M7ghP4YTk3M?t=204"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s BTW also possible to make a left turn on a single rope if you push something against the t-bars.  In German it&#39;s called &#34;Bachmannkurve&#34; and it uses a giant wheel.  You can see it in action here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfw4em7e2OQVideo quality is bad, but this is what it looks like on a picture: https://blog.jacomet.ch/wp-content/20170120-schwanden-052.jp..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In Japan, there were a couple of ski lifts that make almost 90-degree turn, called &#34;bending lift (屈曲リフト)&#34;. Near the turning point they put up a warning sign like &#34;please hold tight or you might be thrown off&#34;. As a kid I always enjoyed the experience though. Sadly all of them have been torn down by about a decade ago, due to its high maintenance cost.cf. http://cable.cocolog-nifty.com/sakudo/2006/02/post_d5e1.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s worth noting that dig (and host) bypass the normal DNS resolution mechanism used by most programs on the host. i.e. These tools aren&#39;t using getaddrinfo/gethostbyname.Sometimes, I want to see the results from getaddrinfo, which are impacted by caching on the host itself and/or OS-specific configuration settings that dig and host know nothing about. (scutil --dns on macOS, systemd-resolvedand nscd on Linux, etc.)In that case, I usually use ping. e.g., waiting for a DNS change to propagate to a host, I might use:    while :; do ping -c 1 hostname; sleep 1; done"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This comes up every year so I ask a question:If you could fix copyright, how would you do it?Here is what I would do:1.  All works must be registered in a government registry.If it&#39;s not in there it&#39;s not copyrighted.  If you want to register a work from before the law passes, you have to prove you own it under the current system.  This would solve the orphan works problem -- if no one can prove they own it, it becomes public domain.  Basically, ownership should be recorded like actual property with a proper chain of title.  It would be published on a public ledger.2. You must renew your registration every three years.  The fee for renewal will be X% of the revenue from the work, where X = years since first registration - 5 (edit: With a minimum fee of $100 to discourage hoarding useless IP).  First renewal is at 8 years.  Your registration fee would be recorded on the public ledger.If you want to continue to derive benefit from your work you have to pay for the privilege.  After 105 years it will obviously no longer be worth it, but probably long before that.  This would be reported like income taxes -- you self report your profits but if the government thinks you&#39;re cheating, they can audit you.  If you have multiple works in one product (think Marvel movies) then all revenue goes to the oldest work (that way you can&#39;t avoid the fee by putting new and old characters together).If you don&#39;t renew, the work goes to the public domain.How would you fix copyright?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t think they even tried to read the ISA spec documents. If they did, they would have found that the rationale for most of these decisions is solid: Evidence was considered, all the factors were weighted, and decisions were made accordingly.But ultimately, the gist of their argument is this:&gt;Any task will require more Risc V instructions that any contemporary instruction set.Which is easy to verify as utter nonsense. There&#39;s not even a need to look at the research, which shows RISC-V as the clear winner in code density. It is enough to grab any Linux distribution that supports RISC-V and look at the size of the binaries across architectures."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"RISC V is an opinionated architecture and that is always going to get some people fired up. Any technology that aims for simplicity has to make hard choices and trade offs. It isn’t hard to complain about missing instructions when there are less than 100 of them. Meanwhile nobody will complain about ARM64 missing instructions because it had about 1000 of them.Therein lies the problem. Nobody ever goes out guns blazing complaining about too many instructions despite the fact that complexity has its own downsides.RISC-V has been designed aggressively to have minimal ISA to leave plenty of room to grow, and require minimal number of transistors for a minimal solution.Should this be a showstopper down the road, then there will be plenty of space to add an extensions that fixes this problem. Meanwhile embedded systems paying a premium for transistors are not going to have to pay for these extra instructions as only 47 instructions have to be implemented in a minimal solution."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So this is one tiny corner of the ISA, not something that makes ALL instruction sequences longer - essentially RISCV has no condition codes (they&#39;re a bit of an  architectural nightmare for everyone doing any more than the simplest CPUs, they make every instruction potentially have dependencies or anti-dependencies with every other).It&#39;s a trade off - and the one that&#39;s been made is one that makes it possible to make ALL instructions a little faster at the expense of one particular case that isn&#39;t used much - that&#39;s how you do computer architecture, you look at the whole, not just one particular caseRISCV also specifies a 128-bit variant that is of course FASTER than these examples"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have used Apache Guacamole to access running GitHub Actions workflows as remote desktops. It worked super well for testing GUI apps on other operating systems that I didn&#39;t want to deal with setting up.It&#39;s also nice if you want to run a GUI application in someone else&#39;s sandbox.https://github.com/jstrieb/ctf-collab/blob/9300c57364f71fe29..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We adopted Guacamole for access to some of our Windows server production environments; the great thing about it is you can put your corporate SSO / authorization model into a web app to control access and not have to disclose credentials to service accounts to developers. You can also tap off a feed from the guacd that represents a complete screen recording and save it for audit trail purposes.The only issue we&#39;ve had is that FreeRDP (that underlies it for connectivity to Window servers) is a bit fussier than the native RDP environment, or at least we&#39;ve had challenges getting equivalent compatibility across old/odd Windows configurations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Using it mainly because of the paranoia of just exposing RDP to the internet. Http(s) is very convenient to add more layers of security, in my case via NGINX (both as LXC containers in Proxmox). I&#39;m using a wildcard domain *.myhome.tld pointed to my static IP. Guacamole is hosted at try_guess_me.myhome.tld, with NGINX basic auth same for all subdomains (further protected by fail2ban). So in total 3 tokens are required (subdomain and basic auth username and password) just to get to the Guacamole login page, where additional username/password + 2FA are required. I used to expose RDP directly for years, but after a chat with a colleague before vacations and a purchase of a NUC for a homelab server decided to strengthen the security slightly.RDP is still much better user experience, so once when I needed a longer session I used Guacamole to access my router admin interface and temporarily expose RDP directly via a random port and a very strong password. I&#39;m still not convinced that the latter combination is not enough, but it&#39;s better to be safe than sorry."</p>

Both.This will apply only after the DOT finalizes a rule describing what all those things actually mean in terms of manufacture.  The law requires that the Secretary publish this rule within the next three years, unless they think it can&#39;t be done, in which case they can push it out another three years.  That rule must give car manufactures at least another two years to implement the requirement.  It also gives the DOT an out to say that it can&#39;t be done, in which case in 2031, they need to write a report to Congress to say why it can&#39;t be done.In software terms, this is a user story that was just submitted for development.

They accessed her Google account and tried to lock us out. They used her PayPal to send someone $5 (a test probably).How could this happen? Well Facebook and Instagram show logins from Texas. The old phone still showed on our find my phone app and it was in Texas. Guess where we sent the phone for RMA? The last ping from the old phone (which was today) was the same as the place we shipped it. The exact location down to the very building. Clearly they fixed the old phone and since it wasn&#39;t wiped, was still logged into her Google account.I called Google and they basically said &#34;woah that&#39;s fucked up we&#39;ll get back to you&#34;. We filed a police report but I don&#39;t expect they will do anything.What are my options here for sueing Google? I know that sounds insane but this breach of trust and privacy is egregious.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see this kind of thing happening all the time, facilitated by third parties.For example, a few months ago I found this funny video of some trombonists playing Bruchner in unusual situations[1] that had been uploaded on 14th September 2015 and noticed it had an obviously-bogus copyright claim for the music (&#34;Song: Calling You (Live), Artist: FUN, Licensed to YouTube by (on behalf of FUN); Songtrust, Sony ATV Publishing, and 2 music rights societies&#34;), with a link to where this bogus &#34;song&#34; had been uploaded[2].The &#34;song&#34; proved to be a video consisting of the original trombone video&#39;s soundtrack played twice, over an unrelated static image, that had been uploaded on 13th May 2021—six years after the video it was ripping off.There was enough information on the &#34;song&#34; video to find out that it had been supplied to YouTube by a company called TuneCore[3] who according to their website offer to &#34;SELL YOUR MUSIC WORLDWIDE: Get your music on Spotify, iTunes/Apple Music, Tidal, Amazon Music, TikTok, Tencent &amp; more&#34;.I contacted TuneCore in July to point out that their service was being abused, but got a semi-automated reply to the effect that unless it was _my_ copyright that was being infringed they weren&#39;t interested.  I replied, and also responded to their automated did-Jira-help-you-today survey, in both cases pointing out that they were (however inadvertently) involved in fraudulent activity but (unsurprisingly) never heard back.I see now that the TuneCore &#39;song&#39; video has been made private, but the original trombone video still carries the false copyright claim.So frustrating.[1] https://youtu.be/rY0m2cLH1m8[2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-577Wp8yBQ - now private[3] https://www.tunecore.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe worthy of its own post but there&#39;s another kind of overt scammer on Youtube. It goes like this:They find some technically hip, well known content and create a new channel with a very similar name as the originator. Create an exciting full screen ad for a crypto currency faucet scam, with price charts and crawls. &#34;Live&#34; stream the original content inset into the ad.Here&#39;s one example: https://cryptoplayboys.blogspot.com/2021/11/spacex-scam-live...Even if you report these things, they don&#39;t get removed very quickly. They&#39;re getting tons of views so why would YT care? The original content holder would care about being associated with them and should sue for defamation though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have been a professional artist for about twenty years and it is my considered opinion that any &#34;rule&#34; given out to beginners is actually a warning: violate this rule and making something that looks good becomes a lot harder, so you should probably better make sure you&#39;re not violating any other &#34;rules&#34; unknowingly.If you know damn well that you&#39;re violating multiple rules then sure, go for it - break your perspective, fill the drawing with tangents, shade with black, etc, break the fuck out of these rules, and you can end up with something pretty good. You have to know your shit backwards and forwards to really pull this off; go look at how solid Picasso&#39;s pre-Cubist stuff was, for instance.There are good reasons to choose to use black and there are good reasons to avoid using it; this article talks about several. IIRC, one of the reasons painting teachers traditionally like to tell you to avoid it is because most commonly available black pigments can very quickly ruin the saturation of any other color you mix it with, ending up with unpleasantly grey shadows. But if you do more graphic work that treats each color as a largely separate entity then a lot of solid black can make stuff positively glow."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"#000 on my screen isn&#39;t going to be pure black either.  There&#39;s ambient light, the black level on the monitor, etc.  Several of the examples of saturated grays in this article are low-contrast UI that&#39;s hard to read.  Please don&#39;t do that.&#34;Words on web pages aren&#39;t black&#34;.  But they should be #000 or close to it.  Let the user&#39;s screen and environment determine the rest.Interfaces are artificial constructs designed to be as readable and understandable as possible.  Looking at the color of shadows and physically dark things is unhelpful for designing readable interfaces with sufficient contrast."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a design background and have written a lot of CSS, and I have opinions so just interpret this all as a personal preference if you want.* It&#39;s basic floor/ceiling stuff. Once you go #000000, you can&#39;t go any darker. Are you 100% sure the thing you&#39;re making #000000 is the absolute darkest thing on your site/app you&#39;ll ever need to declare?* Conversely, never use white! Modern macOS sucks at this! A large window of Mail.app in light mode is pretty blinding. What if you want to add a subtle highlight to a button border on a white background? #fafafa was always a go-to white for me because its easy to remember.* Shadows are really never black and your CSS shadows will look better if you don&#39;t default to black. Toggle &#39;tint shadows&#39; on the _excellent_ css shadow palette generator: https://www.joshwcomeau.com/shadow-palette/. Play with background colors, you&#39;ll see.* Your design will never please everyone, especially anything close to a majority on certain tech news aggregators."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had an algorithms class (6.006 or 046?) with Silvio Micali, who I learned partway through the semester was one of the first authors about these things.Anyway, he was a great professor. When talking through algorithms, he&#39;d always start with say, an n^4 solution. Then cut it down to n^3, call on people to help out, etc. I remember it being something like this (in an Italian accent that we really enjoyed)&#34;And now we&#39;re at n^2! Pretty good you might think eh? After all, we were at n^4 just a few minutes ago, this is much better? But, the human mind is a wonderful thing! It is so creative and some people thought about it, and they got n log n! Amazing. I know you are thinking, n log n is always as good as it gets in this class. Well I don&#39;t want to go into the details because, it is horrifying! But actually some people, they did even better! And you know as I said, the human mind is amazing! So maybe one day, you will do even better.&#34;Also I sat across the aisle from him when Eliezer Yudkowsky came for a talk and only realized it when he answered a question EY asked the audience.This kind of turned into me reminiscing but my point is, the guy who put these out there and did a lot of work on them is a great undergrad professor and that makes me happy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not an expert, but coming from a logic background, I always think that ZK proofs are fudging the idea of &#34;completeness&#34; (and &#34;soundness,&#34; for that matter). For example, in [1] (Definition 1.1):&gt; We note that the constants 2/3 and 1/3 are arbitrarily chosen for simplicity. We can always amplify the completeness probability to 1 − negl(λ) and the soundness probability to negl(λ) with repetition.But that&#39;s not completeness in the metamathematical sense. That&#39;s a statistical boundary on what it takes to &#34;convince&#34; someone (or &#34;gain knowledge&#34;). But that&#39;s a stochastic redefinition of a pretty hard-line property of proof systems. In other words, you could theoretically have no knowledge and just get astronomically lucky to an arbitrary degree (whatever degree it would take to cross that proof threshold).[1] https://crypto.stanford.edu/cs355/18sp/lec3.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A while back I came up with a third ZK Where&#39;s Waldo protocol [1] that avoids the need to watermark the page or search Alice for contraband, and also has the (usually desirable) property that it&#39;s only convincing to Bob.You instead have Bob randomly choose whether Alice must a) pull off the screen, revealing the original page, or b) punch a hole through to Waldo, but not both. Then you can do any number of rounds of this, with Alice putting the page in a random position each time.It&#39;s only convincing to Bob because bystanders (or rather, anyone not part of the random number generation for which challenge to use) can&#39;t rule out the possibility that they conspired to have Bob always pick the challenge that a faker Alice could solve. (Show the original page when the uses the real one, punch a hole when she uses a fake page.)[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15323790Edit: That original comment gives the &#34;magic formula&#34; for coming up with such ZKPs as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Arguably, this is the real use case Pegasus was designed for. A government (Uganda) that does not have a large and mature civil service that would support a G7 level technical domestic intelligence agency went to market for the tools of one (NSO), so they can keep tabs on foreign intelligence agents (state department staff) in their country. I am not a fan of NSO at all, but this case sounds like they&#39;re providing sovereignty or statecraft as a service to a government that prefers to buy instead of build their security capability.When the game is defined as a competition for how to break its rules in the most unexpected ways and with the fewest consequences, Uganda appears to have joined in with aplomb.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I saw a term in the comments: AFOL. I had to look it up: Adult Fan Of Legos.I loved legos as a kid and would spend hours building stuff. Now the kits seem more like models to be assembled and put on display and not touched rather than “a paint brush of blocks” where I can use my imagination. It lost my interest. My attention is now on software where I feel I can build anything. I liken it to my lego experience as a child.I don’t necessarily think there’s a right or wrong thing here. It’s interesting to note how our mind changes as we age and grow older. The ”do anything” mentality get displaced with something else. This would make for an interesting PhD topic. :)I found another quote from a related article that captured this feeling.    “It’s like a blast to the past, straight to our childhoods,” said Deason, 40, who lives in Connellsville, Pa. “It took me by surprise, but it makes sense: Life is so structured. But with Lego, you can do anything.”

    Deason has a few million Lego pieces, which she organizes by type and color. The Star Wars and Architecture sets, she says, are the most popular among adults, who almost always look for the instruction manuals.

    “The younger kids come in and it’s all about their imaginations — playing pretend, building zombie towns,” she said. “But at some point that gets lost. The adults seem to value the final finished project. That’s where they get their satisfaction.”"</p>

That they have fans that can catch this issue and explain it so well is another testament to the standards they&#39;ve maintained.Can we call &#34;lego instructions&#34; an example of software design?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hacker News has a similar problem with comments:  net_votes = up_votes - down_votes

You need at least two of the above variables to get an idea of both the direction and magnitude of the voting. Hacker News provides only one: net_votes. YouTube used to provide up_votes and down_votes, effectively providing all three. Now YouTube has reduced its information to up_votes, so they&#39;re now down to one variable in the equation, as Hacker News has been all along.The difference between 102+/100- votes and 2+/0- votes is large, but invisible on this site. I think it would be better for HN to go to where YouTube was, giving us an idea of both the net vote and the level of activity. Like up/down or up/total or net/total."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As co-founder of another database company in the PostgreSQL ecosystem, I have to say that I&#39;m really impressed with the quality and velocity of launches from the Supabase team. Nothing else to add, except please keep up the great work!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve explored multiple Graphql solutions for PostgreSQL in the past and couldn&#39;t convince of the resolvers based approach and always felt that an extension would be the right solution. The closest I&#39;ve come across and used so far is Graphjin  https://github.com/dosco/graphjin .
Thanks Supabase for the fantastic extension!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I enjoyed Sam Newman&#39;s take on this capability [1]&gt; Great to see AWS providing direct data coupling as a service. /s&gt; This service allows you to directly map a GraphQL endpoint to a database table. It’s like putting getters and setters on an object and claiming your encapsulating private variables. The end result is coupling between GraphQL clients and the underlying datasource.&gt; Information hiding is a key concept in independent change. Can I change the provider (of the GraphQL) endpoint independent of the clients? Directly exposing internal data structure makes this very difficult.And [2]:&gt; So a few people have asked why I have this snarky response. What is my problem with this service? Well, to be clear, it’s not an issue with GraphQL, it’s an issue with direct coupling with underlying datasources #thread&gt; The service as advertised makes it simple to map a GraphQL definition against a database. Now, what’s the problem with this? Well, the devil here is in the detail. But fundamentally it comes down to how important information hiding is to you.&gt; ... see the thread for more ...[1] https://twitter.com/samnewman/status/1346541251617828877

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those unfamiliar with ITA Matrix, it was for a long time the go-to flight search tool for the most dedicated flight hackers, points hackers, etc.It was built by ITA Software [1][2] in the early-mid 2000s (the earliest mention I can find of it is in 2004 [3]) to test and showcase the capabilities of their flight search platform. I once heard that ITA and other consumer-facing flight search companies had tested that kind of UI with ordinary users, but found that not enough people understood or liked it enough for them to justify making it a mainstream interface.Hipmunk, a YC-backed flight search site that launched in 2010, was heavily influenced by the ITA Matrix UI, after co-founder Adam Goldstein had found Matrix to be the best way for him to find flights when travelling around the world for college debating competitions. And while Hipmunk did a good job of being more consumer-friendly and popular than Matrix had been, sadly they didn&#39;t gain enough traction to make it as a standalone company, and after being acquired by SAP/Concur, it was shut down last year.It&#39;s an interesting, and perhaps depressing case of a product design concept being far superior to what&#39;s available in the mainstream for a certain class of user, but cannot gain enough mainstream acceptance to be a viable business or even a well-supported service for those who love it. And far more than most other product categories, flight search has huge infrastructure costs, so it&#39;s very difficult to economically sustain niche products (from grim personal experience of being part of a team trying to build a novel flight search product ourselves).In this case it&#39;s just lucky that Google owns the infrastructure and has enough enthusiasm internally to keep it going to some extent.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITA_Software[2] https://xconomy.com/boston/2008/12/17/ita-software-the-trave...[3] https://www.fodors.com/community/europe/customs-question-sea..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"ITA Matrix is still my go-to for booking flights:https://matrix.itasoftware.com/Playing with this version, it&#39;s a little easier to use, but I don&#39;t see any functionality not in the regular version. Still, if it means Google is investing in Matrix, that&#39;s a good thing. I always worry at some point it will be killed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wanted to self plug a community project I maintain that continues to enhance ITA Matrix, Powertools[1] and see if anybody wanted to help port it over to this new front end. PRs accepted!1. https://github.com/adamhwang/ita-matrix-powertools"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It’s an interesting look at AWS pricing since the cost of the M1 Mac Mini ($699) and it’s power consumption (avg 26 watts) are known. Based on hardware costs (significant) and power costs (insignificant) you’re looking at a hardware ROI at about 6 months from the $.65 per hour price. AWS has an estimated 60% gross profit margin, so from there it’s probably possible to estimate some other interesting things about their costs, utilization rate and 
depreciation schedule.Edit: Sorry, my napkin math assumed a unstated utilization rate of 40 hours per week, but that’s not a great assumption due to the 24 hour minimum. Still, some proportion of machines will be idle, though 75% idle seems like a bad guess."</p>
