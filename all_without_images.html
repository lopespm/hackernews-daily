								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Serious question: if I were to use this, would Microsoft collect analytics on me (code written, keystrokes, mouse movements, sleep/work schedule, productivity metrics, etc) and monetize that data by using it to build some AI product like Copilot, or build a productivity dashboard so managers can fire people for not being productive enough (like Xsolla did), use it to serve me ads, or do some stupid/irresponsible/unethical thing with it that will ultimately end up hurting me in the long run?Because I feel like the answer to that is yes, and I can already see myself in the future writing something angry in the comments section of an article on HN that exposes some evil/stupid shit Microsoft did with this, or happened as a result of this.I&#39;m not against the concept of using a thin client for development, but it just doesn&#39;t seem smart to me do it in such a way where you have to place trust in a company that, throughout their entire existence, has consistently proven that you should not trust them, because they have no incentive to (and thus never will) act in your best interests. It&#39;s like if Facebook released their own web browser and &#34;promised&#34; to respect your privacy; you&#39;d be an idiot to believe them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; My friends, I’m here to tell you I was a Codespaces skeptic before this started and now I am not. This is the way. ~@iolsenI don&#39;t actually doubt that this (and the 4 other glowing employee quotes) are real, but even assuming they are, I can understand people remaining skeptical about the sample size of 5 being broadly representative of the 100s (1000s?) of engineers at the company.Also slightly hilarious that &#34;This is the way&#34; is a Star Wars callback referring to a character blindly following dogma before eventually realising the error of their ways...On the other hand, there&#39;s quite a few &#34;hints&#34; littered throughout the article that their current setup is a bit of a beast, so I can definitely imagine some engineers being relieved to be able to get such a behemoth off their physical laps/desks: I guess if the local development experience is sufficiently brittle &amp; frustrating, any alternative may seem welcome."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So you&#39;re telling me that the next GitHub outage could take out my dev environment and give me an afternoon off? Time to convince management that we need to switch to Codespaces!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m 61 and have been working in high tech since 1983 or so, writing embedded software, doing system administration, and managing people.The article strikes me as good advice. I didn’t find anything to disagree with in it.Ageism is a thing. People have all kinds of biases of which they may or may not be aware. You have them too, and so do I.A line from another source that I keep in mind is this: “If you’re always getting angry, you’ll turn your nature against the Way.” [1] It doesn’t pay to be the angry, unapproachable person in life.[1] https://www.dailyzen.com/journal/bloodstream-sermon"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This captures a lot of what I have always wanted to express. I am of same cohort as the author, and aside from being laid off once (which, honestly, was wonderful) I have managed to stay well employed 30 years in tech.  I hold no degree. I have no specific super powers.  But, yes... everything stated here rings true for me.  I would, humbly, add some of my own.Learn the people patterns.  Every where I have worked has at least a few, if not all, members of Typical IT Cast Of Characters.  There is the &#34;know-it-all-but-does-not&#34;, &#34;wise old sage&#34;, &#34;management climber&#34;, &#34;new guy&#34;, &#34;one-job-and-doesn&#39;t-want-to-change&#34;, &#34;hockey-jersey-guy-who-smells-but-knows-too-much&#34;, etc.   Pick your own.  Most of these people will avoid, tolerate, get along with, or maybe love the others.  Or some combination thereof.   I have found being the impartial mediator to be advantageous.  Be the &#34;Ferris Bueller&#34;.Know the business as well as the tech.  Technologists that can dive into the business language and work with both groups are invaluable.Diagrams. Work hard on developing the capability to express ideas/concepts/flows in a diagram that fits on one sheet of paper.  Do this all the time...even for one-offs.  As the author states, it helps build your brand.  It&#39;s advertising. When I see a one-pager I did 6 months ago on a desk covered with coffee stains, or pinned to the wall above monitor...I know I have made an impression.  I worked with a few masters of this craft, and honestly, they are all magic on any team.Share credit constantly.  Don&#39;t ever appear that you need validation.  Give good ideas away for team members to catch and grow. You will build a community around you that seek you out for guidance.  Time passes quickly... that junior dev you credited for a schema re-jig 5 years ago is now a VP at BigCo.  She didn&#39;t forget.  Keep in touch, right?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s a great article.I&#39;m 59, and have been out of the &#34;market&#34; for the last 4 years. I have no intentions of ever working for anyone else again. I&#39;m fortunate, in being able to do that.What did it for me, was the atrocious way that I was treated, when I went looking for work, after leaving my previous employer; just shy of 27 years. I stayed that long, not because I&#39;m a &#34;clinger,&#34; but because I was damn good at my job, and they valued me.It seems that us &#34;olds&#34; are not popular. It appears to be personal and emotional; not based on any empirical data (Did I mention that I&#39;m actually fairly good at what I do?). Quite strange, in an industry known for its data-driven approach.It didn&#39;t take me long to figure out that the current environment does not want me around. I won&#39;t go, where I&#39;m not wanted, and I&#39;m incredibly grateful to have the means to do this. I am quite aware that most of my peers do not have this choice, and it hurts my heart to know that they will spend their final years of employment, being treated in such a shoddy manner.But that won&#39;t stop me from working. I just had to set my own agenda. It&#39;s coming along nicely. I tend to develop rather ambitious stuff, and the last few years have been fun. I would not have done it, if I hadn&#39;t been pushed; so I guess it&#39;s all good."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I guess I’m the outlier in being very happy with 1Password and fine with paying for the subscription service. Not only is 1Password the best password manager I’ve used, but it makes it seamless to share stuff with my wife. I don’t care if 8 is an Electron app either, considering I usually interact with it via the browser anyway with their extension. (Also I know that the majority of what they wrote for it is Rust and fast, and I generally trust the engineers to do a good job since they’ve done a good job with it in the past) Also they make a CLI tool for accessing passwords allowing you to integrate password management there: https://1password.com/downloads/command-line/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a 1PW subscription user and am happy with the product (however, seeing they are moving to Electron means that is very subject to change...)butSaying that &#34;customers voted with their wallet&#34; and chose subscriptions is disingenousEver since they&#39;ve had subscriptions they&#39;ve made the standalone license page extremely difficult to find on their site. They really didn&#39;t give regular users a &#34;choice&#34;- they dark-patterned them into thinking subscriptions were the only optionAs forthcoming / down-to-earth as these posts from the company seem- they are full of spin. Their impossible-to-find standalone license page is a topic they seem to be avoiding.Edit to add this small addendum: It just really bothers me on an emotional level to constantly run into this juxtaposition as a user of software/hardware: liking a product but being extremely disappointed in the company offering it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I cannot find any source files for the FPGA code in the repository (no .v .vhd .vhdl files and I can&#39;t see anything by looking around manually). The FPGA directory [1] contains some binaries and some documents relating to commercial code from a Swiss firm [2].I&#39;ve seen plenty of projects described as open source when the firmware is open source and the hardware is closed but this is the first time I&#39;ve seen one where the schematics and board layout are open but the firmware is closed. Note that the hardware itself is quite simple, the smart stuff happens in three modules: GNSS receiver, precision clock and FPGA. To me, the contents of the FPGA source code are the only interesting part of this project. Additionally, you won&#39;t be able to meaningfully modify or reuse this project without editing the source code.The hardware module these FPGA binaries seem to be compiled for is described as an AC7100B, the source given for these is a defunct ebay link [3] [4] :-O This project uses two and half grand&#39;s worth of atomic clock and the heart of it runs on a module that fell off the back of a lorry!?[1] https://github.com/opencomputeproject/Time-Appliance-Project...

[4] https://www.ebay.com/itm/XINLINX-A7-FPGA-Development-board-A...Edit: I realise this comes across as quite negative. This looks like a neat project, one I would actually use, but only if it were meaningfully open source."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s interesting to me is how the form factor of timing GPS modules has stayed constant over the years.  I started my GNSS timing journey with a used Trimble GPS from the 2000s, and it has the same form factor and pinout as the modern multi-constellation timing GPSes from uBlox.I&#39;ve had a GPS clock going for several years at this point, and without an atomic clock or really any fanciness (just LinuxPPS and Chrony), I see about +/- 380ns, which is pretty good.  NTP to the Internet gives me jitter in the range of about 20ms-70ms, about 5 orders of magnitude worse.(The version a few iterations ago looked like this: https://github.com/jrockway/beaglebone-gps-clock.  But I now have a uBlox multi-constellation GPS, which is much more accurate with my limited view of the sky from my Brooklyn apartment.  And I 3D printed the case, so it actually looks presentable instead of like some crazed madman that attacked a plastic case with a hacksaw -- which is exactly how I made the first case.  As for the DS3231 RTC that I added... that seems to be stable within about 1.5us, which is pretty impressive.  I tuned it a little bit with the trim register, though.)My takeaway from this article is that the project seems quite compelling, but a lot of cost is added to support PTP.  I see why Facebook needs that, but to sync time precisely throughout my lab, all I need is a coaxial cable with 10MHz on it.  I don&#39;t mind if my workstation is 20ms off UTC."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Man, tough crowd here. And someone who&#39;s been following precise timekeeping tech for 25 years now.. this is really cool! I think it&#39;s great some smart engineers have built a new reasonably compact and low cost very precise bit of timekeeping hardware. Thank you for sharing it open source!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Since leaving Australia (and started living in Europe) I have come to the conclusion that Australia is not a &#34;real&#34; country - it is just a continent owned by corporate interests that happens to also have people living on it.Corporate interests own the media, politicians, food production, education etc. and no one cares, because Life Is Good. Why expect anything to change, or people to care about strong democratic institutions, when there is no incentive for them to care about abstract concepts such as privacy or governmental oversight.Decades of bull markets, house price increases, a decline in public education, torpedoed communication infrastructure and complicit &#34;independent&#34; media has resulted in a wealthy, ignorant and complacent society who allow their representatives full control over their lives. It is not that they don&#39;t care about these issues, they are not even aware they are issues at all.But who cares, when you can go to the beach?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since 2015 and the meta data laws it’s no wonder things have continued to get worse.There was practically no opposition to the meta data laws. No popular resistance. No protests. It’s a non-issue for the public or political class.The extent to which non-tech people in my social circles care is to switch to signal. Not that they’ve stopped using the other tools.There seems to be a “what else can we do” attitude.Unfortunately, there is also no other party to vote for, as both major parties (liberal and labour) hold the same policies on ‘national security’."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Australian tech workers, get out get out get out get out…I can’t stress this enough. The Australian tech industry is a failing joke. You are being grossly underpaid. The country _is_ an authoritarian surveillance state and has been for years and years. The frog boiled and died years ago. Peace out, and find somewhere that will treat you well."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28143261">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A lot of the discussion here is treating impostor syndrome and qualifications as binary: You&#39;re either qualified or not. And your evaluation of your skills is either above your actual skills or not.But it&#39;s more nuanced than that.I&#39;m a Principal Engineer at a FAAMNG company. I have impostor syndrome all the time. Why? Because I measure myself against 1) role models that are ahead of me in many ways - I&#39;ve always done that, and it&#39;s how I grow, 2) against those with strengths in areas that I have weaknesses.I think my impostor syndrome is absolutely fact-based. I am not as good in the technical areas I care about as those I measure myself against.My fallacy is that there is a billion things that I am good at, but I don&#39;t consider them difficult (how could they be, if I am good at them), or I consider them insufficient to a fully rounded engineer, if I don&#39;t also have the skills that I know I&#39;m missing (but some of my peers are not).It doesn&#39;t help that I&#39;m the epitome of a &#39;Generalist&#39; - I&#39;m good at a lot of things, but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m the BEST at anything.I get lots of positive reinforcement - from my management chain, and from those more junior than me. But it never resonates. I always think &#34;damn, I&#39;ve actually fooled them all&#34;. And then I feel guilty that the management is putting so much trust in me, and that the juniors actually look up to a fraud.The only feedback that resonates is from my technical peers. Luckily I get this just often enough that I don&#39;t fall into a catatonic mess of anxiety. And sometimes I believe it..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I guess I just don&#39;t really believe this. It sounds nice, and it might even be a good falsehood to tell yourself for personal motivation—but that doesn&#39;t make it true.Yes, of course if you&#39;re an actual fraudster intending to commit fraud, you&#39;re probably comfortable with committing fraud. But feeling &#34;impostor syndrome&#34; colloquially means  second-guessing whether you&#39;re good enough to deserve your position.There are absolutely lots of people who are better at their jobs than they think they are. But I have to imagine there are also lots of people who are just as bad as they think they are, if not worse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The title is somewhat misleading, because it&#39;s talking about two different types of imposter.The &#34;imposter&#34; of &#34;imposter syndrome&#34; believes others didn&#39;t figure what they really are, that they&#39;re flawed, underskilled, will fail, etc. ; and that makes you somewhat of a fraud, i.e. an imposter, because they&#39;re secretly not the skilled person that was hired.The &#34;actual imposter&#34; from the &#34;imposter syndrome&#34; would be someone who actually lied about their skills and flaws, or at the very least don&#39;t have these skills. I don&#39;t know if these &#34;imposters&#34; have the imposter syndrome or not - but for the sake of argument I would assume that they have the same doubts as everyone else and that they do have imposter syndrome.The &#34;actual imposter&#34; who the author is mentioning is a con, someone who was secretly malfeasant and there for their own benefit. What&#39;s more is that from what the author is saying, they seem pretty skilled, and confident. So of course they don&#39;t have imposter syndrome: they fixed an organization, bring in money, their plan is going well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Kim Stanley Robinson&#39;s recent book The Ministry For the Future starts with a very disturbing scenario: A heatwave  with a &#34;web bulb&#34; temperature of 35 Celsius.It turns out, in those temperatures, even young and healthy people can&#39;t survive. Combined with power outages, as happens in the book, everyone living under such a heat wave will likely die.It&#39;s looking increasingly likely that such heatwaves are possible in the future, and possibly quite deadly. This could result in the mass deaths of many people, especially in poor tropical countries that don&#39;t have a stable infrastructure to cool most people during such a heatwave. I hope a mass death event from a &#34;web bulb&#34; 35C heatwave never happens, but I&#39;m losing hope, especially with the increasing global temperatures, and the very lackluster progress being made on carbon output."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are two cities in India that are pretty close by where this difference is very clear. Chennai is on the coast, while Bangalore is inland at a higher altitude while they’re both pretty much the same latitude.The difference in perception even if the dry bulb temperature is the same is insane. In Bangalore I can always find shade and it’ll be cool instantly, but in Chennai my whole body is always soaking wet, my clothes are drenched with my own sweat and I still feel like always about to faint.I used to take long walks during the day when I lived in Bangalore (it has other man made problems like traffic which are still irritating) but here I Chennai I can’t walk or jog outside even if I wanted to.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Similar question to this that I&#39;ve been wondering this wildfire season -- at what point is  AQI  (Air Quality Index) too severe for human tolerance? The scale tops out at 500, what happens to a person if the air is even worse than that?Some sensors near Medford, OR are reading in the upper 400&#39;s and even low 500&#39;s -- what happens if it hits what would be the  1000&#39;s if the scale went that high?I&#39;m mostly thinking of particulates, but AQI includes other gases like CO, SO2,  NO2 so maybe those would be more dangerous than particulates (and certainly harder to filter out)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s plenty wrong with Ethereum, but casting miners as &#39;the working class&#39; is a flawed analogy. The mercantile class would be closer to the mark. Notably, their hashing power is based in real world economic power and they extract an annuity from capital expenditure on mining operations and hardware.I also question whether miners are really providing the labour power, as you might expect the working class to do. They build the roads and keep the lights on but the means of production of value is (or ought to be) the services provided by those writing functionality that makes the network useful, i.e. the smart contract writers. Whether one thinks smart contracts on Ethereum have any value is another question but that was at least the vision.A move to proof-of-stake does not remove the role of miners/validators. Validators will still earn a reward from validating blocks. So it&#39;s not as if this &#39;class&#39; is being disenfranchised totally.Finally the social class analogy entails disjointness of classes, this is certainly not the case for miners, many of whom are major token holders, and some of whom are involved in governance (of course by miners we are taking about the humans controlling the mining rigs not the computers themselves)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Something here seems awfully similar to the system that crypto-currency was meant to fix. It was meant to eliminate rulers. It was meant to make everyone accountable for their actions. It was meant to reward the intelligent, the hard working and the capable, and not reward the incompetent, or the makers-yet-breakers of promises. However, this repeat of the broken old system seems to be playing out again.&#34;One response is that the promise was not well thought through. The idea was to replace &#34;rulers&#34; (human beings who make decisions to take care of a system) and &#34;law&#34; (written rules interpreted by humans) with code. But (a) code is written by humans who make mistakes; (b) the world changes, and systems need to update to respond to that; (c) somebody has to be responsible for dealing with a and b. As a result, currencies need central organizers to look after them. And those central organizers need to be motivated, i.e., paid. Old-fashioned currencies have sovereigns to back them, and the sovereigns are paid by the monopoly of taxation and/or the ability to issue money. Inefficient, but it works.From this perspective, bitcoin et al. look like technical solutions to social problems. In particular, bitcoin is designed to have nobody taking care of public goods problems on its behalf. That&#39;s a flaw![1][1] https://wyclif.substack.com/p/thought-bubble-defending-bitco..."</p>

I see no reason that this technology couldn&#39;t smoothly scale into human-level intelligence, yet lots of people seem to think it&#39;ll require a step change or is impossible.That being said, robust systematic generalization is still a hard problem.

We spent months developing a chatbot using GPT3 for our game and released a video showcasing it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnuSQvoroJo&amp;t=264sAfterwards OpenAI then added GPT3 chatbot guidelines disallowing basically anything like this.
We were in communication with them beforehand, but they decided later that any sort of free form chatbot was dangerous.What they allow changes on a weekly basis, and is different for each customer. I don&#39;t understand how they expect companies to rely on them"</p>

I mean, great that it works this well -- but program synthesis is one of those rare domains where you can observe exactly what the outcome is after you generate something. You can see execution traces, variable values, what the JIT produced, etc. And all of this is relatively cheap -- often executing a code snippet should be far cheaper than an extra pass through a giant DNN right? So it&#39;s fascinating to me that they train entirely from dealing with code as text.Imagine learning to develop recipes, not by ever cooking or eating or even seeing food, but only reading a giant library of cookbooks. Or learning to compose music but never hearing or playing anything -- only seeing scores."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a huge fan of TikTok because after years of content stagnation and dullness, the internet is fun again. Especially places like Twitter and Instagram are outrage and depression inducers for me, consumed together it feels like the society is collapsing but everyone is living a perfect life at the same time.The China thing is touchy but I want the west to beat them by being better, not by being dismissive and protectionist.I guess by now everyone has heard of their legendary discovery algorithm so I&#39;m not going there but recently I noticed that some of my favourite creators from the Youtube etc. are on TikTok and their material is much nicer to consume there. Why? I think this is because of the short and fast phased nature of the TikTok content. Instead of publishing 10 to 30 min videos(AFAIK Youtube encourages that, it is also good for the revenue), they put together a short video that shows the gist of the subject. They will also be much more responsive, quickly replying with short videos to the comments. It&#39;s a very dynamic place.One exception for me is Nile Red, I love watching his 40 min chemistry videos. Actually, there are a few more YouTubers who&#39;s content works best on YouTube but I&#39;m watching far less and I have more spare time now.Maybe the medium is the message still holds? Maybe people are now ready to hear the message of the TikTok?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like to think of TikTok as the crack cocaine of addictive social media. I used to think my dopamine receptors were burned out by the constant barrage of memes I received from reddit, Facebook and Twitter but TikTok proves they can refine that product to make it even more potent.When I visit reddit now it feels behind in the same way Facebook used to feel behind. Facebook&#39;s video feature (which they shove into my feed as the third or fourth card during scrolling) is 90% stuff stolen from and that I already saw a few days ago on TikTok. But absent their algorithm it isn&#39;t nearly as effective.I often have to remind myself how good TikTok&#39;s algorithm is. After using it for just a couple of days I can tell it knows more about me than I am comfortable with, even though I just scroll the FYP (For You Page) without logging into an account. The unbelievably narrow category of content it serves me clearly panders to my personality in a way that almost lets me believe I have a majority opinion. It creates a nearly perfectly personally tailored media bubble.A lot of people from my generation (Gen X) and even from the older Millennial&#39;s don&#39;t use it, thinking it is just for the kids. That is probably for the best. If you are susceptible to media addiction I suggest never downloading it. TikTok: Not Even Once."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of positivity in this thread, and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s entirely a bad thing, but I think TikTok is the worst of the social media platforms in terms of addictiveness, based on my peers.As a recent grad, so many of my friends are heavily invested in TikTok and have been since quarantine began, some of them for a bit before. The amount of time they spend there is absurd. Consuming 30 second content for three hours can&#39;t be good for concentration, right? It helps add to the &#39;always online&#39; mindset that has grown more popular with social media and smart phones.Instead of going for a walk, some of my friends would opt to lie in bed and watch TikToks, creating empty, basically non-existent connections with people across the world. Connections with people across the world are awesome, and one of the best things about the internet, but TikTok connections are basically UDP.Most TikTok content I&#39;ve been shown is shallow, the same way so much social media content is shallow. My having to get to the point immediately, we leave out key details and we want to catch your attention before you scroll away. Of course there is the other end of the spectrum with YouTube where a 2 minute tutorial takes 15 minutes.I try not to use much social media, and honestly, I probably should limit my time on HN more as well. Doom scrolling is a real thing, and TikTok is not immune to that. I&#39;ve seen plenty of dread inducing content that comes from TikTok as well.TikTok keeps you logged on, as it&#39;s supposed it. I just don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good thing. If you can control and limit your usage to something that&#39;s healthy for you, then I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a problem. For me though, that healthy limit is 0, because I know myself and I have little self control with social media in the past."</p>

It does this by partitioning data storage into one cookie jar per website, rather than using one big jar for all of facebook.com’s storage. With Enhanced Cookie Clearing, if you clear site data for comfypants.com, the entire cookie jar is emptied, including any data facebook.com set while embedded in comfypants.com.This seems exactly right: now that we have partitioned cookies, cookie clearing should clear cookies for the whole partition."</p>

I&#39;ve browsed the web like this for decades (since Opera 9, IIRC), and I had problems with at most 5 websites. YMMV, of course.In my opinion, the simplest way to deal with cookies is to disallow third party, and to keep a white list of authorized websites. Cookies outside this white list should be deleted manually or automatically after a few hours. Extensions for this probably exist, but I&#39;ve had bad experiences with extensions breaking or becoming intrusive, so I made my own where I hard coded the domains that I want to keep."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a big update for a relatively small community distro.  Kudos to the team.A summary of some of the cooler features:Performance:  General performance improvements on all hardware resulting from optimizing for Pinebook Pro and Raspberry Pi - namely, reducing and asynchronizing inter-process communication between desktop components, removing unused code, and reducing disk I/O.Firmware:  Linux Vendor Firmware Service now built-in, enabling firmware updates from within the OS.Flatpak:  all-in on flatpak, all AppCenter apps are flatpaks, as well as some Elementary apps like Web.Portals:  apps must explicitly request permission to get access to files or interact with other apps.  Can tweak these permissions in System Settings.Mail:  The Mail app now sandboxes html emails.Multi-Touch:  Extended from supporting just desktop to various apps now too.Multi-Tasking:  Better hot corners + new window and workspace controls.CalDav:  Tasks and Calendar now designed around the CalDav format, making importing and sharing of tasks and calendar items with other CalDav apps easier.Dark Theme:  system-wide, applies to GTK apps too.Terminal:  smart-paste protection extended from sudo pastes to multi-line pastes.More OEM/Vendor friendly:- Installer is simplified and streamlined - network connectivity, user account creation, and updates moved out of the installer and into the installed OS.  Better for vendors &amp; OEMs.- Startup is intentionally non-Elementary-branded, better enabling OEM/Vendor branded startup splash screen — &#34;we don’t need to constantly advertise your operating system to you&#34;.There&#39;s a separate blog post on hardware-specific improvements here:  https://blog.elementary.io/hardware-improvements-coming-to-e..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lots of comments asking what is &#34;Soviet/Russian Math&#34; actually like, and how is it different.I was lucky to get an education in three systems (Soviet Math, Romanian Math School (influenced by both French and Soviet Math school), and finally in a world top 40 university in North America.I would summarize the Soviet/Russian Math/Physics approach like this:  - understanding of the mechanism/intuition behind the equations/methods is paramount
  - teachers are astute at spotting students who memorize blindly, and will intervene to correct that
  - while rigorous about notation, the mathematical representation always comes after understanding, not before
  - the progression of teaching (order how material is introduced) is very well thought out
  - the old soviet textbooks are generally less verbose than North American ones (less fancy), but high quality in their expression, typesetting, and ESPECIALLY (!!!) the quality of the exercises
  - the Soviet Math textbook exercises are something to behold: they have funny/memorable setting (like jokes), they are short and easy to express, the numbers are chosen in such a way that the result will be a nice whole number, or pi, etc. Basically as a kid you can read one of those problems, lay down, close your eyes, and work on it in your head.

That being said, I did like some of the aspects from the so called &#34;Western Math&#34; (in my case Canadian university):  - teachers are more approachable, more friendly
  - textbooks can be gorgeous (nice colorful plots, etc)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I went through the Soviet/Russian school system with all the advanced topics being covered in high school as others described here. My moment of zen was on my third year in one of the top tech universities in Moscow. There were quite a few students coming from Novosibirsk University who were comfortably ahead of the curve when it came to math. When they showed their transcript (&#34;zachetka&#34;), they had ~3000 hours of Calculus in the first few years against our ~120... As they described it, each day after the usual roster of lectures and seminars, they would spend 4 hours in class in the evening solving math problems with a teacher. While we might have spent a few hours doing homework every now and then, it was nowhere near this. Not to mention doing it in class with a teacher who would likely also give them more challenging problems and valuable feedback. The sheer amount of time and mental effort was staggering."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a weird article. I think this idea of &#39;Russian math&#39; is very nebulous, and is probably used as marketing tool nowadays by some schools abroad. I have graduated from one of the top physics/maths high schools in Russia, and yes we had great math education there, but that was an outlier. Outside a handful of schools the math education is pretty dismal.
And even in the good math schools there are different ways of teaching maths. I.e. there is a famous system of &#39;sheets&#39; where the actual teaching of formal theory is very limited, while most of learning is done by solving problems (given to you on a sheet) and then presenting solutions to the teacher. But it wasn&#39;t used in our school for example.What definitely exists in Russia (or at least some big cities) is a system of free after-school classes, where you can go and learn how to solve olympiad-type math problems and become more interested in maths. That is definitely extremely useful to identify a few people who are talented in maths."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I live in a master planned community (Daybreak, Utah), and while you can definitely scoff at the building quality (state of things everywhere right now, it&#39;s all done fast and with low quality materials), it&#39;s been fantastic, especially during the pandemic.The whole neighborhood is designed to be walkable, with parks, pools, trails, train stations, grocery stores and restaurants (added in the later phases, which are being developed right now) within 5 minutes of your doorstep.It gets a bad rap from locals on the outside, but talk to the people living here (mostly expats from out of state) and nearly all of them say the same thing:&gt; &#34;We love it here!&#34;and&gt; &#34;Why aren&#39;t more communities built this way?&#34;I will say though, the US is poorly equipped for bicycle commuting. Even our neighborhood doesn&#39;t have many dedicated bike paths, opting instead to share the road with cars. Most diehard cyclists I know will tell you it&#39;s a matter of &#34;when&#34; not &#34;if&#34; you have a scary encounter with a driver. And with the amount of gigantic trucks on the roads out here that people use as their commuter cars, you can imagine these encounters don&#39;t typically end well."</p>

All I see is soulless pre-fabs. It looks like you&#39;re living in a shopping mall.2) The freedom to create buildings and institutions that are meaningful to the residents who reside there. Churches, schools, sporting clubs. Trusting the company behind this to provide for your every need is naive. Maybe it will work for some people. But will people want to move and raise children here?Creating one-off experiences is not the way to create the sustainable towns and cities of the future. This is like Airbnb taken to an obscene level. We should be designing car-free towns where people can buy property, design beautiful homes, participate in a small local economy, work locally and start small businesses, create the local institutions that their children and their children&#39;s children will participate in.

There is no way around this step.The defaults for the router also do not allow router access from the WAN port.This means:1) These routers all have secured passwords that are non-default.2) These routers were deliberately placed on the internet by people that knew enough about them to do so.Just because it&#39;s not how you would configure your router doesn&#39;t make it wrong. There are legit reasons to place a router on the internet, so long as it&#39;s secured properly... how else would you remotely manage a router at a different physical location, for instance.__Lastly__ click &#34;Next Page&#34; on the OP search results. The estimated 7,000+ results becomes 21. Many of which are HN aggregators reporting on this thread here.So... out of the possible millions of routers TP-Link has sold in this model line, less than 21 are on the public internet - many of which no longer load via IP address (indicating they are no longer publicly accessible), and the rest have professional CNAME&#39;s attached, indicating professional management.Nothing here..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Although NAFTA was heralded by the U.S. government for reducing barriers to trade, as The Counter previously reported, the pact devastated rural economies in Mexico, flooding the market with cheap, government-subsidized U.S. corn and gutting domestic corn prices by nearly 70 percent. This shift led an estimated 2 million farmworkers to abandon the countryside to seek work in big cities or across the border in the United States.&gt;On December 31, 2020, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador signed a decree that could enable Mexican farmers to reclaim their livelihoods within their home country. The order calls for the phase-out by 2024 of two pillars of American agribusiness: glyphosate and genetically engineered (GE) cornThe problem that US corn grown using high yielding strains is too cheap, so the solution is to ban growing high yielding strains domestically? I&#39;m not sure how that&#39;s going to work.The actual text of the decree is here: https://www.dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5609365&amp;fecha...The google translated version says nothing about banning genetically engineered corn, just banning glyphosate? The second order effect is that nobody buys RR corn seed, since you wouldn&#39;t bother spending more for it if you can&#39;t then use glyphosate to knock down weeds. But that&#39;s only for corn grown in-country. All the media coverage seems to think it&#39;s banning corn imports, which I believe would require repealing NAFTA."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I thought the main health problem with GMO crops (other than overzealous IP management and such) wasn’t even that they’re engineered - it’s that we engineer them to deal with heavy pesticide usage, proceed do so in a way that it’s impossible to clean out, and then consume that food.(and the insect apocalypse, but that’s an indirect effect on human health)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is just my impression, so do tell me if I&#39;m incorrect, but I always got the impression that those North American countries like Mexico and USA rely a bit too much on corn, to the detriment of a more diverse set of crops. Renewable fuel? Corn. Cattle food? Corn. Staple carb? Corn. Sweetener? Corn.Aren&#39;t they putting too many eggs in the same basket?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; One Google employee, who asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation, typically commutes to the Seattle office from a nearby county and would likely see their pay cut by about 10% by working from home full-time, according estimates by the company&#39;s Work Location Tool launched in June.&gt; The employee was considering remote work but decided to keep going to the office - despite the two-hour commute.This seems like a nice little meditation on the loss aversion heuristic. I doubt many people would accept a 25% increase in the amount of their time that&#39;s committed to work in exchange for a paltry 11% pay increase. But if you frame it as a 10% pay decrease in exchange for a 20% reduction in how much of your life is devoted to work, it suddenly becomes a lot less palatable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Class A office space in Manhattan is about $70/sqft, and the average office employee gets 150 sqft allocated (desk, hallway, conference room, supply closets...) Google is probably 170. That&#39;s $11900 annually that they save by not having an employee take up office space.No, it&#39;s not fungible on a small scale, but it&#39;s certainly fungible on a large scale: reduce your office needs by 100 people and you can rearrange desks and sublet that 17000 sqft.Google has other famous in-office benefits that cost per-person, so $12K per remote is a baseline savings. If Googlers had any collective bargaining power, they wouldn&#39;t be getting salary reductions: they would be getting extra expense money for desks, chairs, and ISP upgrades."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The cost of commuting on the environment is extremely high. We should be offering incentives to companies to switch to remote work. If 20% of jobs permanently switched to remote, the impact on carbon emissions would be immediate, and extremely positive."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If anyone actually believed it was &#34;code red for humanity&#34; they&#39;d be pushing nuclear power. There is zero chance of moving off carbon energy sources without causing catastrophic mayhem, unless we use massive amounts of nuclear.For instance, the last 4 years my state has averaged 37% production of total possible installed wind generation capacity. This is a very windy state which is in the top 2 for installed wind capacity and number one per capita. But throughout a day wind power can very from nearly zero to close to max capacity. Those periods of near zero production can last non-trivial amounts of time no realistic battery could provide for.The only solutions are continue with our gas turbine/wind power mix where we build enough gas turbines to handle 100% of the load for when the wind production is bottoming out, or replace everything with nuclear.Nuclear gets us to net carbon zero fastest and with technology easy to export to developing countries in desperate need of plentiful, reliable, cheap electricity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just. Tax. It.We have warmed the earth because we love comfort and money. We will never stop loving those things. So instead let&#39;s use the same systems to fix this (or at least slow things down).As an individual my largest carbon impact is air travel. I like to go places, it&#39;s one of the main things I work to afford. Every single plane ticket I take should have a tax which is used to offset or capture the carbon emissions of my flight. I will pay it. Anyone not willing to pay it will have to fly less. Any airlines that can&#39;t operate under the tax will not operate.Now do the same thing for corporate polluters, packaging waste, etc. If a country won&#39;t do this for domestic goods we can at least impose climate tariffs at borders.The only other thing that could work is some fantastic new technological solution, but let&#39;s not wait for that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s just so hard to know what actions have what impact on CO2 production. Some are high-pain, low-gain (switching devices off instead of standby?), some are opposite (cycling instead of driving when possible etc).For that if for no other reason, I’d rather if consumer prices included an explicit CO2 tax. The here can be a rebate for poorer people, or personal allowance, whatever, but there would be a fixed yardstick for measuring your personal impact.Off the top of my head, I have no idea which if my activities generates the most CO2. My car? Energy use? Diet? Going skiing once a year? No idea.Newspaper articles only help a little, they usually present an incomplete picture, and optimising against an incorrect utility function is often counterproductive.I’m imagining something like VAT, where “value added/carbon” adds up over the lifetime of product/service production."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This invasive capability on the device level is a massive intrusion on everyone&#39;s privacy and there will be no limits for governments to expand it&#39;s reach once implemented. The scope will always broaden.From the article:Apple’s choices in this case, though, go in the opposite direction: instead of adding CSAM-scanning to iCloud Photos in the cloud that they own-and-operate, Apple is compromising the phone that you and I own-and-operate, without any of us having a say in the matter. Yes, you can turn off iCloud Photos to disable Apple’s scanning, but that is a policy decision; the capability to reach into a user’s phone now exists, and there is nothing an iPhone user can do to get rid of it.A far better solution to the “Flickr problem” I started with is to recognize that the proper point of comparison is not the iPhone and Facebook, but rather Facebook and iCloud. One’s device ought be one’s property, with all of the expectations of ownership and privacy that entails; cloud services, meanwhile, are the property of their owners as well, with all of the expectations of societal responsibility and law-abiding which that entails. It’s truly disappointing that Apple got so hung up on its particular vision of privacy that it ended up betraying the fulcrum of user control: being able to trust that your device is truly yours."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; . Yes, you can turn off iCloud Photos to disable Apple’s scanning,so, Apple now has the ability to reach into every law abiding citizens personal phone - report them to the FBI when the algorithm makes mistakes (and it will - nothing is 100%, particular in image recognition), AND THEN THE PERPETRATORS CAN STILL GET AWAY BY JUST TURNING IT OFF??!??!?!My goodness, I couldn&#39;t imagine a stupider way to fight CSAM.&gt; Facebook made 20.3 million reports of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) in 2020.Were there 20.3 million arrests of offenders?  I don&#39;t think so. I doubt they caught 20 perps from that data.  While it may be a better algorithm, it should be a good warning of how often your&#39; very legitimate and non-CSAM data will be leaked to a &#34;verifier&#34;, and worse, to the authorities.Take a look at how often YouTube channels are taken down by &#34;auto triggers&#34; that are then &#34;reviewed&#34; and you will get a good idea of how often the government is going to screw law abiding citizens.  It&#39;s not zero, and imho, it will be well above a range of &#34;acceptable fallout&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; These efforts will evolve and expand over time.I have no doubt they will. Pandora’s box has been opened, and okay, today the scanning is only for images uploaded to iCloud, and only for CSAM. But that is not auditable and subject to change at any time without notice.And today it is only looking at known hashes but the devices already have a capability to analyse images and even run OCR on them, this is not a matter of of these things will be weaponised but when.Can’t believe this is the same Apple that publicly defended the right to privacy for known terrorists by using the slippery slope argument themselves. The mind boggles."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The scary thing about this is that many people have images that look like child porn at home: Family photos of naked grandchildren playing at the sea or in the mud, as well as sexting between consenting teenagers. There is no way automatic classification can distinguish these from real child porn, because they look almost identical and thus many private pictures will be shared with the government. This not only infringes the privacy of those people in the most drastic way possible, but might also lead to lawsuits that can tear families apart (think your father being accused of having CP only for it to turn out months later it was an old picture of yourself). The article mentions that 40% of CP investigations in Germany are started against minors (implied: through sexting), which shows that this concern is not purely theoretical at all.This was not an issue with the old approach of comparing checksums against public CP images, but it will increasingly be if we use more AI algorithms for this.EDIT: Probably Apples neural hashes that are currently in the news won&#39;t be vulnerable to this since they trained specifically to only detect changes in color/cropping/rotation. But we can&#39;t know for sure since the white paper is not that detailed and &#34;naked kid on beach&#34; photos all look really similar usually."</p>

Most European parties send unknown politicians to Strasbourg and let them vote on important topics with low media coverage. Later the local politicians - which act mostly in Bruessels - claim that they have no way but follow Strasbourgs/Bruessels decisions and write even worse state laws upon it.I think we need a new Europe state with a actual parliament in charge, which means the people there are accountable and in power. Without the Commission, Council and Presidency of Council[1]. Instead one actual parliament and one actual government. The Europeans state are integrated part of it, like elsewhere. Next the stuff can be fixed: We just need one army. And one social-security system with one economic policy. And one state department (foreign politics).Most politicians still think of Europe as a economy council but we people expect a sovereign country/state. The former &#34;economy council&#34; could solve economy related issues within Europe in the 1950s. But I think we have much bigger things to do.[1] I don&#39;t know how somebody can seriously use something like a rolling presidency.

The alternative is the key is derived from your iCloud password, in which case, if you forget your password, you lose all your data.Right now, you can browse your photos online. There&#39;s been no statement that this is going away. Implementing this functionality with E2EE backups seem highly problematic.These are huge changes to iCloud functionality that Apple would surely announce...There are many open questions.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s likely true, but quite probably even worse.A friend here in NSW Australia told me some years ago, while working at one of the larger coal-fired power plants we have, that emissions are measured on only one of the four stacks, and the results are then extrapolated.Obviously this was ripe to be gamed, which is precisely what happened.   Good coal (black, low-emission, cleaner-burning) was used to power that turbine, the other three turbines got the low-quality / high-emissions brown coal.Either way, studies like TFA rely on the accuracy of the data that different nation states collect and publish, and I seriously doubt the accuracy of much of those data."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I viscerally hate this title, because the top 5% of power plants probably also account for &gt;50% of electrical generation, and the entire exercise is dominated by how small of a plant counts for the statistics. If all the portable generators sitting unused in people&#39;s garages counted, I bet that 0.1% of &#34;power plants&#34; would be responsible for 99% of emissions, which would make a great headline but still wouldn&#39;t tell you anything meaningful about the world.I would love to know about how efficiency varies with plant size (are bigger plants more efficient?) but this study is _mostly_ just stating that bigger power plants produce more emissions in absolute terms, which should be obvious to pretty much anyone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The cheapest and most effective climate change intervention we could stage would be to get a few busses of activists and shut down the entry of workers and coal shipments into power plants, and to disable equipment.The EU has about 300 coal power plants.With 100 people at each, that&#39;s only 30,000 people.In 2019, 300,000 people joined the &#39;climate strike&#39; in the UK alone:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2019_climate_strikes....At this coal plant in Germany, just five people were able to shut it down for several hours, saving 26,000 tonnes of CO2:https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/04/no-regre...We could probably pull this off just with the backing and resources of a multi-millionaire, to pay someone to organise the activists, identify the locations and equipment, and to bail them out of jail and defend them in courts."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have encountered something similar to this for a submission that I reviewed for a scientific journal.  I will not list any names or give much detail past those generalities, but I pointed out that the authors were misusing a particular technical term. In my review I defined the term and explained it briefly.  I asked the authors to revise their submission accordingly.  The paper was not bad but the authors did not know English very well, so it was quite difficult to read.  That was its main problem.  However, when I received the revised submission, I noticed that the authors plagiarized my definition and explanation almost word for word (from my confidential review). I pointed this out to the editors and they said to just reject the paper with the stated reason being plagiarism, which I did.  The journal ended up rejecting the article, but I discovered it a few years later in a different journal.  The plagiarized section remained, but the authors swabbed out a lot my phrases for these kind of &#34;tortured phrases&#34;.That said, the authors did not fabricate their research (as far as I can tell).  They just did not know English well, so it was easier to just copy things that you know are phrased well than to learn to write English well.  As the saying goes, do not attribute to malice what can be explained by ignorance or laziness. That does not excuse it but it makes it more understandable.I agree with the article that this is probably just the tip of the iceberg.  There are likely many more lesser evils being committed with similar tools that are just much more difficult to spot.  I would not have noticed my particular example if I were not a reviewer for the paper, for example.  It makes me wonder how big the problem really is."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"NCMEC has essentially shows that they have zero regard for privacy and called all privacy activists &#34;screeching voices of the minority&#34;. At the same time, they&#39;re at the center point of a highly opaque, entrenched (often legally mandated) censorhip infrastructure that can and will get accounts shut down irrecoverably and possibly people&#39;s homes raided, on questionable data:In one of the previous discussions, I&#39;ve seen claims about the NCMEC database containing a lot of harmless pictures misclassified as CSAM. This post confirms this again (ctrl-f &#34;macaque&#34;)It also seems like the PhotoDNA hash algorithm is problematic (to the point where it may be possible to trigger false matches).Now NCMEC seem to be pushing for the development of a technology that would implant an informant in every single of our devices (mandating the inclusion of this technology is the logical next step that seems inevitable if Apple launches this).I&#39;m surprised, and honestly disappointed, that the author seems to still play nice, instead of releasing the whitepaper. The NCMEC seems to have decided to position itself directly alongside other Enemies of the Internet, and while I can imagine that they&#39;re also doing a lot of important and good work, at this point, I don&#39;t think they&#39;re salvageable would like to see them disbanded.Really curious how this will play out. I expect attacks either sabotaging these scanning systems by flooding them with false positives, or exploiting them to get the accounts of your enemies shut down permanently by sending them a picture of a macaque."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good article, however-&#34;Due to how Apple handles cryptography (for your privacy), it is very hard (if not impossible) for them to access content in your iCloud account. Your content is encrypted in their cloud, and they don&#39;t have access. If Apple wants to crack down on CSAM, then they have to do it on your Apple device&#34;I do not believe this is true. Maybe one day it will be true and Apple is planning for it, but right now iCloud service data is encrypted in the sense that they are stored encrypted at rest and in transit, however Apple holds the keys. We know this given that iCloud backups have been surrendered to authorities, and of course you can log into the web variants to view your photos, calendar, etc. Not to mention that Apple has purportedly been doing the same hash checking on their side for a couple of years.Thus far there has been no compelling answer as to why Apple needs to do this on device."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t see many people pushing back on the child pornography laws themselves that are the cause of this. I&#39;m stepping into a hornets nest by even bringing this up, because any criticism of the laws on the books makes one look they&#39;re a pedo, so I&#39;ll preface by saying, child pornography (filmed with actual kids) is vile and disgusting, but it is the production of it that is evil to be fought and suppressed, not the possession of it. Remember in the 90s, we had to deal with the Communications Decency Act I &amp; II, because every time they want to crack down on the internet, the excuse is always &#34;it&#39;s for the children!&#34; And pedophilia is the go-to excuse in a lot of circumstances.The CPPA had bans on virtual child porn (e.g. using look-alike adult actresses or CGI), that was overturned by SCOTUS, and then Congress responded with the PROTECT act which tightened up those provisions. These laws on possession are practically unenforceable with modern technology, peer to peer file sharing, onion routing, and encrypted hard drives.Thus, in order to make them enforcement, the government has to put surveillance at all egress and ingress points of our private/secure enclaves, whether it&#39;s at the point of storing it locally, or the point of uploading it to the cloud.While I agree with the goal of eliminating child porn, should it come at the cost of an omnipresent government surveillance system everywhere? One that could be used for future laws that restrict other forms of content? How about anti-vax imagery? Anti-Semitic imagery? And with other governments of the world watching, especially authoritarian governments, how long until China, which had a similar system with Jingwang Weishi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingwang_Weishi) starts asking: hey, can you extend this to Falun Gong, Islamic, Hong Kong resistance, and Tiananmen square imagery? What if Thailand passes a law that requires Apple to scan for images insulting to the Thai Monarch, does Apple comply?This is a very bad precedent. I liked the Apple that said no to the FBI instead of installing backdoors. I&#39;d prefer if Apple get fined, and battle all the way to the Supreme Court to resist this."</p>

Now it&#39;s all buried deep in and you have to search through the individual albums. Even the list of albums itself is not shown on the main artist page, you have to click &#34;See Discography&#34; first.The &#34;Home&#34; page is even worse. Where is my discover weekly playlist? Sometimes it&#39;s near the top, sometimes it&#39;s in this &#34;Made for you&#34; section.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It’s obvious. Every high-tech company has people called “Product Managers” (PMs) whose job it is to work with customers and management and engineers to define what products should do. No PM in history has ever said “This seems to be working pretty well, let’s leave it the way it is.” Because that’s not bold. That’s not visionary. That doesn’t get you promotedThis mentality isn&#39;t unique to product managers. Mobile developers and front-end developers increasingly don&#39;t want to work on technologies that are perceived as outdated, or even to work on someone else&#39;s code. Everyone wants to list new technologies and greenfield projects on their resumes.This was one of the biggest hiring challenges at my most recent large project: iOS developers wanted to rewrite everything in Swift. Android developers wanted to rewrite everything in Kotlin. Our web app was already written in React, but the web developers constantly wanted to refactor it to use the latest state management trend. When Hooks were introduced in React, we spent far too long arguing with developers who wanted to refactor all of the working code to use hooks instead.The bigger problem is that nobody wanted to work on someone else&#39;s codebase. Everyone wanted to work on greenfield projects and technologies that would look good on their resume going into the next job. Some of the most talented developers we hired were obviously only interested in using our company as a stepping stone to FAANG jobs (which didn&#39;t actually pay much more, but they were more prestigious on a resume so they wanted to switch).Blaming product managers is an easy out and will likely match popular opinion among people who aren&#39;t product managers, but the problem extends to development teams as well."</p>

Made by Sofa, Delicious Monster, SubEthaEdit, TextMate, Panic Inc, Rogue Amoeba, Strange Flavour. These were really great software studios that really upheld a standard of excellence for Mac software.But how are you supposed to keep that up when apple forces you into a marketplace that basically relies on customer handouts, where your only way to make profit on your 99ct app is to hit it so big, that your have several million customers.It&#39;s no wonder that there are no good apps anymore, we&#39;ve swamped the market with cheap cheap stuff, and nobody wants to pay for quality anymore.I&#39;ve recently switched from VSCode to Panics Nova, and for a very brief moment I felt like I was back in the old days of Mac Os X where things just worked, and where I felt at home with my OS, without constantly waiting for a better alternative to come along."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks like a giant variety of &#39;Pachyrhizus erosus&#39; or Jicama, which is also a street snack widely sold in Mexico. I&#39;v never seen ones as large as the one in the article, but the watery texture and how it&#39;s condimented (lemon, sugar, salt, chili powder) is exactly like Jicama. Seems wikipedia has a reference to ones as large as 2 meters and 20 kg https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachyrhizus_erosus so it may be like those tree trunk sizes in the article.It&#39;s not Agave. Agave roots are very fibery and dry, there&#39;s almost no moisture in them and you wouldn&#39;t be able to cut such thin slices like the article points out, agave roots are mashed up to start the Tequila process, here are some pics http://www.todomezcal.com/Elaboracion/molienda.htmlSource: I&#39;ve cut open both Agave and Jicama plants, I grew up in Mexico. You can find Jicama/(fruit) street vendors in most Mexican cities main streets or outside Mexico a mexican market is also a safe bet.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There’s something… different about how people (techie people are most of my sample) would write before the 00’s. I’m not sure if it has to do with the medium, or the constraints of the time, but reading it always fills me with something I can best describe as peace/nostalgia. The belief that technology honestly can change the world for the better and that the most influential people driving it have good motives instead of profit motives. And they were real visionaries most of the time. By contrast, anything seemingly after the dot com boom (I can’t draw a clear line, this is just throwing a dart) seems, I don’t know how to describe it. Too self-aware, too clever? It’s similar to the contrast between HN and other forums/social media out there. I’m not sure, but whenever an older article or something shows up, I usually enjoy it.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"From an old comment of mine on the topic:https://youtu.be/sKOk4Y4inVY?t=518 [1]1. &#34;In 1995, there was a debate at Harvard Law School – four of us discussing the future of public key encryption and its control. I was on the side, I suppose, of freedom. It’s where I try to be. With me at that debate was a man called Daniel Weitzner who now works in the White House making Internet policy for the Obama administration.On the other side was the then Deputy Attorney General of the United States and a lawyer in private practice named Stewart Baker who had been chief council to the National Security Agency, our listeners, and who was then in private life helping businesses to deal with the listeners. He then became, later on, the deputy for policy planning in the Department of Homeland Security in the United States and has much to do with what happened in our network after 2001.At any rate, the four of us spent two pleasant hours debating the right to encrypt and at the end there was a little dinner party at the Harvard faculty club, and at the end, after all the food had been taken away and just the port and the walnuts were left on the table, Stuart said, “All right, among us now that we are all in private, just us girls, I’ll let our hair down.”He didn’t have much hair even then, but he let it down.“We are not going to prosecute your client, Mr. Zimmermann,&#34; he said. “Public key encryption will become available. We fought a long, losing battle against it, but it was just a delaying tactic.” And then he looked around the room and he said, ”But nobody cares about anonymity, do they?&#34;And a cold chill went up my spine and I thought, all right, Stuart, and now I know you’re going to spend the next twenty years trying to eliminate anonymity in human society and I am going to try to stop you and we’ll see how it goes.And it’s going badly. We didn’t build the net with anonymity built in. That was a mistake. Now we are paying for it.&#34; -Eben Moglen"</p>

Restricting this comment to this period renders it irrelevant and signals that NASA is trying to avoid the issue.&#34;When the unexpected thruster firings occurred, flight control teams were able to enact contingency procedures and return the station to normal operations within an hour...&#34;So there&#39;s no need to be concerned over why it happened, how long it took to discover the problem, or the inability of those at NASA who discovered it to counteract it until the ISS was in a position where Roscosmos could intervene? As the article author points out, this &#34;all&#39;s well that ends well&#34; attitude is what led to the Challenger and Columbia crashes.&#34;We would point you to Roscosmos for any specifics on Russian systems/performance/procedures.&#34;So, NASA seems to be saying, it is not our problem - but, of course, anything that threatens the integrity of the ISS most definitely is.That covers the whole of NASA&#39;s response so far to IEEE Spectrum, other than the utterly anodyne &#34;We continue to have confidence in our partnership with Roscosmos to operate the International Space Station.&#34;What I would like to know is why public relations spokespersons think it is in the interests of their organizations to make those organizations look clueless, while simultaneously insulting our intelligence by implying we will fall for this nonsense?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here is a piece of commentary from a Russian insider covering the launch of Nauka, but not the docking, in Russian [1]. There was a litany of smaller issues with the launch, probably stemming from the fact that the module has been tossed around for 25+ years.I generally don&#39;t expect Roskosmos to make any comments regarding Nauka unless it blows up or something. Part of the reason, apparently, is that Roskosmos is being assessed for new funding (from the blog post, Google translate edited for clarity):&#34;&#34;&#34;Docking is scheduled for July 29. The future of Russian manned astronautics depends on its success. With Nauka, the Russian segment will be able to operate for another 10 years, and be more effective as a research platform.The future of the independent Russian Orbital Service Station (ROSS) is also indirectly related to the success of Nauka. With Nauka, Roskosmos gets a chance to show that it has the ability to create and launch manned space stations. This, in turn, increases the likelihood of obtaining the funding for ROSS.Probably, this is the reason that Roscosmos has been reluctant to voice any of the problems with Nauka. When half a trillion rubles is at stake, you will inevitably lose your voice.&#34;&#34;&#34;Half a trillion rubles is about $7bn American. I&#39;ve been hearing about plans for this new station for a few years now. I don&#39;t really know if it&#39;s real. Involvement with the ISS, where Americans shouldered 80% of the financial burden, is really what kept the Russian space program relevant. So I don&#39;t expect us to pull out of the ISS voluntarily. If the ISS ends up being decommissioned this decade, hopefully we can piggy back with the Chinese on their new projects or something. That&#39;s assuming we have anything they want, which is a big question mark come year 2030.[1] https://zelenyikot.livejournal.com/158629.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In principle I agree, but there&#39;s a lot riding against a proper, non-nasa investigation.1. No one died, unlike Columbia, there won&#39;t be a Congressional committee put together on this.2. Even if there was a congress committee/investigation done, what changes can actually be instituted? Block any more Russian modules?That&#39;s requiring putting pressure on a foreign country to make changes where the relationship runs a knife edge balancing act of frenemy.The Russian space program is a shell of its former self since ~2010.The most realistic course of action (at this moment) of any corrective recommendation is to remove them from the ISS. They&#39;ve been threatening pulling out for a few years now, so let them?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"No, the space being shown here remains entirely flat.  There is length contraction and time dilation at play, but that’s a uniform effect.  The reason the image appears distorted is because we have more time to catch up to light rays emitted from farther away.  This visual phenomenon is called Terrell rotation.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrell_rotationIt’s based entirely on special relativity—not to be confused with general relativity, which deals with curved spacetime in the presence of gravitational fields."</p>

It includes effects like Doppler shifting of colors, perceived warping of space and time dilation. Good luck at not getting nauseous.[0] http://gamelab.mit.edu/games/a-slower-speed-of-light/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something I found very interesting when I learned about it several years ago: it&#39;s possible to formulate SR and GR with the Euclidean (++++) metric instead of the Minkowski (+---) or (-+++) metric. Such a formulation (there is a variety of them) is sometimes called Euclidean Relativity (ER).See: https://www.euclideanrelativity.com/Some ER research is particularly fascinating to me, e.g. Montanus&#39; work on Flat Space Gravitation:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10701-005-6482-0   A new description of gravitational motion will be proposed. It is part of the proper time formulation of physics as presented on the IARD 2000 conference. According to this formulation the proper time of an object is taken as its fourth coordinate. As a consequence, one obtains a circular space–time diagram where distances are measured with the Euclidean metric. The relativistic factor turns out to be of simple goniometric origin. It further follows that the Lagrangian for gravitational dynamics does not require an interpretation in terms of curvature of space–time. The flat space model for gravitational dynamics leads to the correct predictions for the bending of light, the perihelion shift of Mercury and gravitational red-shift. The new theory is free of singularities."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think back to how we have responded to this pandemic.  We were in denial until the pandemic was spreading unchecked wildly through the population, and even a good chunk of the population is still in denial after 100,000s of dead.We are a hopeless species when it comes to organizing effective collective action ahead of known disaster.  We seem to only respond collectively once disaster has struck, and even then it takes time.I read a book in 1997 that was about this.  Can not remember the name or author of it for the life of me.  It was about climate change and the risk that North Atlantic currents would shift causing a state change that would be hard to reverse.  24 years later we think it is getting closer, but we still do not act swiftly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I often hear that as individuals we can&#39;t really be held responsible for climate change and that instead we should look to our government to impose laws that restrict carbon output.This made me curious: what is the &#34;fair&#34; amount of carbon dioxide that the average individual can emit? According to this article[1][2] published in Nature it looks like the answer is 1.61 metric tons of CO2/year.That strikes me as close-to-impossible for industrialized nations to achieve. A round-trip flight from NYC to SF emits 1.5 metric tons per passenger. In order to reach 1.61 metric tons an individual would not be able to own a gas-powered car, could not regularly consume meat, could not live in remote areas only visitable by plane etc. Many things people don&#39;t even consider &#34;luxuries&#34; (like visiting family overseas) would be a non-starter.In France they implemented a modest fuel tax and they got the Yellow Vest Protests[3] in response. I can&#39;t see the average individual ever voting for a party that wouldn&#39;t let them visit family and nearly eliminate meat consumption.As China, India and Indonesia have industrialized their per-capita emissions have shot up well above these levels as well. I imagine the same thing will happen with African nations over the next 25-50 years.I don&#39;t really see any way out of this other than some miraculous technological breakthroughs like solar powered planes which I understand to be near-impossible with today&#39;s technology.[1] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-018-0021-4[2] https://sci-hub.se/https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-01...[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_vests_protests"</p>

He was not Thomas Castleberry.They are saying he is not allowed to get the documents for the case which he was the main suspect and subsequently hospitalized for since the documents for the case is for the other person.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Honestly I&#39;m glad to see a non-insignificant amount of people in tech take this seriously, especially when the goal Apple announces appears to be for the greater good. It can be hard to stand on the side that doesn&#39;t immediately appear to be correct. We have already lost so many freedoms for &#39;national security&#39; and other such blanket terminology.Just be warned, there will be those that unfairly try to cast this as helping the distribution of CP. Expect a headline tomorrow: &#34;Edward Snowden et al Supports Child Porn&#34; - or some other hot take.A few other things:1. Vote with your feet - Put your money in the pockets of the people aligned to your values.2. Actively support projects you align with - If you use some open source hardware/software, try to help out (financially or time).3. Make others aware - Reach out to those around you and inform them, only then they can make an informed choice themselves."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related but slightly off-topic: am I the only one that thinks more technology is not the answer to catching crooks?
 Can’t the police do good old fashioned police work to catch people doing these things?
Why does EVERYONE need to be surveilled for the 0.01% (or less?) who don’t behave properly.
To further this point: why do we need cameras on every street, facial recognition systems and 3-letter orgs storing huge data silos and maintaining lists etc etc…
One thought: is it because over 10, 20, 30+ years the police have been de-funded everywhere and become useless for difficult cases and/or militarised to deal with peaceful protesters instead?
Genuine questions.. I just don’t think this surveillance nightmare is the answer, and police could still catch crooks before the internet so what’s the problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, if I understand correctly, the NCMEC provides a bunch of hashes of CSAM for Apple to match. This way Apple doesn’t get exposed to the content of images themselves? Then Apple will provide a user’s details plus the IDs of matching content. This identifies the direction of travel for any CSAM content?So, now NCMEC and any local NCMEC can provide new hashes and identify – possibly even historically – the epicentre of the distribution of a group of images.Except, if Apple only gets the hashes, what’s to stop a bad actor in a NCMEC from providing non CSAM images to Apple for other purposes?Seems like this technology should be illegal without a warrant. It’s a wire tap."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well, buried in the middle of this article is an important point:&gt; In fact, as of the fall 2019 semester, Gerber had been officially enrolled only at the university in China, not at St. Gallen.So he was a Swiss person doing a PhD at a Chinese university. His relationship with the professor at the Swiss university was an unofficial one, so the word &#39;dismissal&#39; here is pretty misleading. No information about what happened to his actual PhD program at the Chinese university that I noticed.The actual evidence of chinese influence?&gt; She said she had received a message from a Chinese doctoral student doing research at a Canadian university.So, it sure sounds like some people had their feelings hurt.My totally made-up hypothesis on this article: honest reporter researched a story, realised it was pretty weak, then when they wrote it up shuffled things around a bit to give an exaggerated impact, but couldn&#39;t bring themselves to lie or leave out any facts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an article spun to make controversy out of nothing.The narrative is that a student tweeted something critical about China, and the CCP pressured his advisor into dropping him.The reality is that the student published a tweet that &#34;depicted a comic character that had been altered and had stereotyped Chinese features, with yellow skin tone and slit eyes&#34;. This understandably was perceived as racist by a Chinese student in Canada, who complained to the advisor. The advisor agreed and dropped her racist-seeming doctoral student.The CCP wasn&#39;t involved. Nobody cared about his criticism of China. It was his racist-looking tweet that got him dismissed.Edit: But yes, the CCP can have a chilling effect on free speech. See the Blitzchung controversy. This article is just a non-story."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The professor should be fired and the university punished (doubtful), but the student was also an idiot to do what he did. It’s not like he was some random guy who just tweeted at China, he lived in wuhan for years and has actual family there now, being critical of a totalitarian government in that scenario is the height of monumental stupidity. It’s ironic that the article paints him as methodological and thoughtful because he seems anything but in his actions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Apple&#39;s mistake is that they seemingly believe there is pushback because people misunderstand how it works. The reality is more nuanced: People understand exactly how it works, and how it works is that it is turn-key onboard spyware, that Apple pinky-swears isn&#39;t being used wrong today.For example if the scope/mission expands (e.g. foreign governments), suddenly you&#39;ve created a drag-net for whatever &#34;badness&#34; is of interest in whatever today&#39;s moral panic is (e.g. terrorism after 9/11). Plus perceptual hashing, by its very design, is created to be less precise than traditional cryptographic hashing.A cryptographic hash + file size combo is unlikely to have a false positive within our lifetime (and it has been used successful by multiple companies to combat CP). The interesting thing about a perceptual hash is that the closer the source material is to the banned material in terms of actual content (e.g. nudity), the more likely for a false positive.Therefore, if Apple does mess up via false-positive and manually review your material, it is more likely to be sensitive private materials (involving consenting adult(s), not CP) because that is what the perceptual hashes are looking for similarities to.PS - If you think this concept cannot happen in a Western country, see the UK&#39;s internet filters as a textbook example. Originally started to fight CP, and now used to fight a ton of other stuff too with more proposals every year: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_blocking_in_the_United_Kin..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Take a close look at the way this works. If there are enough hash matches, Apple apparently gets to look at all the pictures on the phone. The description says &#34;threshold reached, all content visible and unlocked&#34;. &#34;All&#34;, not &#34;Matched&#34;.Matches can be forced from the outside, by sending pictures to the phone. They don&#39;t even have to be from the known-bad image set. Using an adversarial system to try to create hash matches might allow generating innocuous pictures which trigger a phone dump.Expect a toolset for doing that to be developed. Although it may take a while for word of it to leak out. This has applications for entrapment, swatting, political retribution, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unfortunalty if our experience from the past with such events teaches us anything, it&#39;s that a minority of us will stop using apple products (or keep not doing it) but the rest of the world will quickly forget and carry on as usual.Worse, if your decision to not use an iphone makes others people life slightly anoying for 2 seconds a week, many will bash on you.As a FOSS user with no FB nor whatsapp account that ask to avoid photos to be taken of him with smartphones, I can tell you I pay regularly the price the price for what I think is doing the right thing. It&#39;s just easier to let the abuse go on.And we have other fights in life. I didnt pick up smoking (pot of cigarets), stopped drinking alcohol, became vegetarian. They all come with social challenges. Add then you have your familly, job, health and goals that needs your care, attention and time.At some point you just want to say &#34;screw them&#34;, create your own bubble of freedom and let them enjoy their distopia. Except we kind of live in it, don&#39;t we?I&#39;m usually an upbeat person but these types of event arrive in a never ending stream, and today I feel tired."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sometimes I think Americans don’t know how badly they want this.Americans will tell you how wonderful European cities are with their small streets and their public squares filled with great restaurants. They think we don’t have cities like that because we’re lacking some fundamental European-ness.No. We just put cars everywhere. Cars ruin everything. Now you have wider streets. Louder streets. More dangerous streets. Far less foot traffic which means very low chances of discovering a new favorite place. You have lower business density which totally changes the economics of an entire neighborhood. Etc.In this and so many other things Americans say they want what they see elsewhere but are uninterested in doing anything about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Add up the roads, parking spaces, parking garages, gas stations (not to mention auto shops, drive thrus and car washes) and the total urban footprint is a gargantuan 50-60% by many calculations. That&#39;s not automatically a bad thing, especially if you are a car, but all of that space creates massive buffers separating all of the other stuff that humans want to walk to. To make it worse, those buffers are far and away the most dangerous thing in any urban environment.On the bright side, the pandemic seems have enabled many cities to finally reclaim some of that car land for use by people. Though it&#39;s not clear how long that will last."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like my car and I like driving.That said, I don&#39;t like driving _everywhere_. When I moved to university, it was incredibly freeing to just be able to walk somewhere I wanted to go rather than getting in my car and driving miles to get anywhere. I grew up in a suburb in Texas so walking anywhere except _maybe_ a friend&#39;s house was entirely out of the question.I visited Portland recently and it was lovely to be able to get around the whole city without a car. We didn&#39;t rent one, save for one day when we went &gt; 100mi out of the city. No Ubers, no Lyfts- just walking, buses, and lightrail.Just my experience as an American."</p>

We are constantly balancing a bunch of different considerations with regards to the way that we compute, purchase devices, and utilize services. Security and privacy are of course important, and Apple to date has had a fairly good (if shallow) track record in this regard, at least in the United States.With that being said, what Apple is doing here is just a blatant violation of that &#39;trust&#39; and certainly a compromise to their commitment to privacy. Under no circumstances is it justifiable to essentially enlist people&#39;s devices to police their owners, while using the electricity that you pay for, the internet service you pay for, and the device itself that you pay for to perform a function that is to absolutely no benefit to the user and in fact can only ever be harmful to them.It doesn&#39;t matter that the net data exfiltrated by Apple ends up being the same as before (through scanning unencrypted files on their servers). The distinction is so obvious to me that I find it incredible that people are legitimately arguing that it&#39;s the same, or that it in some way this is actually helping preserve user privacy.As mentioned in the article, this does absolutely nothing towards protecting children other than directing all but the biggest idiots towards platforms that can&#39;t be linked to them, which I&#39;d imagine, they already are."</p>

So here’s a serious one: if you get locked into a prestigious institution under someone like this, run.EDIT: I should have known this would turn into a sub thread about whether it’s ok to demand an AI researcher brief an executive on Russian political history.Here’s another one: gossiping about firing someone across the entire office, before you fire them. This article says he did that. I recommend reading through it. I have to go move into our house now, so I can’t paste everything. Suffice to say, the behavior patterns were not productive.I think people want to recognize DeepMind’s eventual success.

It shouldn&#39;t cost too much more but will make your life a lot easier as you try to expand globally.  That was one thing that slowed Netflix&#39;s global expansion -- a lot of the content was not globally licensed.You will have to develop a very robust system for identifying a user&#39;s location based on IP address as well as advanced proxy detection.  Maybe not at first, but as you move up into more &#34;Hollywood&#34; productions they will require you to show that you are protecting their content from theft.  You will also have to show that you are encrypting everything with DRM, or they won&#39;t license content to you.Don&#39;t try to stream your video from AWS.  Netflix uses AWS as the control plane but built their own CDN, and some of how they build it is publicly available:  https://openconnect.netflix.com/en/appliances/. Before they built their own CDN, they used Akamai and Level 3.Try to build your system for future white label resale.  If you&#39;re successful, maybe some Asian or Hispanic filmmakers will be interested in a platform focused on their needs.  If you build it for white labeling you could potentially resell it for them (this is how HBO started streaming, by buying what MLB had built).Here are the Netflix black content categories that I know about, but there could be more:https://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/81299227https://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/81305957Good luck!  It&#39;s a hard space to compete in, and if Netflix starts to notice you I can see them trying to copy you, but hopefully you&#39;ll be big enough by then to fend them off!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Strategically, are you trying to be a brand, a studio, a platform, an marketplace, or maybe all the above? I think the question I have is what to try to build first.As a brand, I see you trying to become a trusted provider of content for an underserved black-identifying audience with diverse tastes. To build brand first, I wonder if you don&#39;t want to put BlackOak-curated content out on existing media platforms. That could be #BlackOakRecommends on twitter.As a studio, and one competing with other producers, how will you differentiate yourselves to content creators? I guess that starts with the ability to get one&#39;s content in front of subscribers, but is there something beyond audience (which you are building), and money (which you are growing), that you can offer creators? Maybe that is access to and information about audience.As a platform, you are starting with UScreen.tv, and categorically the questions I have are how does your consumption experience road map and analytics &amp; recommendations road map line up with theirs? How will you be able to deploy your own tech relative to theirs? Analytics might differentiate you. Netflix reportedly does not share much. How might you be able (through analytics) to inform creators about audience response through your platform?  Can you use analytics uniquely to reinforce and maintain the trust of your audience - e.g., when the platform recommends a video or creator to a user, be able to answer the user&#39;s question &#34;Why am I seeing this?&#34;As a market place, you are an intermediary between content consumers and content creators. How do they to find each other and be rewarded from that - how users browse and how you recommend would be central. Maybe you license curator channels on your site. Perhaps that is in part potentially how you are able to connect creators directly to audiences, i.e. like hosted artist&#39;s pages. Perhaps the &#34;BlackOak artist&#39;s page&#34; is the place that consolidates an artist&#39;s identity, catalog and channels - twitter, instagram, twitch, etc - vs the artist&#39;s own page, youtube channel, weebly, etc. So, that&#39;s MySpace, of yore, on BlackOak.If there&#39;s a theme to all this, I would say it is how to make consumers, curators, and creators more visible in relation to a consumption experience. Ideas are cheap! good luck with everything."</p>

I also cannot stand its trackpad.  Is there any linux-capable device with an okay trackpad?* On phones: are there any capable phones out there that aren&#39;t privacy nightmares?  All I want is a phone with a long lasting battery that I can use with maps, a web browser, and texting.* On cloud: I&#39;ve considered executing on a NAS forever, but I&#39;m unsure where to start."</p>

Should the internet be a free for all place without moderation? Where are the boundaries for moderation (if it has to exist), one-on-one versus group chat, public versus private chat?To quote this open letter: “Apple is opening the door to broader abuses”. Wouldn&#39;t not doing anything open a different door to broader abuse?Edit: I would really love an actual answer, since responses until now have been &#34;but muh privacy&#34;. You can&#39;t plead for unlimited privacy and ignore the impact of said privacy.

This means &#39;no privacy&#39; feeling. Everyone is more &#39;careful&#39; when people around. And this has prolonged effect on society&#39;s freedom, democracy and rights of individual because independent thinking happens when true privacy is there.Even a fear of false triggering the system and exposure of one&#39;s private thoughts/pictures/events to other people during &#39;sorting out false alarm&#39; would make people behave differently. Even if they have nothing to do with any children the fear that their private moments can become public just because some AI would decide so would make each person think twice about each step.This is a huge attack on privacy of individual and should not be taken lightly. The effect will be also huge. Just imagine what they will do next if they get away with this. Just imagine what other companies will do once this is accepted for apple devices.I think this can/should also be considered as a fraud because when one bought apple device one was never told that spyware would be installed some day later.Edit: I think it should be illegal/made illegal to install any spyware on any device for any excuse without warant. Spyware is a Search of &#39;home&#39; without warrant to some degree, isn&#39;t it? Done through the hands of some private company under some excuse...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Im really starting to develop a visceral hatred for Apple.They are talking sanctimoniously about privacy out of one end of their mouth, put on a family friendly face by banning anything offending prude sensibilities, while having no qualms about doing as much business as they possibly can in China. Now this.They are the ultimative dystopian corporation, I find them even worse than Facebook in that regard, at least Facebook has some interest in free speech and does not operate in China.I guess the reason I am so angry is that I like the devices and engineering marvels they can produce. But I cannot be a customer of this."</p>

I reinstalled LineageOS with https://opengapps.org added during the install and made the mistake of transferring from my old phone which brought all the google services and everything back to the phone (mostly).I then installed CalyxOS - much easier install process than lineage. Really liked the defaults. Could not get many apps that relied on google play services though. If I didn&#39;t need so many Google-tied apps I would pick this as my phone OS for basic stuff like messaging and browsing.Installed LineageOS again, found there were a couple apps I could not get working after all (50 different apps installed).In the end I gave up and re-flashed Google firmware back onto the phone. I spent about 10 hours on all this stuff and simply ran out of time for now. I though I could get away from Google but I didn&#39;t realize how much my apps needed Google."</p>

We share some bits of code between our projects here: https://github.com/AOSPAlliance.If anyone is interested in building their own custom android OS in the cloud (AWS) with same ability to lock your bootloader like CalyxOS, you can checkout my project I&#39;ve been maintaining for a few years now called RattlesnakeOS: https://github.com/dan-v/rattlesnakeos-stack.And if you prefer to not build in the cloud, there is also a really great project called robotnix (https://github.com/danielfullmer/robotnix) which provides a way to build many flavors of OS (AOSP, GrapheneOS, LineageOS, etc)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you&#39;re unfamiliar with the context: Calyx Institute is a 501(c)(3) with a digital privacy and security mission. For a while they&#39;ve offered, for a few hundred dollars a year donation, unmetered access to sprint&#39;s network. I don&#39;t know the details but I think they have retained access to the network through the merger due to some non-profit provision (something like the sprint merger was allowed with stipulation that certain agencies using the network for certain purposes would be grandfathered over). There&#39;s apparently more history related to the founder previously running an ISP under gag order, which drives their mission.Access to the network is only possible through wifi pucks. I asked if I could register the IMEI of my ThinkPad&#39;s modem/radio, but they wouldn&#39;t allow it citing the usual &#34;we are responsible for the behavior of the devices on the network so you have to use our certified device&#34;. Sadly, these phones do not participate in Calyx&#39;s data network, they require a traditional carrier. Maybe it&#39;s part of their roadmap to eventually offer their data services on these handset form factor devices? But until then, I don&#39;t see a huge point.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have to say, LÖVE 2d holds a special place with me because it&#39;s the first &#39;real programming game engine&#39; (as in language only no accompanying ide or such) I ever actually developed anything that I would consider a fully fledged completed program I made entirely by myself with.This looks pretty awesome and all but I can&#39;t see the benefits over something like unity or unreal or the amazing for the cost and features Godot.I really like Lua. I&#39;ve always recommended it to beginners or anyone curious about programming for fun over every other language. I&#39;ve used it myself extensivelyBut in this day and age, I can&#39;t really see recommendating this or even LÖVE2d anymore to anyone interested in getting into game programming.There&#39;s just too many high quality alternatives these days."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is cool, but I find it hard to find any use case for it. I did plenty of work as an indie game dev in the past, shipped and made money out of games based on my own C++/OpenGL game engine and also shipped a few indie games with some external indie game engines. Then I moved away from gamedev, but recently started playing around with Unreal engine again and was blown away by how much Unreal does for you. It felt like with Unreal engine, game dev is mostly about art and game design and not so much about programming anymore. Given game dev has become so much more competitive and harder to do than in the old days, and the fact that you can get a AAA game engine like Unreal for free (and only 5% royalty after 1-5M in sales), it doesn&#39;t make any sense to use anything else other than Unreal/Unity IMO."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This framework is what I use for most of my hobby projects. There are some videos here: https://twitter.com/j_miskovI went through Unity and Godot before picking it up. I like LOVR because it&#39;s so code-based, with boring boilerplate parts hidden away. I&#39;m no artist and I prefer simple code editor to full engine IDE. The Lua API is easy to understand and remember, and even the framework code is simple to read and modify as needed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here, thanks for posting.Here&#39;s some more color on the reflection on comments, straight from the Linux Kernel documentation that capture my intention much better:&#34;Comments are good, but there is also a danger of over-commenting. NEVER try to explain HOW your code works in a comment: it’s much better to write the code so that the working is obvious, and it’s a waste of time to explain badly written code.Generally, you want your comments to tell WHAT your code does, not HOW. Also, try to avoid putting comments inside a function body: if the function is so complex that you need to separately comment parts of it, you should probably go back to chapter 6 for a while. You can make small comments to note or warn about something particularly clever (or ugly), but try to avoid excess. Instead, put the comments at the head of the function, telling people what it does, and possibly WHY it does it.&#34;[0][0] https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.h..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree with almost all of these viewpoints. The comment one though isn&#39;t quite right.Sometimes you just need a comment. For example, I was writing some code to an API and the company was offering a private experimental feature. The API was JSON, but this one feature was enabled by adding a small stringified JSON object to a field of the larger JSON post body. If a developer looks at it, they&#39;ll think &#34;this must be wrong&#34; but with a comment that briefly mentions why, everyone will be saved some time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Know when to break the rules. For rules like &#34;don&#39;t repeat yourself,&#34; sometimes a little repetition is better than a bit of dependency.Glad to see DRY called out here. I&#39;ve seen so much crazy code simply to avoid breaking, The Rule."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So I was scratching my head for a good couple of minutes trying to figure out how this works, being familiar only with HTTP Response Splitting/HTTP Cache Poisoning.So it seemed that somewhere along the years while I haven&#39;t been paying any attention to websec, it became a common practice to send requests from different clients through the same TLS connection. And due to the non conforming way HTTP 2/1.1 interop was implemented by these webservers/load balancers request boundaries were not delimited correctly, making it possible to inject requests on behalf of followup clients.Fine I get the issue. Sounds like another &#34;good enough&#34; optimization that backfired.What is the solution aside from playing the patching wack-a-mole game? Should maybe a HTTP2.1 protocol work without a strict TLS requirement so that protocol downgrades aren&#39;t necessary to squeeze out extra performance (unless I misunderstand why the HTTP2/HTTP1.1 bridge was in place). Or is the problem that some application servers still don&#39;t support HTTP2 out of the box?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems most of the vulnerabilities here (at least, the first several that I read in the article) come at a point where an HTTP/2 request is transformed into an HTTP 1.1 request. So the insecurity seems to come at the point where a translation occurs and there is redundant information that can be handled in several ways, meaning that there&#39;s lots of room for bugs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"@albinowax_, can you say anything more about how widely you have investigated the prevalence of the &#34;H2.X via Request Splitting&#34; vulnerability?Although all of your attack vectors are fascinating, this seems to be the one which is particularly terrifying. It seems like one single request can basically mess up user authentication across an entire website, and for every active user, until the server becomes resynchronized somehow. If I were running a large public-facing site or application, checking for this vulnerability would be my #1 priority this morning."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been maintaining a spare phone running lineage os exactly in case something like this happened - I love the apple watch and apple ecosystem, but this is such a flagrant abuse of their position as Maintainers Of The Device that I have no choice but to switch.Fortunately, my email is on a paid provider (fastmail), and my photos are on a NAS, I&#39;ve worked hard to get all of my friends on Signal. While I still use google maps, I&#39;ve been trialing out OSM alternatives for a minute.The things they&#39;ve described are in general, reasonable and probably good in the moral sense. However, I&#39;m not sure that I support what they are implementing for child accounts (as a queer kid, I was terrified of my parents finding out). On the surface, it seems good - but I am concerned about other snooping features that this portents.However, with icloud photos csam, it is also a horrifying precedent that the device I put my life into is scanning my photos and reporting on bad behavior (even if the initial dataset is the most reprehensible behavior).I&#39;m saddened by Apple&#39;s decision, and I hope they recant, because it&#39;s the only way I will continue to use their platform."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember an Apple conference where Tim Cook personally assured us that Apple is fully committed to privacy, that everything is so secure because the iPhone is so powerful that all necessary calculations can happen on the device itself, and that we are &#34;not the product&#34;. I think the Apple CEO said some of this in the specific context of speech processing, yet it seemed a specific case of a general principle upheld by Apple.I bought an iPhone because the CEO seemed to be sincere in his commitment to privacy.What Apple has announced here seems to be a complete reversal from what I understood the CEO saying at the conference only a few years ago."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m really conflicted about this.For context, I deeply hate the abuse of children and I&#39;ve worked on a contract before that landed 12 human traffickers in custody that were smuggling sex slaves across boarders. I didn&#39;t need to know details about the victims in question, but it&#39;s understood that they&#39;re often teenagers or children.So my initial reaction when reading this Twitter thread was &#34;let&#39;s get these bastards&#34; but on serious reflection I think that impulse is wrong. Unshared data shouldn&#39;t be subject to search. Once it&#39;s shared, I can make several cases for an automated scan, but a cloud backup of personal media should be kept private. Our control of our own privacy matters. Not for the slippery slope argument or for the false positive argument, but for its own sake. We shouldn&#39;t be assuming the worst of people without cause or warrant.That said, even though I feel this way a not-small-enough part of me will be pleased if it is deployed because I want these people arrested. It&#39;s the same way I feel when terrorists get captured even if intelligence services bent or broke the rules. I can be happy at the outcome without being happy at the methods, and I can feel queasy about my own internal, conflicted feelings throughout it all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So if I understand correctly, they want to scan all your photos, stored on your private phone, that you paid for, and they want to check if any of the hashes are the same as hashes of child porn?So... all your hashes will be uploaded to the cloud? How do you prevent them from scanning other stuff (memes, leaked documents, trump-fights-cnn-gif,... to profile the users)?Or will a huge hash database of child porn hashes be downloaded to the phone?Honestly, i think it&#39;s one more abuse of terrorism/child porn to take away privacy of people, and mark all oposing the law as terrorists/pedos....also, as in the thread from the original url, making false positives and spreading them around (think 4chan mass e-mailing stuff) might cause a lot of problems too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s funny to see anyone here could find this acceptable. I wonder what&#39;s comments would be after Apple start to scan phones for anti-censorship or anti-CCP materials in China. Or for some gay porn in Saudi Arabia.Because you know in some countries there are materials that local government find more offensive than mere child abuse. And once surveillance tech is deployed it&#39;s certainly gonna be used to oppress people."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Cuomo also sent thousands of elderly people to their deaths by forcing them back into nursing homes.And yes, I mean forcing.Do you remember the hospital ship?  The field hospitals?  Javits center?Did you know the hospital ship went home after being almost completely unused?  Did you know it treated IN TOTAL 182 people?  With a crew of 1200 and 1000 available beds?Did you know that javits center never even got remotely close to full?  In TOTAL in treated about 1000 patients and had 4000 beds.And yet he’s forcing these elderly back into nursing homes because it makes him look in charge, and fuels his idiotic feud he had going with the federal government over who was more leadery.  He won an Emmy for it!Cuomo should be facing prison.  The people who have been helping him cover up killing thousands of elderly people as a political play should as well.The fact that he was transferring state employees around so he could kiss them on the cheek and touch their face should get him disgraced and fired.  It is absolutely a distraction from the horror he has inflicted upon thousands of people.  Imagine him sending your grandmother to her death so that he could look good on television.  Absolutely evil."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;&gt; Dani Lever — who had worked in Cuomo’s press operation since 2014 but left in August 2020 to join Facebook as a communications managerThis is the sort of hire that drives me nuts.  I&#39;m sure this person is a fully capable communications manager, but what Facebook really purchased was political access.  Is it no surprise then that long after beginning work she was doing favors for her former employer?  Maintaining a connection to powerful politicians might well have been in her job description.&gt;&gt; Prior to joining Cuomo’s office in 2014, Lever worked as a press assistant for President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign and worked in press relations at the Clinton Foundation, among other roles, according to her LinkedIn profile.Which is more valuable to Facebook: her skills as a &#34;communication manager&#34; or the fact that she probably has the personal numbers for half of Washington?After some quickly googling: she appears to be the daughter of a prominent NYC attorney, which might have something to do with her previous work, as a student, for NY&#39;s attorney general.  And for NYC&#39;s comptroller general.  I would have killed for such jobs during law school.  She seems to have bounced between them while an undergrad.&#34;Lever, who grew up in Quaker Ridge, graduated from [redacted] and the University of Wisconsin-Madison also worked for state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, President Obama&#39;s 2012 campaign, and Clinton Foundation. She is the daughter of Joel and Debbie Lever of Bradford Road.&#34;https://scarsdale10583.com/about-joomla/the-project/5776-sca...I love that &#34;Bradford Road&#34; reference.  That is New England code for an old and well connected family.  (The implications of her highschool are just inappropriate and so I redact it.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The shocking thing about Cuomo is how blatant it all was. Not just the sexual harassment but his character across the board.This is a guy who wrote a book about his leadership in the covid pandemic during the covid pandemic. That&#39;s like Churchill writing his memoir of World War II during The Blitz.We ought to have a culture where someone who behaves like this is laughed out of the building."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s so irritating to be an American that has moved overseas. Basically the only country in the world that charges taxes on money you make and spend somewhere else, just because of where you were born. Thanks to IRS regulations, 90% of investment firms will just reject me outright rather than deal with the paperwork. Getting someone to help file my inordinately complex taxes costs thousands of dollars more than I actually pay in tax. I can&#39;t have a proper retirement account here since America doesn&#39;t recognize the local pension providers, so my government mandated pension is deducted from my salary here and then also taxed as income in the USA. If I ever want to leave, the IRS charges a small fortune for the privilege of not being a citizen too.I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a small number of rich people gaming the system, but for the vast majority of expats the citizenship-based taxation system is almost cartoonishly cruel."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting facts about renouncing American citizenship:- There is renunciation fee that has to be paid and currently stands at $2,350 (the highest in the world).[1]- A final tax return will sill need to be filed.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m an &#34;accidental American&#34; who has navigated this issue and it&#39;s incredibly easy. Just don&#39;t file. Every professional that writes blogs about this has a professional duty to give legal advice but the practical advice is just don&#39;t file. Look into what exactly triggers data to be sent to the IRS under your tax treaty and the policies of your financial institutions. Being &#34;accidental&#34; is the key here. If you tell your bank you aren&#39;t an American and you have a non-American birthplace and birth certificate they have absolutely zero way of knowing and your information will not be sent. If you have an American birthplace you can lie and say you renounced, but this carries some risk as the IRS maliciously publishes lists of renouncers so it&#39;s possible they could guess you lied. FATCA and FBAR are egregious violations of your rights. Not even the NSA has the right to spy on Americans abroad, but the IRS can do dragnet surveillance on American financial data from foreign countries with no probable cause and no warrants. You have a duty not to comply."</p>

In the case of Kid Pix, when it was first released back in 1989, Borderbund sponsored their first Kid&#39;s Day. It was a weekend testing day for 20 children to try out Kid Pix. Developers offered their testers cookies for a break and a crafts table with paper, glue, glitter, etc.--just in case the testers got bored. According to Broderbund employees, few cookies were eaten and almost none of the crafts were used. It was determined that Kid Pix would be a hit (Druin and Solomon 1996).&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The link leads to a reddit post, which leads to another reddit post, which leads to this article in Swiss: https://www.nzz.ch/schweiz/hsg-und-china-kritik-auf-twitter-...I can&#39;t read Swiss... but the comments on Reddit seem to show that this isn&#39;t as cut and dry as the title makes it sound. Quoting /u/hamsterman20:&gt; &#34;First of all, he was going to a chinese university with a chinese scholarship.&gt; He left the swiss university because of some weird technicalities while attending the Chinese university.&gt; He posted political messages against china and 1 picture depicting a chinese with yellow skin and slit eyes.&gt; Im not surprised he was kicked out of the chinese university and that the supervisor wanted to distance themselves. Though I wish they would stand up against China, its hard when your career depends on it.&gt; His swiss university refused to take them back. Don&#39;t know why. Technicalities I guess.&#34;I&#39;m sure there&#39;s still more to the story, and that it obviously isn&#39;t entirely the student&#39;s fault, but it isn&#39;t like a Swiss Student randomly tweeted about the CCP and got kicked out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Als seine Freundin einige der Tweets sieht, ist sie schockiert. Sie bittet ihn am Telefon, damit aufzuhören. Nicht weil sie bei allem anderer Meinung wäre. Sondern weil sie sich vor Repressionen der chinesischen Regierung fürchtet. «Ich bin in der Schweiz, nicht in China», antwortet er. «Hier kann ich sagen, was ich will.»Translation:When his girlfriend saw some of his tweets she&#39;s aghast. She&#39;s asking him on the phone to stop. Not because she disagrees. But because she is afraid of repercussions by the Chinese government. &#34;I&#39;m in Switzerland, not China&#34;, he replies, &#34;here I can say whatever I want&#34;.Of course he should be able to speak his mind.But when your girlfriend (who is Chinese and living in China) pleads for you to stop, maybe you should just take the hint. Not even for your sake (&#34;I&#39;m in Switzerland&#34;), but for hers?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Deep down in the reddit comments there is a statement from the university, which mentioned &#34;The former supervisor&#39;s desire to clearly distance herself is understandable when an accusation of racism is in the air.&#34; Some other comments also mentioned a &#34;racist cartoon&#34;.It is also mentioned in the report: https://www.nzz.ch/english/swiss-phd-students-dismissal-spot...&gt; The writer accuses Gerber of a «racist attack on the Chinese people.» He was referring to a specific tweet: a cartoon that Gerber had posted in response to another user&#39;s tweet. It depicted a comic character that had been altered and had stereotyped Chinese features, with yellow skin tone and slit eyes. This drawing circulated on social media in the spring of 2020, and was deemed racist by some users. Gerber said he only shared the cartoon because of its political message. The underlying topic had been China&#39;s stance toward Taiwan and Hong Kong. «In retrospect, I realize I didn&#39;t question the rendering of the Chinese person enough,» he said.So it is about &#34;yellow skin tone and slit eyes&#34;.This is crazy. I don&#39;t understand how is this OK. One Twitter of cartoon , you are expelled? No chance of explanation or apologize?Even the CCP wouldn&#39;t do this. I am pretty sure a Chinese student wouldn&#39;t be expelled from the university from one single anti-CCP social media post."</p>

I can find merit in complaining about apple&#39;s restriction in accessing payments. But SignIn with Apple, as a user I will always opt for that given my email won&#39;t be available with a third party forever for them to spam or sell. 
I have integrated SignIn with Apple both in an app and backend. I never felt it was particularly difficult or under-documented."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This literally could have been written by any developer in the UK. I think most of us start out like this! I think the best one was a company I worked for in Leeds, it was building a secure learning platform for schools which ultimately fell flat on it&#39;s arse. The company was run by a self-made millionaire who was notorious for scamming people.He&#39;d randomly lay off huge numbers of the sales team, and the first anyone would know about it is when the door code would be changed and we&#39;d have to ring the &#34;office manager&#34; (ex-SAS) for the new code.His grand idea to save the failing online learning platform was &#34;pivoting&#34; to selling personalised dog food online........... (and I mean personalised in the sense of just slapping the dogs name and their face on some generic crap dog food, not actually nutritionally personalised to the dog)Left that place being owed 3 months wages (which I never got).Last I heard he was being investigated for fraud. (this was the scum bag in question: https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/04/barclays-sm...)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is eerily similar to a job I had. I also worked for a young asshole CEO called Andrew, with multiple rubbish businesses, pretending to have more money than he had, having no idea what he was doing, and faced jail time a few years after I left.If you replace &#34;property market&#34; with &#34;education sector&#34; and &#34;UK&#34; with &#34;Australia&#34; we could have almost written the exact same article.I wonder how many of these companies are out there. Be wary of CEOs that don&#39;t bring anything other than money to the table. The more useless someone is, the more of a cunt they can be. Obviously this guy was struggling to pay his rent so he was going to take whatever job came up, but if you&#39;re entering startups and have the privilege of a bit of money in the bank and time on your side, try and pick the one with founders that are actually doing the work themselves. Look for some proof that they&#39;ve built, designed or sold something substantial, before you agree to do all the work for them. Because if they haven&#39;t even begun to do the hard yards themselves, they&#39;re not likely to respect any of your work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My first paid developer job was writing backend code for what I would later learn was the Canadian mafia. I was doing some backend and embedded work to build super shitty gambling kiosks for them. They already had some person &#34;managing&#34; project and the Indian contract house that was building flash games for the kiosk. He was useless, so I was stuck figuring everything out. Including getting things running on a then obsolete HP Itanium Integrity server with an old insecure version of Fedora on it. Plus figuring out how this was all going to work in the Dominican Republic where power was not a given at any particular time nor was connectivity. These kiosks would be scattered across 10&#39;s of casinos down there.Eventually things got weird, and I figured out that it was probably a form of scam against their investors. Since they wanted things very insecure and unlogged. Then they wanted me to come down to the DR and help with setup there. I bounced at that point, I was unwilling to give them that sort of power over me. They were in with the former president down there and I would have been at their mercy.10 ish years later I would hear from the &#34;manager&#34; again. He wanted me to help with an automated locker system. I helped a bit but once he begged me to go to an ATT store and recharge his prepaid phone I was done with him. (I did recharge his phone because I am a sucker for a sob story)If someone seems scummy, DO NOT work for them. Your gut is probably telling you something.That said, a good work ethic and a baptism by fire where you have to do everything can be an effective way to get your start."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The value of work is not in the work done; it&#39;s in the decisions being made. It&#39;s the ability to handle edge cases, to work your way through ambiguity, to &#34;unstuck&#34; a stuck situation, and to resolve tricky unforeseen issues.If you build a robot that only handles the main workflow and can&#39;t handle any of the exceptions, you&#39;re not automating anything; you&#39;re building a convenience tool. Basically, you&#39;re removing some of the labor part of the job, but still keeping the decision making part of the job for humans.This is both economically unviable and largely unpopular. You&#39;re not reducing labor costs by much, because you still need humans around. And workers lose control over their job, and have to &#34;work around&#34; the robot&#39;s limitations. Instead of being freed up to do more work, they become babysitters of machines that they have to oversee so it doesn&#39;t mess up everything.This is why partial robotic systems don&#39;t really exist; either it&#39;s a nifty tool that speeds up a small repeatable process of your work, or it&#39;s building the entire house."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The question I would have around automated building construction is &#34;why use bricks?&#34;.Bricks are great for humans to build with, they are just the right size and weight for the human hand to manipulate and place.  They are not optimised for machine manipulation.I would guess that if you wanted to automate construction you would start by making things like walls on an automated production line, then ship the largest practical piece to the construction site.  Once there I&#39;m guessing some automated cranes could move them into location far more easily than thousands of slightly randomly sized pieces of hard clay.Work out what problem you are trying to solve.  Do you want cheap construction?  then why choose a material that requires thousands of operations just to build a wall regardless of if it is a human or machine doing the building.  There are far more efficient building materials used every day... Just see how fast commercial buildings can be constructed and you can be sure that they are optimised both for speed of construction as well as (hopefully) energy efficiency and ease of maintance after construction.The problem seems to be people have a emotional idea of what a dream house is, an idea that is firmly stuck in the red brick house of 1970&#39;s sitcoms."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you think bricklaying is a simple task, you&#39;ve probably never laid bricks, or likely ever worked a construction job.There is _a lot_ that goes into laying a brick wall. From excavation, base compaction, material choice, mortar composition and viscosity, wall type, overlap patterns, leveling, overhang patterns, set time, and much more. Using an incorrect overhang pattern for instance can allow water drops to fall and contact the relatively soft surface of bricks and destroy them in a few years. Having an incomplete mortar seal allows the elements to penetrate through what would normally be waterproof, especially in places with high wind. An improper excavation, compaction material or compaction of said material, improper leveling, and many more factors will lead to failure within just a few years.The best way to learn about this stuff is to go try it! One could volunteer for Habitat for Humanity or a local shelter that builds homes and get some time with the tools. None of this stuff is simple, straightforward, or easy, and there are a million ways to do it incorrectly."</p>

Even a cache timeout of 5 seconds will provide robust protection against tens of thousands of hits per second, because request coalescing/dog-pile prevention will ensure that your CDN host only sends a request to the origin a maximum of once ever five seconds.I&#39;ve used this on high traffic sites and seen it robustly absorb any amount of unauthenticated (hence no variety on a per-cookie basis) traffic."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While the article is correct, it omits most of the actual function of CUPS. Many printers are capable of accepting various types of documents directly over the network, with postscript, HP PCL, and PDF being commonly supported---and ASCII pretty much universally supported.The problem is that few printers support _all_ of these standards. Postscript, for example, is surprisingly complex to implement in practice, which leads to a lot of inexpensive network printers actually lacking postscript support. Further, printers are very slow at rasterizing, and so while support for PDF rasterization is very common you probably don&#39;t want to use it. You can easily see a minute per page for printing modest PDFs. In-printer PDF rasterization is also of very uneven quality, and I have seen issues like completely broken kerning in documents due to the printer&#39;s poor handling of embedded fonts.One of the key functions of something like CUPS is to address this problem: CUPS standardizes the format of all printed documents to something that is well-supported by the printer, and performs much of the rasterization ahead of time on the much faster print server. This saves time and improves reliability since you don&#39;t need to figure out if a given document is supported by the printer. For most printers these days some variant of PCL is the preferred language for jobs, as it&#39;s simpler and easier to implement than Postscript. It also presents fewer security concerns.Of course the other major problem CUPS solves is the management of the queue, including across multiple users. That&#39;s an important feature but not one that matters in a lot of home situations. That said, if you don&#39;t use a printing system you can and will run into annoying situations where you cannot print a document because you are waiting for the previous one to complete sending, which often gets blocked on the printer&#39;s memory space or rasterization."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hah. I had a similar moment of enlightenment with FreeBSD when somebody explained that you can just cat a wav file into /dev/audio (or /dev/dsp? forget the exact name). And that you can produce white noise by catting /dev/random to the same destination. With no barrier to the sound card like that, I was free to experiment with programming dfferent noise algorithms and figuring out how digital audio works. I eventually did things the proper way with OSS and finally sndio on OpenBSD, but direct, universal interfaces like files invite that initial exploration and help you get things done quick and easy.netcat is also a secret weapon around the house. My girlfriend runs macOS, but it&#39;s way more reliable to just nc files to each other over wifi than deal with all the cloud and airdropping bullshit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FWIW, the Internet Printing Protocol (and IPP Everywhere in particular) make printer setup in CUPS far, far easier, but distributors seem reluctant to encourage it.  I wrote about my experiences with IPP back in June (https://lwn.net/Articles/857502/).  I expect to never have to hassle with printer drivers again..."</p>

Even if it&#39;s not 100% true, if you&#39;re a manager at Facebook, and the situation isn&#39;t 100% clear cut, you&#39;re still going to act, so you can show it as an example the next time the FTC tries to fine them.And they did offer an alternative:&gt;Clark said Facebook offers targeting data sets for political ads, and has suggested the NYU group use that information."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The debate on who has control over data typically creates two parties: the individual user who it is related to, and the corporation providing the platform or product.We ought to add another party: the public. Perhaps data should be able to be used for the public good, and we should be able to participate in deciding what data is collected and how data is used.In this case, having data about what ads are seen, by whom, and why they see those ads, seems like it could lead to us better understanding how FB and other companies algorithms are segmenting the population and how certain ideas proliferate within those segments. This seems beneficial to the public, since as we&#39;ve seen over the last 5 years or so, these platforms and the way they choose what information we see can have drastic effects on the economy, politics, etc. If I had a choice, I would choose to continue collecting data about the behavior of advertisers and the platforms that serve them for that kind of analysis. But we don&#39;t have a choice, because facebook &#34;owns&#34; that data.A number of people in this thread have referenced Cambridge Analytica. When Facebook does choose to share data with other parties, we have no say over what data is shared with them or what they may do with it. We don&#39;t even get a choice in how Facebook internally uses our data. Instead of democratizing the decision of what data is collected and how it is used, the FTC applied the rules of private property and fined FB for lack of privacy.The public got nothing out of that situation. Facebook now is more defensive of their ownership over our data, which also precludes us using it for the public good."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; And finally, something that would, in my opinion, really add to the realism and historical flavor of a medieval-themed city builder would be the introduction of mechanisms in which agricultural surpluses are skimmed by the church and the feudal lord. Tithes, taxes and rents! Instead of merely abstracting the taxes into an income modifier or letting the player be the extractor himself, we could be shown the tax collector visiting the village, counting the sheaves by the side of the road, selecting the calves and chickens. This way, the experiences of our medieval forebears are visualized and may help to educate the public about medieval village life.This is the part that&#39;s most interesting to me. I always feel tax policy &amp; land use is very rarely explored in games; in most of these games if you can set tax rates at all it always seems to be a straight tax on productivity so you just have to pick the amount of deadweight loss you&#39;re willing to accept to generate the revenue you need to run your government. There&#39;s also very rarely any distinction between government spending and private spending, and how government spending on public goods influences the asset values of private interests. You could make an entire game about just that subject.EDIT: As a follow-up, I found this history of land &amp; tax policy in Denmark going back to the middle ages to be quite fascinating and might be a useful point of contact for this sort of thing: https://bibliotek1.dk/english/history/centuries-of-experienc..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would love a building game where you can&#39;t build roads. All of those building games so far allowed that, but I think it would be more fun to just allow for constructing building, and roads/pathway would form depending on their connectivity inside the production chain. I.e. you wouldn&#39;t connect your farm to a butcher, but pathways would form and eventually turn into street based on the amount people from dependent shops walking to it (also depending on terrain and usage of i.e. horse carriages)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hrm.  My opinion is that complete accuracy isn&#39;t all that fun.  Folks have used tax records to do analysis of, say, how many farmers it takes in a village for a blacksmith to be present, and so on and so forth.  It was a lot more than you might imagine.On the other hand, looking at the D&amp;D 3.5 Dungeon Masters Guide 2, they have finally fleshed out Saltmarsh.  Bizarrely, a town of less than four thousand people actually has an assassins&#39; guild, with roughly ten members.  Do they take turns, each assassinating one person a year?  Because that&#39;s roughly how infrequently it would have to occur for their little club to escape notice.  Hardly worth paying dues for, sitting around, discussing that murder you managed five years ago and how you look forward to one in another five.Take a look at city-building ... in most games you rarely see the hub-and-spoke develop around a port city, despite that being a prevalent pattern, or the unique feel of isoheight versus steep streets in a hilly region (the San Francisco pattern).  If you watch city maps over hundreds of years, many forces are at work, and I think they might be simulable but I don&#39;t know if the end result would be enjoyable enjoy to warrant it.If you look at our actual cave ecosystems, troglobionts, which are adapted for living strictly in caves, are typically quite tiny.  There&#39;s simply no food down there!  Resources are scarce.  Hence you would get no gelatinous cubes or hook horrors or carrion crawlers stumbling around the caves, lurking about, waiting for adventurers or the average bear.  Instead you get some very small, pale shrimp.  This is not exciting for the adventurer.  Some handwaving of a source of energy called &#34;Faerzress&#34; eventually takes place and is only vaguely acceptable if one does not look hard, serving as kind of a bottom trophic level for the game.The balance between actual plausibilty and what one might call &#34;fantastical satiation&#34; is quite difficult.  Your large-sized dragon, perhaps your standard-issue Vermithrax Pejorative, would need something like a log flume ride of virgins delivered straight to its gullet to sustain its bulk, not to mention the caloric expenditure.  Clearly, this isn&#39;t very satisfying for your story-telling, either.The balance is rough and I suspect that nitpicking in the name of accuracy can undermine most of what is constructed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s a surprise to see my blog post from nine years ago (!) at the top of Hacker News. Anyone have questions about chargers?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; (...) roughly 4mm of distance is required between the two circuits. (As I discuss in Tiny, cheap, dangerous: Inside a (fake) iPhone charger, cheap chargers totally ignore these safety rules.Which is why I immediately destroy any charger at my home that is suspect to not come from a brand name producer.Is it really worth to risk your life for couple of dollars?Electronics is my hobby and I also happen to design some switch mode power supplies for AC. I can&#39;t overstate how difficult it is to design a good safe SMPS. Comparing to my other projects it seems it is at least 20-50 times harder to design a dedicated SMPS than the rest of the circuit, even with a lot of specialized literature on the matter to help me out (meaning I don&#39;t create my own topologies, I just learn the ones that are well described in the book). And that for applications under 100W."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a shame so few companies still make high quality 5V/1A chargers anymore. Apple seems to be the only one left that does so, and with consistent and predictable manufacturing.5V/1A is great for overnight charging. I&#39;ve noticed my phone battery lasts so much longer the next day."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Pretty dismal discussion in here at the time of writing. Largely complaints about tyranny. Makes me sad that we can&#39;t have a calm discussion about the merits of the policy.From what I can tell, you might be opposed to this policy if:1. You have fears about getting a vaccine, moreso than for coronavirus. If this is you, do you prefer a mask mandate? And if so, how do you enforce this in a restaurant, where anyone eating takes off their mask right away?2. You have fears about the privacy implications. If so, what are those fears? Perhaps your vaccination status can lead people to make inferences about your health?3. You are not particularly concerned about the community spread of coronavirus (and the implications of that)There aren&#39;t a lot of choices. You can 1) avoid high-risk areas and escape infection/spreading disease, in which case, this policy doesn&#39;t really directly affect you. Or 2) you can take your chances with coronavirus, which you will get sooner or later, and spread it. Or 3) you can &#34;take your chances&#34; with the vaccine which, statistically and biologically, is safer than getting coronavirus and reduces spread.This policy allows people to choose from 1) and 3) but not 2), which is in all ways the worst decision. Unless, of course, you think that the vaccine is more dangerous than coronavirus. And then I don&#39;t really know what to say.(lightly edited for clarification)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Vaccine requirements have been in place for decades. 
For pre-K in NYC kids need shots for PCV and Hib.For kindergarten they need more shots: Hep B, Polio, Chickenpox, and Measles, Mumps and Rubella.Going to middle school? Then you&#39;ll need more shots, the TDAP and meningococcal conjugate.These are all vaccine requirements. Is it an invasion or privacy to demand children&#39;s records? Is it the nanny state? We could go down that road, but who wants to live in a world where we lose herd immunity to all of those diseases because 30-40% of people choose to opt their children out?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To preface: I got the vaccine months ago (as soon as I had access), I&#39;m a big believer in vaccines.With that being said, this policy doesn&#39;t sit well with me. None of the currently available vaccines in the US are FDA approved. Of course, a lot of people have received those vaccines, but I also don&#39;t necessarily fault individuals for feeling hesitant (the nuance here is that I think people ought to get the vaccine).  mRNA is a new, unknown technology, and the vaccine was rushed faster to public access than any other vaccine before. We have absolutely no idea if there are any long term side effects of these vaccines.Both candidates Biden and Harris expressed the need for full trials and transparency in regard to the vaccine before they were in office, then changed their tune after (see: https://twitter.com/pbhushan1/status/1416969060890210305).  Biden says:&gt; When we finally do, God willing, get a vaccine, Who’s going to take the shot? Who’s going to take the shot? You going to be the first one to say, “Put me — sign me up, they now say it’s OK”?If the vaccine is as effective as it seems, then this decision feels positively nanny state to me. It takes away an individual&#39;s agency to inform themselves of the risks on both sides and make an informed decision."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In case anyone is interested, this is what it looks like on Internet Explorer 5 in Windows 9x: https://i.imgur.com/g668yBy.pngWhat&#39;s happening is that the &lt;h3&gt; tags are all nested, since they don&#39;t auto-close in this situation, and modern browsers define the &lt;h3&gt;&#39;s size as &#34;font-size: 1.17em;&#34; which of course adds up over time. I&#39;m not sure how IE5 interprets the page. Maybe I can get an older embedded version of Firebug to check.I think it&#39;s important to not break even older websites even if they have totally busted HTML, but this is probably such a rare case that no one ever thought of it, and at this point it&#39;d probably be much more disruptive to try and &#34;fix&#34; it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The font-tags are getting unfairly blamed!The increasing size is due to the unclosed &lt;h3&gt; tags combined with unclosed inline level tags. This is parsed into a nested structure, with h3&#39;s nested into h3&#39;s deeper and deeper. The font-size of h3 is defined as relative increase, so the nested h3-elements get increasingly larger size.The effect can be reproduced with this HTML snippet:     &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;hello
     &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;hello
     &lt;h3&gt;hello

Which is parsed as:     &lt;h3&gt;
       &lt;span&gt;hello
         &lt;h3&gt;
            &lt;span&gt;hello
               &lt;h3&gt;hello&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;/h3&gt;
       &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;/h3&gt;

Usually a h3 would be automatically closed when a new h3 (or any block-level element) is encountered, but because of the unclosed inline element (span in the above example) it is instead parsed as a nested structure. In OP it is unclosed font-tags which cause the h3&#39;s to nest, but it has nothing to do with the semantics of &lt;font&gt; per se, it is just because they are unclosed.So why did it look correct in old IE? I think this comes down to the built-in browser style-sheet. I suspect h3 is defined with an absolute font size in the IE browser style sheet which means nesting does not increase the size."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m kinda just pulling this out of the swamp of 25-year-old web design knowledge, but the unclosed code on that page consists of &lt;font&gt; tags, which are long since deprecated, and those font tags have size=&#34;2&#34; / size=&#34;-2&#34; attributes. I&#39;m pretty sure the old behaviour was that &lt;font size=&#34;[signed int]&#34;&gt; affected the size relative to the parent in the same way that CSS &#34;font-size:200%;&#34; or &#34;font-size:50%;&#34; would do. So nesting them doesn&#39;t create any new block elements, but it modifies the font size within a &lt;td&gt; or &lt;p&gt; relative to the parent. Just at a look, that seems like the explanation for the increase in font size, in this admittedly odd document.[edit] I believe the page would look as intended if each &lt;font&gt; tag overrode the prior unclosed &lt;font&gt; tag, rather than treating it as a parent, and that was probably how IE 6 interpreted it. In fact I think old browsers would auto-close &lt;/font&gt; if you wrote a new &lt;font&gt;."</p>

Even if you&#39;re sure you will never need one or more of those features, get them all. Wifi and Bluetooth and NFC are strictly optional, and probably not worthwhile.If you need color printing, send it to a printing company. There might even be a local one. It will be done at a higher quality, with better ink and good paper, than you can do at your office or house -- unless you are big enough to utilize a whole flock of printers, or you are a professional. If you are a pro, you don&#39;t need this advice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There should be a law that states for any subscription product I should be allowed to buy a fixed-term version with no auto-renewal. In the past two days I&#39;ve had the following experiences:  * Wanted to buy a Font Awesome &#34;Pro&#34; license for their icons. The only way to do this is a 99/year subscription. Reading the fine print says that I can buy it and cancel it the next day and still have lifetime access to the version at the time of my purchase. Why make me jump through the hoops?
  * I wanted to support a writer on Substack by subscribing for a year. But I can&#39;t, I can only start a perpetual sub. So I subbed and canceled 1 day later. Then I got a &#34;why did you cancel?&#34; email. I didn&#39;t really
  * I saw a cool open source project I liked and wanted to donate. They only had a Patreon link. Patreon only has recurring subs. So I had to email them and ask for their PayPal so I could send them $100.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s good to just delete the packages. Same goes for Android Apps in the Google Play Store or for Chrome Extensions.These compromised packages should have their page set to a read-only mode with downloads/installs disabled, with a big warning that they were compromised.This is specially troublesome with Chrome Extensions and Android Apps, where it is not possible to get to know if I actually had the extension installed, and if I had, what it was exactly about.Chrome Extensions getting automatically removed from the browser instead of permanently deactivated with a hint of why they can&#39;t be activated again, and which was the reason why the extension got disabled, is a problem for me. How do I know if I had a bad extension installed, if personal data has been leaked?This also applies to PyPI to some degree.----Eventually the downloads should get replaced with a module which, when loaded, prints out a well defined warning message and calls sys.exit() with a return code which is defined as a &#34;vulnerability exception&#34; which a build system can then handle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is why our build systems don’t use public repositories directly, and why we always pin to an exact version. Any third party dependencies (js/python/java/c/you-name-it) are manually uploaded to our Artifactory server- which itself has no internet access. All third party libraries are periodically checked for new versions, any security announcements etc, and only if we are happy do we update the internal repo.It has been a bit of a challenge, especially with js &amp; node and quite literally thousands of dependencies for a single library we want to use. In such cases we try avoid the library or look for a static/prepackaged version, but even then I don’t feel particularly comfortable.I should really start specifying checksums too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems to me like one low hanging fruit to make a lot of these kinds of exploits significantly more difficult is protection at a language level about which libraries are allowed to make outgoing HTTP requests or access the file system. It would be great if I could mark in my requirements.txt that a specific dependency should not be allowed to access the file system or network, and have that transitively apply to everything it calls or eval()&#39;s. Of course, it would still be possible to make malware that exfiltrates data through other channels, but it would be a lot harder.I am not aware of any languages or ecosystems that do this, so maybe there&#39;s some reason this won&#39;t work that I&#39;m not thinking of."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To chime in with my own anecdotal opinion that is likely to anger some people... in my experience most developers do their best work after about 6-8 months of starting a job at a new company, and that comes to an end after about 24-36 months of working at the same company. After that the vast majority of people just stagnate, get complacent, the job stops being interesting to them and they move on.After observing this I don&#39;t really mind hiring people to work for 2-3 years and then have them move on to another role, and most people I hire I do so with the expectation that I&#39;ll get a good two years of work and not much more.A very small percentage of people continue to improve over the long term, and those people I am happy to continue increasing their pay, but I don&#39;t really go out of my way to retain employees and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s particularly worth it to do so.This blog post mentions a kind of impact based compensation structure, and while I can respect the idea behind it, I am skeptical that they&#39;ve managed to find a deterministic and impartial way of measuring &#34;impact&#34;. I don&#39;t presume to have such a system so I pay based on what I observe in the market and let the market decide what the value is of software developers. For example, I genuinely don&#39;t know if software developers have more of an impact than the product designers, or the legal department even though I pay software developers much much more. What I do know is that it&#39;s much easier for me to hire a competent lawyer or UX designer than it is to hire a competent software developer and there are many more competent lawyers and designers out there... so I pay them less, regardless of whatever objective measure of impact may exist."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t really understand this article, or the current trend of job hopping. I&#39;m from the generation where you have one job, maybe two, and that&#39;s it: I&#39;ve had 7, but I really only ever wanted one good job.For some perspective: when I left Intel circa 2010, I was a Senior Staff Engineer fighting to get promoted to Principal Engineer (followed by Senoir Principal, then Fellow, then Senior Fellow, hahaha). FYI I loved Intel for the first 10 years, and hated the last 12.I made $130k base salary, $70k typical bonus (EB+ECBP), and stock options (most of which were worthless). This was after over two decades there, started in &#39;88.Recently, a friend (12 years younger than me) was hired by Intel to work in one of the ML groups. He asked if the starting salary was fair: they offered him $400k. I was angry, jealous, and shocked. I have friends that are STILL there, grinding away at sub-200k base salary after nearly 30 years, and they are too scared to leave.So this idea of coders flitting from job to job just seems so alien to me. I&#39;m obviously from a different generation. I don&#39;t even know what I would ask for pay if I ever left consulting. Headscratcher."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The hard truth that many companies struggle to wrap their heads around is that they should be paying their long-tenured engineers above market rate.From an ethical point of view, maybe. From a rational point of view, maybe not.Jobs are &#34;sticky&#34; — it&#39;s a pain to apply for jobs, arrange interviews, deal with the possibility of getting rejected. And if you do get an offer and accept you will be leaving colleagues that may be friends, risk your position being less stimulating, have to move house and/or deal with a new commute.There is a very real salary range between &#34;low enough that I&#39;ll think about applying for other jobs&#34; and &#34;so low I&#39;ll actually start applying for jobs&#34;. Employers are aware of this and are paying salaries accordingly. It sucks for everyone in that salary band but — ethics and long-term viability aside — it&#39;s still the rational economic choice for employers. Every now and again someone will quit and get their deserved 40% increase, but many will delay leaving for years, or simply put up with it indefinitely, saving employers tons of money.Of course this may not be the case forever. It seems like recently the cohort of people who find interviewing and changing jobs more tolerable (the so-called &#34;job-hoppers&#34;) is increasing in size. If you happen to be a part of this cohort, then congratulations, you&#39;re winning the job-market pain-of-change-vs-salary arbitrage game and will enjoy above-average year-on-year salary increases for at least the near future."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a bit of a story behind this. Oculus is owned by Facebook, but the Facebook website and the Oculus headsets/software are by different teams working in different states. When Facebook bought Oculus, they decided to get rid of the Oculus-specific account system and use only Facebook accounts. The Facebook account requirement took effect with the launch of the Oculus Quest 2, which launched in October 2020.October 2020 was the month before the US election, and the peak of both disinformation/influence campaigns, and of Facebook-the-website&#39;s efforts to combat those campaigns. So the spambot detector sensitivity was turned up to max that month, and if you tried to create a new account, there was a large chance you&#39;d be mistaken for a bot and banned immediately. So a bunch of people who weren&#39;t Facebook users got fancy new VR headsets, tried to create Facebook accounts in order to be able to use them, and got immediately banned. The support department for Facebook-the-website was not at all up to the task of dealing with this. This kind of wrecked their product launch; instead of the press coverage and public reaction being about how great their hardware was, it was about all the people who couldn&#39;t use their hardware because of account issues.So now Oculus has a completely separate support department for Facebook account issues, which acts less like it&#39;s supporting a free website and more like it&#39;s supporting a $300 piece of hardware. And if you have an account issue with the website, and you want to use that support department instead of the bad one, then buying a Quest 2 is not such a bad idea."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FB had an internal help system called &#34;Oops&#34;. It was meant for employees to get help for friends they knew in real life. It was discontinued not long ago (EDIT: maybe not according to a child comment). There were just too many requests for help.Facebook has a corporate structure that simply will not prioritize any effort longer than 6 months unless a senior company executive (Mark, Sheryl) supports it. Even if it affects the bottom line - and there were plenty of examples where large customers could not spend significantly more money with Facebook because of software bugs - they won&#39;t do anything about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Utility services start off as luxuries, and are private and unregulated.  This was true with telephone and electric companies.  When these services get to a certain point where there are real consequences for not being able to access the system, they need to have public regulation to ensure access and customer service.  ISP internet service has definitely reached this point, and I think that there&#39;s a strong argument that Google &amp; FB accounts (particularly for businesses) have reached this point as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is more than a privacy disaster. It is so far so vaguely worded (maybe deliberately?) that the government can target everyone in the ecosystem with penalties:While the language is still evolving, the proposal would seek to expand the definition of “broker” under section 6045(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to include anyone who is “responsible for and regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets” on behalf of another person. These newly defined brokers would be required to comply with IRS reporting requirements for brokers, including filing form 1099s with the IRS. That means they would have to collect user data, including users’ names and addresses.The broad, confusing language leaves open a door for almost any entity within the cryptocurrency ecosystem to be considered a “broker”—including software developers and cryptocurrency startups that aren’t custodying or controlling assets on behalf of their users. It could even potentially implicate miners, those who confirm and verify blockchain transactions. The mandate to collect names, addresses, and transactions of customers means almost every company even tangentially related to cryptocurrency may suddenly be forced to surveil their users."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The downsides listed are just cryptocurrency lobbyist talking points.“Require new surveillance of everyday users of cryptocurrency;”What everyday users? There’s nothing you can do with this stuff except speculate, gamble and build obfuscated Ponzis.”Force software creators and others who do not custody cryptocurrency for their users to implement cumbersome surveillance systems or stop offering services in the United States;”Not offering these services seems like a positive outcome.”Create more honeypots of private information about cryptocurrency users that could attract malicious actors;”Losing your money to malicious actors is a standard part of the crypto experience already. Endless scams and ransomware don’t seem to worry the author.”Create more legal complexity to developing blockchain projects or verifying transactions in the United States—likely leading to more innovation moving overseas.”Ah, blockchain innovation, which is somehow so vital to the shining future of mankind, yet has utterly failed to produce anything of technological or economic value with the billions already invested. Overseas sounds like a fine place to continue this pseudoinnovation charade."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anybody who has followed cryptocurrency in the last year knows that major US financial institutions and hedge funds have become heavily involved. The regulations coming are entirely to do with making the legal burdens of individual custody onerous enough that users place their coins on completely centralized exchanges to manage legal risk, all so these institutions have access to these coins for manipulation purposes like borrowing for shorting. The ONLY regulation you will see is on the average user so they can suck up coins like Daniel Plainview drinking your milkshake, NOT on market manipulation or trading habits of institutions which is the key driver of malicious activity and harm in the cryptocurrency space."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Because my engagement with unions has only been positive, I am interested in the amazing number of people who seem motivated to say how negatively they feel about unions. I get that in an oppositional sense, if you don&#39;t want what a union wants, then they tend to cast into the bad, but for the middle ground who are not VCs, owners, Managers, and are candidates for union membership, I find it really strange how much people cast them into a class of &#34;money grabbers for no benefit&#34;Do people feel the same about life insurance, car insurance? Its not that you actually intend being harrassed or sacked (fall ill, have a car accident) It&#39;s that you don&#39;t want to find yourself on the wrong side of an employment dispute (accident claim) without some insurance.Unions may be taking your hard earned money. They may be doing things which you don&#39;t like (do I love my car insurance company?) But, they have a neccessary role in risk management.We talk about risk management in the ICT sector all the time. Why can&#39;t we talk about risk management for labour hire?Amazon used &#34;dirty tricks&#34; to win this election. I am sure the Union bust some minor rules too, but overall I am reasonably confident that the vote was neither free, nor fair. I also do think there is no latent 100% pro-union vote out there, and that a large number of the polled workers don&#39;t want a union, or the cost of the union, or the risk of jobloss from Amazon if they join the union (which is illegal but still has a risk of happening) -So I don&#39;t for a minute believe a re-vote will magically reverse the signal with an overwhelming result.What interests me, is the basis for opposition to the union in the first place. Do people really think the garment workers in  New York were backing the wrong horse? Do people think the machineguns which Ford arranged to turn on a union march in Detroit didn&#39;t happen?&#34;oh, that would never happen now...&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This could work out. Each time the employer violates an NRLB rule during an organizing campaign, even if the employer wins, there&#39;s another election in 3 months. Until the union wins or the employer stops breaking the rules."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The surveillance seems like the more troubling ruling. Having a security guard stand outside a union meeting and photograph the attendants seems like a thinly veiled threat, and if I were in that situation I would likely jump ship."</p>

has the exact same issues - what if there&#39;s a typo here? My IDE can&#39;t highlight that this is wrong because it&#39;s *not code* and is just a string.Maybe I&#39;m just the odd one out here, but vue (and angular) love to use strings as a makeshift programming language, which to me is a major smell.^[1]: https://v3.vuejs.org/examples/commits.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"China is not &#34;smashing its tech industry&#34;. It&#39;s cracking down on private Internet companies that acquired too much power through network effects. This is completely consistent with CCP doctrine. Anything that central has to be state-owned.Xi declared this year that while digitization is important, “we must recognize the fundamental importance of the real economy… and never deindustrialize.” Right. China, remember, has a national industrial policy. It&#39;s expressed in the national 5 year plan, which is taken seriously and used to set priorities.What those priorities are is no secret. The current 5 year plan, the 14th, lists them.[1] Specific technology goals are in blue boxes.  Semiconductors, gas turbines, biotech, new energy vehicles, robotics, advanced agricultural equipment. Internet services are mentioned in the Plan. One key line section out here: &#34;We will strengthen the economic supervision of internet platforms in accordance with laws and regulations, clarify platform enterprise positioning and regulatory rules, improve the laws and regulations concerning the identification of monopolies, and crack down on monopolies and unfair competition. ... We will intensify anti-monopoly and anti-unfair competition law enforcement and judicial efforts and prevent the disorderly expansion of capital.&#34;If you think this isn&#39;t to be taken seriously, go back and look at the 13th 5 year plan and check off the completed items.[1] https://cset.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/t0284_14th_Fi..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; China may simply see things differently. It’s possible that the Chinese government has decided that the profits of companies like Alibaba and Tencent come more from rents than from actual value addedExcellent observation, and I hope, for China&#39;s sake, that this is the reason.The United States is likely in for a long-term rude awakening when it finally realizes that an economy predicated on negative-value-add activities like clicking heart icons on photos, repackaging financial securities into products with impossible-to-detangle risk profiles, advertisement and addiction optimization, and political outrage, will not remain any definition of &#34;global superpower&#34; for long.Facebook and Netflix are excellent examples of companies that contribute greatly to our GDP whilst simultaneously draining our reserves of actual capital and mental health."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; There are certainly those in America who believe that Facebook and Google produce little of value relative to the profit they rake in; maybe China’s leaders, for reasons that will remain forever opaque to us, have simply reached the same conclusion.Arguably, capturing most of your country&#39;s top talent with absurd salaries and putting them to work on world-critical challenges like... how to generate more revenue from advertisement or... how to create as many &#34;phone-addicts&#34; as possible... could be quantified as producing tons and tons of negative value.If China&#39;s crackdown on &#34;consumer-facing tech&#34; is about this, that could be a very good thing for China long term.I grew up wanting to work on NASA and putting stuff on space, and during university got offered 10x the NASA salaries at FAANG companies, and was to week to just say &#34;no thanks&#34;.10 years later I am starting to wonder what my legacy is going to be."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My one and only Google interview went this way years ago.  Each round they&#39;d send me more books to study, which frankly I couldn&#39;t be bothered to read given the circumstances.My experience ended when an interviewer in round 3 or 4 asked me an obviously scripted question.  I answered sarcastically, he got peeved, and I never heard from them again.I&#39;m not claiming I&#39;m Google caliber, whatever that means.  Obviously I&#39;m not because I don&#39;t have the patience for their interview questions.To be clear, the entire question was:
What&#39;s not in a Linux inode?My answer was:
Lots of things...dinosaurs, the moon...The interviewer told me very matter of factly that it was in fact, the filename.I honestly lost all respect for the process, sorry Googlers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What’s happening is that companies want to completely remove risk from the hiring process.In the real world, you cannot remove risk. You can manage it, but you cannot remove it. Asking candidates to go through 6 interviews before making a decision and not telling them when a decision will be made signals a risk adverse culture that cannot make decisions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ah Amazon... 14 interviews, an additional 5 hour technical test, spanning a total of 3+ months. Only to be informed at the end that I was too technical for the role they had in mind but they were offering me a Senior Principal SDE role instead.By the time we got to the end of the process I&#39;d already concluded that the hiring process was a reflection of their internal decision making and that this was not a company (or department) I wanted to work for.Then I was hired elsewhere and I saw something similar happen to a candidate and realised that this was truly an indication of the indecision. We had lots of roles, just none shaped in a way that fitted the person, and what we should&#39;ve done is reject the person but on that occasion we hired and it was a terrible decision. They were a good person and very capable, but not a fit for the role finally offered. I had the sense that if I had accepted the Amazon role that would&#39;ve been true for me too.An interview process of more than 3-4 defined steps that takes longer than a month to schedule, is a bad sign.Top tip for candidates: Ask what the process is, if they cannot conclusively tell you then double down on interviewing at a company that can."</p>

Maybe it&#39;s possible with a crossover cable between two Mellanox 100 Gbps NICs, using water-cooled and overclocked CPUs, but not over ordinary networks with ordinary servers.I have gigabit wired Internet to a site with gigabit Internet. Typical performance of SSTP or IKEv2 is 15-30 Mbps. That&#39;s 1.5% to 3% max utilisation of the available bandwidth, which is just... sad.It&#39;s not the specific site either, other vendor VPNs can easily achieve &gt; 300 Mbps over the same path.It&#39;s a year and a half into the pandemic, there are record numbers of people working from home, and Microsoft is the world&#39;s second biggest company right now.Meanwhile, volunteers put together a protocol in their spare time that is not only more secure but can also easily do 7.5 Gbps!That needs to be repeated: At least ONE HUNDRED TIMES faster than the &#34;best&#34; Microsoft can offer to their hundreds of millions of enterprise customers that are working from home.Someone from Microsoft&#39;s networking team needs to read this, and then watch Casey Muratori&#39;s rant about Microsoft&#39;s poor track record with performance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99dKzubvpKE"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Now I feel old. I remember vividly running around with my first camera, looking for objects worthy of being photographed. The film cost money, so did developing it into pictures. I really had to weigh the pros and cons of taking a particular picture. And in a class of ~25 kids, I was one of three who owned a camera. Not that it was such a luxury item, but most people weren&#39;t into that.These days, (nearly) everyone carries a camera around all the time, and one that is quite probably much better than the one I had in 1992. They can take dozens, even hundreds of pictures without breaking a sweat, and it does not cost anything.Nostalgia is a very warped mirror. Back then, I did not miss the ability to take dozens of pictures at no cost, because the option did not exist. Was it better? Worse? Neither, I think. But this is the first time I feel old and appreciate it for the history I have lived through. Getting old is weird, but it sure is interesting. (For reference, I&#39;m 40. &#34;That&#39;s not old&#34;, I hear someone say, but I have never been this old before, so for me it&#39;s all new.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">" The second paragraph is funny to me:&gt; I memorized phone numbers, jotted things down in notebooks, had conversations with taxi drivers, talked to random people at bars, wrote checks, went to the bank, and daydreamed.I did all of these (except the phone number one) in the last week.More than technological advancements or anything else, all of this nostalgia is really just about getting old.&#34;The human civilization peaked when I turned 12 and started declining when I crossed 25.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you look at the history of the Public Broadcasting Act [1] that established the CPB and eventually PBS, it seems clear that it was passed in response to poorly-funded educational programming not being able to compete with high-budget commercial network TV. Its authors wanted to make it easier for smaller, non-commercial entities to produce and distribute high-quality educational content.In that regard, the Internet (aided by inexpensive video gear and editing software) has succeeded far beyond their wildest dreams. The breadth and depth of educational content available just on YouTube is incredible.The same forces that make it easy to produce and distribute educational content also make it easy to produce and distribute misinformation. This is a problem, but&#39;s unclear how a &#34;PBS for the internet&#34; would solve it.For example, if you look at the one concrete piece of legislation mentioned in the article:&gt; The Local Journalism Sustainability Act takes a different approach to the government grant model. The bill would, for example, give a tax credit to people who donate to nonprofit newsrooms, or to small businesses who buy advertising at a nonprofit outlet.It&#39;s not clear to me why people wouldn&#39;t just choose to donate to or buy advertising in outlets that promote whatever form of misinformation or partisan information that suits their tastes.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Broadcasting_Act_of_196..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well there is:https://www.pbs.org/video/Also PBS has a great kids games app(s) that are free with games that are fun / no ads.And PBS kids video app is again free, great content, no ads.If you&#39;re in the US and care about that content, I suggest contributing to your local station.  The quality of the content from kids to adult is outstanding.   It&#39;s not usual for me to browse a few streaming services and just end up watching PBS&#39;s content in the end.Maybe when it comes to the article they mean more accessible?  But I&#39;m not sure as they seem to ignore the PBS content available."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would like to note that PBS does actually publish Youtube videos via PBS Digital Studios[0][1].

								<p class="story__comment_others">"i’ve been using linux as my daily driver for just over a year. steam on linux has been great, and proton (wine) has been indispensable. big title games i’ve played with _no_ issues at all:* Cyberpunk 2077 (ok that has issues, but it has the same issues for windows users..)* Dying Light* Titanfall* The Divisionalong with _many_ other indie/small games.honestly the only thing left is titles that include invasive anti-cheat. when that day comes, i don’t know if most of my friends will have any reason to remain on windows.and who could blame them? finally, they won’t need to deal with a company that collects data from them without their knowledge, runs ads in their taskbar, demands they have a useless microsoft account, restarts their machine on a whim for updates, etc.i hate that i’m going to say this out loud, but could 2022 really be the year of linux on the des- why does it feel so wrong to say that? :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just to be fair and balanced I&#39;m a hardcore linux user and gamer and I&#39;ve tried gaming on linux and I&#39;ve hit many issues. 365 games on steam and while some windows games work I&#39;ve hit probably just about every possible issue you can hit with other games. Graphical artifacts, freezing, stuttering, and even full OS reboots.Sometimes I read this thread and scratch my head. I get enthusiasm for FOSS, but enthusiasm to the point of delusion? Honestly, Linux is not up to par with windows in terms of running games that are basically designed for windows. Thus the experience compared to windows for these things is definitively inferior."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"From my limited understanding this seems really impressive!I immediately associated this to possible disruption in the cement supply chain that&#39;s about to hit Sweden. Cementa, which produces about 75% of Sweden&#39;s cement, will no longer be allow to mine limestone on Gotland. Their permit was due to be renewed but due to the low quality of their environmental impact study the court was unable to determine if the mining might impact the local residents groundwater. So just a week or so ago a Swedish court decided Cementa muts cease mining operations some time in October. And as I said this mine/factory produces 75% of Sweden&#39;s cement. So there are more problems with the current way of producing cement than just CO2.Most probably there will be a limestone/cement void in Sweden that needs to be filled, and I&#39;d rather have you doing it than some new limestone mine. Best of luck to you!"</p>
