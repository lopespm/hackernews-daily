								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At one point (a very long time ago now) it was declared that Dogwood was the future and as a result Go would be the language of choice at Heroku and Erlang would be no more.Trouble is that Erlang ran all the important Cedar code (it might still today) and the Erlang engineers didn&#39;t particularly like the news that Erlang code was essentially deprecated so they left and nobody knew how to maintain the stack. This definitely wasn&#39;t the only problem we had but it was a big one.What do fellow Herokai think? Was Dogwood a fool&#39;s errand? Or did we just not get enough staff to build it properly?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only thing I don&#39;t like is their usage-based pricing. On Heroku I could pay $7 a month and know I&#39;d never be charged more than that. I&#39;m sure when you&#39;re scaling a service it&#39;s fine - maybe even better - to do it on a sliding scale. But for a fire-and-forget blog site, I don&#39;t want to have to worry about stuff like that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I could relate to the comment on Redis.  The only things I can see missing are automated Redis hosting by the platform.

There have been so many times I wanted some simple key value store which I do not have to bother about setting up and taking care of. Something like &#34;ambient Redis&#34;. It&#39;s OK not to have crazy scaling promises. You just enable an API (maybe for a small fee) and just use it.If and when you get big enough you switch to a setup you bother about setting up and taking care of.Am I making sense to anyone?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Litestream author here. The motivation for this docs page was two-fold. First, laying out the different options with their trade-offs helps people understand what Litestream is trying to be so it helps keep my focus narrow. For example, if someone is looking for very high durability guarantees then they can see that rqlite might be a better fit and they don&#39;t try to fit Litestream into that mold.Second, Litestream doesn&#39;t interfere with other backup methods so you can run it alongside a cron-based backup. I typically run both because I&#39;m overly paranoid and because it&#39;s cheap."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A service that says &#39;here is an alternative to our service&#39;? Right on their own website? Even though cron backups are basically &#39;competition&#39; to litestream?That&#39;s it. I&#39;m giving fly.io a try next hobby app I start.I&#39;m so impressed with their business decisions right now, I was afraid for litestream but then I read how the creator is just hired to work on it full time. What a splendid development!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Following the announcement of Fly.io acquiring the Litestream project and hiring its creator Ben Johnson I&#39;ve been looking into it (and am very impressed by what I see!)Reading through the docs I was delighted to find this full set of instructions including script commands for setting up a simpler regular snapshot backup using cron - for situations where Litestream is (quote) &#34;overkill&#34; - ie where the database is smaller and your durability requirements are lower.In fact, the docs have a whole alternatives section for different requirements. I think this kind of thing is great, and something more projects should do! Wanted to share it because of this meta thing, but also because it&#39;s just pretty useful per se."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some of the top-rated comments make me wonder whether the authors have even read the article. This isn&#39;t about whether PoW or cryptocurrencies as a whole make sense, but strictly about the economics of mining, and how standard accounting practices might obfuscate miners&#39; true profitability. The author sounds like an investor who would be equally happy to hold long instead of short positions in those stocks if their prices were different."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Disclosure: I hold short positions in companies mentioned in this article. This is not financial advice.Hmm. Well, on the one hand, he is putting his money where his mouth is. On the other hand, this could be prime evidence of motivated reasoning. The author has also submitted his own article to HN it seems. Reading the analysis, it makes sense, but I&#39;m not experienced in analysing company financials. Other people I respect/trust who have a good track record don&#39;t feel this way about the companies in question.I think, in general, shorting volatile assets is a pretty fraught undertaking. There could be a Gamestop style short squeeze fueled by Crypto bros for example. There could be a purchase announcement that could spike the price. ARK could decide to buy a large stake. All these things could lose you a lot of money for &#39;no good reason&#39;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I weigh 350 pounds. I&#39;m very obese. I know this.When I was a teenager, I looked at people who weighed 300+ pounds and though, how do you get that way. Don&#39;t you realize that you are gaining weight? Don&#39;t you know that you just have to eat less to lose weight?Anyway, now I realize that I am hungry. It never goes away unless I eat a significant amount of food. My body told me to eat, so I ate.It doesn&#39;t even take that much extra food to gain a lot of weight. One extra piece of cake a week is a few pounds in a year. If you live a few years, it adds up. You gain weight in kilograms and lose weight in grams.Hunger is a sensation that happens inside a person&#39;s body and mind. You cannot compare your hunger to my hunger.So many diets talk about not being hungry while you are on the diet. I&#39;ve been to dieticians and told them I&#39;m hungry, and they suggest eating more protein or more fiber. That does help, but I still feel hungry.There is a very good chance that someone is writing a reply with some suggestion as to how I should eat so that I&#39;m not hungry. Thank you for the thoughts, but realize that you don&#39;t live in my body, you don&#39;t know how I feel, you don&#39;t know what I&#39;ve tried.Hunger sounds like a problem to people. Hunger feels like a problem inside the body. People still tell me I shouldn&#39;t be hungry. Maybe part of the solution is realizing that eating to satisfaction is ... bad for some people. Maybe it&#39;s Ok to be a little hungry.Anyway, these are just some thoughts. I&#39;m down 30 pounds from my max. I think I have a good mentality now, but it took years to get here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While correct and useful advice for some people, this advice is useless for many (I suspect most) overweight and obese people.I&#39;m on the border of overweight/obese. I can lose weight if I focus on losing weight. I&#39;ve dropped from 100kg to 74kg and back. I&#39;ve gone back down to 91kg and back. How? Eating less, of course. By counting calories. But here is the problem. Anything below 95kg and my body and mind is hyper annoying, constantly interrupting my thoughts (amygdala?) insisting that I go eat something. It is impossible to program computers when my brain keeps interrupting me. I simply cannot focus on anything other than eating. It&#39;s like a very slow motion breath hold... eventually you will come up for air. I find life so miserable at those weights that I eventually learned to accept my fate and I&#39;ll die early I&#39;m sure, but at least life will feel tolerable until then.Why do some people&#39;s bodies/minds insist so insistently that they eat more when they clearly are already overweight? That&#39;s the question I would love to have answered. People often postulate the answer lies in the kinds of foods you eat, but I&#39;ve proven that hypothesis wrong (for myself) many times. Avoiding sugars and fried foods and eating oatmeal, fish soup, salads, fruit and veg with lean proteins...  does not make any weight difference for me, nor does it make low body weights any more tolerable. Sounds great, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s healthy, but I&#39;ve proven on myself multiple times that this technique does not work. Only counting calories works for weight loss (actually distance running works for me too), and it always leaves me famished and miserable.Going on a zero-carb diet might work. I&#39;ve seen success stories. I haven&#39;t seriously tried it. When I&#39;ve tried in the past I was craving bread so massively that I caved in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Someone finally wrote this article. So refreshing. It&#39;s obvious when you live with a fat person why they have trouble losing weight, even when they&#39;re on a diet: they&#39;re usually not actually following it. Whether they don&#39;t understand portion sizes for calorie math, or look at calories at all, or eat things that they say &#34;do not count&#34;, there is almost always a failure to understand what and how much they are eating."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A perfect example of how &#34;democracy dies in darkness&#34;. They will keep pushing anti-consumer laws through the backdoor of &#34;free trade&#34; agreements, until we stop it by requiring that:Before any international agreement may be ratified, [our country] must pass all the laws needed to comply with that agreement ahead of time, through regular democratic processes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Free&#34; trade agreements. &#34;Free trade agreement&#34; is a propaganda term anyway, but applying it to agreements that impose intellectual property monopolies is bizarre.https://cepr.net/trade-agreements-that-increase-protectionis...https://cepr.net/trade-deals-are-about-increasing-protection...&gt; It is also important to point out that the liberalization of trade in goods is largely a done deal. Tariffs are already zero or near zero in the vast majority of cases. The potential gains from further liberalization are limited, especially since goods are a rapidly falling share of total output.&gt; Instead, deals like the TPP are largely about locking in rules on items like intellectual property protections and preserving Mark Zuckerberg’s dominance of the Internet. The TPP, like other recent trade deals, calls for longer and stronger patent and copyright monopolies.&gt; These protections are 180 degrees at odds with free trade. They are about shifting more income from the bulk of the population to people who benefit from rents on patents and copyrights, by making them pay more for drugs, medical equipment, software and a wide variety of other items."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was prescribed benzos because of sleeping issues, but I was also taking phenibut at the same time.  After about 3 weeks of using large doses of the benzos every night, I stopped taking them, but a year later I still feel pangs of withdrawal sometimes when I get stressed.  It took me another 4 months to get off the phenibut and a month or so after that before my sleep returned to normal.  There were months where I maybe got an hour or two of sleep a night.  If I got stressed, I simply wouldn&#39;t sleep at all.  I once went three days without sleep.  The torment of that combined with the withdrawal from the drugs showed me what hell was like.  I tell everyone to never take benzos for any reasons.  I don&#39;t care how safe the doctors say they are; they aren&#39;t.  Period.  There are repercussions - as this study shows - and they will not help the underlying cause of your issues.  Treat the cause, not the symptoms."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Caution:  While this is a cool study in Nature Neuroscience, almost all facets of this work are based on a single fully inbred strain of mouse—-C57BL/6J. This strain also happens to have a major mutation in the  GABRA2 gene that reduces expression about 2X relative to almost all other strains of mice.  GABRA2 is one of the most important receptors involved in inhibitory responses in CNS and benzodiazepine responses.This same strain also has a well known splice variant mutation in a key mitochondrial gene, NNT, that modulates both mitochondrial and macrophage function. The microglial mentioned in this paper are a special class of macrophages that reside in the CNS.Given these comments, when the authors refer to “wild type” (WT) mice, remember these are anything but true wild type mice. Fully inbred strains always carry numerous homozygous recessive and dominant mutations (several hundred each) that often affect CNS, immune systems, and mitochondrial functions.The results may well hold up in other strains, but I would not count on it. Do benzodiazepines affect all humans uniformly?Would studies of other strains or types have been practical? Yes. The Thy1-GFP and Thy1-YFP lines can be crossed to make F1 hybrids. This particular transgene is also available on at least one other strain of mouse (DBA/2J).Unfortunately, most reviewers at Nature Neuroscience are not geneticists ;-) They are typically strong molecular neurobiologists who are used to reductionist methods. They are perfectly content with submission to Nature journals that are based entirely on with N=1 mouse genome—almost always the mutant C57BL/6J inbred strain.In my own work I try to avoid this N=1 trap. (But I have also failed ;-)Generality and robustness of results (see quote below) should ideally be established across two or more diverse genomes before making broad claims of relevance to other species, including od course to humans.The quote:“We have demonstrated that microglia in WT mice alter their morphology and functions upon diazepam treatment and cease to do so in Tspo−/− mice.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The world of medecine is degenerate. Sustainable, non addictive and non neurotoxic anxiolytics exists:
the #1 being opipramol the sigmaergic.
emoxypine (which btw cure hangover) and guanfacine are worth mentioning.
Maybe beta blockers to some extent. NMDA antagonists such as memantine have side effects but are not neurotoxic to my knowledge and there are milder ones such as mg-lthreonate.
afobazole is interesting but its pharmacology is too weird to be sure. Etifoxine is revolutionnary, it double axon length growth rate so ironically a great cure to benzo neurodamage. its acts on the mitochondria benzodiazepine receptor. It&#39;s unclear to me wether it is subject to a tolerance effect and if so if it is lower. Also etifoxine can interact badly with other drugs on the liver.
Note that there exists ultra-atypical mechanisms, such as inositol megadose or tofisopam but they are not firstline.So yeah, basically opipramol and guanfacine should be what humans take as first line. Glycine is a nice obvious augmentation (kinda absurd that people forget about the second inhibitor neurotransmitter in the brain, especially since the effect feel nice and doesn&#39;t really lead to tolerance).
if you have benzo neurodamage, take magnesium lthreonate which is a very potent synaptotrophic.also fun fact: the benzo cartel was so strong it was the most prescribed drug in the world, all classes, in the 70s"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s no doubt that, for a lot of people, there is just a better convenience/quality trade-off. I had a good size Onkyo system for watching movies and I configured it meticulously. But it&#39;s hard to explain to others why there is so much ceremony and bulk, especially when watching habits degenerate from immersive movies to binge watching netflix serieses.Part of the experience with hobbies is some kind of sacrifice along with the reward. The drive towards convenience takes away that sacrifice and makes me appreciate something a little less.It&#39;s like takeout and boxed wine, wearing a T-shirt; versus dressing up a bit, making a nice meal, and opening a bottle from a winery you visited. The former is ovjectively good and convenient, and all of the latter ceremony is a hassle that provides little benefit (you probably can&#39;t tell the boxed wine apart in a blind test).But... aren&#39;t we happier with the latter experience?I&#39;m too lazy to &#34;waste&#34; time on that kind of happiness though. That&#39;s the sad part.I think if I&#39;m motivated by others it&#39;s different. For instance, stuff like surfing/snowsports requires a significant hassle, and it&#39;s a lot easier to find people who will put up with that hassle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel that the AV-receiver market has gone the way of the DSLR market. Compact speaker systems like Sonos (that don&#39;t need a separate AVR) simply got good enough. Thus the need for buying a separate AVR to drive your Dolby / DTS / etc. setup has all but vanished except maybe for the most determined audiophiles (and even most of these would do well to simply get a compact wireless speaker setup instead of some monstrosity that they can hardly ever enjoy...because too small of a listening room, and neighbours).I&#39;m not saying market for Onkyo, Denon, Sony, Yamaha, etc. AVRs is a goner, but I am suggesting it may have peaked and that going forward there will be less and less demand for AVRs, especially in the low/mid range of things."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something similar that I find both fascinating and heart-breakingly tragic: The &#34;Black Belt&#34; in the U.S. Deep South. The Black Belt is both a geological term used to refer to the rich &amp; dark soil [0] and a geopolitical term to refer to the high percentage of African Americans [1]. During the Cretaceous period, the shore-line at the time ran through the middle of Alabama and Mississippi, depositing rich organic deposits, which in turn allowed for plantations to thrive in those parts of the deep south. Even nearly 160 years after the Emancipation Proclamation, those counties still have some of the highest percentages of African American Populations. Overlaying the population demographic map on a a map of the cretaceous shoreline shows a correlation [2].[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Belt_(geological_formati...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the US/Iraq war such contraptions were commonly referred to as EFPs (explosively formed penetrators). My platoon was once hit by a four-array EFP that was hung behind a cement wall (US forces would often line streets with barricades like this) so we couldn&#39;t see it. It went through the concrete wall, the humvee, and took some legs with it. Brutal things they were. We avoided prolonged truck excursions, but I remember we used to always sit with our arms and legs as staggered as possible--The thought being that if an EFP went through, you might get lucky and only lose one arm/leg instead of two. Of course it probably didn&#39;t help... but whatever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Wikipedia article on shaped charges is fascinating:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaped_chargeThe penetration distance is proportional to the diameter of the charge (counterintuitive; you&#39;d expect the height), and can be up to 7x as large.  So a ~5 inch charge shown in the film can penetrate up to about 3 feet of solid steel.Also, all of our known defenses against shaped charged rely on the assumption that the same spot won&#39;t get hit twice.  Composite armor breaks and deflects the geometry of the jet through its deformation; reactive armor relies on a mini-explosion to defeat the jet.  This has interesting implications in a world of drones and precision-guided munitions, and in fact the Javelin missiles we&#39;ve been shipping to Ukraine have double warheads, the first to destroy the armor and the second to destroy the vehicle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I amuse myself by thinking that Sidney Alford (the expert in the video, who by the way appears to have passed away last year) looked like, and was, the modern Grand Maester, conjuring up magical (but yes, destructive and terrible) explosives for the use by kingdoms against each other.   He should&#39;ve been given a cameo part in Game of Thrones...I got onto the topic years ago when watching the Dambusters.   Related to this, he also has a video showing how putting a simple tube/bag of water behind an explosive charge magnifies its force incredibly.  I believe he started a company that built and sold explosives with such a water-fillable jacket that could be used to knock down doors by police forces.edit: here&#39;s the water filled explosive knocking down a door: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_80gWlDQdHg"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"LUNA is trading at below $0.00001, that is below 1/1000th of a cent right now. For many, getting rid of it may be much harder than just ignoring it. A few weeks ago the price people were willing to pay for it hovered around $100.I say &#34;the price people were willing to pay&#34; instead of &#34;value&#34;, because now that nobody wants to speculate with LUNA, it did fall down to its intrinsic value: Practically zero. Nobody needs it for anything besides buying and selling it from and to other people, which is not happening anymore.Cryptocurrency is gambling, plain and simple. The difficulty that fiat currency faces is inflation, which roughly means diluting the economy that backs it too much. The difficulty with cryptocurrency is that there is nothing of worth backing it. Factor in the horrifying externalities, and its worth is negative.For Bitcoin, the most popular one, on the order of 100.000.000.000.000.000.000 of hashes get calculated to mine a single block, multiple trillion per second. Within ten minutes, only a single one of those 100.000.000.000.000.000.000 hashes is actually used, depending entirely on luck. The rest are thrown away entirely. They do not form part of the final hash or anything else, the energy spent on them is lost."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I prefer Matt Levine from his newsletter today:&#34;Safe assets are much riskier than risky ones. This is I think the deep lesson of the 2008 financial crisis, and crypto loves re-learning the lessons of traditional finance. Systemic risks live in safe assets. Equity-like assets — tech stocks, Luna, Bitcoin — are risky, and everyone knows they’re risky, and everyone accepts the risk. If your stocks or Bitcoin go down by 20% you are sad, but you are not that surprised. And so most people arrange their lives in such a way that, if their stocks or Bitcoin go down by 20%, they are not ruined.&#34;On the other hand safe assets — AAA mortgage securities, bank deposits, stablecoins — are not supposed to be risky, and people rely on them being worth what they say they’re worth, and when people lose even a little bit of confidence in them they crack completely. Bitcoin is valuable at $50,000 and somewhat less valuable at $40,000. A stablecoin is valuable at $1.00 and worthless at $0.98. If it hits $0.98 it might as well go to zero. And now it might!&#34;I have in the past told the story of TerraUSD and Luna by saying: The weakness in TerraUSD is Luna. One UST can be exchanged for $1 of Luna, but that only works if people continue to have confidence in Luna; if Luna goes to zero then TerraUSD will follow. But you could also tell the story by saying: The weakness in Luna is TerraUSD. Luna, as the cryptocurrency of a blockchain ecosystem, would rise or fall with the value of that ecosystem. But Luna, as the thing supporting a stablecoin, could go to zero in a week if that stablecoin needed support. Terra was so unstable because it was trying to be stable.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I interviewed with Terraform Labs less than a year ago. The guy interviewing me was a pretty standard eng manager who&#39;d left Amazon for the excitment of a crypto startup. I tried to prep for the interview by researching their white papers to figure out how the various balancing and investment mechanisms actually functioned on a technical level. But it was difficult to make sense of their white paper, which was fairly general, and different portions of their documentation seemed to contradict one another. When I asked what I&#39;d been misunderstanding, he told me that I hadn&#39;t misunderstood anything: their white paper was not a full spec, and their documentation was out of date. In that case, I asked, how could one actually understand the protocol? &#34;It&#39;s probably not possible at this point,&#34; he told me, &#34;These things are in motion all the time.&#34; I thought his answer was pretty eye-opening.Their interview question was: design a simple app which allows one to query the effect of crypto price changes on the supply &amp; price of LUNA. I gathered that the upshot was, how big a movement would be required to break the $1 peg? I wonder if their models weren&#39;t good, or if their models were good, and they were just accepting a high level of risk?"</p>

They are crap companies which make poor and gullible parents enroll their kids in one of their programs for extortionate amount of money. If the parents cannot afford to pay all at once, they give a &#34;loan&#34; to the parents and collect a part of it each month even if the kids aren&#39;t satisfied with the education that is being provided. Note that none of the kids in India use these apps as the only way to study. They attend regular schools and use these apps as an additional source. Byju&#39;s employs 1000s of people whose only job is to go visit as many houses as they can and trick the parents into subscribing for their services by falsely claiming that the only way their kids can succeed is when their education is supplemented by these apps. Many innocent people who want to do all they can to make their kids&#39; lives better fall into the trap and then keep paying the &#34;loan&#34; amount back which could be a substantial part of their monthly income.Meta and Disney invested a lot of money into these companies and they use it to bully anyone who tries to bring these issues up by shutting down their YouTube channels and filing defamation law suits [1,2].

Any application with access to the X11 socket effectively has the keys to the kingdom, because it can hijack other applications, including those running at higher privileges, at will. (There have been halfhearted attempts to address this over the years, but nothing that&#39;s been effective or widely adopted.) The only real solution for desktop app security on Linux is to forbid direct access to X11 entirely, and so it&#39;s a huge deal that Firefox is now able to do this.In general, doing this sort of thing is a monumental undertaking for large applications like Firefox.

But no one ever gets these widgets right (unnatural scrolling, non-identical behavior when clicking in the gapped region, different scrollable-to-nonscrollable widget ratios, colors not respecting certain subtle theming choices, etc, etc.I wonder if there was an alternative specifically for the scrollbar here - some way of obtaining an outer &#34;shell&#34; (via win32k, but then basically &#34;orphaning&#34; it so that you can&#39;t do anything besides kill it when you&#39;re finished) that just provides the window with an empty scrollable element that is then populated by the restricted process.That ship has really sailed though; I think the days of native widgets are quickly coming to an end."</p>

Granted, this is a one-time cost once you get it working, but it&#39;s still a lot to think about and manage over time.I&#39;ve written software rasterizers that fit neatly within 200 lines and provide very flexible pixel shading techniques. Certainly not capable of running a cyberpunk 2077 scene, but interactive framerates otherwise. In the good case, I can go from a dead stop to final frame buffer in &lt;5 milliseconds.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I strongly feel that the spammers thing is smoke and mirrors.The deal at $54.20 was maybe OK for him a month ago (it was great for Twitter because nobody else was interested at that price). Since then, Twitter reported disappointing numbers for the past quarter, and the entire market took a nose dive, with tech hit especially hard.TWTR stock price was in the mid-30s before Musk&#39;s offer. Without the offer, and with the disappointing numbers, and with the recent market development, one could reasonably assume that the stock would be below 30 today.Musk should just pay the break fee of $1bn, and renegotiate for $42.69 or whatever meme number he fancies. Why pay $42bn total for something when you can get it for $30bn."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;&gt;Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of usersHe is asking for proof that spam and fake accounts are less than 5% of total users. He obviously believes the number is much higher[1]. This does not seem to be a deal killer - he is just calling their bluff[2]. Maybe they are right. Maybe not. We will see. Interesting times![1] https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1517215066550116354[2] https://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-estimates-spam-fa..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a lot of talk about how Elon is weaseling out of this. That may be true but you should know something about acquisitions. Typically there is a termination or breakup fee that one side has to pay for walking away or if the deal falls through. AT&amp;T paid billions for the failed takeover of T-Mobile [1], for example.The Musk Twitter deal has a $1 billion termination fee [2] on both sides. Now it&#39;s unclear on what conditions would trigger this exactly. In Twitter&#39;s case, it at least includes accepting another offer. On Musk&#39;s end, it includes if financing falls through.So here&#39;s the $1 billion question: what happens if (as Musk might argue) Twitter made material misrepresentations about their business, specifically to do with how many users they actually have? This might be an out for Musk or it might not.Personally I&#39;ve long thought there are a huge number of fake Twitter accounts and Twitter is actively disincentivized from ever finding out if that&#39;s true or not. Put another way: they like their big numbers for active accounts, DAU and MAU.But if Twitter is found to be materially misrepresenting those numbers, they have way more serious problems than if the Musk deal falls through. They&#39;ve then opened themselves up to litigation by the SEC and investors that they materially misled investors.Things could actually get really ugly for Twitter here regardless of what happens with the Musk deal.If you think about it, this could be a relatively cheap way of mortally wounding Twitter. Make a buyout offer, get access to the books, prove they&#39;re lying about DAU/MAU, walk away with no termination fee paid, watch the executive team get sued into oblivion and the company tanks.[1]: https://money.cnn.com/2011/11/24/technology/att_t-mobile_bre...[2]: https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/26/elon-musks-twitter-deal-in..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work for non-tech generating 100million+ in revenue. Cushy job, fully remote, good pay and full autonomy with flexible hours working as an IC.I recently talked to a startup, similar pay, culture would be a better fit since it was mostly techies and I&#39;m a nerd by nature.....but things just got awkward as soon as I asked about their revenue....they were bleeding money and I was told they were being acquired by a big corp. Also, the tone worried me, the confidence the CEO presented early in the call disappeared.I also tried digging deeper into their business and what they were selling, as I have interest in that space due to my hobbies. I literally didn&#39;t see a need for their startup to exist. But I&#39;m just an average developer what do I know."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has been a long time coming.Back in the day, there was an inherent understanding that a stock price is supposed to reflect &#34;the fundamentals&#34; - present value of the company + future earnings. And of course there was some amount of speculation around future earnings, but for the most part companies at least tried to be profitable.But if you look at the share price of like, Tesla - it&#39;s completely insane. There is no way your slice of the company is worth that much. The stock market has been behaving like a pyramid scheme, where everyone assumed there will be more money entering than leaving any given stock.Tech is a pretty egregious sector because of how many business models basically boil down to &#34;we don&#39;t actually need to make money if we have a desirable stock&#34;. In the long run, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be worse off if the next generation of software companies actually focuses on making products people want to buy rather than play games with DAU and user acquisition and etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"(Former AI researcher / founder here)It always surprises me at the ease at which people jump on a) imminent AGI and b) human extinction in the face of AGI. Would love for someone to correct me / add information here to the contrary. Generalist here just refers to a &#34;multi-faceted agent&#34; vs &#34;General&#34; like AGI.For a) - I see 2 main blockers,1) A way to build second/third order reasoning systems that rely on intuitions that haven&#39;t already been fed into the training sets. The sheer amount of inputs a human baby sees and processes and knows how to apply at the right time is an unsolved problem. We don&#39;t have any ways to do this.2) Deterministic reasoning towards outcomes. Most statistical models rely on &#34;predicting&#34; outputs, but I&#39;ve seen very little work where the &#34;end state&#34; is coded into a model. Eg: a chatbot knowing that the right answer is &#34;ordering a part from amazon&#34; and guiding users towards it, and knowing how well its progressing to generate relevant outputs.For (b) -- I doubt human extinction happens in any way that we can predict or guard against.In my mind, it happens when autonomous systems optimizing reward functions to &#34;stay alive&#34; (by ordering fuel, making payments, investments etc) fail because of problems described above in (a) -- the inability to have deterministic rules baked into them to avoid global fail states in order to achieve local success states. (Eg, autonomous power plant increases output to solve for energy needs -&gt; autonomous dam messes up something structural -&gt; cascade effect into large swathes of arable land and homes destroyed).Edit: These rules can&#39;t possibly all be encoded by humans - they have to be learned through evaluation of the world. And we have not only no way to parse this data at a global scale, but also develop systems that can stick to a guardrail."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wanted wired Ethernet in my office but didn&#39;t want to punch holes in the wall. Luckily I have an old &#34;central vacuum system&#34; that as far as I can tell has never been even powered on, many years before I bought the house.I tied a ping pong ball to a piece of string and used a vacuum cleaner to suck it through the pipes, then used the string to pull a stronger rope and then the Ethernet cable. So now my Ethernet goes from my office to the wireless router via the vacuum ducting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yeah, I&#39;ve never really seen the appeal.  Wires are just so reliable.  I am always in meetings with &#34;sorry, my headphones died, can you repeat that&#34; or people mysteriously vanishing because their laptop can&#39;t charge as fast as Zoom draws power and their computer just dies.  I have a wired mic, headphones, and power, and it just never breaks.Wireless is just temporary, if you have wireless headphones, you have to plug in a wire to charge them.  If your computer has a battery built in, you have to plug it in every day to charge.  So it&#39;s just an extra chore that makes your life worse.  Not that exciting.Maybe everyone fantasizes about being a digital nomad.  I do not.  I have a great desk, chair, keyboard, and 3 monitors.  I couldn&#39;t work without them.  If I want to see the world, I&#39;ll go do that without bringing my computer.  A vacation with your computer is just work.A question I&#39;m asked is &#34;what if there&#39;s a power outage&#34; but we have had about 10 total minutes of power outage here in Brooklyn in the 10 years I&#39;ve lived here (during Hurricane Sandy).  My thought is I just won&#39;t do any work if there isn&#39;t any power.  We waste an hour a day dealing with wireless not working, 10 minutes every 10 years is no big deal.  (&#34;But what if it&#39;s the big one!?&#34;  Then my ISP&#39;s backup batteries will also be drained and I still can&#39;t work.)"</p>

Their efforts at filing down the sharp edges here with the airpods (and they have done as well as anyone could expect and more) don&#39;t change the fundamentals.&#34;Get a dongle&#34; -- maybe I will when I finally give up my original iPhone SE, but I&#39;m not going to be cheerful about paying an extra $30 for the privilege along with the overhead of keeping track of an additional thing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is going to be a polemical comment, but I feel compelled to share it:It&#39;s my opinion that a great deal of the blame (if not the outright majority) for this state of affairs can be levied against suburban culture (and, by extension, car culture).The communities that hand-wring the most about predators and risks to children tend to be middle class, suburban, and white. They drive their children everywhere, and thereby are (somewhat) alienated from the idea of a &#34;local community&#34; beyond the immediate neighborhood (which can only be entered or exited by car.) Things like childcare are purchasable services, not kindnesses that you or your neighbor do for each other when the other&#39;s in a pinch. When this is your bubble (or, for the rest of us, the dominant cultural metaphor for responsible parenting), it&#39;s hard not to see the world as a foreign and scary place, with unknown levels of unknown danger."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Friend of mine runs a local eatery.  She told her 9-year old son to walk across the street - literally to the candy shop where she knows the owner, and told the kid to do some homework for an hour.  Police brought her son back and threatened to charge her with endangerment or abandonment or something similar.  This was... 2018 IIRC.They live about 1.5 miles from the eatery.  She would let her 9 year old walk home sometimes in good weather - low crime with actual tree-lined suburban streets.  Police apparently threatened her over that as well - that&#39;s somehow endangering the child too much, and she might be charged with some misdemeanor.I don&#39;t get it.  Really.  As someone who grew up in the 70s/80s... I can&#39;t say &#39;nothing bad ever happened&#39;.  Obviously it did.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Glad to see progress in this space.I couldn&#39;t find anything describing the paradigm used for the JavaScript frontend. From the video, it looks like things are fully server side rendered, i.e. no client side routing as-in SvelteKit or Next.js? Are the Svelte components hydrated+interactive after page load? In my experience so far with SvelteKit and other SSR+SPA frameworks, there are too many tradeoffs with hydrating then opting to CSR for subsequent navigation. I like the browser&#39;s built-in implementation of navigating between pages because it preserves things like mutations to the document and scroll position out of the box, with no additional JavaScript. If you collapse a comment in this thread, navigate back to the home page, then use your browser&#39;s back button, the comment you collapsed should still be collapsed. In my experience with SPA CSR, you&#39;ll need to track and restore the JavaScript state driving that collapse on your own (a combination of the window.history object and CSR hooks), since navigating back to the page is a full client side re-render of the page.I&#39;ve found Svelte+React have good support for TypeScript, especially for guaranteeing the types of props passed to components, are there plans to support this? With controllers in Go and Views in Svelte/React, is there any way to help with correctness of data passed as props to the Svelte components?"</p>

Iris and the constant drama, was that Iris, I don&#39;t even remember the name...) so it will be pretty interesting to see the reception for that framework.One advice to the author, congrats but don&#39;t call your framework &#34;framework&#34;, it&#39;s like the go community hate that word, just say &#34;a set of useful libraries to help web development&#34;, it seems like euphemisms are easier to swallow for some..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here. Working at a tech company as a developer vs working at a non-tech company are very different.These two types of roles were called line vs staff when I took a business school class and I think the differences between these two types of roles have a big impact on what the job is like, even if doing the same type of work. It&#39;s a bit confusing because it overlaps with &#39;staff software engineer&#39; term.I recall hearing stats before that the vast majority of developers work at non-tech companies, but I almost never hear their stories. They are the dark matter of software developers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been both staff and line at various companies.The biggest downside to staff IME is that you are almost constantly reminded that you are a cost and at danger of being cut.OTOH, the biggest upside is the domain knowledge, and in particular, how companies (ie customers of the line engineers) really deploy and run their systems, which IME is often very different from how the line engineers think they run them.Line engineers tend to gloss over the myriad of external influences that affect how easy their systems are to deploy and integrate (eg how many FTEs doe it take to operate your systems, how long is an acceptable maintenance window for applying fixes, how long does it take to roll back if a fix fails, etc).An experienced staff engineer introduced to a line team can be a huge asset, and will ask the right kind of questions, ie those that the customer is often most interested in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related to this article: The owner of a company (non-startup, but growing and profitable) I used to work for gave me great career advice. He said to always focus on things that produce revenue. If you aren&#39;t doing things that produce revenue, try to move into those areas if possible.His view was that revenue can soar 100%, 200%, 1,000%, 10,000% or however high. Cost savings, on the other hand, can only go down to a maximum of 100% (but obviously much lower in practice). So in his mind, a business-wide focus on growing revenue is always better than a focus on cutting costs. If you are in the second boat, it means the company is struggling and maybe it&#39;s time to get out.Obviously, a rational CEO would see $1m cost savings the same as a $1m gain in profits, but CEO&#39;s are not rational beings (nor is any human) and understanding that they usually prefer higher revenue to lower costs is fundamental to understanding how they value different parts of the company. It&#39;s not fair, it&#39;s just truth (at least in many companies).There&#39;s something refreshing about some hedge funds where portfolio managers are rewarded exclusively on their own performance. For example, if the fund loses money, but you continue to bring in great revenue, you can bet that any sane hedge fund will pay you a lot to stay around, regardless of how they are doing overall. Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately), profit in most companies isn&#39;t directly attributable in the way it is at hedge funds. But the same truth holds. If you are bringing in good profit, it&#39;s hard to get rid of you (or not pay you well) regardless of how the company is doing overall. Try to be in one of those profit centers, if you can."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So there&#39;s two options right - the first is that Parag is for some reason making big strategic decisions about the direction of the company despite the fact that we all know he&#39;ll be gone if the deal closes. Or he&#39;s making big strategic changes at the behest of the acquirers before the deal closes.Neither of these things seem particularly kosher moves to make. The question is how to figure out which one it is.It would seem weird for Parag to be following Musk&#39;s orders given how Musk has behaved. It also seems weird for Musk to already have the insight into the company to know specifically who to fire. There&#39;s not much advantage to making these changes now.On the other hand, going rogue and making big strategic decisions about the company really has the potential to burn Parag&#39;s reputation for wherever he would move next.I guess there&#39;s a third option - that Musk has expressed a specific view, Parag has a different view, but that they both think that this move is necessary anyway so just got on and did it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using Twitter since it&#39;s main novelty was that it was a successful Ruby on Rails app, and honestly I&#39;ve been trying to figure out where the exit is for my personal use of Twitter lately. If the acquisition goes through, Twitter won&#39;t make enough money to service it&#39;s debt, and the things they will do to fix that are pretty much guaranteed to lower the quality of the platform, which frankly has never worked very well for me anyways. The fact that they&#39;re doing a leadership purge right now is not helping my opinion on this.I also think the proposal to have Twitter allow all content that is &#34;legal under US law&#34; is a dangerous idea for the platform being a healthy community that most people actually want to participate in. Content moderation debates have never been so ham-fisted as they are online so I won&#39;t try here, suffice to say there&#39;s some pretty horrible, disgusting things that are &#34;legal under US law&#34; (and as a content moderator, I&#39;ve seen them all). If Twitter allows people to do them, it will make it difficult for Twitter to maintain a healthy community, and the platform could quickly devolve into a scarychan-style sewer that only the craziest people on the internet will want to dwell in.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There was some discussion on plausible NATO membership of Finland and Sweden. At that point the disucssion was based on guestimates from media.But now it&#39;s official. This is not the NATO membership application, but a statement from the political leadership in Finland that they support and suggest parliament proceeds with the application process with maximum urgency.The President and Prime Minister of Finland have published their position on NATO membership. This more or less seals Finland joining NATO.In Finnish system, the Prime Minister has most political power but president is the head of foreign policy. Their common statement was the required signal for the parliament to proceed with the process.Translation:
During the spring, there has been an important discussion about Finland&#39;s possible NATO membership. Time has been needed for domestic position formation both in Parliament and in society as a whole. Time has been needed for close international contacts with both NATO and its member countries, as well as with Sweden. We have wanted to give the debate the space it needs.Now that the time for decision-making is approaching, we also state our own common positions for the information of parliamentary groups and parties. NATO membership would strengthen Finland&#39;s security. As a member of NATO, Finland would strengthen the entire defense alliance. Finland must apply for NATO membership as a matter of urgency. We hope that the national steps still needed to reach this solution will be taken swiftly in the coming days.Sauli Niinistö

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The thing that I think some people miss about Tether is that it&#39;s not about whether it is backed enough it&#39;s either fully backed or it isn&#39;t. If it&#39;s not, it&#39;s not a question of whether it&#39;s back enough to weather this storm, it&#39;s about whether the people running it think they can weather this storm. If they think they can keep it running they&#39;ll sell whatever backing they have and keep the peg. But if they even think there&#39;s a decent chance they can&#39;t permanently sustain the peg then the best thing for them to do is take the backing and run, not sink it into a stable-coin they now know isn&#39;t going to work. That&#39;s going to happen way before they run out of money.Let&#39;s say for example, Tether is 20% backed and there&#39;s $100Bn  of coins so the backing is $20Bn, and people start flooding out of it. Let&#39;s say $10Bn floods out. So the guys running it have handed out $10Bn. They now have $10Bn left, and money is still flooding out. Do they really continue to hand over the cash or do they say &#34;Well, the whole thing is about to explode anyway, I&#39;d rather keep the $10Bn cash I&#39;ve got left&#34;. At which point the holders of the coin have to play &#34;Find these fuckers and sue them&#34; which will be difficult since they&#39;ve got $10Bn to fight/flee/hide."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The entire concept of a &#34;stablecoin&#34; reminds me a lot of something from SIGBOVIK 2014. Keep in mind, this was written in 2014, before any stablecoins actually existed, and that SIGBOVIK is supposed to be a joke conference where people present extremely silly ideas as if they were real breakthroughs.&gt;  DollarCoin: We propose skipping the middleman and providing direct proof-of-dollar with a blockchain that consists of videos of burning US $1 notes. Each video will be unique as the hash of every block header is required to be written on the dollar bill to be burnt; the block header includes the previous block’s hash, which means that each block is forced to build on every previous block, forming a valid blockchainhttp://sigbovik.org/2014/proceedings.pdfThe fact is, people have convinced themselves that this is somehow a good idea. And then half the time, the person behind it doesn&#39;t actually burn any money and just arbitrarily mints coins. It&#39;s absolute lunacy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tether is back up to around $0.98, but volume is high. Somebody is pouring cash into Tether to support the price.Similar over at UST. Price is back up to $0.60, but volume is far above normal.Remember, with a stablecoin, there is no upside to holding. Any indication of risk means it&#39;s time to get out. Even if Tether has enough reserves to get the price back to $1, there will be substantial cashing out.That&#39;s why a stablecoin has only two stable points: 1 and 0."</p>

In my opinion astronomy is jumping the shark with these images by making this a big PR stunt.I&#39;ve looked at their methods for their earlier images and they seem to be hunting for a circle that looks like a black hole in their data. The EHT&#39;s full imaging stack has never been calibrated by looking at a known celestial body to compare images to validate their algorithms. They have calibrated their signals from results of other instruments, but their imaging algorithms change to fit their wanted results. This is my biggest problem with their approach. Anyone can modify algorithms of any arbitrary data to get an image of a glowing circle. A better method that shows a more true image would be to calibrate their imaging algorithms against a known celestial body to make sure their techniques produced comparable results from other instruments. Then they should have taken their calibrated imaging algorithms and gave it data from their target.I&#39;d have more confidence in the EHT if they would not change their imaging algorithms across images and give a side-by-side comparison of a known celestial body that other radio telescopes have imaged to verify their whole imaging stack.To me this a just a big PR stunt and I&#39;m very skeptical of their image."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s scary, because CSAM (child sexual abuse material) is very, very broad, and quite vague in its definition¹. My three year old son stayed with my parents for a week, and he was being taught to swim in their swimming pool. Of course, I get sent pictures and clips of his progress by a proud grandma, and of course, him being a toddler, he felt swimming trunks to be completely optional (and of course, they are at his age in a private pool).That&#39;s not CSAM right? But who knows how the AI will mark those happy pics? Some quirk in its programming and training leading to them being pushed way up whatever ranking is used? It&#39;s a nude child after all, and that is most likely one of the few things such an algorithm can detect quite reliably.The automated filter won&#39;t care about the context though, and if any of the recent failures of algorithms ruining peoples lives are anything to go by (the Dutch Toeslagenaffaire comes to mind), being flagged by the CSAM filter is a high risk event — even if you can clear your name later by human intervention — because now you are on a list.1: People tend to conjure up horrific images of underage children getting raped by adults when they hear &#39;CSAM&#39; or &#39;child pornography&#39;, but when you read up on the legal definitions used it becomes very vague, quite fast. A seventeen year old boy sending a dick pic to his 18 year old lover is producing child pornography and can in many jurisdictions be sentenced as such, and nudism of any minor can be seen as CSAM if the pose they strike can be construed as &#39;erotic&#39; — yet there is no clear definition of what this means, falling squarely into “I&#39;ll know it when I see it” territory."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think this proposal is quite enough, we can do better to protect the children.The homes of the people who champion this proposal should be thoroughly searched for child abuse materials every week. Naturally, their personal electronic devices should be taken for analysis. I understand this may cause them some inconvenience, but think of the children!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The worst thing is that, while the EU proposes dubious stuff like this, the police doesn&#39;t actually try to remove such content from the internet or are at least really ineffective at doing so. There was a documentary[1] from the german public tv station NDR in which reporters / journalists managed to delete the majority of content from one such CSAM forum, by sending deletion requests to the hosters. The police just... did nothing about it? :/It&#39;s mind boggling. It would be nice if only 50% of the energy put into laws with questionable results like this, would be used to give victims of sexual child abuse more help and support (or, in many cases, some at all) to continue living as much as possible despite the monsters in their own heads that such sexual abuse creates, wouldn&#39;t it? :/[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iItLpwkQMUQ

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s less that I&#39;m glad the market is crashing, and more that I&#39;m glad that the insufferable crypto bros are finally getting a punch to the mouth. Seriously, these people are the worst. Your average &#34;crypto investor&#34; has no skills, no mathematical foundations, nothing. Except for pure stupid luck, and the ability to spew inane crypto babble 24/7. And yes, they think they are much smarter than you, because they achieved better financial results than you did while only doing 1/1000 of the work to get there. I truly hate the fact that these people are so rich. It makes me want to move to Alaska and just try to ignore society for the rest of my days.This came off as pretty bitter. I apologize, but I am bitter, and I&#39;m having a shit couple weeks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel bad for people losing money, but crypto has not lived up to its potential at all, remains a solution looking for a problem, and is an environmental disaster.I used to be a huge believer. Brian Armstrong gave me my first Bitcoin in 2011 at District in SOMA. Electricity was included in my rent so I bought 10 video cards and mined for about two years on 5 systems. At a company I founded, I use Bitcoin to pay for food and drinks. According to the Barista, I was the first person to ever pay for coffee with Bitcoin at Coupa Cafe (despite having to stand there and wait 10 minutes while the transaction cleared).But nothing has come of it. All the years of promises and applications, nothing. Ether DApps, sure, but how much of the modern internet runs on those? I also mined StorJ and Monero for years. Apart from a way of making money and storing value, crypto is useless. Processing fees are way too high to even be considered as a replacement for payments not to mention other barriers such as the ability to integrate with antiquated point of sale systems entirely designed around credit/debit and cash.So I put all of my holdings into a retirement account and don&#39;t worry about the price. But I&#39;ve given up on crypto and everyone who babbles on endlessly like they know something I don&#39;t about how it&#39;s going to change the world. So even if Crypto loses its value some, I&#39;m glad because the lack of easy, effortless gains will disappear for a lot of those people and most of these short term hucksters will fade away. I&#39;ll gladly exchange crypto&#39;s price for less crypto bros. My cost basis is around $150 so I have a long ways to go before I care that much."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a Macro crash. SP500 is down -%5 YTD. Meta -37%, Netflix -65%. Lots of pain spreading. You shouldn&#39;t gloat or be happy. Give it a couple of more months like this, and lots of the HN audience would be worried about layoffs.The security of your average software developer job is strongly tied to market cycles.If you want a place to direct your hate and bitterness, I would do it at the architects of the BOOM/BUSTS cycles that keeps happenings and destroys people lives."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve only ever &#34;shipped&#34; two independent projects, and they are the the best things I have ever done for myself in terms of development, both from a personal career growth perspective but even financially.I work at a nonprofit and I had done some ABSURDLY SIMPLE data analysis on a relatively annoying public data set to consume. I&#39;d done it for our institution, but it was sort of straightforward to generalize it to any institution for which this would be applicable. The code was... awful. Rather than doing it &#34;properly,&#34; since I already had all the code I had written to do the analysis for my institution, I literally just ran it on the entire data set (10GB or so) for every organization that existed and then just put some result file on S3. My &#34;site&#34; would just let folks search for their institution, and present the data with a couple graphs, some nice visuals, and have them print it out. I was ashamed of it in a technical sense.But I just bought a domain and tweeted at a journalist. Whelp, two weeks later, I had my picture in the city&#39;s biggest paper, my org got some positive press, did a service for other non-profits, had folks reaching out to me about jobs, etc. It took SO LITTLE effort, and every instinct I had was that it was bad and I shouldn&#39;t publish it. But the reality is I had already done 95% of the work... committing to just do the extra 5% was so hard to do, but in hindsight, so obviously amazing ROI, even if it hadn&#39;t gotten the attention it did.Secondly, I built a reading app for a teacher at my school to let him do an activity where kids would jumble up sentences and paragraphs in order to help them understand transition words. The only reason I agree to try to do this was that I was learning React at the time and wanted to play with the React drag and drop library. After a weekend, I had it essentially working, and it was a success in his classroom. And here, too, it was to be the end of it... but I pushed myself through it, added a simple login mechanic, user account, etc. I had a small technical question as I was wrapping up, and I posted it on reddit. Someone who worked at a nonprofit mentioned to me that the app could potentially qualify for a grant that the Verizon foundation was running for learning apps. I applied... and we got it. The money award helped pay for my entire grad school tuition.Really... just ship it!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A big fallacy that I always see - and that is implied by this post - is that the work ends after shipping, a.k.a. &#34;build it and they will come&#34;. That doesn&#39;t happen any more. So after you &#34;ship&#34; it, you need to promote it, advertise it, create buzz around it and make people use it. 
And that is a totally different kind of beast than coding something.But on the flip side, if you develop a side project just for yourself, you most certainly learn something. Heck, the author explicitly mentioned learning React Native, which is absolutely great and definitely worth investing time into.Learning things is valuable in itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; My app is officially dead.Most markets are large enough to accommodate several businesses. There&#39;s really no reason to stop working on something just because you find that there is already someone solving that same problem. Who knows, they will shut it down at some point, or might head upmarket or pivot to a tangential area."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I noticed this too when I used steam to stream a game to my laptop over good wifi. Every minute it would stutter for a second. I set up iperf3 tests and noticed the wifi lag increasing every minute between my macbook and my server and between my windows desktop pc and my server (when connected over wifi). Of course no lag when using cables, so I reasoned it was wifi related, and had noting to do with my setup (I used different clients, and different AP&#39;s). I then took my macbook (only portable computer I had) it too a nearby coffee shop with good wifi and I could still measure lag spikes every minute. So then I was really puzzled, was there some rogue device interfering with wifi all over the neighborhood? Finally I found a suggestion to turn off location services (or whatever it is called), and the spikes disappeared. And I learnt that even when it is not used (not sure it the lid was closed) a macbook can cause significant interference to the wifi for all other nearby devices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is normal across all wifi clients; they can&#39;t scan for networks and transfer data simultaneously so there will always be increased latency during that event. You can test this yourself by doing a low-interval ping and clicking the wifi icon to show you nearby networks - you&#39;ll notice a brief latency spike.I agree that it&#39;s not a good default to have an app doing this, though."</p>

Instead of panicking, my video-game-induced laser focus kicked in and I calmly piloted the car until the wheels gained traction and I could park the car on the side of the road.But learning how to focus in the midst of chaos, instead of panicking, is a technique I specifically had to learn in childhood to beat challenging levels of Super Mario Brothers.Thanks, video games."</p>

And they aren’t SPIC insured in the situations where crypto is a security.It’s funny to see people shocked (SHOCKED!) when crypto doesn’t have the protections of regular banking and investments. That’s why you don’t invest with stuff that isn’t insured. Those aren’t real rates, they are risk adjusted rates for not having insurance.It’s fine to invest in these products, but scary because people aren’t doing due diligence and have unrealistic expectations.The CEO’s statement that they won’t go bankrupt it just comical. Of course he thinks they won’t. Few bank CEOs think that. But real banks and brokerages have insurance for their customers in the rare situation that they go bankrupt."</p>

And for the product where it most matters.I&#39;m guessing this is a single master database with multiple read replicas. That means it&#39;s not consistent anymore (the C in ACID). Obviously reads after a write will see stale data until the write propogates.I&#39;m a bit curious how that replication works. Ship the whole db? Binary diffs of the master? Ship the SQL statements that did the write and reapply them? Lots of performance and other tradeoffs here.What&#39;s the latency like? This likely doesn&#39;t run in every edge location. Does the database ship out on the first request. Get cached with an expiry? Does the request itself move to the database instead of running at the edge - like maybe this runs on a select subset of locations?So many questions, but no details yet."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, this looks potentially very interesting. Since this is sort of fresh in my mind from the recent Fly post about it:* How exactly is the read replication implemented? Is it using litestream behind the scenes to stream the WAL somewhere? How do the readers keep up? Last I saw you just had to poll it, but that could be computationally expensive depending on the size of the data (since I thought you had to download the whole DB), and could potentially introduce a bit of latency in propagation. Any idea what the metrics are for latency in propagation?* How are writes handled? Does it do the Fly thing about sending all requests to one worker?I don&#39;t quite know what a &#34;worker&#34; is but I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s kind of like a Lambda? If you have it replicated around the world, is that one worker all running the same code, and Cloudflare somehow manages the SQL replicating and write forwarding? Or would those all be separate workers?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I once sent out a proposal on the FreeBSD lists to merge /sbin with /bin, and /usr/sbin with /usr/bin. People were concerned that this would slow down the system, due to PATH lookups taking longer. Even when I demonstrated the opposite was true (it being faster due to fewer directories needing to be scanned), I wasn&#39;t able to get consensus. What a shame."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve read this explanation a couple of times, and if you go all the way back to PDP-11 the split does indeed sound ridiculous. I had my first contact with Linux from some magazine CDs in the late 90s, I think it was Red Hat or SUSE based. The documentation there had a much clearer explaination:/sbin, /usr/sbin is for binaries that need root. You put them in separate directories so their permissions all match up, and so they don&#39;t show up when completing in bash.The paths without /usr - /bin and /sbin - are available from the get go. It is the very first partition that is mounted, and what is guaranteed to be available if you do &#34;init 1&#34; or boot in single user mode. You can also do fsck from there (assuming the boot partition is not damaged). I don&#39;t know how this integrated with initrd (initramfs wasn&#39;t a thing yet). I think there was only one &#34;base system&#34; - either initrd was very basic, or the whole base was in initrd, or something similar.The paths with /usr were managed by the package manager. Word of mouth was: don&#39;t install anything manually there. If you do (via make install), keep around the source so you can do make uninstall. But better install to /usr/local or /opt."</p>

My life is much worse now, I went into that job healthy and strong and now I&#39;m sick all the time. Perhaps celaic disease was always in the genetic cards for me, or maybe the stress triggered it? The worst part is the job wasn&#39;t especially bad, it was a reasonable job, and I can expect my next job to have similar stress I think. What am I going to do?I&#39;m always amazed at the change in perspective after being in a job for a while. While unemployed, I feel competent, I make progress on hard problems nobody else in the world is working on, and I feel good. While employed, stupid crap stresses me constantly, I can&#39;t leave the stress at work, I bring it home, I obsess about social hierarchies that can vanish in an instant. Everytime I&#39;ve left a job I&#39;m amazed that after just a couple days I can barely remember what I was working on before and what stressed me, like my brain knows all of that no longer matters and let&#39;s it go in an instant.How can I keep a healthy outside perspective while remaining employed?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; In 2020, the pandemic destroyed bucket #3 for most people. We were no different. Friends from back home in Canada couldn’t visit us. Even meeting up with local friends became hard. In January 2021 I tore my achilles tendon playing pick-up basketball. There goes bucket #2.&gt; Only then did I realize bucket #1 had been running low for a while.I&#39;m somewhat puzzled. If the author is struggling to socialize with friends (bucket #3) and struggling to pay attention to physical health (bucket #2) then why does he think that this is going to help improve work-life balance:&gt; I work more hours. I’m more likely to be working in the evening or on the weekend now.I can empathize with the desire to get caught up in a high-energy startup (it&#39;s fun!) but this whole blog post reads like someone trying to replace an increasingly disappointing personal life with excessive workaholism. Filling your days with extra work can fill the &#34;bucket #1&#34; (career) but it seems like a nail in the coffin for the author&#39;s problems with bucket #2 (physical health) and bucket #3 (social life).Posts like this are a dream come true for investors and startup founders. &#34;Lacking satisfaction in your life? Come work harder for less money at someone else&#39;s startup!&#34; I suspect this blog post is going to become a staple on VC Twitter and in startup recruiting pitches for the next few years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bias up front: I work at Google.Something I try to do whenever I read articles like this: Whenever you see the name of the giant corporation that the author worked at, replace it with &#34;my team&#34;. Google has over 100,000 employees, so there&#39;s no real &#34;here&#39;s what it&#39;s like to work at Google&#34;. At that scale, there is too much variance for any simple neat summary (though there are certainly trends and commonalities).I&#39;ve met people who worked at Amazon who described it as a hellscape of misery and others who felt it was incredibly rewarding. There&#39;s been times when I worked at EA when I loved my job and times when I hated it.A single data point is useful, but it&#39;s only a single data point. I&#39;m glad the author found a better job that fits what they&#39;re looking for. That&#39;s all any of us really want in our careers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What will the author blog in 5 years?I am noticing a (darkish?) pattern in these recurring “I transitioned jobs” reports. Worryingly, they represent many of the words I imagine myself writing if I were again a blogger.It’s basically the honeymoon/wanderlust cycle. Person gets job. It is a dream job. It is described as a dream job because of reasons a1, b1, and c1. Delta t passes. Things have changed. Because of reasons x1, y1, and z1, job is no longer a good dream job. It’s now a bad dream/nightmare job. Person has awakened now, and for reasons, a2, b2, and c2 is living a new dream. Blink, flinch, repeat.The nagging suspicion is that while things change, they don’t so much actually. They shift around. What does change is how we come to see things. At one point, we convince ourselves things are awesome. Later we believe it’s not. Which is the real truth we ought to accept? It’s like trying to measure the one way speed of light. You can’t, just the sum of the round trip.So do we make the assumption that somewhere in the middle of this good-to-bad cycle is the reality? Or suspect it was always that bad, we were just able to initially gaslight ourselves? Or perhaps that it was and still is good, we’ve just let the negatives creep in and take over?Some would philosophize that all happiness is an illusion. Or a choice. Or whatever.But what frustrates me about this (having been through this cycle 3-4 times now), is that it is not a universal life experience. I have relationships with family, friends, and various institutions that grow stronger and stronger over time. They do NOT loop like work relationships do. Is there something inherit in work relationships that makes this loop inevitable? Do all experience it, or only a certain mindset of persons? Are there cases where this loop is broken, but they just rare enough, you don’t hear about them? Should I despair or hope?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Despite many maturity issues in practice Flutter is the only realistic option for true cross platform UIs that run everywhere. Apart from Qt , but the licensing issue is a hindrance. And yes, the web backend isn&#39;t ideal, but it will improve over time.I just wish Google had built Flutter on a low level core that isn&#39;t tied to Dart, so it would be usable from other languages.Dart isn&#39;t horrible and is getting better, but it is still a somewhat awkward mish mash of Java and JavaScript,  and  I  don&#39;t really enjoy using it.The only reason to use Dart is Flutter, which really hurts ecosystem health / library availability and prevents code sharing with the backend."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was recently tasked to build a mobile app at my work, that would have maybe 5% of the feature-set of our gargantuan web product. However, this 5% was mission critical. Coming from React-TS, building with Flutter was a bit weird at first (where&#39;s my CSS???) but the productivity gains came quickly. The Pub ecosystem is fairly mature, in that all the third party packages are pretty high quality and address most common use cases. Unlike npm where there are 10+ solutions for the same problem, there will only be one - maybe 2 in Flutter land.I was very pleased to find out, that Flutter supported web as well. Now, it&#39;s not as good as mobile yet - some of the animations are render blocked by the JS main thread - but it is a very nice &#39;middle&#39; solution to somebody who needs to use the app who doesn&#39;t have iOS or Android (for example, Surface tablet). Also great for internal testing - push up the latest changes to a dev web environment, and everyone can test without installing APKs or using TestFlight.In my use case, I was actively discouraged against making something that looked beautiful or pretty - the software is designed to be spartan, minimalist and essential. Flutter is perfect for that.All in all, Flutter is awesome. Is it the right answer for everything? No. But when you only have one developer to spare whose job it is to build a mobile app, it&#39;s perfect for that. The web support is a nice bonus - haven&#39;t tried any of the desktop stuff yet.Dart, as a language, is nice. Not spectacular, but certainly tidier than Java or JavaScript. I&#39;ve gotten used to functionality programming, so writing everything in classes was jarring at first."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Flutter 3 comes with an upgrade to Dart 2.17 [1], which has quite a few improvements as well... including state on enums.While that&#39;s great, I was hoping it would be like in Rust, where each enum variant can declare its own state components, but unfortunately it seems to be more like Java: same state for all variants.Well, at least there&#39;s quite a few other small but useful improvements... and they showed how they really listen to the community by implementing the new syntax for passing on constructor parameters to a super-class... and by improving the docs of the 200 most popular packages with lots of examples, as requested by the people.I like how they&#39;re listening to the community as well to implement meta-programming (like macros) [2] to solve the main pain point, currently, in Dart, which is how verbose it is to generate code for things like serialization and data types.Once they get that, Dart will be a really good language to work on (it&#39;s already quite ok IMO, despite most people, usually those who don&#39;t actually use it much, hating on it).[1] https://medium.com/dartlang/dart-2-17-b216bfc80c5d[2] https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/1482"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve recently heard about this YouTube account named Roel Van De Paar. If you&#39;ve looked up any error message on YouTube recently, you&#39;ve probably run into him. Because of the &#34;no dislikes&#34; change, he&#39;s everywhere now.And by everywhere, I mean EVERYWHERE. The account has over 2 million videos. Approximately 0.2% of ALL videos on the ENTIRE platform of YouTube can be attributed to this account, and if you check now they&#39;ve probably uploaded a few videos in the past couple minutes. The videos are generated crap, ripped from tech forums. Normally you wouldn&#39;t see it anywhere due to dislikes being easy to spot, but now they pop up all the time in search results due to dislikes becoming a sort of &#34;hidden feature&#34;.Hiding dislikes = less people press dislike (no feedback) = low quality videos are much harder to get rid of in search results. It&#39;s really, really bad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t personally think the dislike button is the explanation. But something seems to have changed in the Youtube recommendations algo in the last few weeks.In my experience, the algo has gotten very noticeably worse recently:- Recommending lots of 6 - 12 year old videos on topics I&#39;m interested in (who cares about a 12 year old product review?)- Recommending tons of videos I&#39;ve already seen or recommending really, really old videos from people I normally watch. It&#39;s always done this, but it seems worse recently.- Trying to push &#34;streamer bro&#34; meme videos on me, which seem aimed at 12 year old kids- The algo seems to be really clinging to recommending only videos about the last few topics I searched and totally forgetting my main interests. Look up a video on a new car you just bought? Congratulations, Youtube will now recommend you every video ever produced about that car forever to the exclusion of whatever it is you are actually interested in even if you have never shown an interest in cars.Maybe someone who works at Youtube knows if a new recommendation system was pushed out recently or something? It&#39;s miserable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only explanation for getting rid of dislike count that makes sense to me is to make big brands happy as their videos can&#39;t be made to look bad with a high dislike count and they can&#39;t be &#34;dislike bombed&#34; for things that may be unrelated to the content (eg the recent Activision-Blizzard scandals).Why? Because in every other way (and every way for the viewer), this makes Youtube worse. So it&#39;s a hell of a price to pay to appease big corporate interests. That&#39;s why I have such a hard time comprehending this move.It definitely changes how people use the dislike button since there&#39;s no feedback for it. Maybe that too was by design? It&#39;s true that people are generally terrible at using dislikes and downvote buttons. Ieally it would be a quality indicator but really it&#39;s just used for &#34;I don&#39;t like what you&#39;re saying&#34;, &#34;I don&#39;t like you&#34; or &#34;I don&#39;t like something about you&#34;. And that&#39;s probably not a great signal.Side note: for anyone with such functionality, it would probably greatly improve the overall user experience to identify these low-indicator downvoters and shadowban them. Don&#39;t take away the downvote UI. Just make it do absolutely nothing as in it shows them they downvoted / disliked but just don&#39;t count it for anything. These people are toxic.Anyway, I actually hope to see more low-quality generated content on Youtube as it&#39;s probably going to be the only thing that causes this decision to be reversed."</p>

To use the article&#39;s definitions:* &#34;Bootstrapped from zero&#34; is, of course, founder-friendly - no investors and no board means you get to do what you want!* &#34;Raised $100M+ from VCs&#34; is also pretty founder-friendly, at least in the early days, because you&#39;re selling those VCs on the lottery-ticket dream that they could earn 3-5 orders of magnitude ROI. With such an incredibly high upside, VCs and angels are willing to take risks with zero due diligence on unproven founders and small dilution.If you remove the long tail of upside from the possible outcomes and tell your early investors &#34;the best case for you is 100x return, but zero is still just as possible&#34; then the market will compensate in these ways:* Less availability of capital* More dilution* Less faith in &#34;visionary founder&#34; CEOs and more desire by investors to bring in professional management* Long and protracted due diligence processes before the check even landsAll of that is fine! There&#39;s nothing wrong with building a business this way. But there&#39;s no free lunch here - companies that don&#39;t chase astronomical outcomes will have a harder path to getting those first few dollars in funding."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This post is describing a structural issue on the funding side of new ventures: -- bootstrapping is very hard- traditional credit/loans aren&#39;t structured well for the &#34;mid&#34; type risks of starting software businesses (not much collateral)- and on the VC side there is much less opportunity for the Unicorn 1 in 10 exits.Tackling this problem are two funds that I didn&#39;t see mentioned in either the article or the comments so far: TinySeed and Calm Fund.https://tinyseed.com/thesishttps://calmfund.com/shared-earnings-agreementBroadly both invest much less than a traditional VC would and are compensated differently. The details are different (and matter) between the two but it&#39;s more along the lines of profit sharing than looking for big exits."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Progressive causes are near and dear to my heart. I am a feminist and staunch Democrat. As a federal public defender turned law professor, I have spent my career trying to make change in a criminal legal system that is riven with racism and fundamentally unfair to those without status and financial resources. Yet, as someone who understands firsthand that the fundamental rights to free speech and due process exist only as long as competent lawyers are willing to vigorously defend extreme positions and people, I view the ACLU’s hard-left turn with alarm. It smacks of intolerance and choosing sides, precisely what a civil-liberties organization designed to defend the Bill of Rights is meant to oppose.What an incredibly level headed take. It&#39;s so level headed that it seems fake when projected onto the landscape of modern political discourse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"ACLU membership and staff have always been fairly left, but they were impressively focused on (IMO) the most important civil rights as rights through their work at ACLU, and largely kept their personal politics out of that.  A &#34;mission driven organization&#34;, as it were.  Pretty sad to see what&#39;s happened over the past few decades (accelerating; not sure when it started, but it got really bad around 2012-2016, and then far worse).  They always believed in &#34;all civil rights except 2A&#34;, but I could overlook that since there are other 2A-specific organizations.I still support them on specific issues, but they&#39;re often on the anti-liberty side on other issues, or just actually crazy. Sad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here is the testimony of the ACLU for this trial, if you&#39;re curious about it. I watched it live and was beside myself. There are a lot more shenanigans than listed in the article. It&#39;s important to listen to the actual words spoken and changes in voice, see the facial expressions, watch the dancing around the questions, hear the contradictions.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRkLmKJCKbw"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is a part of me that wants to abandon streaming services and just buy a couple of albums per month based on what I think might be cool. I find myself enjoying music significantly less now I have unlimited access to everything I could ever want. It’s become disposable; just background noise rather than something I’m actively experiencing.There is also a part of me that wants to take those albums and keep them on an old click-wheel iPod. I always thought the early iPod nanos were among the best consumer hardware devices ever made. Just the right mix of boxy and round; small enough to be novel (at least at the time), but large enough to still be perfectly usable. Unfortunately, finding one that both holds a charge and isn’t battered to all hell is quite difficult these days, and even so, it’s much harder to justify a single use device for music when I literally always have my phone with me.As someone who was a teen when the iPod really started taking off, it was a constant presence during the time music was starting to become an important part of my life. Sad to see it go, even though really it’s been gone since the iPhone launched."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a 6th gen iPod Classic that I used for almost 15 years before it finally died on me a few months back. Dedicated music players nowadays are a niche market, so it was really hard to find a replacement. I ended up getting a FiiO M5, and while it&#39;s definitely got some pros -- much better sound quality, can pop in a 512GB/1TB SD card for effectively infinite space for compressed songs, can play FLAC/WAV/OGG -- the ergonomics of the iPod were just so much better. It&#39;s funny how seemingly little things can be so frustrating: there&#39;s only enough space on the screen for 4 names at a time, the scrolling isn&#39;t adaptive so it takes forever to get to the bottom, the play order isn&#39;t consistent with the song display order within a folder... I used to love just browsing my music collection on my iPod on the train to work, but with the M5 I&#39;ll just pick an album or playlist and press play. It&#39;s just not as fun to flip through music.I don&#39;t consider myself an Apple fanboy, but the iPod was a rock solid product that got all of the little things right. Given that the market for standalone DAPs is tiny because most people today just use their phones and music streaming apps, it&#39;s unlikely that we&#39;ll ever see a music player that compares to it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What a press release: the actual main message -- iPod touch is being discontinued -- has been weasel-worded out of the entire text, to the point that a non-native reader of English wouldn&#39;t even be able to decipher what it&#39;s trying to say.I get that it&#39;s second nature for corporate marketing to try to dampen the message when they&#39;re taking something away, but this is on a whole new level."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Honestly I prefer Apple Maps over Google these days. This is mostly opinion and feel, but it &#34;feels&#34; like:* Google is becoming less correct- ex: &#34;use the right 3 lanes&#34; when only the right 2 lanes work* Google is taking me on routes that are much less safe and more challenging- ex: taking small side roads to a left turn onto a busy road with poor visibility and no light rather than right turns to the main road and signaled lefts* Google is hammering me with unimportant details- ex: I don&#39;t care that I&#39;m on the fastest route- ex: I don&#39;t care that something 4 hours away has a traffic jam- ex: I don&#39;t need to be told to stay on just because an exit ramp has a disappearing lane* Google tries to send me on wild boondoggles literally all the time. It sends me off highway in an attempt to avoid traffic, along with several other poor lost souls who are aimlessly listening to the same computer as me while we drive through some rural thru street.So I stopped using google. Apple isn&#39;t perfect but it&#39;s unsurprising for long road trips and provides reliable instruction that follows major road paths."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ok, so I guess Apple Maps is the new DDG. By this I mean, every DDG related thread immediately descends into anecdotes about &#34;Google Search is terrible, DDG is much better&#34; that always leaves me wondering &#34;Are you using the same Google Search I am? Because it doesn&#39;t appear you are&#34;.Google Maps&#39; integration with, say, various forms of public transit APIs (in paritcular) is second to none. Like, it&#39;s not even close. It&#39;s true Apple Maps is a lot better than it was but most of those improvements, in my experience, have been very US-centric, meaning the gap is much, much wider in other countries. Google Maps listings are still way better.What I suepect is that the same people who have decided they hate Google have now let that define their opinions on Apple vs Google Maps just like they have with DDG vs Google Search.I can only recall two current complaints I have with Google Maps:1. I&#39;ve come across a listing that claims to be a supermarket chain. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s a local market. I&#39;ve filed corrections about this. A year later it still shows the wrong supermarket chain. No idea why. You can see it on street view; and2. Maps decided to hijack the Menu tab on restaurants to use an ML pipeline from someone who really wanted to get promoted by classifying photos tagged at that location into menu items instead of, you know, just showing me the menu PDF on the website.Oh and while I&#39;m airing complaints, there&#39;s a standard for showing exchange rates. Google &#34;GBP to USD&#34; and you&#39;l get an answer of 1.23 (as of this writing). By the standard the entire finance industry uses this should be shown to 4 decimal places. It used to up until about 6 years ago. Someone changed it. It&#39;s clearly wrong. It&#39;s annoying. And if anyone from Google reads this, please fix this for God&#39;s sake.Unrelated to Maps but you have to try."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I prefer Apple Maps in absolutely every way except their business info. Many businesses are missing, listed but no longer operating, or have incorrect/outdated business hours and other metadata. I do my best to add or correct info via the in-app crowdsourcing interface, but it often takes a long time for the information to be reflected if at all.That being said, it’s hard to compete with Google on data munging. Besides, if I’m actually looking for info on a business besides it’s location, I’d just Google it or visit its website anyways—especially post-pandemic as businesses close, open, and change hours so frequently."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Microservices was always a solution to the organisational problem of getting more developers working on a system at once. A lot of people working on one code base over the top of each other often causes problems and issues with ownership. The solution was services independently developed with the trade off cost being increased complexity on a range of things.There is an essay in the mythical man month about Conways law and microservices are very much about a way to use Conways law to achieve scale of development. You likely don&#39;t need microservice until you hit a scale where the monolith is a real pain point. You can probably cope with a monolith especially with some reasonable design effort up to the 100 developers maybe more with a lot of separation but at some point in the &gt;25 developers range it becomes cheaper and easier to switch to multiple deployed units of software and deal with the increased system complexity and interface designs and the inherent versioning issues it causes.It is easier to start with a monolith, find the right design and then split on the boundaries than it is to make the correct microservices to begin with."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Come to Erlang/Elixir (and OTP), you get the best of both worlds:  - a mono repository
  - a single codebase for a single system
  - your micro services are supervisors and gen servers (and a few other processes) in a supervision tree
  - you decide which erlang node run which apps
  - your monolith can scale easily thanks to libcluster and horde
  - ...

Also, there is the midpoint between monolith and micro service, and this is called Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), you could have:  - a DAL (Data Abstraction Layer) service
  - a Business Logic service (talking to the DAL)
  - an API (talking to the Business Logic service)
  - a Frontend (talking to the API)

Your API (or gateway, or whatever you want to call it) can serve as glue for third-party services (like Stripe, or anything unrelated to your business).Microservices are a solution for an organizational problem, not a tech one. You need multiple teams to work on the same system without blocking each others. This is a solution for huge corporations, not your 2 pizzas team startup."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The monolith vs microservice debate always seemed so misguided to me. It seems exactly like vim vs emacs. Or ruby vs python. The arguments are always the same.* &#34;In vim I can do this in 3 keystrokes, in emacs it takes 5!&#34; (where &#34;this&#34; is some vim-idiomatic thing you&#39;d never do in emacs).* &#34;Ruby leads to bad programs, I have inherited a legacy ruby codebase and you wouldn&#39;t believe what they did...&#34; / &#34;Python leads to bad programs, I have inherited a legacy python codebase and you wouldn&#39;t believe what they did...&#34;* My team took a python/ruby app and rewrote it ruby/python, and now it&#39;s 99% faster and our productivity is way higher!What I&#39;m hinting at is this: You can write a bad or good microservice or monolith. The rules are different. You&#39;ll have different frustrations and tradeoffs. You&#39;ll have to play to the architecture&#39;s strengths and avoid it&#39;s weaknesses. You&#39;ll NEED institutional standards to keep people from doing the wrong thing for the architecture model and making a mess."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Last years, using MVC framework was not an option as soon as you wanted a dynamic front-end. Having to reload a full page for every user action leads to a bad user experience and is indeed, not acceptable in 2022.When it&#39;s needed, fine.But there are so many SPAs that just don&#39;t need to be. Rendering HTML server-side is just nice. It&#39;s simple and easy to work with. Weird states are unusual. The user gets a really normalized, predictable experience. And done well/quickly, there&#39;s little actual difference.Maybe I&#39;m just showing my age. This falls really close to my &#34;I miss the old web&#34; type sentiments. The last thing I built, and the next thing I will build, are purposely doing full page renders for any actions (no jQuery or React/SPA stuff). I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to have any javascript at all. It&#39;s really fun and lean. I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s just got me going lately--reminds me of when I was starting out.My last project is 300 lines of python, 270 lines of php, html/css of course, postgresql, and cron. Some scrapers run, ingest data, and the php sorts and displays it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The big MVC frameworks are in a great position to take advantage of the move back to hypermedia as a major network model for web development.  We are seeing a swing back to this model with modern hypermedia-oriented libraries like unpoly, hotwire and my own htmx, where javascript is used to augment the hypermedia model rather than replace it with a client-server RPC-style network model as with most SPAs.These older frameworks have been honed to a razors edge for producing hypermedia (HTML) server side and delivering it to clients efficiently.  As people begin to realize just how much you can achieve with this approach (and the simplicity it brings back to web development) I expect interest in these frameworks to soar.Bullish on 2005 tech books!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;But as a general rule, I think we must not discard a technology just because it&#39;s old. Doing so because it&#39;s too new would make more sense, if you want to build stuff for businesses.Agree with the first statement but, not necessarily on the second.People dismissed React for being &#34;too new&#34; or &#34;the latest stupid shiny new framework&#34; for a long time because they didn&#39;t understand it. But when I read about it for the first time, I understood the problem it was solving with the VDOM. It made perfect sense for me to start using it immediately because it quickly starts saving a lot of time formerly spent on writing DOM setting/resetting code and making sure it never breaks. It was something I was already thinking about: &#34;how could I avoid writing all this tedious DOM manipulation code&#34;. And there it was, and I knew it would become big. It took a while for the rest of the world realize it, but eventually it caught on.Sometimes tools pop up that make perfect sense. So you shouldn&#39;t dismiss any technology for its age, whether it&#39;s old or new."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; SQLite isn&#39;t just on the same machine as your application, but actually built into your application process. When you put your data right next to your application, you can see per-query latency drop to 10-20 microseconds. That&#39;s micro, with a μ. A 50-100x improvement over an intra-region Postgres query.This is the #1 reason my exuberant technical mind likes that we use SQLite for all the things. Latency is the exact reason you would have a problem scaling any large system in the first place. Forcing it all into one cache-coherent domain is a really good way to begin eliminating entire universes of bugs.Do we all appreciate just how much more throughput you can get in the case described above? A 100x latency improvement doesn&#39;t translate directly into the same # of transactions per second, but its pretty damn close if your I/O subsystem is up to the task."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Or, just make devices not so power hungry.I got this fancy tire gauge+filler.  It uses a couple coin batteries.  They live around 6 months with it &#34;off&#34;.  I use it a couple times a year, so basically every time I go to use it it is dead.  Removing the batteries requires disassembly.  A year or so ago I soldered in a couple AA batteries in place of the coin batteries, it&#39;s been good so far, but I&#39;m waiting to see.On the other hand, I have a Mitutoyo caliper, which also uses a couple coin batteries.  I sometimes forget to turn it off when I put it back in the case, and so far, over 6+ months, it hasn&#39;t run the batteries out.So it CAN be done.  Both devices are basicaally the same: LCD display and they measure a sensor.Back when I was in HS, I had a Casio calculator watch, but it ate through batteries (3-6 months IIRC). The bracket for the strap broke, so I just taped it up in my locker.  Soldered it to a D battery, and never had to replace it again.  :-)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked in this industry for many years. The railroads were always hyper-focused on increasing throughput. I left the industry about ten years ago, but back then derailments were considered the most significant risk to average network speed. At the time, average network speed was roughly correlated with profit. The rule of thumb was a 1 mph increase in average network speed was worth about $100MM in profit. That was 15 years ago.There were a lot of systems in place to monitor rolling stock:- Wheel Impact Detectors- Hotbox detectors- Acoustic bearing detectors- Truck performance detectorsTo name just a few. There were also efforts to monitor the railway infrastructure. The things I remember:- Rail stress management (rails need to be under the right amount of stress, which of course varies with temperature)- Top of rail friction management- Rail profile management (the name eludes me, but the idea is you want the interface between the rail and wheel to meet certain parameters)I worked on the rolling stock side measuring wheel impacts, overloads, imbalances, and a handful of more esoteric metrics. One of the outputs of these measurements was a train consist. For each of our locations we were able to build up the consist of the entire train (which was a fun CS problem in itself).I stared at a lot of consists over the years. In North America I never saw anything longer than about 100 cars and 2-4 locos. However, in Northwest Australia they routinely ran 300 car trains meeting the description in this article. But, the reason they could get away with that is they were running a straight shot from the heart of the Pilbara to one of the port towns on the north west shoulder (Karratha and Port Hedland).I need to check in with my old colleagues and see if things have changed. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if train lengths have gotten longer, but I would be surprised if this correlated with a large increase in derailments, as that would have a tremendous impact on average network speed and thus profit.As someone mentioned elsewhere on this thread, there are a lot of single track corridors. It&#39;s bad enough when one train has to sidetrack. It&#39;s really bad when a train takes out the whole corridor. These aren&#39;t packet switched networks. It&#39;s not easy to reroute. And it&#39;s really expensive and difficult to lay new rail."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I also live in Ames, Iowa, where the author resides. I live less than a mile from the track segment he is talking about, owned and operated by Union Pacific. While I&#39;m pretty skeptical of this author&#39;s individual concerns given the twice-removed nature of the statements from their &#34;source&#34;, trains have unmistakably gotten longer during my 15 years near these tracks, and they are moving faster.A hazmat situation impacting only a one-mile radius around the tracks could effect up to 30 to 40 thousand people here. I interned for Union Pacific while in college, and yes, the company will state that safety is their number one priority, but it was very clear that their business was to profit by optimizing every single little part of their business for maximum efficiency. The company has an open distain for regulations, especially safety-related regulations, and did not shy away from sharing those views internally. I would not be at all surprised if crews are being abused, and safety sidelined, for the sake of maximizing profit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; For myself: I believe it is Wall Street greed and investor demands. 16,450-foot trains weighing more than 42 million pounds are gratifying someone with power. Someone who wants it all and more. I believe it is those few, who live nowhere near here, who own their own private islands and jets. This is far removed from laissez faire economics, or the neo liberal model, coming out of the 1980s.This was an incredibly common economic outlook coming from the Midwest and South. It&#39;s both tickling and sad to hear. I do love the way this was written, and those PSR trains sound like a nightmare. When I worked the network engineering desk for a Class I railroad we took derails seriously to the extent of pulling anyone who made changes to infra to the dispatchers themselves. That wasn&#39;t that long ago either but it sounds like a lot has changed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The new typeface is nice, providing the required feel without succumbing to cliche, but now whoever is actually using it to typeset titles isn&#39;t doing any kerning! This makes the title look like it is supposed to be &#34;Avata R&#34; (the typographer almost certainly did create proper kerning in the font, but as soon as you start messing with different sizes and increasing the tracking, the kerning is going to have to be adjusted as well, and that wasn&#39;t done).It&#39;s like James Cameron said &#34;Fine! I won&#39;t let my guy I had make the titles last time choose the font, we&#39;ll have a new font made. But I want the my guy to do the rest of the title work, because he&#39;ll still do it for just a crew jacket.&#34;https://www.creativebloq.com/news/avatar-way-of-water-logoAnyway, I quite appreciate the WIP sketches, it makes it plain what the influences are: the bones of the letters are somewhat reminiscent of typefaces like Lithos or Penumbra, and the slight blobbiness of terminals and serifs (which might otherwise be classified as either wedge or flare serifs) subtly recall both Papyrus and some &#34;runic&#34; typefaces. The &#34;runic&#34; influence shows up in some other details as well, like the &#39;v&#39; of the A&#39;s crossbar. The rejected &#34;too extreme&#34; lowercase has a hint of Fraktur or something similar.Like Papyrus, though, this is most certainly a display font.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Preview is one of those essential things that sets macOS apart from the other operating systems, and contributes to that “Mac has good UX” vibe. Last time I opened the Windows equivalent, it tried to sell me on Microsoft’s PDF-alike format… and asked me to connect Office365.Another tiny macOS feature I love is that you can drop a file icon on any Open or Save dialog to select the file in the dialog. On other OSs, this moves the file to the directory shown in the dialog, or does nothing. On Windows, I install Listary to get the same features https://www.listary.com/There are so many other little macOS things that make it easier to work in the GUI - but on HN they’re all overshadowed by the big “wow window management on Mac is 90s unless you install an app” issue, which makes me sad. I’m hoping that the post-Ive Apple - an Apple more comfortable with “pro” users and beauty in utility versus form - will try to fix that one… and bring back all the good Mission Control stuff from Snow Leopard (which IMO is the greatest OS ever released)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really enjoyed working with the Preview team before I retired from Apple. My small group created a private framework that added &#34;document reconstruction&#34; to PDF documents: basically an inferred DOM based on whatever information (mainly geometric) we could use in the PDF document.Our moment of fame game at WWDC 2009, when Bertrand Serlet talked about Snow Leopard during the Keynote. At around the 5:10 mark he talks about performance improvements to Preview. He then goes on to say &#34;There are also lots of little touches. The one I like is about text selection in PDF files. .... In Snow Leopard, we have used a little bit of AI to infer the structure of the document....&#34; (He then demonstrates intelligent selection across columns) [Applause from the audience]. (https://youtu.be/FTfChHwGFf0?t=306)My colleague and I presented the proposal to add this &#34;little bit of AI&#34; to a small group from the Graphics and Imaging department. Bertrand was in attendance, and it was thanks to him that we joined G&amp;I. They were a fantastic team to work with!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People also forget that you can use Preview to scan documents from your scanner rather than using whatever shitty software came with yours.Also, Preview &gt; File &gt; Import from iPhone &gt; Scan Documents gives you a virtual scanner instead of having to install one of those &#34;scanner&#34; apps on your phone. Its built into your iPhone already!I also use it frequently to change image file types.You can also make a digital version of your signature from a picture of physical version.There&#39;s just tons of small features that work well."</p>

So many grocery and convenience stores in the city have no posted prices for any items, even in the airport. As a foreigner I was pretty shocked but the people I talked to said it was pretty much normal and there’s nothing really that can be done.

Here in Germany they can be often seen as garbage truck or fire fighting truck[2] in the cities. An BEV version was announced[3].On the other hand, even tallest semi trucks (here 40 tons class) are allowed to roll through German cities widely. They are often involved in accidents with pedestrians or bicylclists with fatal outcome. The main reason is bad sight when turning right. Therefore turning assistants[3] will become mandatory.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I sat on a citizen&#39;s jury about cycling a few years ago and one speaker we heard from (in our lead up to working on recommendations) was from the trucking industry. We knew trucks had poor visibility, that cyclists could get knocked over and swept under the trailer, etc but this guy was an absolute buck-passer and unfortunately he had the rest of the jurors spellbound with irrelevant excuses. He&#39;d admitted that &#39;skirts&#39; on the side of the trucks would make a difference, but there was zero appetite for that change because obviously it would cost transport companies money.Even just better visibility with the side windows has to be fairly achievable.That said, I have a lot of respect for truckers here in Australia. In my experience, they&#39;re some of the more responsible drivers on the road, through sheer mileage and consideration of their heft. They&#39;ll almost always signal when it&#39;s safe to overtake, through necessity they&#39;re wary brakers and so on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The video interview at the bottom of the article discusses the source of capital for this enterprise to &#34;keep&#34; the peg. The interviewee claims that the source of the capital was basically a crowdfund. The team issued a lot of the tokens, kept a lot of it (about 1/2), and sold the rest. Perpetual motion is possible in finance, but you need fancy licenses and government appointments to do it. These guys are going to prison.This thing isn&#39;t just one token, but apparently at least three. One of them (Anchor) claims a 20% yield on savings. This alone should be a red flag because that&#39;s about 1900 basis points above what you can expect to get from a good savings account or short-term treasury.I don&#39;t have time to dive into the Rube Goldberg machine that this thing appears to be, but when it ends, it will end very badly.Every Bitcoin era seems to have its Ponzi scheme.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"So we&#39;ve been in one of the longest bull markets in modern history. I have been amazed at the wilful ignorance of Crypto Andys when it comes to why financial markets, the financial system, central banking, debt and debt markets are the way they are.There&#39;s a certain delight [1] in watching increased market volatility exposing how understanding merkle trees and consensus protocols doesn&#39;t make you an expert on what the financial system is, how it works and why it is the way it is.So lots of countries have tried pegging their currencies to other currencies, most commonly the US dollar. Your ability to do so is limited by how much money you are prepared to throw at it to counterbalance market forces. I mean this is one reason why we moved from Bretton-Woods to floating exchange rates.Central banks have far more ability to defend a peg. Still a pet can be attacked  (eg [2]) if the peg is sufficiently out of line with the market.It&#39;s going to be funny to watch these crypto trainwrecks learn these lessons (again) the hard way.[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCQGQ5qBQTA[2]: https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/george-soros-ban..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It looks like this (un-)stablecoin has lost its peg two times in the past. The interesting thing is that&#39;s it&#39;s an algorithmic stable coin: if its price is below a dollar, you can &#39;burn&#39; one UST to get $1 worth of LUNA (a regular crypto currency without an enforced peg). That has a deflationary effect and is meant to raise UST&#39;s price.
Conversely, if UST&#39;s price is above $1, you can burn LUNA to get back UST, inflating the supply and lowering the price.It&#39;s quite the neat idea really -- but I suppose it hinges on people believing that there is a healthy UST-LUNA ecosystem tomorrow that you can use to withdraw your funds if you want. Burning UST to get LUNA doesn&#39;t make sense if LUNA loses enough value by the time you could exchange it for something else, so I assume people rather take the loss on selling UST for less than $1, which would explain what we&#39;re seeing:
Right now UST is at $0.81 and LUNA is down 47% in the last 24h. We&#39;ll see if the system is robust enough to recover from a &#39;bank run&#39;, if you can call it that. It at least isn&#39;t the first time the peg has been broken, and so far it&#39;s stabilized at $1 again every time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"it will be interesting to watch NY (and/or CA) put something like this in place and observe from afar. i strongly feel that states should be much more aggressive running policy experiments if their constituents desire them, and at the national level we all get some benefit of seeing how things turn out in real time.all that said, assuming there is some tangible tax increase, NYC high earners are going to be knocking on the door of 60% combined rates (city, state, federal). tax avoidance and/or relocation services are going to be booming if so."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Coming from a country that has this, there should be caution: it gets more affordable, but you get what you pay for.  In my country of origin, you get a partially-paid-for ride to the emergency room, where you pay for things like casts, non-ward rooms, dental care out of pocket.  There is no prescription coverage.  There is no optometry coverage.  I would wait significant chunks of a year for procedures and diagnostics.  To cover the things that aren&#39;t covered, most have private insurance through work or also out of pocket.Since moving to the US, it is more expensive (than next to nothing), but I actually get good care.  Several conditions that were ignored or misdiagnosed for me are now cured.  My life might be significantly shorter had I not come here.If NY does this, the near zero chance of my moving there ever would go to absolute 0.  It is a terrible system for any place that does not have infinitesimal state or national government expenses and more-than-60% kind of taxes (e.g., Scandinavian countries)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m an MD who trained in NYC. I have also had emergency surgery in the NHS at one of their most prestigious hospitals in London and so I feel like I’ve seen the system a little bit from the inside.It was far cheaper for me than it would have been as a Brit in the USA, but the standard of care was lower. They didn’t have some technical and staffing resources late in the afternoon that would be a baseline in any of the hospitals I’ve been at in the USA. The English doctors were just kind of apologetic and bashful about it, talking to someone they knew was an American doctor who knew what kind of specific diagnostic algorithm was appropriate.The NHS hospital did have really excellent amounts of ancillary staff. Someone brought coffee and tea to me like 3-4 times a day, it wasn’t hard to get my luggage delivered to my bed, etc. Not like that in the USA from what I’ve seen.The NYC hospitals are somewhat financially strained as it is. Especially the public hospitals (Bellevue, Elmhurst, Metropolitan).Also related would be care at the VA hospitals, which is slower/worse than care at NYC flagship hospitals. But as a society we don’t want to prioritize or pay for good care for veterans, so it is what it is.I predict this will continue to basically just produce a more two-tiered system in the US. Most doctors who have a choice (large group practices) will take the wealthy patients with private insurance, and the big hospitals and whomever else who don’t have a choice will be forced to accept the NY single payers (basically the existing model, where the poor and 65+ are already covered under Medicaid and Medicare already). It will likely strain these systems even further, as reimbursements from Medicaid/Medicaid are insufficient to run large health systems which depend on higher rates from private insurers (payor mix). Good luck there.In NYC even more physicians and group practices will try to go to alternate models such as cash-only. Try being on Medicaid or Medicare and finding an outpatient psychiatrist in NYC now as it is. This will extend to more PCPs, chronic disease specialists, etc.Some patients will get better and more affordable care, but some will also get much worse care. It will be interesting to see what happens. I’m not necessarily opposed, but this is absolutely not going to be a clear and decisive win on all fronts as some commenters are suggesting. The US healthcare system, if you have private insurance, is the best in the world already in terms of level of service and access to rapid specialty and high-end care."</p>

And I think that&#39;s why my father, who was only a little older than I am now when I first showed him the web, grasped it straight away and was supportive of me building a website for his business.These days I&#39;m not spending much time writing HTML files in a text editor and uploading them via FTP; rather I&#39;m writing programmatic code that talks to a database (A database! Just like MS Access or FileMaker Pro), does some processing, and displays the result on the screen with some elaborate JavaScript to make it look and function how I want (I’m happily a heavy user of React for building rich web apps), but it&#39;s still fundamentally the same concepts. Files on servers, accessed over a network and delivering useful information to my browser or app. The beautiful simplicity is still there, and it still doesn&#39;t feel like a big leap from the kind of computing we were doing 1993.The world of blockchains and cryptocurrencies and &#34;web3&#34; feels vastly more opaque and esoteric by comparison and therefore untrustworthy to many of us, which I think is a significant answer to the question that was asked here in the past couple of days: &#34;Why is Hacker News so anti-crypto?&#34; [1].I can&#39;t quite accept that it&#39;s just that I&#39;m &#34;old&#34;; firstly because first heard about Bitcoin soon after it appeared and was excited by its potential, but also because I remember how people older than me reacted when the web arrived, and there was much more rapid acceptance and embrace than there I currently see for cryptocurrency, outside of those who are just chasing quick riches.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31302494"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I miss those times.
I could spend hours complaining about the depressive current state of the web, I imagine being a newcomer to such world and have to handle the over complexity of the current scenario without knowing that things could be simpler.I remember seeing a team member migrating a project from grunt to webpack, the project was just a 404 page. &#34;You need to compile your assets&#34; they say, just a cat *.css &gt; site.css would do it. Or even better, just do it inside the HTML and that is it.People who need a JS library to check if a number is odd or even went way too far, I&#39;m not exaggerating - https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-odd"</p>

There&#39;s a bunch of similar apps for Windows (I used to use Hain) but none ever worked quite right for me, PowerToys Run does though.FancyZones is awfully nice too for just putting a window somewhere at a reasonable size and location.As other folks have noted SysInternals is another similar rogue Windows product by Microsoft. Process Explorer from there is indispensible, as is Autoruns."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use PowerToys just for the easy key remapping, which I wish was a built-in feature in more keyboards. Works very nicely as a simple alternative to AutoHotKey. My RSI has gotten a lot better by just remapping Caps Lock to Ctrl.If any PowerToys feature deserves to be added to Windows, it&#39;s gotta be the Keyboard Manager."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Welcome to the automated account suspension age of the internet, where companies shoot first and don&#39;t care later, as the amount of false positives is not worth putting any meagerly (if there&#39;s any already) real, physical support to resolve. This can apply to smaller companies too, for other but equally pricey reasons. The amount of fraudulent activity attempts online may warrant those aggressive measures from their business perspective (that are also not limited to passive data collection, but taking active steps such as scanning targets&#39; ports [0]).
Unfortunately, if you live in certain areas or are forced to use mobile networks, with IPs constantly refreshing multiple times a day, major services can be almost unusable, and the user may not even realize the reason why. Some—for reasons I&#39;m not knowledgeable about—do it better than others, but it may simply be about the resources put into it and the amount of risk a miss could amount to.0. https://blog.nem.ec/2020/05/24/ebay-port-scanning/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is every company that deals with fraud of some sort. They collect evidence. Once evidence is damning enough, they ban, without giving any information. If they were to give out their evidence, then their evidence collection methods would become known and would no longer be effective.Furthermore, even when they get it right, people who were banned correctly come on to the internet to complain.But sometimes they get it wrong. And the only recourse seems to be a public shaming online."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I guess this was posted after someone saw this come up on HN yesterday: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31295427I&#39;ve been planning (for 2+ years now so it probably won&#39;t happen) writing a large blog post about this matter, which would be called “Tries, Packed Tries, and the Bentley–Knuth–McIlroy story”:• Part 1 would introduce the trie data structure both abstractly (the tree structure) and concretely (how exactly to represent the children of a node), with the trade-offs: as a linked list (space-efficient, slow lookup), as an array (fast lookup, takes space), or as some more nontrivial tree structure itself (“yo dawg…”). Then we&#39;d discuss the really cool idea of “packing” the array, as nicely described in Frank Liang&#39;s thesis https://tug.org/docs/liang/ (also mentioned in TAOCP Exercise 6.3:4 and answer, which incidentally refers to the CACM Bentley–Knuth–McIlroy article that we&#39;re talking about). We&#39;d also illustrate how hyphenation is done in the TeX program using packed tries (maybe this can be a separate post).• Part 2 would go into the Bentley–Knuth-McIlroy story:• Part 2a (&#34;Before&#34;): Bentley&#39;s thesis/book on writing efficient programs, and the Programming Pearls column. Knuth writing TeX first for himself in SAIL in 1977–78. The instant interest and ports/rewrites it led to. Knuth responding by rewriting TeX into its current form in 1980–82, and how the goals of portable software (thus Pascal, and its limitations! see BWK rant) and of eventually publishing it as a book led him to the idea of literate programming, which he still considers the most important outcome of his years into the TeX project. Meanwhile, at Bell Labs, McIlroy&#39;s invention of Unix pipes, and the instant excitement of &#34;pipe day&#34;. (“It was absorbed instantly into one&#39;s outlook on programming. And by the end of the week secretaries were piping the output of NROFF into the printer”) The Unix philosophy, and how it took a while to spread. How these three threads came together in 1986, when Bentley read Knuth&#39;s TeX, wrote about LP in his Pearls column, and published one program of Knuth&#39;s (the random-numbers one) and asked him to write another (the frequent words one).• Part 2b (the program): How Knuth ingeniously combined the idea of packed tries with that of hashing with linear probing, to create the data structure especially for this problem (maybe we can call it a hash-packed trie?). Another look at his very nice idea/program, presented differently (maybe some illustrations of how the data structure works), and some design choices he made.• Part 2c (the review and later): How Bentley got McIlroy to review it, a close reading of the review: its actual content and points about LP and Knuth&#39;s style, and finally the (first sentence and) last part where McIlroy used the review to advertise his own Unix philosophy and the short shell pipeline version. The further reactions to this, including Bentley&#39;s remarks in the same column, and later articles and reactions like the &#34;prefabs&#34; comment (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22406070). The short-lived LP column in CACM that it spawned (https://shreevatsa.net/post/programming-pearls/) and how it fizzled out, how it turns out everyone wants to do LP in their own system. How the story got bastardized over time (the misleading &#34;More shell less egg&#34; blog post for example, and some other examples of people misunderstanding the history entirely).• Part 3 would compare the two approaches (even though they are not meant to be compared!), mention how at https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/188133/ I simply translated Knuth&#39;s program into C++ and beat the then-fastest Rust solution (since beaten again by translation from C++ back into Rust: still based on the trie idea though!), some words about cache misses and 32-bit “pointers” in a 64-bit world (and Knuth&#39;s rant about it).Something like that: it&#39;s probably too long for me to ever get around to writing it (or for anyone to be interested in reading), though…"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there more discussion about the &#39;framed&#39; part? I mean how was the counter perceived. The whole &#39;setup&#39; looks like:- show how to write a spreadsheet application- here you go, couple of hundred pages it is though- ahh, silly person, why not type &#39;excel&#39;So what happened next? Everybody rolled eyes, or people said &#39;yeah, typing excel is pure genious&#39;?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am super excited by https://observablehq.com which has made an out-of-the-box literate programming environment for Javascript zero configuration (like Knuth&#39;s it has a non-linear execution order). Since switching to literate programming I have found myself adopting a documentation-driven-development methodology, where I ponder about the purpose of the notebook in the introduction, and because I reread it every time I open the notebook, the clarity of the software goes up, which also feedbacks into the ongoing development process too.It takes a little while before habits change, but I think I have learnt more in the last year at age 40 than I did in my first year of undergraduate aged 19.An aspect of Observable which is particularly compelling since Knuth is the fact that inter-notebook dependencies are hyperlinks, so these are not standalone literate programming artifacts, but they are a graph of explanation too. You can learn a lot by surfing notebook dependencies. Bundling code with documentation is such a win.The other thing about Observable is the cells are reactive, so your documentation is not necessarily static either. You can provide animated interactive explanations too.More info on the different types of content you can embedhttps://observablehq.com/@observablehq/cell-modesMore info on the spreadsheet like execution ordering:https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/observables-not-javas...

Forms don&#39;t need any JS to work, yet the impression this gives to beginners is that they do.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25915313But then again, this is Microsoft, which is now firmly in bed with Google in contributing to the Big Browser monopoly, so I suppose I shouldn&#39;t have expected anything else. The agenda is obvious to anyone who cares to look."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On a related note: I&#39;ve had to help train a bunch of Java/C++ devs about web dev over the years. I&#39;ve also talked to a lot of new devs. One thing I noted is that there wasn&#39;t a good resource that tried to explain the key pieces of web dev concepts, terms, and technologies, and how they fit together. So, I ended up writing a &#34;How Web Apps Work&#34; blog series to try to fill that gap:https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/series/how-web-apps-work/The series provides an overview of HTTP and servers, client dev, browsers / HTML / CSS, JS / DOM, and AJAX.A number of folks have told me they found the series particularly helpful."</p>

Should I be using ES6 imports? Which build tool? Would I want React or Vue or something simpler here? Should I use SSR? NPM vs. Yarn? Do I need a CSS compiler? Maybe I should be using TypeScript? Wepback?Basically I&#39;m overwhelmed with choices, but struggle to find useful docs on why a lot of these tools came about, what problems they solve, tradeoffs for using them, etc.Asking the web devs I know in person doesn&#39;t help much (“just use React for everything, it&#39;s fine&#34;)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Several were veterans of the company, with more than six years of experienceI think it&#39;s sad that we have an industry, where someone with six years&#39; experience, is considered a &#34;veteran.&#34;But it sounds like Amazon is sending a message to managers of other warehouses, to go as low as possible, to fight unionization.Expect things to get ugly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me a more reasonable explanation than any in the article is that after losing the vote, Amazon looked into the warehouse and decided part of the problem was that the managers were making the situation worse. This could have been that the rsi injury complaints were true and unaddressed promptly. Or that the managers came off as cold in communications. Or 5 other things they could have done better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The managers were told they were being fired as part of an “organizational change,”Nit: That language implies that they were laid off, not fired. The timing is a stupid move from Amazon, and these employees will likely be able to make a good case in court.Being from Europe I have mixed feelings about unions here in the US...On the one hand I think they are essential to tilt the uneven power dynamic between employer and employee towards the employee, and are thus dearly needed!On the other hand, unions seem to often go overboard with impractical demands and are more political than in Europe, which damaged their reputation - I think - and contributed to their demise over the past few decades. Which is truly a shame!
(I&#39;m reminded of alleged cases where only a union worker is allow to plug a power plug into an outlet at exorbitant prices. But this might a rumor too.)Any opinions here?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a forefront issue that Buddhism tries to address, both modern pragmatic Buddhism and fundamentalist Buddhism. It&#39;s why right speech, right action, and morals is one of the first things they drill into you. Most pragmatic practitioners will refuse to teach you if you indicate that you have some mental problems or moral deficiencies that should be addressed by a professional first, as mindfulness may end up doing more harm than good. It&#39;s one of the flaws of teaching secular mindfulness, far from its Buddhist roots. I&#39;ve experienced all these interpersonal deficits after meditating seriously 2 hours every day for 2 years straight. Just need to have the self-awareness to address them, despite the goal of no-self.I saw a Dr. K video in another comment, and one of my favorite quotes he uses to describe meditation is that, &#34;if you run for 5 miles a day, there will be changes to your body that will definitely happen&#34;.More here:- https://www.mctb.org/mctb2/table-of-contents/part-i-the-fund...- https://eudoxos.github.io/cfitness/html/index.html- https://themindfulgeek.com/ plus a talk he gave at Google https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2xxsA9Bn-4"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This would line up with a broader trend I&#39;ve noticed and would be interested in reading more about: the use of pop psychology to justify antisocial behavior.Ten years ago, telling a distressed friend you don&#39;t feel like hearing about their problems would be incredibly rude. Now you can find NYT articles explaining how to couch the same sentiment in more acceptable terms like, &#34;I don&#39;t have the bandwidth to perform that kind of emotional labor right now.&#34;Same thing here. Telling a person you wronged to &#34;get over it&#34; is unacceptable. Telling them that you&#39;ve been working on letting go of negative feelings about the past and being more mindful of the present, and you hope they can do the same? Well if anyone has a problem with that, you don&#39;t need that kind of energy in your life!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"10-20 minutes/day was enough to teach me how to be &#39;mindful&#39; on demand and mitigated a lot of mild ADHD-type problems in my life (impatience, anger, finding queues unbearable, high sensitivity to noise etc.).I spent a few months doing more, and it may not be related, but I became increasingly detached from the outside world, more self-absorbed and less motivated. Spent a lot of time just sitting and being content with nothing, which made me question why I should strive for -anything-. Always focused on improving myself, and the way I thought and felt, but it kept me stuck in my own head and not engaged with other people. There is a benefit in doing loving kindness and other forms of meditation that connect you with others."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Look at a chart of the S&amp;P 500 from 1920 to 2008 and you&#39;ll notice something rather curious: the stock market has gone parabolic ever since the financial crisis. What made this period so unique? Tremendously low interest rates coupled with quantitative easing dissuaded capital from financing the real economy and instead encouraged herding and levering up in the financial economy for returns.At ever dip, it was an open secret the Fed would cut rates and ease again.At least for now, that game is over. We&#39;ve had moments in the past when the markets had a similar panic (see 2018), but this period is unique due to the inflationary backdrop. Since 2008 we&#39;ve never seemed to be able to create significant economic growth or inflation greater. The COVID fiscal canon blew growth and inflation skyward. The fed can&#39;t just turn on the printers again or cut rates until we hit proper a proper recession.That&#39;s when you buy the dip.[0]: https://www.macrotrends.net/2324/sp-500-historical-chart-dat..."</p>

What I previously thought as &#34;okay I just leave it in the stock market for a bit of time to recoup&#34; is something I am now realizing would likely have to be 10+ years.It&#39;s kind of funny because I was getting shaky about having money in the stock market back in December, and I held onto investing some of my money there. But I ultimately relented 4 months later to lose 10% within about two weeks (and after just index funds). Now it&#39;s much worse, and I guess I&#39;ll just leave it all there.And in 15 years I&#39;ll be back to where I was when I originally invested it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Technology robbed workers’ of what had been highly valued physical knowledge about a job: the precise way to jimmy a stuck gear, the sound a machine makes when something’s about to break.There&#39;s an experience that lives rent free in my mind as well. As a teen, I worked at a bait shop that was on the Gulf coast. They sold mostly live shrimp but had other live stuff for bait as well. Salt water was pumped from the nearby innercoastal canal by two heavy duty swimming pool type pumps. From there, the water was split through several different pipes and manifolds and dumped into the live bait tanks. The overflow ran back out to the canal.There was this one customer I was getting bait for and he meandered around the bait room randomly (customers weren&#39;t supposed to be in there but I didn&#39;t feel like saying anything). He ended up way in the back of the room where the pumps were and I could see him touching them. Figuring I needed to get him out of there politely I walked back there pretending to check on stuff. Before I could say anything, he says &#34;You will need a new pump soon&#34;. Um &#34;What?&#34; I say. &#34;Put your hand on this one&#34;. So I did, I felt nothing. &#34;Now put your hand on this one&#34;. And that one had a really high frequency vibration coming through it. &#34;The bearings are shot, it will lock up soon&#34;.I was impressed. Granted for two more years I&#39;d regularly &#34;feel&#34; the pump again, the vibrations were slowly getting worse. But then a hurricane came and flooded everything anyway so we got new stuff.But still, anytime I see a high RPM electric motor running, I got to &#34;give it a feel&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Diminishing returns on productivity is obvious (eg working 80 hours a week outputs productivity somewhere between 1 to 2 times the productivity of 40 hours a week).However, rewards for work is also highly nonlinear, and usually rank based. For example, Usain Bolt is not twice as fast as the second fastest runner but Bolt is rewarded many multiples more than the second fastest runner.What is rational is to think of the payoff or reward space, and think how even a tiny incremental increase in productivity (which compounds) can result in disproportionately large payoffs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t find anything wrong with being addicted to getting things done if the productivity gains are shared amongst the labor force. Specifically, increase in productivity can be used to eg shorten the workweek even further and demand protections against work encroachment on personal life. I see that this is happening with some companies embracing 4 day workweeks, others adopting remote from anywhere etc. We need to accelerate this trend, possibly enshrine them in labor law.To be honest, the greediness of the managerial/investor class is kinda dumb. I keep thinking about how Amazon/Starbucks could have worked with their employees rather than exploiting and harassing them so relentlessly that now the labor movement is growing rapidly to their detriment. It was really stupid to think they could get away with being shitty forever. Incentive structures should be created that don’t bias so heavily towards the short term."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"With JavaScript, these kinds of optimizations in an engine make sense due to the web being limited by it and thus speed is a huge factor. With Python, however, if a Python web framework is “too” slow, I would honestly say the problem is using Python at all for a web server. Python shines beautifully as a (somewhat) cross platform scripting language: file reading and writing, environment variables, simple implementations of basic utilities: sort, length, max, etc that would be cumbersome in C. The move of Python out of this and into practically everything is the issue and then we get led into rabbit holes such as this where since we are using Python, a dynamic scripting language, for things a second year computer science student should know are not “the right jobs for the tool.”Instead of performance, I’d like to see more effort in portability, package management, and stability for Python because, essentially since it is often enterprise managed, juggling fifteen versions of Python where 3.8.x supports native collection typing annotations but we use 3.7.x, etc. is my biggest complaint. Also up there is pip and just the general mess of dependencies and lack of a lock file. Performance doesn’t even make the list.This is not to discredit anyone’s work. There is a lot of excellent technical work and research done as discussed in the article. I just think honestly a lot of this effort is wasted on things low on the priority tree of Python."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"During Perl’s hegemony as The Glue Language, I feel like the folk wisdom was:“Performance is a virtue; if Perl ceases to be good enough, or you need to write ‘serious’ software rewrite in C.”And during Python’s ascension, the common narrative shifted very slightly:“Performance is a virtue, but developer productivity is a virtue too. Plus, you can drop to C to write performance critical portions.”Then for our brief all-consuming affair with Ruby, the wisdom shifted more radically:“Developer productivity is paramount. Any language that delivers computational performance is suspect from a developer productivity standpoint.”But looking at “high-level” languages (i.e. languages that provide developer productivity enhancing abstraction), we can rewind the clock to look at language families that evolved during more resource-constrained times.Those languages, the lisps, schemes, smalltalks, etc. are now really, really fast compared to Python, and rarely require developers to shift to alternative paradigms (e.g. dropping to C) just to deliver acceptable performance.Perl and Python exploded right at the time that Lisp/Scheme hadn’t quite shaken the myth that they were slow, with Python/Perl achieving acceptable performance by having dropped to C most of the time.Now the adoption moat is the wealth of libraries that exist for Python—and it’s a hell of a big moat. If I were a billionaire, I’d hire a team of software developers to systematically review libraries that were exemplars in various languages, and write / improve idiomatic, performant, stylistically consistent versions in something modern like Racket. I’d like to imagine that someone
would use those things :-)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great read, and it&#39;s fantastic to see all the work being done to evaluate and improve the language!The dynamic-nature of the language is actually something that I had studied a few years back [1]. Particularly the variable and object attribute look ups! My work was just a master&#39;s thesis, so we didn&#39;t go too deep into more tricky dynamic aspects of the language (e.g. eval, which we restricted entirely). But we did see performance improvements by restricting the language in certain ways that aid in static analysis, which allowed for more performant runtime code. But for those interested, the abstract of my thesis [2] gives more insight into what we were evaluating.Our results showed that restricting dynamic code (code that is constructed at run time from other source code) and dynamic objects (mutation of the structure of classes and objects at run time) significantly improved the performance of our benchmarks.There was also some great discussion on HN when I had posted our findings as well [3].[1]: https://github.com/joncatanio/cannoli[2]: https://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/theses/1886/[3]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17093051"</p>

Apple was able to ship the M1 and roll out new iterations of many other offerings since the pandemic hit. They&#39;re just fine.Apple didn&#39;t collapse since the pandemic hit, and the flexibility offered by remote work is far more valuable to lots of people than the loss of in-person collaboration opportunities. We deserve to have input into how we work best and if that means walking away from companies run by egomaniacs that need to see butts in seats, then so be it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Warning: Hot Take.I genuinely believe many people who prefer working in an office versus at home have unfulfilling social lives or bad home lives. The social dynamics, competition, in physical offices fills the void in their lives. Also seems like most of the people clamoring for a return to the office are also climbers &amp; middle managers.For some work a physical presence is required not just preferable, but for most of a software engineer&#39;s day to day there really is no unquestionable upside.I&#39;ll quit before I go back full time. I&#39;ve never been happier or more fulfilled with my work/life balance, and I&#39;ve never been more productive with my time. I&#39;ll even take a different remote position at a 20% pay cut and a reduction in equity, at least, to retain WFH.

It&#39;s still a job seeker&#39;s market and my workplace is not keeping pace. It&#39;s spec&#39;ed for 3 years of experience but salary is about the median for a new graduate w/o professional experience. I&#39;m happy to train someone but if I rework the job class to allow for new grads then HR will lower the starting salary. So, I&#39;m hoping to find someone who&#39;s a new grad but had a part time job or internship or any other non-coursework experience the could be even the least bit argued as adding up to the required experience. (the position is basically a data wrangler / sql jockey / light analysis position, but it directly supports the main revenue-generating operations of the organization so there is real $$$ lost by having this position empty. ::Grrrrr:: end rant.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I appreciate the writing style, but this article is shockingly naive to me.Convenient consumer products tend to sell better than less convenient ones, even if the product is worse. That&#39;s the entire story. People have finite time, so when they receive more income they will tend to spend it to reduce the time they spend doing things that they don&#39;t care about.I for one hate spending time doing all the things that the products in the article make more convenient, and happily pay more so I can spend my time on other things.  * I don&#39;t like shaving, so I optimize for razors that get the job done faster (more blades, easier to swap a new blade)
  * I don&#39;t like cleaning pans, so I buy pans I can clean faster and don&#39;t have to &#34;season&#34;
  * I don&#39;t like filling bags with tea, so I buy tea bags that are pre-filled
  * (nespresso) I actually enjoy the ritual of making espresso, so I use a real espresso machine
  * I bike every day to and from work, so I take it a step further and buy an E-bike with no shifter
  * I don&#39;t want to fiddle with chromecast or fire stick, so I just use my TV&#39;s built in smart features
  * (inner city shops don&#39;t sell individual pieces of fruit) I live in SF, it&#39;s very easy to find individual fruits here
  * I don&#39;t like going to grocery stores, so I pay to have groceries delivered to me

My time is precious to me, so instead of spending money on luxury items I spend money to save time. Evidently so do most other people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I believe that many things stated in this post are correct, this still has that hard &#39;old man yelling at the internet&#39; odor.If you are to compare stuff, stuff like modern razor cartridges and double-edged razors, you ought to mention the convenience side of the things. I hate being the devil&#39;s advocate, but shaving with 4-blade cartridge designed for easy shaving is still &#39;miles&#39; ahead compared to shaving with double-edged razor. Miiiles ahead. And I use a double-edged razor 9 out of 10 times, so I would know a thing or two about it.And that&#39;s not to say that are overly pricey. They are. Plus, if you account for different prices in different regions, the price difference is even more concerning.The same is also true for some other appliances/services mentioned - tea bags and coffee machines are not just &#39;superficially convenient&#39; they are wildly more convenient.EDIT: As one person said in the comments down below, &#34;What this article completely misses, is that there are more than two options.&#34;. That was my whole point, and I&#39;m sorry if it came out the wrong way. Shaving is a personal preference, and you are free to do it however you like; but saying &#39;Shaving is too expensive and is a demonstrative example of how most consumer products are designed to extract more money from you rather than to improve your life, or the world, or to be in any way remotely good.&#39; is just incorrect and insane."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Other examples of products that seem to exhibit a similar trend, where purported convenience leads to higher prices&gt;Cooking equipment: essentially indestructible Cast Iron skillets transition into teflon pans. The newer pans perform worse, and must be replaced on a shockingly regular basis. They also seem to be poisonous.They have their uses. I wouldn&#39;t try frying eggs in a cast iron, for instance (technically you can, but it requires an absurd amount of oil). Also, claiming that they &#34;seem to be poisonous&#34; without any qualifiers is a little misleading. To my knowledge they&#39;re only poisonous during manufacturing (ie. the precursor chemicals) and when they get too hot.&gt;Nespresso machines, and other coffee pod brands, replace many styles of coffee brewing. Provide much worse coffee, at a higher price but are superficially convenient.Why are they only superficially convenient? They seem pretty convenient to me.&gt;Televisions moving from being screens which accept input, to self contained &#39;smart&#39; devices that require software updates and thus have a shortened useful lifespan.I thought it was the other way around? ie. smart TVs are cheaper than dumb TVs because they&#39;re subsidized by ad revenue. Also, the claim itself doesn&#39;t really make any sense. Even if you stop getting software updates, that doesn&#39;t prevent you from using it as a dumb display."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was at Bell during the options “debate.” I think something that this otherwise wonderful article misses is that some believed that commands were never intended to be the only way to use the system as the shell was intended to be just one of the many user interfaces that Research Unix would provide. From that perspective, it was entirely reasonable to believe that if a command was so complex that it needed options than it was likely more appropriate for one of the other user interfaces. I believe this is unfortunately now understood by some as it shouldn’t exist. However, because of the seemingly instantaneous popularity of the shell and pipelining text it became synonymous with Unix. It’s a shame because McIlroy had a lot of interesting ideas around pipelining audio and graphics that, as far as I know, never materialized."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unix history is always fascinating.&gt;None of this explains dd.This one really made me think. I have never thought about dd before. Although I have wondered about other commands. Perhaps the author should also have added some command options not requiring a minus prefix, e.g. tar, ps.The manpage [0] reads:In the first (legacy) form, all option flags except for -C and -I must be contained within the first argument to tar and must not be prefixed by a hyphen (`-&#39;). Option arguments, if any, are processed as subsequent      arguments to tar and are processed in the order in which their corresponding option flags have been presented on the command line.
In the second and preferred form, option flags may be given in any order and are immediately followed by their corresponding option argument values.[0]: http://man.openbsd.org/tar"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I believe the oldest program that uses subcommand is the version control system SCCS, from 1972IIUC, other non-Unix operating systems commonly used the subcommand style for normal interactive use; it was the style used by the normal command shell, and all commands in those operating systems therefore followed this style.  The operating system (or its shell) was responsible for enabling easy use of this style by adding completion support (commonly using the ESC key, IIRC).  This older style can still today be seen in Unix tools like ftp and telnet, which uses this style for its internal command line interface.  Another tool using this style, which many might be familiar with, is the multi-platform Kermit.Unix therefore has been rather late in adopting this style, first in gradually adopting tools which uses the subcommand style (ip, git, etc.), and later with support in shells for programmable completion support where a program can optionally register completion hooks for the user shell to use, making it finally come up to the level of those older operating systems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The problem that GraphQL was trying to resolve is real: reasonably-sized REST projects usually ended up inventing their own awkward, ad-hoc mini query languages on top of REST.But GraphQL as a solution is not great. It looks nice in the first place, but there is too much hassle to deal with.P.S. I&#39;ve seen quite a fraction of GraphQL projects actually using Node.js as the backend. If that&#39;s the case I would recommend TRPC[0] over GraphQL - it&#39;s more seamless and straightforward.[0] https://trpc.io/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my relatively naive opinion, graphql exists to solve a few things (which are mostly benefits for large scale companies):1. Reduce the total number of HTTP connections required to get the data for a specific component or page. Imo this is presumably less important with http3 but the driving force is probably similar for both.2. Give backend-for-frontend style services more autonomy to provide an interface that works for a specific feature on the front end without coupling it to specifics of how the backend organizes resources3. Allow performance issues with frontend query logic to be addressed without changing anything on the front endI think the situations where it would be useful are large teams that want to operate more independently where the overhead of dealing with graphql is worth it.An example being someone trying to render a component for a list of comments. It would be great if the front end could just write some &#34;magic&#34; query that gives them everything they want and they don&#39;t have to worry about batching requests to specific endpoints and the order in which they should make those requests. That doesn&#39;t mean the problem magically goes away, but it&#39;s now someone else&#39;s problem and that&#39;s good: the app development can free itself from things it shouldn&#39;t care about."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve used GraphQL on several projects now, with small teams (2-5 devs) where we control the front and back end, and for that case, it&#39;s actually been really good. It provides a solid contract that is easy to get wrong with a REST API. (Will the server send IDs as ints or strings? Will it accept either? Which params are optional? What shape does the data come back in, an array of results, or an objects with results nested somewhere? etc.) I&#39;ve even setup CI to fail if it finds queries on the front-end that don&#39;t match the schema. And of course it&#39;s easy to request exactly the data you want on the front -end.A big downside is that the tooling is immature, and all subject to big changes. And I haven&#39;t written a server meant for public consumption, but that does add new layers that you can kind of ignore when you trust the client."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s convenient that GitHub Markdown supports graphs natively, and I&#39;ve used Mermaid there successfully. However, I was fairly disappointed with Mermaid itself; I found the syntax irregular and non-intuitive (the syntax for every different graph type feels like it was designed by different people working independently), the documentation was sparse (though it exists at all, so I&#39;ll give it points for that), and worst of all the error messages were atrociously cryptic and entirely unhelpful.That said, I also found the default styling and layout of the generated graphs to be far more attractive than Graphviz/dot, though I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s attributable to Mermaid or GitHub.Which is to say, altogether probably a step forward, but still lots of room for improvement.

It&#39;s easy to feel like, &#34;at ${year - 1} I was such an idiot, glad that&#39;s over now.&#34; You&#39;d be surprised how many years in a row you can feel that way before the meta realization sinks in.Understanding other people is like learning to play &#34;Have You Got It Yet?&#34;[1]:&gt; When Pink Floyd gathered in January 1968 for one of their first rehearsals as a quintet, Barrett shared a new composition he called “Have You Got It Yet?” The song sounded straightforward, but the band became confused as they tried to join in and learn the number. The melody and structure seemed to shift on each run-through, with Barrett gleefully singing a chorus of “Have you got it yet? Have you got it yet?” at them.&gt; Eventually they realized that Barrett was changing the arrangement each time, deliberately making the song impossible to learn. “We didn’t get it for quite a long time,” says Gilmour in Rob Chapman’s book A Very Irregular Head. “I remember the moment and the song well.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Science and technology and other nerdy pursuits can be really valuable, and certainly don’t require you to be judgmental of others.The problem, as I’ve seen it is that people who are bad at some of the other ‘games’ that make a meaningful life lean too heavily on  science and technology as a coping mechanism. That coping mechanism could be many things: nerdy pursuits, alcohol, video games, etc.Whatever your pursuit, if you’re being judgmental of most other people, then you’re probably missing something big and should take some time to reflect on what that is for you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There was a comment on HN about a year ago by somebody that grew up in India, and being Pakistani i relate to it a lot as well.Specifically, it mentioned that these &#39;games&#39; and people choosing one or two games out of a great number of games available out there seems like a uniquely North American thing (as far as we can tell from our own limited exposure to other societies).So while you folks had the jock, the nerd, the artist etc. , we had schools, teachers and parents that taught us we should strive to excel at everything, i.e. play every game and try to play it well.Its a little disappointing to be put into a bucket by North American folks because they assume everyone is good at just one or two games. Not trying to be disrespectful, but i personally also think a little less of people that take so long to come to the realization that the author did in the article. A little ironic, if you think about it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great technical article as always, and apologies for not responding to the meat of the article, but I tend to look at declarative UI with some degree of skepticism. Raph, do you think this general approach can eventually be scaled up to develop complex and highly interactive applications such as DAWs, video editors, and graphic design software? At least based on my experience with SwiftUI, I find the paradigm easy and satisfying to get started with, and great for prototyping and widgets, but quickly run into roadblocks whenever trying to build creative software that&#39;s not just a view around a database. Or do you see this as just another tool in the UI toolbox, and not necessarily mutually exclusive with imperative and immediate mode UI? Curious to hear your thoughts!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Have you thought about backing the persistent widget tree with native widgets as the final layer? Or, at least supporting it as a render target. That is, UI/NSViews on Apple platforms, DOM nodes on web, GTK objects on Linux, etc. Essentially using them as the final “render tree”.SwiftUI takes this approach, as ComponentKit did before it. The framework still does most everything (state updates, layout, animation, etc), but the host compositor handles the actual rendering.This approach has a few advantages in my opinion. These widgets integrate nicely with the host accessibility system, for one. They also can come with built-in styling to make them “fit into” the target platform.There are also performance benefits to leveraging the system compositor – Firefox switched to have platform native layers on macOS and it helped immensely with battery life.It is worth noting that SwiftUI and ComponentKit components don’t have 1:1 mappings with native widgets – they both perform flattening (i.e. for drawing paths and layout only nodes) to optimize their performance.I think most importantly, though, it allows for rewriting code incrementally as that approach naturally supports bidirectional embedding. Having rewritten the Shortcuts app editor from UIKit into ComponentKit into SwiftUI (maybe one of the larger projects written in SwiftUI?), incremental rewriting is crucial for existing software projects.The other concern is mobile – it just is not feasible to rewrite the text input stack on mobile, for example, so being able to use native text editing views would very much be necessary.This all looks fantastic!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really cool work. My impression after reading the article is that it’s significantly inspired by SwiftUI, but without the magic annotations (@State, @Binding, @EnvironmentObject, @StateObject, etc.). It will be interesting to see how Rust handles the fully-statically-typed view tree, which has been really pushing the limits of the Swift compiler.Question for the author: perhaps I missed it, but how do you plan to handle view trees that change based on state (ie SwiftUI’s IfElseView + viewbuilder)?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Loneliness. We don&#39;t have meaningful social connections anymore like our parents or their parents geeration had. We are so scattered, that I am unsure how many of my friends are actually friends and how many are just professional contacts. Everytime I switch job, almost 70% of my friends suddenly fall out of contact. Heck, I don&#39;t even know the people who live in next apartments both left, right, up and down on the same building. Socializing with my friends mean, setting up an appointment weeks ahead to see if we can align on a free-slot and this often involves all of us commuting to somewhere and disbanding by 22:00 hours because family, work next morning, chores to do, doctor appointment and other human things.Interestingly, in this rat race, a lot of people suddenly inherited significant wealth and managed to use those wisely to have enough return to maintain a minimal lifestyle without working a primary 9-5. Some of us also achieved significant wealth by our early youth that we can afford to chase our hobbies for long time without worrying about the rents and bills and other responsibilities. Add social network to this, and these people cumulatively pursue things like world travelling, elaborate vacations, own businesses, YOLO etc.. , an endless stream of &#34;other people doing YOLO&#34; while us being worried what did I achieve so far?So, yeah, we feel lonely, go to social sites(which is appearently the whole &#34;internet&#34; to non tech-savvy groups) to see how others are having it good. Then suddenly we realize we wasted a lot of time on watching others having fun and decide that, we need to get better hobbies and stop this. But the loneliness never goes away as hobbies are extra toppings when we have a complete social life, so we are again pulled back to the cesspool, because at least there we can get some connection in forms of comment, likes and we can post our opinions as well or get into hours of comment-wars(which counts as social connection too)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am addicted to twitter and reddit. Especially reddit. It often takes the place of reading, hobbies, quiet moments, improving my home, talking with my spouse, and playing with my baby.When reddit records a click or an upvote, it thinks it has been a Good Product, and created Engagement. Reddit then takes those feedback loops and tunes the algorithm and feedback loops to create further engagement.But in reality, there&#39;s almost no positive relationship between my engagement with social media and my personal human flourishing. I think these products are mostly poison for my soul."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Because we humans have a lot of idle time.We feel like we&#39;re wasting it, and we feel we should instead spend time archiving goals, to better ourselves, to do something more meaningful.  
But that is not how life works. You are just unnecessarily burden yourself with guilt. Thinking you should be doing something else. There are so many things to learn about, so many things to experience, right? We fear on missing out on life, chasing something, but what exactly we don&#39;t really know.But maybe you just don&#39;t need to? Most of us are exactly fine with where we are. Of course you should always strive to improve, but truth is &#34;killing time&#34; is a big part of life. Especially for top of the food chain animals like humans. Watch some livestreams of lions on youtube, what do they do? 99% of the time they just sit under a tree doing absolutely nothing, and I bet they don&#39;t feel guilty about it. People used to walk labyrinths for hours and hours, just to kill time.This whole notion that you need to make the most out of every moment, live life to the fullest, see all the places, chase the uncomfortable! - I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily the best advice, the happiest people I&#39;ve met tend to have very simple boring routines."</p>

One day the Microsoft 360 API (used for email) seemingly stopped working. After a whole week of troubleshooting and discussion with other devs around the planet I fixed the issue.  New headers had to be included. It was a one line fix that stole a week of my life.  The API had changed.  I could have been ok with this but when I made a post on the repo explaining the fix and that I had no idea why it had even changed, instead of a thank you- a Microsoft API dev chimed in to say it was a trivial change and didn’t see what everyone was so upset about.  Knowing no documentation had been updated and every system around the planet had been broken for probably a week that depended on it. No apology no gratitude. I can handle that. But an insult to say I was being impertinent and overblowing the importance.Well I never forgot it, and eventually this stuff comes out. I hazard to say there are toxic dangerous people in every major company I just don’t understand why these people aren’t cautioned as soon as these public incidents happen it’s as if no one is really watching the behaviour in the irc channels or repos but are instead focusing on internal metrics which in my opinion don’t measure the devastation cause by these bad apples - who should atleast be checked up on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The idea is that the bidder&#39;s precision signals confidence, and that low confidence signals amenability to negotiation, and that negotiation leads to poorer outcomes for the bidder. The HBS paper they cite on M&amp;A [0] is most interesting, to my view, in the sense that both players in the M&amp;A &#34;game&#34; are presumably quantitative. One would think a social psychology effect would be less so in a game between quants, but their interviews suggest perceived confidence does matter. The precision signals that the bidder is confident pricing and negotiating analytically.The thing I am curious about in [0] is that they report the bid price per share, and not (unless I missed it) the asking price. I don&#39;t know how M&amp;A &#34;works&#34;. If you and I are both estimating the value of a good, if our estimates are close it&#39;s one thing and if they are far apart it&#39;s another.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another extremely successful tactic I stumbled upon by accident: electing a 3rd party decision maker that the other negotiator can&#39;t communicate with. Without the communication channel, the other negotiator is forced to &#34;sweeten the deal&#34; instead of using conversational skills.I received a job offer while my wife was traveling. The number was right for me and the job/company was right. But I told the hiring manager that I needed to talk it through with my wife first and that I&#39;d need a few days (no context about why I needed the time or which direction I expected it to go).She got home 3 days later. We sat down, talked it through for 10 minutes, and we were ready to accept.In the time between the initial offer and accepting the offer, I received 3 updated offers with increasing compensation. The final offer I accepted was $75k higher than the initial offer.After experiencing that, I&#39;ve noticed companies use this tactic frequently. When you call into a help center, often times the phone operator &#34;will need to talk to their manager&#34; who is authorized to make the actual decision. You aren&#39;t allowed to talk to the manager - all communication goes through the intermediary. I suspect they are aware that this is an effective negotiating tactic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Surely this has something to do with the anchoring effect:- If you offer £210,000, it&#39;s a signal that you&#39;re looking at increments of £10,000.- If you offer £211,000 it&#39;s a signal that you&#39;re looking at increments of £1,000.- If you offer £211,000.01 then it signals that you&#39;re taking the piss.I&#39;m sure there&#39;s something about confidence and accuracy in there too, but I would expect anchoring effects to be stronger in those contexts."</p>

A big problem is the type of housing being built, particularly in urban center where like NYC where the vast bulk of new housing units are ultra-luxury condos;2.

There are so many &#34;hints&#34; and tooltips for almost every option there is. It really helped me a lot.Keycloak is good software. It never failed for me. Even upgrading from 7.x.x to 16.x.x somehow just worked.Yes, their docker image is fat, but it&#39;s also very flexible. Now that they are basing Keycloak on Quarkus instead on Wildfly, the docker image should shrink in size.    quay.io/keycloak/keycloak   18.0.0                      a6bd0f949af0   15 hours ago   562MB

ok, still big :).Beware: they aren&#39;t using Docker Hub anymore. Newer versions are on Quay only (https://quay.io/repository/keycloak/keycloak).I&#39;m happy with Keycloak. Also nice folks around Keycloak."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My company used Keycloak for a long time (I&#39;m not there any more) and I agree with everyone here, it works great, but it&#39;s hard to understand unless you already know oauth/oidc, and it is a huge binary.While Keycloak is a great out-of-the-box solution, my #1 complaint at the time was how heavyweight it was, which was a burden for development, followed closely by its packaging as a J2EE app and bundling with Wildfly (at the time).This meant we needed to know not only about Keycloak itself, but also about Wildfly&#39;s special quirks, the clustering system (Infinispan??), Java and Docker.Now it&#39;s packaged with Quarkus, which is another dependency to learn about, and to be honest despite the quality of the finished product, all those dependencies have become pretty off-putting.So while I can recommend Keycloak&#39;s functionality, if you&#39;re not already deploying Java apps as part of your job, I suspect it will present a pretty serious administrative burden to deploy into serious production."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We tried using keycloak in a startup where I worked. It needed a loooooooot of memory and was very slow to start. It probably needed some JVM tuning, but we were just deploying as a stateful set (for the postgres). The docker images were also huge.We had to use another FOSS project called Gatekeeper as an authentication software along with keycloak, which got obsoleted and replaced with a different project (lukedo proxy or some such).The community support was also relatively not that active like other FOSS project that we used (for other areas of the stack). Overall, the experience was not so great that we decided to ditch both keycloak and gatekeeper. This was about a couple of years back. Not sure what the current status is.Some other alternatives that we wanted to try were from the Ory project (Kratos etc.) But we just went with some proprietary AUTH solution in our startup."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This sounds like burnout to me. I am in my mid-40s and used to have spells like this, but no more. I needed some kind of large change, back then, to get myself sorted out, but this could be pretty destructive because if I waited too long, the change I&#39;d need wouldn&#39;t really be conducive to staying on whatever project I was on.The key to not having to deal with this problem anymore, for me, was starting to proactively switch things around to break the routine of consecutive work-weeks. One of my tricks was to do some kind of mini-vacation every 6-8 weeks, go somewhere new, leave work behind for 3-4 days. Even smaller things like regular social events can work wonders - anything that breaks the weekly routine.Back when I&#39;d get myself into burnout periods the most effective way to recover enthusiasm was to pick up a new skill, work-related or not. I was in my mid-30s in the late aughts and not entirely sure I wanted to keep coding - so I signed myself up for an 18 month &#34;executive MBA&#34; program to find out if I might want to do something else, and instead came out of that with a whole new outlook on how and why to write code.Then around 5 years later I started writing code on the side, for myself, to gradually improve over the long term, and this can be absolutely therapeutic.Try to switch things around a little bit, do something new, see if that helps?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Your problem is very simple: you are working on bullshit.Across your entire description of your situation you never once mentioned what it is you are actually working on but called out the income you hit and frameworks you are playing with. I humbly submit that your problem is that you have lost the plot.Hate to break it to you chief but the libraries and frameworks and techniques you use to work are not the point. Creating stuff that people want to use is all that matters. Doing it with finesse and craftsmanship is how you go from good to great but if nobody gives a shit you will always feel empty.Switching projects and doing something &#34;harder&#34; isn&#39;t going to fill that void.Build something people want. I promise your drive and all the rest will follow behind once you are making them happy and get hooked on solving their problems and improving their lives.That is what this game is all about."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll pile on to the burnout suggestion with my own personal solution to how I fixed that problem.I&#39;m early 40s, started coding around 13 or so, so it&#39;s been 30 years of software for me.  About ten years ago after living in the web programming world for a few years I got kind of the same feeling you have.  I missed my forms and windows app development, so I went to another company doing what I remembered enjoying.You can guess what happened next.  I hated it.  I remembered all the things that annoyed me about windows app development, and realized I was just tired of coding every day.  Coding has never been what I like about coding, it&#39;s building things that do things.  I started focusing more on the building side, this time with the team around me, and also just some non coding fun projects like learning auto mechanics, etc.  I drifted into a management role by accident and found a ton of fulfillment in coaching and mentoring.  After a while I started to miss the coding side, so I went into an architecture role where I still got to do coding but it was mostly exploratory POC stuff to decide on new technologies or not.  I took a role after that as a principal engineer, and while these are all mostly just title changes, it gave me enough variety to be exciting again.Today I tell prospective employers that I am someone that drifts between IC and leadership roles.  I believe experience in both helps both.  My drive waxes and wanes but I think that&#39;s totally normal for humans.  I just came to terms with it and stopped worrying about it, and now I&#39;m very satisfied in my career."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Energy densities of various substances and/or reactions is pretty fascinating concept.Some of the most interesting energy analysis I&#39;ve come across (Vaclav Smil and David MacKay especially) describe energy in terms of area:  what are the comparable land areas which would have to be dedicated to specific sources or forms of energy or fuels, and how do those compare?  One of Smil&#39;s descriptions of petroleum wells is &#34;punctiform&#34;, which I love.  A hole in the ground, only about 20 cm in diameter, can provide years to millennia of human energy output, per day.1 litre of oil is equivalent to about 3 days of human energy output (at 3,000 kilocalories/day).1 gallon of oil is eqivalent to about 11 days of human energy.One of the oldest oil wells in production (the First Oil Well of Bahrain) produced 80,000 barrels of oil per day initially.  That&#39;s over 1,000 years of human energy equivalent.By comparison, the yeild of current biomass production is far, far less.  The difference, of course, is that oil is biomass, accumulated, converted, and concentrated over hundreds of millions of years.  We&#39;re consuming it at &gt; 5 million times its rate of formation.  (See Jeffrey S. Dukes, &#34;Burning Buried Sunshine&#34; (2003).)In terms of radioactivity, the net metabolic rate of the Sun&#39;s core is lower than that of a human, measured in energy/mass.  Solar metabolism is closer to that of reptiles, about 1/5 of mamallian metabolic rates.Chemical energy is less productive than the most effective nuclear transitions, but its shear abundance and ease of utilisation tends to weigh in its favour."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Potassium-40 decay is also one of the largest sources of geothermal heat [0]. The cumulative energy released is within two orders of magnitude of the Earth&#39;s gravitational binding energy.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth&#39;s_internal_heat_budget#R..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; 15 decays per second from one banana work out to a couple of picowatts of power, roughly the power consumption of a single human cell. Even if you captured that decay energy with perfect efficiency, powering a house would require about 300 quadrillion[6] bananas&gt; [6] Fine, I looked it up this time.I think that&#39;s out by a factor of 1000.Potassium-40 decays 89.28% of the time to calcium-40, releasing 1.31 MeV, and 10.72% of the time to argon-40 releasing 1.46 MeV [1].  That&#39;s .8928*1.31+.1072*1.46 = 1.32608 MeV per decay on average, which is about 2.1246e-13 Joules [2] per decay on average.  15 decays per second is 15*2.1246e-13 ≈ 3.1869e-12 Watts = 3.1869 picowatts per banana.  I think Randall is using 1000 Watts as the average power usage of a house.  1000/3.1869e-12 ≈ 3.1378e14 ≈ 300,000,000,000,000 = 300 trillion bananas.  Maybe he looked it up wrong?Can anyone confirm this?I can&#39;t find the packing density of bananas, but if it was 1000 kg/m^3, a medium banana is ~118 g [3], so 1000/.118 ≈ 8475 bananas / cubic metre, so 300e14/8475 ≈ 3.54e12 cubic metres of bananas.  The New York metro area is about 12000 km^2 = 12e9 m^2 [4], so the depth of the banana pile is on average 3.54e12/12e9 ≈ 295 metres, which is indeed taller than most of the buildings, so that bit seems right.It&#39;s half past midnight here, so I&#39;m well into &#34;Someone is wrong on the internet&#34; [5] territory....[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium-40[2] https://www.unitjuggler.com/convert-energy-from-MeV-to-J.htm...[3] https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/bananas-calories-carbs[4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_metropolitan_area[5] https://xkcd.com/386/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been using Hasura and TablePlus a lot lately, and actually wished for something that combines them.Hasura is great at understanding relations and making joins feel effortless and TablePlus is so good at making table editing feel as fast as excel.This looks like it&#39;s the thing, with some extra power thrown on top (formulas and nested layouts are nice!).The UI looks drab, but maybe that&#39;s ok? It means the functionality needs to be so strong it doesn&#39;t matter. It also looks super snappy which matters most.Something that Airtable has over relational database GUIs is lightweight enums and arrays of them. Sure you can model all that in SQL, but it&#39;s super useful to have it right inline. I hope this tool can pick up on a pattern like enum tables (like hasura) and provide UI that makes them look like tag list/select fields."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related: I&#39;m enjoying the format of the HYTRADBOI (have you tried rubbing a database on it?) videos.

Give me the information succinctly, so I can watch it during a coffee break or whatever.The organiser of the conference had an interesting (and likeiwse pleasantly succinct!) post-mortem write up of the event, if anyone is interestedhttps://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/hytradboi-2022-po..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here’s some more information on Ultorg:&gt; Ultorg creates general-purpose software that helps organizations manage their data. Based on a new method for interactive data visualization, our product combines ease-of-use with expressive power to allow end-users to query, display, and edit relational data, without resorting to custom programming. This fills a long-standing gap between spreadsheets and tailor-made database applications.
