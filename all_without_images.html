								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are two issues:1) Data collection and algorithmic manipulation. This has been discussed to death, but why you&#39;d let an adversary control the information flow to a huge portion of the population is beyond me. This is obviously a national security issue.2) Fairness in the marketplace. No, I&#39;m not talking about the U.S. marketplace. U.S. tech companies have had their IP stolen and unfair regulations placed on them in China. Why should the U.S. let Chinese tech companies compete in the U.S. marketplace when China doesn&#39;t let U.S tech companies compete in their marketplace?I&#39;m not going to feel pity for TikTok."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me, the interesting question is why a foreign company is doing a better job of understanding what American teenagers wanted than domestic firms with seemingly infinite bankroll to work with.Nobody forced anyone to install TikTok at gunpoint.  Presumably, if there was a more compelling domestic product, the kids would go there instead.  Why has that product failed to materialize?I know, you can&#39;t really set out to manufacture &#34;cool&#34;, but maybe we need to get back the spark in this sector.  I don&#39;t think the existing players are capable of creating an appealing blank-slate social platform.  They might have the cash and technical chops, but they have negative social currency.  Facebook/Meta&#39;s brand is hopelessly tainted: if it&#39;s not creepy spying, it&#39;s still where Mom and Dad hang out to swap antivax memes.  Google might have a little more cool left-- not much-- but they&#39;re also attached to such teen favourites as &#34;crappy limited school-provided Chromebook&#34; and &#34;we have 92 chat apps on our phones and still can&#39;t reach each other&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m conflicted.TikTok collects data for an adversary at scale. Many complain that the US does the same but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that I live in the US. The Chinese government is an adversary of the West whether we like it or not.With that said- It&#39;s pretty telling that the FCC only needs to go to Apple and Google. It would be really nice to have some antitrust regulation so that the FCC doesn&#39;t have this power."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A security researcher wrote an article  while back and it was shocking to see how much data TikTok was collecting:- biometrics- what words are mentioned in the video, popularity- surrounding wifi, location data- your contacts (presumably to cross link to social media platforms)I just can&#39;t believe that a powerful country like America is letting a not-so-friendly military/civilian complex infiltrate it for somewhat unknown purpose."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s incredible that the US allowed TikTok (which is by all measures a chinese spy tool) to become such a dominant social network.India got it right from the beggining by banning TikTok. They saw the immense threat and didn’t hesitate.China, by principle, has always banned all foreign information technology companies. What seemed hostile for us, it’s a reasonable play if you understand the unmeasurable power of massive information products such as Google or Facebook.Meanwhile the US is just focused on attacking its own homegrown tech companies and diminishing their ability to compete in global contexts.We are on a declining trajectory and we willingly paved that road. It’s sad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I will repeat my comment:Stop generalizing the &#34;country of origin&#34; as if it does not matter like the Chinese Comunist Party isn&#39;t a threat to the world.
- There will always be a ruler, and which ruler is killing, slaving, censoring and selling it&#39;s own people as meat tools for foreign companies?- China will kill, torture it&#39;s own people and their families if they think they are a thread (even if remote) to their government party (CCP).- China put on a HEAVY surveilance tool and actually forced people to behave like they want using social credit- China is actively removing ANY historical filosophies, tales, traditions, religions that could be a thread to the CCP&#39;s beliefs.- Have you ever seen a CCP convention? Their plan is to remove the worlds countries boundaries in order to rule over everything from culture to politics and economics. Australia is suffering a lot on their hands, they even sent spies to patronize elections."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a stellar example of a quite rare class of magic trick where the method is actually more amazing than the effect. The vast majority of magic tricks are the opposite. The effect is amazing but the method is actually quite mundane. This is one reason magicians don&#39;t reveal &#34;secrets&#34;. The reality is most magical methods are rather disappointing compared to the astonishing impact of the effect created.For any magical effect there are almost always many possible methods and, conversely, for each method there are multiple possible effects. This method provides a way to know the location (or absence) of each card in a shuffled deck without the performer handling the deck. For most of the effects which could be accomplished with this method there exist a wide variety of alternate, much simpler, methods. Using any of those easier and cheaper methods would likely appear identically amazing to audiences. And that&#39;s why I love this method. As a technologist and magician, I&#39;ve always had a special fondness for wildly complex methods - that rare kind of magic where the method actually IS as amazing as the effect."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This tech could be a game changer for accessibility. Many card games are not or cannot be adapted to braille, so I haven&#39;t been able to play them with friends. If cards can be sold with invisible ink in an open format, then I would need only a scanner and a earphone to be able to check my cards without other help.I&#39;ve thought of doing with with QR codes, but I&#39;m not sure if it will look okay for the other players and if the qr codes won&#39;t be recognizable enough by a human to give someone unfair advantage in some situations."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The intro speaks truth and brings back a lot of frustrating experiences:&gt;We may have all heard the saying “use it or lose it”. We experience it when we feel rusty in a foreign language or sports that we have not practised in a while. Practice is important to maintain skills but it is also key when learning new ones. This is a reason why many textbooks and courses feature exercises. However, the solutions to the exercises feel often overly brief, or are sometimes not available at all. Rather than an opportunity to practice the new skills, the exercises then become a source of frustration and are ignored.Typical exercise soltion: How to draw an owl. 1. Draw some circles. 2. Draw the rest of the $@#% owl."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I expected some in that line: 
https://generalabstractnonsense.com/2017/03/A-quick-look-at-...That is - drawing things on paper, no formulae. I used to do similar exercises with the printed Iris dataset and giving people a transparent foil to draw the classifier. Then, giving them another sheet of paper with the validation dataset. The exercise was loved by people from high-school students to managers.I developed an interactive version, https://github.com/stared/which-ml-are-you. Unfinished as a game, but it works."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I always thought that textbooks never gave detailed solutions because of space limitations.Digital pdf is a great way to break free of these limits and this document is impressive indeed with the detailed solutions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Side-note on digital calendars: What I&#39;d really like is a continuously scrolling calendar to help with long-ish term planning (3-4 months). Most apps are stuck in the single-month page view analogy to physical calendars, which for me keeps breaking my mental flow of stringing activities across the boundary/long distances. And I get why (standard behavior/components and user expectations) but it just seems like a missed opportunity. Not sure how many want this but I suspect more would do if they were exposed to it.A few calendar apps allow a stretch of &gt;4 weeks and there&#39;s this POC web version: https://madebyevan.com/calendar/app/ but all I can do for now is constantly switch from a Gantt app to my calendar app (Thunderbird or Google Calendar)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly, this is where design really falls flat.It looks nice, the idea is appealing, but the result is awful. This thing is totally unusable. You need to remember to slide the frame every month. It doesn&#39;t even tell you that you did or not. Sliding the frame requires checking the number of days there are in the month. When you&#39;re in the last week, having the 31 always there is a pain in the ass. Knowing the next month is kind of useful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Neat. Some limitations:- It doesn&#39;t tell you how many days there are in the month (31/30/28/29).- Working out how to move the frame at the end of the month isn&#39;t very difficult, but it&#39;s not trivial either (especially given the previous point)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something not mentioned in the article: Middle Earth is depopulated. Without large market, it does not make sense to produce at scale, nor you will have the capital to do it.The main characters travel hundreds of kilometers down the biggest river around and they don&#39;t encounter other vessels or a populated settlement until they reach Minas Tirith. And I&#39;m not even mentioning the missing cities and villages in the inland part of the travel. We can say that this is due to lower birth rate in the numenorians who obviously have reproductive issues as mentioned in the books. Another reason is the brain, knowledge and capital drain caused by the large elvian immigration going for centuries. Dwarfs have the excuse of a long generation length to explain why they are not multiplying like rabbits for the thousands of years since the last world war, however, Tolkien does not provide a good reason for the other human nations, the orcs or even the hobbits.Possible explanation might be the unstable security situation on the continent, however, most of the societies are not described as being constantly under the risk of a raid from nearby orc. Aragorn is able to defend most of the north with a few hundred irregulars, while the east participated in only one war 60 years ago that was done in a few weeks time. The south is not described, but nothing unusual there as well as far as the books go."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I highly recommend &#34;The Last Ring Bearer&#34; for people who like to have a bit of fun with Tokien.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_RingbearerEskov&#39;s version of the story describes Mordor as a peaceful constitutional monarchy on the verge of an industrial revolution, that poses a threat to the war-mongering and imperialistic faction represented by Gandalf (whose attitude has been described by Saruman as &#34;crafting the Final Solution to the Mordorian problem&#34;) and the racist elves.[2] For example, Barad-dûr, Sauron&#39;s citadel, appears in chapter 2 as...that amazing city of alchemists and poets, mechanics and astronomers, philosophers and physicians, the heart of the only civilization in Middle-earth to bet on rational knowledge and bravely pitch its barely adolescent technology against ancient magic. The shining tower of the Barad-dûr citadel rose over the plains of Mordor almost as high as Orodruin like a monument to Man – free Man who had politely but firmly declined the guardianship of the Dwellers on High and started living by his own reason. It was a challenge to the bone-headed aggressive West, which was still picking lice in its log ‘castles’ to the monotonous chanting of scalds extolling the wonders of never-existing Númenor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article presents an engineering answer to s sociological question.The reason technology did not advance in Middle Earth is because innovation was not rewarded. Innovation and experimentation were punished.Mine a little too deeply? You awaken a balrog that kills you an everyone you have ever known.Want to expand into that verdant area across the river? You didn&#39;t expect giant spiders, did you?Build a disruptive startup and bank $50B? You&#39;ll hear dragon wings a-flappen.Middle Earth was not filled with innovative disrupters because the risk and reward equation strongly discouraged innovation."</p>

If the answer sounds vague, beware. If the answer makes no sense, beware. If the answer is multifaceted, beware. This suggests that the company will not even begin the process of becoming profitable.2. Who has this problem?You should get a clear picture of an actual person. If not, beware. If that person has no money, beware. If that person has no pull within an organization, beware. If that person is high maintenance or fickle, beware.

If the solution is too expensive for the customer, beware. If the solution can&#39;t be differentiated from its competitors, beware. If the solution has no competitors, beware.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Personally I think they should not be able to decide such things. A payment provider should be forced to accept all legitimate customers. It is absolutely unwanted for a private business (in an unrelated category no less) to be playing the role of legislator.The problem is once a majority of payment providers (especially in this category where there&#39;s only really 2 major ones) starts blocking things, it becomes really difficult for fringe groups that are in fact perfectly legal. I understand that porn payments are a bit more risky but the providers can simply have a policy to deny chargebacks for this category and shift the risk to the customer. Similar to the way returns of sex toys are not accepted for hygiene reasons.Recently there was a lot of news in the Netherlands about prostitutes not being able to open bank account because all banks refused them. Think of prostitution what you will but over there it&#39;s legal work and they pay their taxes. But not being able to get a bank account gets them into very difficult situations and pushes them to shady people (which was exactly what the legalisation was avoiding).Also other platforms like fetlife have recently been forced to validate their users, leading to potentially serious consequences if this data ever becomes compromised. Many people there don&#39;t even show their face so the result is that they have to give a lot more personal info now than they would have wanted to."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As an author of pinephone keyboard firmware, I spent a bit of time thinking and trying to use keyboard like this. I can say that what hinders portability/serious use of all of these layout designs that try to emulate regular big keyboard is that they try to emulate big keyboard layout. That layout is made with an asumption that you have many fingers available, and that they can easily reach anywhere if you like.If you have only two thumbs available for typing, that can only reach about half the keyboard each (quite a hard limit!), you realize how asumptions this layout makes suddenly don&#39;t hold, and normal things like ctrl+a or alt+shift+1, or alt+shift+any arrow are almost impossible.Yes, you can modify the shortcuts in i3wm,screen,... (not Firefox, which is quite resistant to modifying keyboard shortcuts by design) specially for your &#34;PDA&#34;. But  if you just want a portable device you can painlessly migrate your tasks to for a few days a year, spending a lot of time designing shortcuts for your DE, or terminal multiplexer, is not that appealing.It would be probably more useful if key layout was designed from the start to allow various modifier combos to be invoked by dedicated keys, or layout designed so that more modifiers were symetricaly placed (or something even less traditional, and have all letter/number keys on the right and all modifier/modifier combos/special keys on the left), instead of wasting space on big enter key, or big spacebar (for which you may spend several HW iterations just to make those right and reactive on their whole surface), etc. Due to size, it&#39;s usually uncomfortable to press 3 key combos even with the keyboard laying on the table.Also comfortable position for the most comonly used keys (usually modifiers) is not on the edge of the keyboard. That&#39;s really pretty bad for your thumbs.The layout of these things just needs a lot more thought.Sad thing is, that if someone would spend a ton of research and thinking on making something usable and comfortable, most people would completely poopoo it as a freaky unusable layout, just because it would look unfamiliar, lol."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ugh, every time I see a device like this (and even the larger Reform) I&#39;m so tempted. But I learned my lesson form-factor wise with the GPD Win Max: even as a travel laptop it&#39;s painfully small after about a day or two of use. And the sad reality is that the performance-freedom tradeoff is still immense. If we assume the best system module is faster than say a Raspberry Pi 4 (which seems optimistic), it&#39;d still get absolutely walked by an 11-year old i5 (e.g., Tx20 generation Thinkpad which are coreboot-able these days).Any kind of performance-critical stuff is clearly not the point, but it&#39;s hard to not think that smartphones have killed off this form-factor/performance tier for good reason. Makes a lot of sense as a Raspberry Pi with a screen and keyboard, but not really as a &#34;laptop.&#34;"</p>

My needs are very simple, and I&#39;d love to know the state of anything that can (and with stability).1. Be a decent phone (voice, sms)
2. Contacts/Mail/Calendar sync
3. Run android apps that require voice (Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, etc)?
4. Take pictures + videos (not even at a high level)
5. eSIMEverything else is gravy. But those 5 items are the base requirement that I personally have for a phone. Every time I dip in, it&#39;s at best unclear."</p>

I use it as my daily driver in work and for personal use.It has so many features that puts me, the user, in control that I totally take them for granted until I have to use outlook for something.I use it in a multinational, I used it with exchange and now with office 365. People can complain away but there are many like me who rely on it every single day and it has a real, positive impact on our work lives every single day.Some days are just email client and Web browser, and without thunderbird and Firefox working for me as the user...... I dunno, work would be a lot more frustrating I guess. MASSIVE thanks to all the contributors to thunderbird!"</p>

I&#39;m not sure if it will be useful in the office, which is small enough for people to just talk to one another, but it could come in handy in some circumstances where we&#39;d normally use an email chain."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article is informative.  I have found that databases in general tend to be less sexy than the front-end apps...especially with the recent cohort of devs. As an old bastard,  I would pass on one thing:  Realize that any reasonably used database will likely outlast the applications leveraging it. This is especially true the bigger it gets, and the longer it stays in production.  That said, if you are influencing the design of a database, imagine years later what someone looking at it might want to know if having to rip all the data out into some other store.  Having migrated many legacy systems, I tend to sleep better when I know the data is well-structured and easy to normalize.  In those cases, I really don&#39;t care so much about the apps.  If I can sort out (haha) the data, I worry less about the new apps I need to design.  I have been known to bury documentation into for-purpose tables...that way I know that info won&#39;t be lost.  Export the schema regularly, version it, check it in somewhere.  And, if you can, please, limit the use of anything that can hold a NULL. Not every RDBMS handles NULL the same way.   Big old databases live a looooong time."</p>

The user clicked the link after getting it in their mailbox but then Auth0 throws up an error page because the e-mail address has already been verified (by Outlook scanning). 
The problem becomes worse if for some reason the mail ends up in the junk mail folder so the user thinks they&#39;ve never received the mail but when you check it looks like the e-mail address was verified successfully.
That has caused a lot of annoying back and forth trying to figure out what the hell is going on.

Super annoying."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not just in megaprojects either. In my large, fairly dense US city, basic, easy-to-build, local infrastructure like adding a 1-mile bike lane to a straight street is impossible because a handful of NIMBYs are constantly taken seriously by local politicians.My city has many bike lanes that are popular and well-used, as well as a bike-share program that is extremely popular. It also has a large number of cyclist deaths - including children! - due to the spottiness of existing bike infrastructure and overall lack of protected bike lanes. It seems like improving that infrastructure would be both easy, cheap, and popular, given the popularity of cycling and its existing infra, and the cheapness of plopping a concrete barrier onto a street. But no - the second anyone mentions protected bike lanes, a handful of NIMBYs write in with &#34;but muh cars&#34; and the politicians throw up their hands and surrender.I don&#39;t understand why NIMBYs have been taken so seriously in the US in the past 50 years. It seems like at any point in history, any local project will be opposed by somebody, no matter who they are or what the project is. But previous generations seemed to be able to get over that in favor of building. For today&#39;s generation it seems like doing nothing has become better than doing something. If this were the 1900s, government would have told the NIMBYs to get bent, we&#39;re building Thing X because it&#39;s good for society and if you don&#39;t like it, tough. That&#39;s what living in city means sometimes!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the things I love about Palladium (and closely related, Samo Burja&#39;s newsletter) is the depth of research.Like the detail that one of the most egregious episodes from California HSR involved a Spanish company that performed excellently on rail projects in Spain. Overall, this piece makes a strong case that the problem is specifically NIMBYism and loss of government institutional capacity.I think the million dollar question is how government organizations can hire and retain better. The current situation looks dire. Obviously a charismatic leader with a broad anti-NIMBY mandate would go a ways at getting competent people to want to work in government. You saw that succeed on a small scale with orgs like US Digital Service.The elephant, after that, is merit-based pay and promotion. Someone needs to sell this to the public. RN literally random cops and plumbers make mid six figures thru overtime while the directors of $100b mega-project are low-energy lifers making less than that. That&#39;s not gonna work."</p>

And it&#39;s pleasant to feel like my own wisdom or self-control has been validated.OTOH, I know that everyone has limited wisdom / self-control / intelligence, including me.  So it seems hypocritical to mock someone who trips, knowing that I&#39;m just lucky to sometimes avoid the hazards that would trip me up.In the end, about the only conclusions I&#39;m really confident in is that trouble besets us all, and usually it&#39;s good to default to kindness and sympathy.EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION: I&#39;m not saying that I want swindlers to succeed.  I want such predation crushed into dust.  My comment is about the people who don&#39;t intend harm to others."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Prominent crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital has defaulted on a loan worth more than $670 million. Digital asset brokerage Voyager Digital issued a notice on Monday morning, stating that the fund failed to repay a loan of $350 million in the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, USDC, and 15,250 bitcoin, worth about $323 million at today’s prices.In other words, the $670 million that 3AC defaulted on was ~50:50 USDC and bitcoin.Then later:&gt; Zhu [3AC founder] is known for his incredibly bullish view of bitcoin. He said last year the world’s largest cryptocurrency could be worth $2.5 million per coin. But in May this year, as the crypto market began its meltdown, Zhu said on Twitter that his “supercycle price thesis was regrettably wrong.”This seems odd. How does a person convinced that bitcoin exchange is headed to $2.5 million take out a loan of 15K bitcoin if he actually thinks he&#39;ll be paying back it back at a higher exchange rate? Either the founder was bullish in principle but bearish in practice, or didn&#39;t have the first clue about what he was doing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really don’t understand the business model of making massive fiat loans to “firms” to buy bitcoin. If crypto goes up, you get a small amount of interest. If crypto goes down, you lose everything. What? Lol. Just spend a fraction of the sum on bitcoin and do something safe with the rest. What was the plan?Edit: I guess when someone has “20 billion dollars” a 700mm loan doesn’t seem like a big risk."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a good overview, but even by 2014 we weren&#39;t calling hlt - there&#39;s a few problems there. Imagine the situation where you fork() a process on one CPU, and you have another CPU that recently called hlt. Ideally you&#39;d schedule it immediately instead of waiting for the next scheduler interrupt, but sending interrupts from one CPU to another (to break it out of hlt) is kind of expensive. The replacement is an instruction called mwait, which will (like hlt) wake the CPU up on interrupts, but will also wake up the CPU on a write to a specific memory address. If you want to wake up an idle CPU, the working CPU can just do that memory write and then the idle CPU will wake up back into the scheduler and figure out it has work to do.(Edit: there are still actually some circumstances in which hlt is called rather than mwait, but this is very CPU dependent and is based on vendor recommendations. Also, before mwait showed up, switching to deep CPU power saving states tended to involve performing magic IO port accesses rather than calling hlt, and yes the world was worse back then)"</p>

Asyncio has its place but is waaay overused. Typing was a cool idea, but so awkward in practice.All of it has really turned me off, personally. It’s getting to where reading libraries is just painful.  The simplicity of the language was really beautiful and when I wanted type safety, etc. I’d use something else.  I can still write simple Python, but it’s more all the other code I need to grok.I find myself going to Go more and more for stuff I used to use Python for. It’s easier to set up a dev environment for other people, easier to distribute code, and gives me type safety and concurrency as first class citizens while being a very small language.I miss dictionary comprehensions and other shortcuts from time to time. But it actually feels more ergonomic now.All personal opinion. I’m fine shifting languages.  I still write C from time to time to bang bits.  I play with various LISPs to exercise my brain.  I never used Python for performance critical code.

  &gt; of soft pseudonymity as my digital personal space, and expect
  &gt; to have it respected.

Without judging whether the goal is good or not, I will gently point out that your current approach doesn&#39;t seem to be effective. A Google search for &#34;BoppreH&#34; turned up several results on the first page with what appears to be your full name, along with other results linking to various emails that have been associated with that name. Results include Github commits, mailing list archives, and third-party code that cited your Github account as &#34;work by $NAME&#34;.As a purely practical matter -- again, not going into whether this is how things should be, merely how they do be -- it is futile to want the internet as a whole to have a concept of privacy, or to respect the concept of a &#34;digital personal space&#34;. If your phone number or other PII has ever been associated with your identity, that association will be in place indefinitely and is probably available on multiple data broker sites.The best way to be anonymous on the internet is to be anonymous, which means posting without any name or identifier at all. If that isn&#39;t practical, then using a non-meaningful pseudonym and not posting anything personally identifiable is recommended."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; You should organize each day as if it were your last, so that you neither need to long for nor fear the next day.I&#39;ve come to find this &#34;live each day like it&#39;s your last&#34; advice to be pretty unhelpful. My favorite quote about it is, &#34;all that goes to show you is some people would spend their last day giving you stupid advice&#34;.The problem is that if it actually was your last day, most people would give the finger to all of their responsibilities and go party, eat cake, see friends, familiy, lovers, etc. Which is simply not an actual way to live your life. It&#39;s a way to exit your life.An alternative framing that I&#39;ve come to find more helpful is to take your life expectancy, and cut it by 2/3. Now what do you do? For example, if you&#39;re 20 years old and your life expectancy is 80 (ie. 60 more years), pretend that you only have 20 more, so you&#39;ll only live until you&#39;re 40. It&#39;s nice cause it naturally adjusts as you get older. You&#39;ll have smaller windows to work with.This approach strikes a nice balance. It gives you enough time to be able to really do something and change directions if you want. But not so much time that you can really waste any. It forces you to ask the hard questions about whether your day to day is truly connecting with your dreams, and whether you&#39;re on a path to get there.Of course, Seneca didn&#39;t have life expectancy tables to work with. But I think he would have approved. :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article buries its lede, which is about how honey bees get all the attention but are at less risk than wild bees:&gt; And that brings us to the actual problem. The honey bee (Apis mellifera) is only one of about 20 thousand different bee species. The non-honey bees are usually referred to as wild bees, and each location has its native species. According to an estimate from researchers at Cornell University in 2006, wild bees contribute to the pollination of 85 percent of crops in agriculture.&#34;&gt; [...]&gt; But last year the magazine Cell published the results of a study with a global estimate for the situation of wild bees. The authors looked at the numbers of bee species that were collected or observed over time using data publicly available at the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. They found that even though the number of records has been increasing, the number of different species in the records has been sharply decreasing in the past decades.&gt; The decline rates differ between the continents, but the species numbers are dropping steeply everywhere except for Oceania. The researchers say there’s a number of factors in play here, such as the expansion of monocultures, loss of native habitat, pesticides, climate change, and bee trade that also trades around pathogens.&gt; So the problems that wild bees face are similar to those of honey bees, but they have an additional problem which is… honeybees. Honey bees compete with wild bees for food and habitat and they also pass on viruses. Now, a big honey bee colony can deal with viruses by throwing out the infected bees. But this doesn’t work for wild bees because they don’t live in large colonies. And worse, when honey bees and wild bees fight for food they seem to both lose out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"(1) Stop using neonicotinoid pesticides. There are plenty of alternatives for protecting food crops from insect infestations, such as neem oil applied as a foliar spray or a soil soak in response to infestations.  Neonictoninoides are based on the tobacco nicotine molecule structure, but are typically chlorinated and modified to make them more persistent and toxic to insects relative to animals.  There&#39;s a good argument for banning the entire class due to their persistent ecological effects on beneficial native insect populations.https://organic-center.org/research/neonicotinoid-pesticides...(2) Have undisturbed habitat set aside for wild bee populations.  This can be something as simple as maintaining undisturbed hedgerows on the sides of agricultural fields, but in general means maintaining a fair amount of undisturbed native habitat.https://www.planetbee.org/planet-bee-blog//native-bee-series..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I appreciate that she draws the link between monoculture crops, land use, and the health of ecosystems upon which agriculture depends.Organics are important not because GMOs are the enemy but rather because the land use change is inherently bad for all life in that area. GMOs don&#39;t have to lead to monoculture crops that span acres or rampant neonicotinoid insecticides, but they often do, and it&#39;s precisely at that point we can see drastic changes in a biome&#39;s stability and therefore the health of bees among many other pollinators. That&#39;s why we need to be talking about insect numbers at large and not only bees.The study of biodiversity has an extremely difficult time modeling these kinds of changes, and that&#39;s probably why many scientists won&#39;t go to bat against this kind of land use change. A self-respecting scientist won&#39;t say that converting croplands to monocultures ready for insecticide use lead to biodiversity die-off because it&#39;s hard to actually track the fluctuations between species. It takes so much time to collect data to analyze before we even get an inkling of the interplay. We understand so little about the microscale interactions and how it fits into our larger understanding of agriculture and land development.For those who think this is all overblown and alarmist, go sit on the grass -- if you can find a patch -- and stare at a spot until it comes alive. Things are moving around and teeming with a multitude of species of plants and insects. The reality you see escapes unnoticed until you stop to think about the ecological systems that underpin our fragile existence. Our health depends on a functional biosphere. If we cannot figure out how to share the earth with its other inhabitants, what the fuck are we doing going to Mars?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The visual language Bladerunner invented has virtually defined SciFi for the past 40 years.If you enjoy it&#39;s worth digging into the work Syd Mead - the film&#39;s concept artist - created:https://www.flickr.com/photos/x-ray_delta_one/5642443624/in/...https://www.flickr.com/photos/x-ray_delta_one/5642443252/in/...https://www.flickr.com/photos/x-ray_delta_one/5641873923/in/...https://www.flickr.com/photos/x-ray_delta_one/5642441904/in/...Syd&#39;s work in general is worth a deeper investigation if interested -&gt;https://sydmead.com/https://www.flickr.com/photos/40143737@N02/albums/7215762290...https://www.iamag.co/the-art-of-syd-mead/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The main difference between what Ridley views this all in terms of and what I view it all in terms of is as follows. To me, the replicants (or androids, if you will) are deplorable because [inaudible] they are cold, they are selfish, they are heartless, they are completely self-centered, they have no empathy, they don&#39;t care about what happens to other creatures, and to me this is essentially a less-than-human entity for that reason. Now, Ridley said that he regarded them as supermen who couldn&#39;t fly. He said they are smarter than humans, they are stronger than humans, and they have faster reflexes than humans. Well, then I said &#39;well, gee Ridley, I mean, holy smokes, uh, golly,&#39; and that was about all I could think of to say, you know. That&#39;s rather a great divergence, you see: we&#39;ve gone from somebody who is a simulation of the authentic human to somebody who is literally superior to the authentic human. So we&#39;ve now flipped all the cards on the table, you see, when we do that: in other words, all the cards that were up are now down and all the ones that were down are now up. And I was at a loss at that point, you know, to respond, I mean. I said, &#39;okay, now the theme of the book is that Rick Deckard is dehumanized in his job of tracking down the replicants and killing them, that in other words he winds up essentially like they are.&#39; And Ridley said that he regarded that as an intellectual idea and he was not interested in making an esoteric film.&#34;-- Philip K. Dick, interview with Paul M. Sammon (https://invidious.snopyta.org/watch?v=3d7XMnmPgUk starting at 19:10)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hated that movie the first to I saw it.  I was bored with it.Now I love it.  I really enjoy how much time they spend establishing the atmosphere and characters.    It all feels very real and has depth.I loath the speedy sci fi that tries to touch on atmosphere and then hurries along with their paper characters and so on.  So much sci fi I encounter now feels little more than a long trailer with no idea how to end."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Tech writer here.The absolute, invariable first rule in tech writing is to know your audience.Understand not just their technical problems but take the time to empathize with why they have these problems in the first place.Tech writing isn&#39;t about documenting, it&#39;s about finding the best way to explain something to people so they can solve their problems.Oh, and use an editor (the human kind, not the digital kind.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of great advice here. One piece of advice I got from my publisher when authoring a technical book was to first break down what I was going write into headings and subheadings, and if possible, into sub-subheadings. Then review that to see if your flow is coherent and whether there are sections that are missing, or could be extracted into another text.Personally, my process after this is to express my thoughts in bullet points, followed by inserting any placeholders and captions for any graphics (e.g. charts or diagrams), and then finally I start rewriting my bullet points into proper sentences, expanding my examples, and adding any interstitial text necessary to make things flow.Also, I see some comments on keeping things short and to the point. In general, I agree with this, but depending on the medium, sometimes it doesn’t hurt to inject a bit of personality into your writing. Technical writing can be dry at times, and this can deter engagement. Try to use concrete examples whenever possible or refer to other supporting texts."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If anyone is interested, after firefox send shutdown, i wrote https://www.relaysecret.com, its footprint is extremely small (1 lambda function that does all signing for s3 upload/download, simple frontend code that does encryption in browser using web crypto api with no 3rd party Js, no 3rd party css, no tracking. Anchor tag is used for additional random key material (so it wont leave ya browser and files will always be encrypted regardless).You can roll your own too with the terraform code in it. It costs me barely anything (never go over free tier limit) to run it because files never live more than 10 days (there is a catchall lifecycle rule on the bucket) and when users select durations, i also put them in bucket prefix that has lifecycle rule place on objects under them for that duration. Note that we can&#39;t rely on lifecycle rule all the time so i also make sure when lambda is called to access the object, it checks the time-stamp, the duration and if it is meant to expire and not yet cleaned up by s3 - lambda function deletes it.I learnt a ton of cool things about s3 after this neat little project and really dig the API, the lifecycle rule, signing url etc...Ps: for these type of tool, you should definitely mitm it to see if plaintext file or password ever leave the browser... Relaysecret does leave one item unencrypted and that is the file name. You can change it upon upload but i like to leave it there so people know what they are downloading. I have simple idea of encrypting that with just the anchor key but haven&#39;t gotten around to put that in yet."</p>

Last I heard, Firefox Send was shut down due to malware/etc moderation issues.https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/what-happened-firefox-s...&gt; Firefox Send has been discontinued as of September 17th, 2020. You will no longer be able to upload or receive files. We’d like to thank all of you who tried Firefox Send.&gt; We started Firefox Send as a way for you to share files safely and easily from any browser. Unfortunately, some abusive users were beginning to use Firefox Send to ship malware and conduct phishing attacks. When this problem was reported, we stopped the service.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Even if Google was an absolute saint without a trillion-dollar ad business, there&#39;s still a problem of &#34;bug-compatibility&#34;.Without a second browser engine to test pages in, it&#39;s really hard to know what is a bug and what is intentional. Devs don&#39;t know all the specs by heart. They write whatever happens to work for them, but sometimes they accidentally depend on obscure edge cases in the implementation that were never meant to exist.In the long term it&#39;s paralysing for the engine maintainers, because any change in implementation could be changing some subtle behavior that breaks some pages. W3C requires two independent implementations, so that they&#39;ll share intentional behaviors, but hopefully their bugs will differ.The single-engine Web will be as fun to maintain as Windows: Windows 11 Explorer has a shiny new context menu with an option to reopen it as an older, uglier context menu, because Microsoft couldn&#39;t touch a line of code of the old context menu without breaking apps."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The chromium-only web is not google’s fault. It is a symptom of a body of web standards that has grown wild to the point of being all but unimplementable.Building a browser for the modern standards-based web is effectively impossible, because it costs too much, takes too long, and requires a standing army to keep up with.We are at an impasse. The standards cannot be deprecated because they are used all over the web, and because they are used all over the web a new browser maker has little choice except forking chromium or firefox. Even microsoft couldn’t afford to keep adding all the standards to their browser engine. Normally the solution for a messy overgrown implementation is a grand reboot. But we can’t do a grand reboot of the web because we cannot get rid of the legacy. The only viable strategy I see to have real browser engine diversity without giving up on compatibility is moving as much of the standards implementation as possible into JS modules, so new browser makers can start with a small engine that loads the publicly hosted  standards modules."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article does an incredible job as painting Apple as a dystopian corporation that is strangling the web with forced WebKit, but spends so little time actually refuting the statement &#34;if WebKit weren&#39;t mandated, Chromium would take over&#34;. It pretty much comes down to &#34;if Apple were forced to open their platform, they would spend money improving Safari, and user&#39;s wouldn&#39;t switch because Apple has a gorillian dollars&#34;. The author seems to ignore that Google also has a gorillian dollars, plus the added inertia of Chromium itself, plus the pervasive network of Search and YouTube that would shove ads for Chrome down the throats of users. Money alone, even billions, cannot create a competitive browser engine. Microsoft tried. I&#39;m not sure that, if you actually cared about browser diversity, that forcing Apple to open up iOS and then hoping they don&#39;t mismanage Safari trying to compete with Chrome is a losing bet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me, I felt this take was so disconnected from my reality as a user that I didn&#39;t even know where to start.Looking at the author bio, I can see he&#39;s very invested in the Blink project so it&#39;s difficult to shake the feeling that by arguing for &#34;browser diversity&#34;, he&#39;s simply pushing for increased Blink dominance.If one truly wanted to get more diversity in the Browser space, the number one objective should be getting Google to divest from the Chrome project. This would finally create space for other players to come in and have real influence over the future of the web.As it is today, everything Web-related gravitates around what Google wants. Apple is not playing ball, and so Google is getting the community to push regulators to intervene and make them kneel.Well, that&#39;s my view at least, maybe I&#39;m too cynical."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s not just WebKit. Devs can’t extent WebKit very much. Orion is trying but they’ve barely gotten anything done on the iOS extension side. There are limitations on what you can do by linking into the iOS web browser API, it seems.I recently switched to Mac with  great success. So I decided to try out the iPhone. I hadn’t used one for years and I was sick of Android.I’m still no great fan of Android. And so many little things are better on iOS.However, the SINGLE BIGGEST THING is absolutely broken. Browsing on iOS is unusable if you’re used to uBlock Origin. I can run that on Fennec/Firefox. I cannot do so on iOS. I was hoping the content blockers and extensions might come close. They do not in any way.I don’t even REALLY like FF and I don’t like Android but those are the options if I want browsing that doesn’t suck.Or maybe I’m missing something and someone can enlighten me before I return the iPhone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article buried the lede, which I think is this-- Google as email provider had information all along that DMCA notices it was sending to its YouTube property were not legitimate.  Google even went so far as to flag and reject some of those notices because of false personalities, but instead of going to the root cause to stop abuse of its systems it allowed the same user to plug along long enough to manipulate YouTube in a way that caused Bungie an alleged $7.6m in damages.  Then the icing is that when Bungie came knocking Google initially resisted a court-related request to allow Bungie to identify the user and stop the abuse.  Wow."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A side note that I found particularly interesting&gt; On March 22, the Reynolds account logged out of Google and less than a second later, the Wiland account logged in, suggesting the same person was behind both accounts.I&#39;ve always wondered how often timing analysis is used in practice by surveillence big tech. I suspect that as people become more privacy aware, and start using VPNs, pseudonames, multiple accounts, etc, that big tech will start using timing analysis more and more to correlate traffic and identify users. Like if your friend sends you a Reddit link on WhatsApp, and you immediately open it in your browser, that Reddit session is now linked to you.Another more complex example: let&#39;s say Google has already identified your Reddit account. You open a Reddit discussion, and deep in the discussion it links to a Youtube video, and you open it in your browser. Now even if you weren&#39;t logged into Youtube, Google could guess that it&#39;s you based on the timing of when your Reddit account opened the discussion, and when the linked Youtube video was accessed. And not just that video, but now every Youtube video watched in the same browsing session, is now linked back to you (assuming you have first-party cookies enabled, which is basically required if you ever want to log into anything).Seems a bit paranoid, but I actually suspect this happened to me a few months ago. I was using a FOSS reddit client and clicked a youtube link buried deep in a reddit thread, and opened it in Newpipe (a FOSS youtube client). I wasn&#39;t logged in, and was using a VPN, and yet the next day on my Youtube feed I started getting recommendations based on that video (and those recommendations were very different from my usual ones). Scary stuff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My understanding is that if you wanted to hurt a YouTube channel, you could do so like this   1. Use a VPN create a gmail address.
   2. Use that address to file a DMCA notice on each channel video.
   3. Google auto-accepts; the channel challenges each notice.
   4. You deny all challenges.

And just like that, you can destroy any YouTube channel, without any accountability. Is this correct?"</p>

I turned off all electronics for a month and uninstalled the apps and restricted my phone use to calls and responding to 3 close friend&#39;s texts at a set time each day--I didn&#39;t keep it on me at all. No video games, no TV, no watch or music streaming. I had my library of local music loaded to my trusty Zune and used that exclusively for music as the only device I carried with me.I read through the entirety of the Percy Jackson books and the Heroes sequels, the Mortal Instruments, the Seven Realms Novels, and the complete unabridged HHGTG. All it took to get my book-a-day self back was bringing myself back to my teen years when I wasn&#39;t allowed on the computer with access to the internet and my texts cost .3 minutes to read or send and I only got 100/mo. I was averaging roughly 350 pages per day.When I wasn&#39;t reading I was drawing or writing or outside being active when it was cool enough which improved my mental health even in spite of my heat based SAD.At the end of the month I had the attention span when I got back online to attend to a cross country move and secure a job and an apartment by the end of August. I had been intending to move for the 3 years prior.I wonder how I could go about taking advantage of the burst of creativity and focus while still being online enough to develop some of the software ideas I have that I never follow through on without getting overstimulated and distracted."</p>

Anti-societal violence in video games were under constant protest (like the original Grand Theft Auto, or Mortal Kombat), and don&#39;t even think about trying to start a business like Uber or Spotify.New file formats could be immediately crushed by IP concerns. Even web pages posting content about circumventing current systems or linking to sites like that were targeted. If you weren&#39;t a big player, you didn&#39;t have any way to accept money (besides asking people to mail you checks).While tech is seen as too powerful now, I think it&#39;s at least nice that we no longer have the anxiety that plagued any idea or project in the past.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I find people are religious about being git cli purists and only interacting with it in this black box (the terminal). On top of that a lot of people stop learning git after add commit push pull branch and merge so concepts like rebasing and cherry picking are scary.
In this day and age we have state of the art GUI tools that change the game and allow git users to see and interact with the state of a git repository in real time. It&#39;s a great way to demystify things like rebasing and interactive rebasing because they show you what&#39;s happening in a modern UI designed specifically for git.
I often suggest git CLI purists to get something like git kraken and just use it as a visual dashboard. Watch what happens when you run git commands. You can see everyone else&#39;s remote branches and have a much better idea of what&#39;s going on than you can without it.  
I&#39;ve worked on teams that just didn&#39;t rebase at all and I think people are oblivious to the mess they make on branches with their chaotic merge strategies.  
These days, I tend to envision the state of the branch that I want and make that happen. It&#39;s so easy to create a new branch before I do anything that if I think something might go south, I just hard reset to my previous state (a branch I created right before the operation)  
Gitkraken also has an undo button that handles all sorts of scenarios and I rarely click it without getting exactly what I expected."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My mental model of a git repo is basically a bramble bush with labels on it.The bramble stems and branches are the commit history (which may join and well as split, unlike a bramble). The labels are stuck to particular bits of the bramble. Some labels are even stuck to other labels!You can move the labels around, and you can glue extra bits of bramble to the tips of what you have. You can even hack about with the bramble, but this is not recommended. Label moving often happens automatically, e.g. when &#39;growing&#39; a bramble tip.It gets interesting when you compare two brambles (e.g. remote and local repos). You might determine that one bramble is identical to another, just with the labels moved. Or one bramble is the same as the other but with extra stems added. Or both brambles had a common ancestor bramble, but now they both have extra stems. Or perhaps they are completely irreconcilable.Better visualisation tooling would help."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This book changed me. I was an idle eight year old, and my school didn&#39;t give us homework to do. So my father decided to set me homework of his own devising, which on one occasion was reading Flowers for Algernon.I was moved by the story of a man who had little natural ability, straining to make the best of what he had. Then becoming smarter than everyone around him, and then what follows.There&#39;s many things to take from this story. I took away that we should make the best of what we have. To do otherwise is to miss out. Never take what you have for granted. Everything is a blessing; don&#39;t waste it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ted Chiang wrote a short story inspired by Flowers for Algernon (&#34;Understand&#34;) that explores what might happen if a guy just never stopped getting smarter: https://web.archive.org/web/20140527121332/http://www.infini...I love Flowers for Algernon, but Understand is my favorite short story of all time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think too many of us believe that intelligence is valuable, in and of itself.  Instead, I think we should value personal excellence.  That is, making the most of the intelligence you’re given.The arc of intelligence in Flowers of Algernon is the same arc that we’ll all experience over our lifetime.  With old age, we, too, will lose our intelligence.  If we value intelligence, in and of itself, we’ll eventually face a crisis of sorts.  But, if we value making the most of our intelligence, we are resilient.Applying this framework to Charlie, there’s much less to be sad about.  He made the most of the intelligence he was gifted, and that’s what really matters."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I collect a lot of certs for fun, but most have not been helpful. I still like to collect them anyway.I think OSCP was the most legitimately useful in tech https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/PMP has been useful to take on Project Manager roles, but really PrM roles aren&#39;t all that exciting to begin with. Still helps when you want to run your own projects.I&#39;m currently studying to be a certified parliamentarian from the National Association of Parliamentarians. I&#39;m interested in corporate governance and learning Roberts Rules of Order definitely helps.I&#39;m also a certified farmer (yeah its a thing), I have 5 sailing certs, 3 scuba certs, Wilderness Emergency Medical Responder cert, working on my pilots license, getting my real estate sales license, ham radio operator general class, almost done with my CDL, there&#39;s lots more I&#39;d have to check my notes on.I do want to get a Kubernetes cert done this year. Long term I want to knock out my CPA/CFA exams, but those are a huge commitment so we will see if it pans out.Most of this response hasn&#39;t answered your question at all, because certs really are mostly useless. Still fun to collect.I&#39;d imagine financial certs would be the most useful (CFA in particular).If anyone knows any other fun certs let me know."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This will not apply to all companies, but for our hiring decisions certs have an adverse effect. If someone puts many certifications on their resume my expectations are lower and I likely won&#39;t consider them for interviews. It&#39;s a negative signal in my experience. Your time is better spent working on side projects, contributing to open source, writing a blog, etc. I.e. do real-world stuff instead of wasting time on artificial tests that require memorization and exist largely as a revenue stream for certification providers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"MCSE really helped me.In the late 90s, 98 I think, I worked for an internet startup that didn’t end up being huge. We were on Novell and a bit if solaris and had just launched a product that used windows nt and server side activex.I was a college dropout web dev/web master making $50k. They had a hard time hiring devs who knew nt and could design and automate server farms. I learned on the job and did an ok job running it. But they wouldn’t promote me because I was really young and didn’t have a degree.I went to a Microsoft conference and would buy a study book each day and take the test there. I did 3 exams during the conference and took the other three when I got home and with all 6 certs got my Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (with a stamp of bill gates’ signature).They gave me a raise to $60k (and the college grads went from 50-55). I then got $70k six months later and $80k six months after that as I was the “certified person.”I always thought it was funny that I did the same job before and after the certs. The Networking cert was really useful and I still remember how to do subnets and dns and dhcp and stuff."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Anecdata: exercise massively reduces my otherwise constant craving for processed sugars, deep fried and smoked or cured things, alcohol and smokes.I&#39;m not less hungry, but I&#39;m less hungry for nasty stuff, so from my perspective there seems to be a lot of truth in this!Context: I&#39;m natively extremely lazy (phisically, not intellectually), I find any phisical activity a pain an a nuisance, I derive zero pleasure from any kind of sport and phyisical exercise (except hiking and skidiving, but not the phisical effort aspects of them), the release-endorphines-on-effort circuit is 100% broken for me or I just lack the receptors for those endophins... eg. 100%-lazy-cat except not fat because genetically I come from a line of people slim-no-matter-what-we-eat. (Probably more average or atletic people&#39;s bodies just don&#39;t work like mine...)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Although this is my guess based on experience, I think said anti-hunger effect can be had without intense exercise.  I&#39;ve noticed consistently that walking has an anti-hunger effect.  Walking does take more time than running, but it doesn&#39;t really register as stress to the body in the same way that running and other forms of cardio do, meaning a lower cortisol response.  Maybe it&#39;s not as strong an effect as with something like running, but I think it&#39;s worth observing and considering.  In weighing the pros and cons, I think that walking is better in terms of longevity.  Cortisol and stress on joints are things you don&#39;t really want."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not paying 32 bucks for the study, but it seems the study was mostly done on mice. We share 99% percent of genes with mice but hope the 1% are important enough :-)The abstract mentions the effect also occurs on humans and horses, without further details if they were part of the study, or if is just well known. It could be a temporary effect.If you are trying to lose weight, change diet before starting with exercise.
When at the proper weight, use exercise to keep at the correct level.Several studies compared two groups. One group changed just diet, and other used diet and exercise from the beginning. Faster weight loss noticed in the group just doing a diet change and not doing increased exercise.The assumption that the increase of exercise, might call
for additional cravings, even if of a different type of food.[1] &#34;...For weight loss, diet seems to be more effective than physical activity,&#34;... &#34;You have to do huge amounts of physical activity to lose weight, but you can get a better energy deficit just by cutting down on calories...&#34;
...&#34;...So both diet and physical activity are important,&#34;...&#34;Diet probably more important for losing weight. Physical activity for keeping it off...&#34;[2] &#34;...Despite the prevailing advice, exercise is pretty unhelpful for weight loss...&#34;[1] &#34;Mayo Clinic Minute: Which is better for losing weight – diet or exercise?&#34;:

We didn&#39;t stay outside very long (maybe 5 minutes). But walking him back inside he stopped and said &#34;thanks for waking me up to see this. I really liked it&#34;. Then we both went back to sleep.It may seem trivial but these are great moments to share with your kids/spouse/SO—there is so much in our lives that we can&#39;t see or touch nowadays and it is really meaningful to be able to point up in the sky (even without binocs/assistance) and &#34;see&#34; these planets we talk about but only usually see in pictures.It can be a real spiritual experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there any way to get alerts on your phone of these events before they happen? It always seem like by the time they make the press and get disseminated on sites like HN it is too late. Was very frustrated by the solar eclipse  a while back because by the time the mainstream press picked up on it, glasses were sold out everywhere. There is too much going on to have to manually research and systematically keep track of every topic of interest. Isn&#39;t that the point of the News, and sites like Reddit/HN?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A surprising experience to me was seeing Saturn through a telescope.  Despite working on PhD in physics at the time and being a lab demonstrator for an undergraduate astronomy course, I looked at it and thought &#34;shit, it&#39;s real!&#34;Though it was a nice enthusiast-level telescope, I think it was just seeing the rings that did it.  So I reckon a cheaper one would have had the same effect."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll be the begrudging devils advocate for a decision that is sure to have devastating consequences for poor women in red states.It is good for unelected bodies like the Supreme Court to allow such dividing issues be figured out democratically. The US house has bled power to the other 3 institutions and of them, the judiciary is the least democratic. Ofc, my support for this change assumes that this Supreme Court will show restraint towards political activism (in either direction) in general. Call it naive, but I&#39;ll wait and see.States rights has always been a double edged sword. You can&#39;t have your cake and eat it too. The same state rights that allow gun control and homosexuality to be locally legalized before national concensus; also now lead to abortion legislation being a state issue.The sad part of democracy is that it aims to represent the views of the voting majority. If the voting majority truly cares about access to abortion then we will hopefully see enough democratic traction to give them the mandate needed. Now, the rural republican votes counting for more in the senate is a huge issue and threat to democracy that the US needs to figure out if it ever wants to represent the views of the people. But, the Supreme Court should not be responsible for managing dysfunction in other branches of govt.My personal opinion is that polarization has pushed both sides to be completely antagonistic towards each other. &#39;Own the libs, fuck the deplorables&#39;, no compromise. The jaded side of me says: vote in more moderates that are willing to strike compromises. Crazed jesus Republicans and hyperprogressive activists are terrible people to put into national office. They gain power by antagonizing and being unhelpful roadblocks for change, all while asking for the most stubbornly impossible outcomes.In the long run, history will have a dim view of this era of global polarization with all political sides to blame."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I almost lost my wife due to the Catholic Hospital&#39;s policy against D&amp;C procedures. Had the OBGYN not put his career on the line, and over-riding the prohibition on the procedure, she would have died.  Now that same hurdle can become risking prison.A few years later, we were blessed with a child who is doing well. I would have neither if not for Roe v. Wade.This isn&#39;t about abortion, it&#39;s about denying healthcare!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Before anyone writes a eulogy based on the headline, note the following:So it’s sad, but also awesome in its own way, that 2022 will see the end of Zachtronics. Not because their publisher shuttered them, or because their venture capital funding ran out, or because Activision made them work on Call of Duty, or any other number of reasons (bankruptcy! scandal!) game developers usually close their doors.No, Zachtronics is closing because...they want to.“We’re wrapping things up!” Barth tells me, way more enthusiastically than you would normally expect under these circumstances. “Zachtronics will release Last Call BBS next month. We’re also working on a long-awaited solitaire collection that we’re hoping to have out by the end of the year. After that, the team will disband. We all have different ideas, interests, tolerances for risk, and so on, so we’re still figuring out what we want to do next.”I play games too infrequently to invest the necessary bandwidth into a Zachtronic game, but I read some of ZACH-LIKE and always respected the philosophy. As long as no one is getting the rug pulled, this sounds like an awesome way to go and an awesome thing for the gaming industry. Hopefully this means more smart indie gems in the future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve found it difficult after starting to work full-time to fully enjoy Zachtronics games, since they use much of the same parts of my brain as my day job, but the sheer joy I got out of Zach&#39;s earlier games (SpaceChem, KOHCTPYKTOP, Codex of Alchemical Engineering) contributed a lot to my decision to work in software. I&#39;ve experienced little else that scratches the &#34;design itch&#34; in such a pure and thoughtful way, whether games from other developers or actual software development."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Zachtronics leaving game development is such a blow to the industry. Zach is directly and indirectly responsible for a lot of games we see today. His game Infiniminer was a major inspiration for Minecraft, he published a game that was also a book explaining his philosophy on puzzle design, and his games were genuinely fun with no BS."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is Alina Chan, one of the co-authors of Viral: The Search for the Origin of Covid-19.I’m going to answer some of the questions that have come up in the comments.1. Are Chan and Ridley selling a book?Yes, the updated paperback comes out in the US next week: https://www.harpercollins.com/products/viral-matt-ridleyalin...The updated epilogue now discusses three significant new developments since the publication of the hardback that are being hotly debated in the comments here. The first was the discovery of a virus in a bat in Laos that is slightly more similar to SARS-CoV-2 than the virus studied at the Wuhan Institute of Virology; but both are still not the progenitor of the pandemic. The second is detailed information about how prominent western virologists, who had privately thought the virus was likely manipulated in a laboratory, began to instead tell the public that no lab-based scenario was plausible. The third is a trio of conflicting studies about whether the Huanan seafood market was the site of a natural spillover of the virus from animals to people or just the site of a human superspreader event in December 2019.As with the hardcover, half of our earnings from the book have gone/will go to charity.2. Does the available evidence lean towards a market origin?Some experts have asserted that there is dispositive evidence that the virus jumped from animals to people at the Wuhan Huanan market. However, their analysis failed to take into account the realities in the early days of the pandemic. Without access to the methodology and actual data collected by investigators in Wuhan, their interpretation unfortunately falls prey to ascertainment bias. Please see this thread for details: https://twitter.com/Ayjchan/status/1499794942012579843At the moment, US intelligence, the WHO SAGO advisory group, and many top virologists and experts find both natural and lab origin hypotheses plausible and deserving of investigation. The evidence does not lean so strongly towards one hypothesis or the other that we can assume one as the default truth.I personally think the available evidence points towards a lab origin but would not go as far as to say that there is dispositive evidence of it. 
Please see these 2 threads:
https://twitter.com/Ayjchan/status/1524394197738049537
https://twitter.com/Ayjchan/status/15397457368076165133. Can scientists manipulate and genetically engineer naturally found viruses without leaving a trace? In other words, can the genome of the virus tell us its recent history?We describe the seamless genetic engineering capabilities developed in the years leading up to the pandemic in VIRAL. Due to advanced technologies, it is no longer always possible to use the genome of a virus to distinguish between a natural pathogen vs one that has spent time in a laboratory. Even top coronavirologists, including Ralph Baric who collaborated with the Wuhan scientists, have said that the only way to know is to look at the Wuhan lab records. You can also read my twitter thread: https://twitter.com/Ayjchan/status/1493733086089121794Even the presence of the furin cleavage site insertion that is unique to the pandemic virus and is indeed what makes it a highly infectious pandemic virus is not “dispositive evidence” of either a natural or lab origin. Please see our peer-reviewed analysis here: https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/39/1/msab327/64260854. Why does the lab leak hypothesis encompass so many different scenarios by which research activities could lead to the emergence of the pandemic virus?A natural spillover hypothesis also encompasses several different scenarios, e.g., bat direct transmission to people in natural habitats, bat to people in markets, bat to farmed animals or wildlife to people in nature, at farms or market, etc.This doesn’t mean that a natural or lab origin are insinuations. It just means we are lacking so much key evidence that it’s not possible to pin down an exact mechanism by which the virus emerged in the Wuhan human population.5. Does finding close relatives of the pandemic virus in bats, e.g., in Laos, mean that its origin is natural?No, because viruses that escape from labs were also ultimately derived from nature and we know that scientists in Wuhan had been collecting viruses from across 8 countries (China and SE Asia) where the closest relatives to the pandemic virus have been found. Please see the graphic in this tweet: https://twitter.com/Ayjchan/status/15221172706124513356. Is there anything to do about finding the origin of Covid-19 now? Isn’t it a dead end? And is that why interest is waning?There is plenty to do to investigate the origin of Covid-19 using sources and data that exist outside of China. Please see a recent peer-reviewed letter in PNAS: https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2202769119And my thread on it: https://twitter.com/Ayjchan/status/1527381169729425410It is very surprising to me that these feasible routes of inquiry have not been explored more than 2 years into the pandemic.7. Have infected animals on sale at the Huanan market been found? Was there any evidence that SARS-like viruses were circulating in the Wuhan animal trading community before the emergence of Covid-19?No. I recommend reading my medium post for more details: https://ayjchan.medium.com/a-response-to-the-origins-of-sars...8. Regardless of the origin of Covid-19, shouldn’t the focus be on making sure there is more oversight and regulation of current and future pathogen research?I agree and wish that we didn’t need to prove the origin of this pandemic to motivate scientific leaders to better regulate risky pathogen work. I have been dedicating efforts to this cause since last year and hope to be able to share some exciting news later this year."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those with a bit more background in the sciences, there&#39;s an increasingly massive amount of evidence to support Zoonotic origin.  Philipp Markolin has a good rundown:https://protagonistfuture.substack.com/p/natures-neglected-g...Most of the &#34;evidence&#34; for lab leak is just weird insinuation -- it&#39;s increasingly hard to pin down what the advocates for that position are even arguing (e.g. whether it&#39;s a natural virus that escaped or an engineered one, how different lineages showed up at the market, which lab it allegedly escaped from since the WIV campus is much further from the market compared to the CCDC, etc etc).China is a bad actor and definitely contributed to the conspiracy madness around the virus by being so shut-down and performing such a half-assed investigation but unfortunately they would have done the same whether the virus came to be via the same animal trade that caused the last SARS outbreak or if there was some secret Wuhan project."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think understanding the origin is important, but I also understand why it wasn&#39;t a media fixation during the pandemic itself.1) Understanding the origin doesn&#39;t change the consequences or response to the pandemic2) Unlike the nuclear analogy in the article, pandemic virus outbreaks happen naturally, and fairly frequently. Combined with the huge increase in global travel, when one does happen it can be around the world in every airport before anyone has even identified it.So in the big picture this type of outbreak seems inevitable, not anomalous or inherently preventable.Understanding the origin, either by cross-species origination or a laboratory containment breach, is indeed important and significant and should be pursued, but I also understand why the search for that answer isn&#39;t at the top of the 24-hour news cycle."</p>

Otherwise account takeovers become trivial.The article&#39;s attack is relatively benign - the user simply goes to a website. Sure they may end up putting info in that website, but probably not. Plus existing systems for malicious website filtering can kick in to prevent this.The more concerning attack is the social engineering one where a third party says something like &#34;let me &#39;verify&#39; your identity, I&#39;ll send you a number tell me what it is&#34; then triggers an identity verification request on the domain (this can be done either manually or part of a sign up flow for some honeypot service). Now the target needs only relay 6 digits to someone they already &#34;trust&#34; and are in a conversation with, versus in the article&#39;s example they needed to put their full account info into an unknown website."</p>

Can we just  use something other than Google Analytics?”. This is how the idea for Plausible was born.Surely they must have looked around and seen that there were already quite a few products doing privacy-first analytics? But yet they started anyway? And had success even though their marketing doesn&#39;t really state any reasons why the user should use them not the many other privacy-first analytics offerings out there?I mean I&#39;m happy for them that they&#39;re successful, but I think there must be more to it than alluded to in this blog post, both in (a) the decision to start in the face of lots of competition and (b) success despite not trying to differentiate themselves from the competition."</p>

Crypto providers operating in or from the Netherlands also needed to apply for registration with the Dutch Central Bank (DNB). Besides the AMLD5 implementation DNB required from crypto providers to implement additional measures, which is the same wallet verification that Coinbase now requires.Bitonic (a dutch crypto broker/provider) filed a lawsuit against DNB regarding the additional wallet verification requirement, which was not part of AMLD5. DNB formally acknowledged the complaints from Bitonic and revoked the wallet verification.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is the future of databases, but nobody seems to realize it yet.One of the biggest problems with databases (particularly SQL ones) is they&#39;re a giant pile of mutable state. The whole idea of &#34;migrations&#34; exists because it is impossible to &#34;just&#34; revert any arbitrary change to a database, diff changes automatically, merge changes automatically. You need some kind of intelligent tool or framework to generate DDL, DML, DCL, they have to be applied in turn, something has to check if they&#39;ve already been applied, etc. And of course you can&#39;t roll back a change once it&#39;s been applied, unless you create even more program logic to figure out how to do that. It&#39;s all a big hack.By treating a database as version-controlled, you can treat any operation as immutable. Make any change you want and don&#39;t worry about conflicts. You can always just go back to the last working version, revert a specific change, merge in one or more changes from different working databases. Make a thousand changes a day, and when one breaks, revert it. No snapshotting and slowly restoring the whole database due to a non-reversible change. Somebody dropped the main table in prod? Just revert the drop. Need to make a change to the prod database but the staging database is different? Branch the prod database, make a change, test it, merge back into prod.The effect is going to be as radical as the popularization of containers. Whether you like them or not, they are revolutionizing an industry and are a productivity force multiplier."</p>

I came across it at a really good time in my computer science self education. It helped me learn about some essential data structures and algorithmic analysis. The video lectures interspersed in the text augment the text and vice versa. The sections without videos were tougher for me to digest, but are written clearly and bear revisiting and study. If you, like me, are looking for a good next step after Grossman’s PL MOOC, I recommend spending some time with this incredible free resource."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found my experience trying to work with a large OCaml base a nightmare — when signatures changed in an unstable dependency (e.g. function argument removed and nested inside another), the errors spat out by the typechecker were utterly incomphrehensible.This was largely due to automatic currying in OCaml — if I have a function call &#34;some_function arg1 arg2&#34; and &#34;some_function&#34; adds a third argument, that call becomes a function that requires a single argument, arg3, but the typechecker message that tells you all of this is well-nigh unintelligible.Switching to Rust was a blessed relief, not least because Rust has much better developer tooling and documentation (but also no automatic currying).It made me think that OCaml is efficient and beautiful if you&#39;re the only person touching your specific codebase (which I think is true in the vast majority of cases) or if many of your colleagues are deep OCaml officionados with PhDs, but it&#39;s not a good collaborative language for the rest of us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I spent a lot of time on Standard ML in university.OCaml was always portrayed as the engineer&#39;s alternative for real applications.I spent some time brushing up on OCaml a few years ago using Exercism.io.While OCaml is a personal &#34;top tier&#34; language, I&#39;d always prefer Haskell, Rust or Scala.Type classes / traits just seem to beat a higher-order module system for me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"All these things are related.  Back in the 1990s I worked with others to develop DSL technologies (ADSL, HDSL, VDSL) for telcos.  Why not fiber, some ask?  oh, fiber materials may be sand, but installed fiber is sand, energy, and labor.  Installation costs trump everything - use what you have for the physical medium.While we (PairGain) also made point-to-point private links, it was clear then, and even moreso now that most DSL involves a service provider managing the network - with specialized skills, practices and setup.In the 2010&#39;s I was spending time with the Ethernet folks, and in particular industrial folks with large plants.  I ended up chairing IEEE Std 802.3cg which developed the 10 Mb/s 1km technology.  Not really a speed increase - more an application refocus.  As the networking world developed, many realized that converging networks above the physical layer added network complexity and therefore setup and ongoing operating costs...  So we now also have SPE - pure Ethernet at DSL-like distances...Similar tech with different use models, enabling connectivity for whatever...I&#39;m not Al Gore - I won&#39;t claim to have invented the internet.  I just an engineer who happened to have a hand in both of these technologies, and am still pleased to see that people use them."</p>

In fact they end up selling your code back to yourself if you plan to use the service.If the answer is no, that moves the needle pretty far in the direction where I&#39;d at least consider the idea of moving all of my repos to Gitlab. I don&#39;t care much about stars or popularity. I open source things that are interesting and useful to me and if other folks want to use it they can but I don&#39;t gain motivation from others using the projects I release. I like Github and its UI and it&#39;s no doubt &#34;the spot&#34; for open source but selling code written by others rubs me the wrong way a lot. It stinks because it also means no longer contributing to other code bases too. It&#39;s moving us in the opposite direction of what open source is about."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find this whole topic very annoying, this is like the 3rd variation to reach the front page today. But it has made me realize why I instinctively dislike Free Software as a movement.Copyright and licensing are bad, actually. Stop getting worked up about the idea of using courts to punish theft. Stop getting into a frenzy of arousal about the police kicking down doors to drag Billy Gates to jail because 80 characters of fast square root is theft but 79 isn&#39;t.Where on earth is the ambition and vision!? Knowledge is public domain. A commons of knowledge is a public good. The cost of code copying is zero.Sure in our day job we have to pretend to care about this stuff. But when did the ideological scope of what can be achieved become rules lawyering over license text.Copy my MIT licensed code without attribution? I don&#39;t give a shit, go ahead, I hope it helps, in fact I want a truly public domain license but copyright law is so hostage to corporate interests no such thing exists in many countries.Free the code."</p>

Under which license? Some open source licenses are incompatible with others, but copilot uses code from probably every OSS license conceived.4.

But I think it&#39;s worth empathizing that this is a thread on the Git ML in response to a user who&#39;s asking if Git/SHA-256 is something &#34;that users should start changing over to[?]&#34;.I stand by the comments that I think the current state of Git is that we shouldn&#39;t be recommending to users that they use SHA-256 repositories without explaining some major caveats, mainly to do with third party software support, particularly the lack of support from the big online &#34;forges&#34;.But I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any disagreement in the Git development community (and certainly not from me) that Git should be moving towards migrating away from SHA-1."</p>

Instead gpg signs the SHA-1 commit digest directly. It&#39;s not signing the result of a secure hash algorithm.SHA-1 has been considered weak for a long time (about 17 years).  Bruce Schneier warned in February 2005 that SHA-1 needed to be replaced.  Git development didn&#39;t start until April 2005.  Before git started development, SHA-1 was identified as needing deprecation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ya know, it’s funny. I like Python. We like it enough to actually use it in embedded products. It has its limits, and we use other tools where it doesn’t fit. Python in a browser seems like a keen idea.But JavaScript vs Python isn’t really the key thing for me on the web. It’s the uncanny pile of other software one uses to build a man-machine connection that flummoxes me. It’s the CSS, the DOM, the events, the browser API, the ever churning massive pile of complexity that interactive software has become with the voluminous W3C specs, expressed in near BNF form and full of edge cases and backwards compatibility, all so every thing my user does can be observed by myself a few megacorps. I honestly wouldn’t care if I could write it in Fortran. It’s such a minor wart of the whole mess.Caring about which actual language you can use in all the script tags of a jacked up text format feels like caring which font is being used in your favorite hot piece of government legislation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article describes what is possible with Python in a browser, but misses an important detail: how much memory it consumes and how much CPU it uses.Python is not a fast language. For example, consider a simple loop:    for i in range(10):
        pass

In Python, this will be compiled into: a call to range(), heap allocation of an Iterable, calling getIterator() on an Iterable (which might also do allocation), calling next() on an Iterator while catching for StopIteration exception (and calls are often slow in interpreted languages). While in C we could just have a loop without any calls.I remember how I had to use a Dart-based web application (compiled to JS) in one of Google&#39;s advertising products. The script weighed around several megabytes and everything was so slow. Furthermore, there also was a small and useless &#34;what&#39;s new&#34; applet, and it probably was shipped with a separate copy of Dart runtime because it weighed several megabytes too. Obviously this was a product intended to be used only on latest MacBooks, not on a Windows XP laptop.It is totally fine to write such application for youself, or maybe for internal use, but if you are a corporation with millions of users, I think you should pay a little attention to performance and choose a better technology. Or, if you are of a Google scale, find a way to optimize the code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"  &gt; But there is another aspect of the language that makes it so desirable from his standpoint: it can be extended with binary extensions that use an API that is written in C, but can be accessed from other languages. He likens Python to &#34;a Honda Civic with mounting bolts for a warp drive&#34;. So the language can be picked up by kids who can then pop open the trunk &#34;and bolt on warp nacelles&#34; that allows the code to run faster than C or C++ in some cases, Wang said.
  &gt; 
  &gt; That aspect is sometimes overlooked, but it means that Python can be used in ways that other, similar languages cannot. &#34;It&#39;s not just like Node, it&#39;s not just an alternative to Ruby&#34;.

Both node and Ruby have a comprehensive C API, this is a very common language feature since binding to native libraries is unavoidable. Is there actually anything different about python here?https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like Rust and I&#39;d love to see it in the Linux kernel, but not before the GCC+Rust issues are all fixed. You shouldn&#39;t need non-GCC compilers to compile Linux and from what I can tell there isn&#39;t any GCC Rust compiler that&#39;s fully equivalent to the standard Rust compiler just yet.They say that Rust support is optional, but when the first big driver gets written in Rust it&#39;ll become mandatory. So either the Rust integration will fail and nothing important will get written in it, or it won&#39;t be optional. I&#39;m not sure what comfort that&#39;s supposed to bring."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"EDIT: It is very bit unfortunate that my general/off-topic comment is currently the most upvoted. I was not commenting on the Linux integration specifically. I&#39;m a _novice and hobbyist_ when it comes to Rust.For example this comment https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31849071 is much more interesting and on topic.---I want to provoke a little bit, but I&#39;m genuinely curious about the following:I feel like the Rust ecosystem is still quite immature in a lot of areas. Just a few indicators to illustrate what I mean:- Both async/await and the question mark operator feel like rushed implementations, neither seem like the best long term solutions for Rust and are not in line with the otherwise solid foundation of the language.- Open source code examples sometimes use an array of external dependencies that are unrelated to a given project and feel arbitrary. This reminds me of the JS ecosystem.- Some projects pride themselves to not use &#34;unsafe&#34; code, including linking with battle tested C code, which seems like an arbitrary restriction that sounds better than it actually is. There is even an open source maintainer that got mobbed out from his own project because he used &#34;unsafe&#34; in places that others didn&#39;t agree with.- Rust is fashionable. Putting &#34;Rust&#34; next to a HN title immediately gets clicks and upvotes. SO surveys and similar report high interest in the language. This is not an inherently bad thing, quite the opposite. But as a secondary effect it might detract from objective, technical decision making.I really like the language, I have _way_ more good things to say about it than bad things. But am I alone in feeling like this? Other modern language communities come with a philosophy that promotes stability and simplicity. Is the Rust community riding on the merits of Rust&#39;s unique value proposition, while forgetting some important fundamentals?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is my humble opinion, but kernel shouldn&#39;t be a place for language diversity. Even code comments should be standardized for such critical and complex project with so many participants."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have started doing something completely different than using bookmarks. I set up yacy[1] on a personal, internal server at my home, which I can access from all my devices, since they are always on my wireguard vpn.Yacy is actually a distributed search engine, but I run in &#39;Robinson mode&#39; as a private peer, to keep it isolated, as I just want a personal search of only sites I have indexed.Anytime I come across something of interest, I index it with yacy, using a a depth of 0 (since I only want to index that one page, not the whole site). This way, I can just go to my search site, and search for something, and anything related that I&#39;ve indexed before pops up. I found this works way better than trying to manage bookmarks with descriptions and tags.Also, yacy will keep a cache of the content which is great if the site ever goes offline or changes.If I need to browse, I can go use yacy&#39;s admin tools to see all the urls I have indexed.I have been using this for several months and I am using this way more than I ever used my bookmarks.[1] https://yacy.net/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have tried many different solutions the last two decades, but none of of them really stuck or became useful over time. I kinda gave up and as a last ditch effort started to do the simplest thing I could think of: ctrl+D to add bookmarks in Firefox, jotting down a few keywords on each entry. No folders, no structure, just a flat list and some keywords.A few months in I noticed how powerful this simple system was. When talking with someone else about a tool, github-repo or article I had seen but did no remember the name or title of, finding it back was suddenly a breeze. Since I keep my desktop and mobile bookmarks in sync, it it just a matter of typing in a keword in the address bar in firefox and it shows up instantly!On desktop, you can limit the search to bookmarks only by starting with a *, which is helpful to avoid browser history etc.I have really low bar for adding a bookmark now as the mental overhead is so low and it is done notime.

And he’s being proven right at an alarming pace this year.So far this year we’ve had:- A land war in Europe- Food insecurity in the developing world- Breakdown of supply chains and shipping routes- Nation states resorting to seizing each other’s ships (see Greece-Iran issue recently).Everything that he had talked about in the past and in his latest book.The thing about Zeihan’s arguments is that you can’t really argue against demographics. You can procure any resource from any part of the world, but if you want an 18 year old to consume or work or fight, you HAVE to wait 18 years. Or import them from elsewhere - which causes all sorts of cultural and societal conflicts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting to combine this line of thinking with the transition from nation-states to market-states:https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1744057060106386...The power vacuum that&#39;s arisen from populism &amp; isolationism is about to create a gigantic untapped market for firms that provide the services of a state - defense, dispute resolution, and currency - for a fee, to gigantic multinational corporations.  At the same time, there are nascent technologies (drones and robotics for defense, blockchain and the Internet for dispute resolution &amp; currency) that dramatically lower the cost of many of these services, to the point where we may see private companies that are more effective than nation-states at it.  Might we see the nation-state get replaced by a web of competing mercenaries, each of which effectively serves as a protection racket for their customers?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Haven&#39;t read the book, but for those who don&#39;t know who Zeihan is, his work follows two threads of post-WWII history:1. Deglobalization; and2. DepopulationThe article focuses mostly on deglobalization, but depopulation is in the horse pulling the cart.Many are familiar with the deglobalization idea from the last US presidential administration. The current administration kept those tariffs, and abided by the previous commitment to exit Afghanistan. Zeihan argues that this trend toward increasing isolationism goes back decades.What may seem less familiar is the demographic implosion the entire world is undergoing - a baby bust. The vast majority of major countries with the exception of the US and Mexico have passed a point of no return demographically. Their populations will shrink with mathematical certainty. As their populations ebb, so will their economic growth prospects and place on the world stage. The problem is especially pronounced in Asia and Europe, but can be found everywhere.The reason for the bust: people moved to cities. On a farm, kids are free labor. In a city, kids are expensive conversational pieces."</p>

I was shooting video on digital 8, editing in Final Cut Pro 4 which was the new hotness, and trying but failing to use DSS on my college network. Actual streaming at scale required a massive server and a massive license from RealNetworks. If I wanted to do anything with animation, it was all $$$$$ software. This all took place in a shared lab at my college with stuff I could never afford on my own.Today, people at that age are making lucrative careers out of streaming then doing the things they love out of their bedrooms using OBS. Blender has enabled all kinds of amazing creators, from animation to video editing to 3D printing and even (basic) architecture. Kicad makes EDA! approachable.  My teen son has been able to dabble in all of the above in his spare time without spending a dime.I’m in awe of the power of free software and the amazing engineering work that has enabled these projects to be good enough for real professionals to choose first. I hope we see Godot achieve world domination in gaming,  GIMP in graphics, and Libra Office + Collabra in productivity. The people who have given us these tools deserve the highest accolades."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m one of the authors of this. Happy to answer any questions.One of the fun technical details is that, when enabled on a machine (tailscale up --ssh), the userspace tailscaled process takes over all TCP port 22 packets after the WireGuard decryption and doesn&#39;t even feed them into the kernel over TUN. We use gVisor&#39;s netstack to handle the TCP connections in-process.So it doesn&#39;t matter whether you have other processes (or iptables rules, etc) that would prevent the Tailscale SSH server from binding to port 22. This lets people gradually use Tailscale SSH over time without messing with their system one.The Tailscale SSH server currently only runs on Linux but there&#39;s support in git main for macOS too but it&#39;s not super well tested yet and not included in the sandboxed GUI builds currently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been having trouble adopting Tailscale. As so many others say, relying on another identity provider is unfortunate - I, too, worry what happens when Google decides to lock me out because some algorithm decided my account is fishy.The biggest blocker has been the issues with the Android client. I&#39;m either hitting https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues/915 or https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues/4611, but neither issue appears to have a fix coming soon. Whenever I am on my carrier&#39;s network, my phone&#39;s internet stops until I disable Tailscale - that&#39;s just a show stopper from using TailScale.So instead of developing this SSH feature, I would have preferred to seen them work on their bug backlog.In the meantime, I&#39;m experimenting with ZeroTier. While it doesn&#39;t have the ease and cool magicDNS+LetsEncrypt feature, I think I&#39;ll survive with something more reliable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m very interested in Tailscale for both personal and business use-cases, but I&#39;m rather put off by the stark centralization of offered identity providers: Microsoft, Github (Microsoft), Google, okta (?).

Had already read many glowing reviews then, but was not sure if the choice of language (Java) for the first half of the book would be a hindrance (it&#39;s not the stack I am most familiar with).Decided to buy it anyway, primarily because the two implementations of the toy language piqued my interest (most other books only go through one implementation).Boy was I glad I did.Writing is superb, end-of-chapter challenges are instructive, code samples are meticulously and beautifully done. Here and there I also encountered references to other languages (e.g. had a brief detour to Lua internals [1], thanks to a side note), which I have enjoyed too.Went through the first half twice: first using Java as it is written and then secondly implemented the interpreter in Rust (my initial fear turned out to be unfounded).

These books should have CS theory, but still be fundamentally focused on implementation. It&#39;d be really fun to have one of these for a more functional compiler (type checking, code generation, optimization), for a language service (query based compilation, concrete syntax trees, language server protocol), for databases, operating systems, and so on.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My reaction to this is that it&#39;s an effort to keep users within the &#34;walled garden&#34; of Twitter, which is not the best thing for those that write.Recall the story with Medium - yes, you get broader reach with less effort, but at the cost of giving up control of your content.I know that I am talking with an overly developer-focused lens (a-la &#34;you can reimplement Dropbox in a weekend&#34;), but self-hosting blogs outside the &#34;walled gardens&#34; is not super complicated even for non-power users. Ghost has existed for years and is a very user-friendly experience. Want to be a bit more technical - go the static site route.It might be a lost battle to convince the majority of the social media audience of this (after all, can&#39;t beat the convenience and the cost of $0), but I really do not see this as beneficial to those that deeply care about their long-form writing accessibility and sustainability.Twitter already has login walls to just read tweets, so I&#39;d imagine the same is likely to apply to long-form content as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While it&#39;s all well and good to launch new features, I think Twitter should improve their existing service and I&#39;m referring to low hanging fruits.I don&#39;t understand the rationale behind cutting me off while I&#39;m scrolling through Twitter simply because I&#39;m not logged in. Twitter can still display Ads to me irrespective of whether I&#39;m logged in or not. In fact cutting me off means I leave Twitter which means I don&#39;t see the Ads they&#39;re selling which in turn means less Ad money for them.Even when logged in, Twitter will display the new message/note icon. When I click on it to read the notification, it turns out to be Twitter telling me to turn on notifications. Now normally, once you have read the message, the &#39;new&#39; message/note icon is cleared. Instead Twitter displays it again almost immediately and this then goes on for the next few hours before they stop.If they can&#39;t fix these simple things, why would someone want to read longer content on Twitter. They would still get cut off again as Twitter is doing for existing tweets"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I welcome this. I always hated the long multi-tweet essays and have often just given up on reading them, especially when I&#39;m not logged in I can&#39;t even make it to the end before twitter blocks me from scrolling further.As of now it doesn&#39;t look like you can reply to a note with another note? That might go a long way for improving debate and discussion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Important to remember that combustible cigarettes are terrible and e-cigarettes are a slightly less terrible alternative to those. In a world where cigarettes are  so terrible however, e-cigarettes end up saving billions in health care dollars and quality of life.Of all the e-cig players, Juul (which is now majority owned by Altria) is the most reputable one — by far - they have by far the best technology, quality controls, compliance and regulation teams, etc.Unfortunately before Altria acquired Juul it was a terribly ran company. People spend a lot of time discussing the chronic youth issues but the reality is that Juul never wanted to sell to youths or anything of the sort — they were just _so_ incompetent at operations that they couldn&#39;t do anything.They set fire to hundreds of millions of dollars on totally ridiculous projects plainly stupid ideas:* A modular supply chain project with the idea that they could use manufacturing as a carrot for regulatory laws — this team was 50-100 people and had tens of millions of dollars in budget. Never did anything.* All manner of vanity innovation projects: new battery technology, next and next and next generation projects, dozens of flavours, absurd marketing campaigns, rebrands, a $250k custom typeface, the list goes on.* Hired McKinsey and Bain because the executive team (who were all ex-management consultants) wanted the company to move fast ....* My personal favourite Juul story (ok I have a bunch) was that the company was so incompetent they didn&#39;t do headcount planning — You could just hire as many people as you wanted if your random (often incompetent) VP was okay with it. Juul had 50-100 VPs so it was sheer chaos.It got so bad that Altria had to step in and install their own CEO and axe all of the existing executive team (and lay off thousands of random employees) to try and right the ship. Altria are a very legit operational business — you may not like them but they know how to work with the FDA within strict regulation guidelines. If Juul is removed from the market despite Altria taking over they&#39;re truly fucked.In my time at Juul I have never worked with so many incompetent people. 
It was quite impressive but also incredibly depressing as someone that joined because the idea of creating a connected device vaping product to help switch Americans off combustible cigarettes was very compelling."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I managed to give up fags over four years ago after 30 odd years of smoking around 20+ a day.  I&#39;m still quite surprised that I managed it but in retrospect I did a mental job on myself - you have to be hard but in the end it wasn&#39;t quite as bad as I thought it would be.  If I can, you can but you need to find your strategy.Initially I thought that I&#39;d transition to e-fags and climb down from there.  Nope.  You are trading one habit with another - it doesn&#39;t matter if a e-fag cloud is better for you it is still not good and keeps you tethered to smoking.  I think it would be quite easy to go back to tobacco if you &#34;allow&#34; yourself to vape as a transition.I rapidly realised that once I started down the abstinence route I had to be very hard with myself.  It wasn&#39;t actually that bad in the end.  I came up with two mantras that I repeated to myself in my head whenever I really wanted to smoke:  they were - &#34;I don&#39;t want to smell&#34; and &#34;I don&#39;t want to die&#34;.  They are pretty self explanatory.I did and sometimes still have dreams about smoking.  It is a very insidious habit.  I was a smoker for 30 years so it is obviously still a part of my life at age 52 but it is fading and I rarely have to say my mantras these days.I had another strategy too, which helped in the short term:  I started my give up, in the early afternoon of day one (Easter 2018 as it turns out) and had a very long lie in on day two.  That got me to over 24 hours with minimal stress.  I then progressed to a series of time based targets:A day (tick), two days ... a week ... two weeks ... (tried a drag on daughter in law&#39;s fag - no thanks) ... a month ... two months (weird dreams) ... six months ... etc ... four years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The worst thing about this was that openoffice was starting to get some name recognition before oracle killed it, and this whole debacle intentionally or unintentionally turned that name recognition into a weapon against LibreOffice.Ideally they should have given LibreOffice the OpenOffice name, but even if they had just said &#34;openoffice is dead&#34; then it would have been easy for people to find libreoffice.Unfortunately, by taking over the OpenOffice name and absolutely refusing to admit that development has ceased, Apache has caused tons of confusion that has massively harmed libreoffice, because for years people who had heard about &#34;openoffice&#34; would see the terrible, out of date, insecure pile of junk being distributed by the Apache Foundation and not realize that the actively developed LibreOffice was available.In the case of linux distributions it was less of an issue since they just switched to LibreOffice, but I wouldn&#39;t be suprised if there are windows users who are still downloading OpenOffice (and possibly taking one look at it and giving up and switching to Office 365).Apache should have killed OpenOffice years ago but at the very least they should take it down and honestly apologize for fucking this up so badly.Even ignoring the harm to LibreOffice it&#39;s just irresponsible for Apache to keep distributing OpenOffice when they can&#39;t even make new releases to simply apply security patches for years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The mark of a good open source maintainer is the ability to, when your personal interest wanes, find a new maintainer and hand over.I&#39;ve done this several times, and certainly development went on much slower than before, but them&#39;s the breaks. At least I did the right thing.For such a big organization, with so many open source projects under its big wing, Apache has failed on this mark of maintainership completely. It failed so badly that at this stage, deploying Apache-maintained software for a customer or employer is downright irresponsible.Would you organize all your company&#39;s internal communications around Google&#39;s latest messaging thing? That&#39;s insane, you know it&#39;ll bite you in the ass in a few years time when it gets cancelled. Apache is no better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To be honest I never understood why Apache even started in the first place. By that time the LibreOffice fork was well underway."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This stifling of competing ideas, say a growing number of scholars, is a big reason why there is no treatment for Alzheimer’s. (The four approved drugs have no effect on the disease, providing only a temporary memory boost.)Those who championed the amyloid hypothesis truly believed it, and thought that focusing money and attention on it rather than competing ideas was the surest way to an effective drug.Or maybe the real problem is the excess emphasis on finding a drug in specific that can be commercially monetized. A single drug for a single cause of what is likely a complex process.Amyloid and another protein (tau) accumulate in the brain due to sleep deprivation.  Helping people get a good night&#39;s sleep -- without drugs -- would likely help, if only to stave it off in those at risk.The problem is it won&#39;t create any razzle dazzle &#34;unicorn&#34; companies and newly-minted zillionaires.One of the researchers in the article found that herpes simplex infection promotes the accumulation of amyloid. Her research was not irrelevant to the amyloid hypothesis.  It was only irrelevant to an agenda to find a drug to treat amyloid."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FTA, contradicting the headline (emphasis mine):&gt; Despite being described as a “cabal,” the amyloid camp was neither organized nor nefarious. Those who championed the amyloid hypothesis truly believed it, and thought that focusing money and attention on it rather than competing ideas was the surest way to an effective drug.This discrepancy indicates part of the problem: the investigators narrowing the search for causes honestly believe in what they&#39;re doing.The NIH review panelists really believe they&#39;re safeguarding the NIH budget, and the Pharma execs really believe they&#39;re wisely allocating their R&amp;D budget."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is no better way to get shut out as a scientist than to disprove the career-making findings of the important people in your field. One of the side effects of this is the “discussion does not match the results” paper. It’s routine to read papers where the discussion blatantly contradicts the papers own results. What is happening is the authors are disclaiming their own findings in order to get past hostile reviewers, betting that astute readers will notice the contradiction, ignore the discussion and draw their own conclusions from the results."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Docker going strong :-)Unsurprising, really. The usefulness of it cannot be overstated.Doesn&#39;t even matter if its used anywhere in the deployment chain; simply having the ability to pull up a replica of almost any *nix environment on my laptop in mere seconds, using it for tests, and then throwing it away resetting it again in mere seconds is beyond awesome, no matter if what I&#39;m working on then goes into a huge complicated deployment chain, or is shoved onto some on-premises, zero-abstractions, baremetal server.And how is it all configured? Plain text files. How is it controlled? Command Line. Meaning I can script it every way I want, using the tools I already have and use. Doesn&#39;t get in the way, doesn&#39;t demand that I work around it...it works with me and my tools in the same way they already work together.Oh, and of course, good bye and good riddance to the days when I had to install and configure local RDMS for tests. Everything I use has an official image, so I just write some small setup script, a Dockerfile, knit everything together in a docker-compose.yml and presto, done: Application stack is up and running.To me, Docker is as essential as my text editor these days."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been using Copilot for a few months and...Yeah, it makes mistakes, sometimes it shows you i.e. the most common way to do something, even if that way has a bug in it.Yes, sometimes it writes a complete blunder.And yes again, sometimes there are very subtle logical mistakes in the code it proposes.But overall? It&#39;s been *great*! Definitely worth the 10 bucks a month (especially with a developer salary). :insert shut up and take my money gif:It&#39;s excellent for quickly writing slightly repetitive test cases; it&#39;s great as an autocomplete on steroids that completes entire lines + fills in all arguments, instead of just a single identifier; it&#39;s great for quickly writing nice contextual error messages (especially useful for Go developers and the constant errors.Wrap, Copilot is really good at writing meaningful error messages there); and it&#39;s also great for technical documentation, as it&#39;s able to autocomplete markdown (and it does it surprisingly well).Overall, I definitely wouldn&#39;t want to go back to writing code without it. It just takes care of most of the mundane and obvious code for you, so you can take care of the interesting bits. It&#39;s like having the stereotypical &#34;intern&#34; as an associate built-in to your editor.And sometimes, fairly rarely, but it happens, it&#39;s just surprising how good of a suggestion it can make.It&#39;s also ridiculously flexible. When I start writing graphs in ASCII (cause I&#39;m just quickly writing something down in a scratch file) it&#39;ll actually understand what I&#39;m doing and start autocompleting textual nodes in that ASCII graph."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using the beta since last year and I love it. I think most of the people complaining about it either haven&#39;t used it, or are judging it on its most verbose guesses. That&#39;s not what I use it for mostly. For me, it&#39;s just a really, really good autocomplete. It&#39;s best for things with common patterns and APIs. But hey, they&#39;re common so I write them a lot. Boring stuff like creating a Response object, adding the right headers and response code. And look, it&#39;s worked out that I need a case for a 404 next, and has suggested the code for that to, and a 500 in my catch block. Sure, that&#39;s not much typing or cognitive load, but added up over many, many times then it&#39;s easily worth it.And no, I&#39;m not a beginner. I&#39;m a principal with over 20 years experience. I don&#39;t really use it for the Stack Overflow-type stuff, but even as an autocomplete it&#39;s worth the money. As it happens I&#39;m apparently eligible for free access as an open source maintainer, but I&#39;d pay $100/year in a heartbeat for it. I&#39;d pay for Intellisense if that was $100 too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has been the biggest productivity improvement to my workflow in yearsNo it doesn&#39;t &#34;understand what I&#39;m doing&#34; or &#34;get everything right&#34; but that&#39;s hardly the pointIt&#39;s often reducing the amount of labor I&#39;m doing by hitting the keyboard by guessing 90% correctly what I was going to typeIt also often saves me from having to google how to do something, it&#39;s effectively serving me a search result right along my codeI&#39;m lucky to be getting it for free but would have immediately paid $10. It needs to only save you minutes a month for that to be worth itAlso the comments about it being &#34;unfair their monetizing other people&#39;s work&#34; are missing the point.Github has created a product that many people use and through that effort created a large repository of code.They are now releasing a product that is going to create a large amount of of value in time saved and are maybe capturing 2% of that. This is a great outcome for everyone"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We use Cloudflare to serve ~20-30TB of traffic a month where I work. Was the SRE on call when I got paged on our blackbox monitoring/third party web checks failing..It was very pleasant to find the cloudflare status page pointing me to the issue right away (minutes after our alerts triggered), even though I couldn&#39;t replicate the issue myself yet.I wish more companies would take note of the transparency and sense of urgency on updating their status page. (Looking at you Azure)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The default way that most networking devices are managed is crazy in this day and age.Like the post-mortem says, they will put mitigations in place, but this is something every network admin has to implement bespoke after learning the hard way that the default management approach is dangerous.I’ve personally watched admins make routing changes where any error would cut them off from the device they are managing and prevent them from rolling it back — pretty much what happened here.What should be the default on every networking device is a two-stage commit where the second stage requires a new TCP connection.Many devices still rely on “not saving” the configuration, with a power cycle as the rollback to the previous saved state. This is a great way to turn a small outage into a big one.This style of device management may have been okay for small office routers where you can just walk into the “server closet” to flip the switch. It was okay in the era when device firmware was measured in kilobytes and boot times in single digit seconds.Globally distributed backbone routers are an entirely different scenario but the manufacturers use the same outdated management concepts!(I have seen some small improvements in this space, such as devices now keeping a history of config files by default instead of a single current-state file only.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of our sites uses Cloudflare and serves 400k pageviews per month and generates around $650/day in ad and affiliate revenue. If the site is not up the business is not making any money.Looking at the hourly chart in Google Analytics (compared to the previous day) there isn&#39;t even a blip during this outage.So for all the advantages we get from Cloudflare (caching, WAF, security [our WP admin is secured with Cloudflare Teams], redirects, page rules, etc) I&#39;ll take these minor outages that make HN go apeshit.Of course it helped that most our traffic is from the US and this happened when it did but in the past week alone we served over 180 countries which Cloudflare helps make sure is nice and fast :D"</p>

It&#39;s weird to say, but my wife kind of accepted that I&#39;d work on weekends between 1-3 pm when the kids sleep. What helped me get out of this &#34;solo-time-drain-thing&#34; was to find the right Co-Founders to help me. I&#39;ve found a really nice guy to help me with Marketing, and another one who helped me develop the Product. &#34;If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, find a team.&#34; I hope you can find some way of financing so that you can push through this wall. For me, it was working a full time job and building WunderGraph at night and on the weekends, but it&#39;s making you age quickly. I wish you the best for your future."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the post:&gt; For example, it is integrated with GitHub in such a way that on every push it will provision a new server running specifically that code, deployed to the edge, worldwide, and persisted permanently. Want to access the code your app was running a month ago at commit f7c5e19? It will be served up instantly at a moment&#39;s notice. It costs you nothing to have that bit of JavaScript responding to requests indefinitely.These things sound great and almost a dream come true but how realistic is it to consider being able to do this in most web apps? As soon as your application uses a SQL database and you have database migrations then you&#39;re out of luck because a commit from 2 months ago might expect a different database schema than the current version and while it&#39;s common to migrate in backwards compatible ways, the backwards compatibility is usually only temporary until you finish migrating from A to B.Long story short, this sounds cool but in practice is really only applicable to static sites or dynamic sites where you plan to keep a version of your database and code base backwards compatible from day 1 to current day (which I&#39;ve never seen done in any app developed over the last ~20 years of freelancing for many different companies). The post mentions &#34;The open source Deno runtime shows how clean and productive a modern, batteries-included, programming environment can be&#34; so it sounds like they expect you&#39;ll be running database backed apps and not only static sites."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting how this will play out. It&#39;s an ambitious goal to consolidate client side and server side javascript ecosystems which is quite fragmented today. On the other hand, this may only increase fragmentation further by introducing another target to develop for (wait for transpilers that can automagically convert between deno and node code). I will always look at javascript as this problem kid that cannot get its shit together in life, perpetually chasing the romance of utopia."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Deno overstates the problem it is intended to solve because its founders needed to justify achieving funding by being developer-famous.Let&#39;s say a company were to adopt this tech over Node, well, it seems like it would be slightly better, but probably not much of a game-changer.I&#39;ll leave it to y&#39;all to talk about what tech is truly interesting as I don&#39;t want to seem ideological/biased, I just don&#39;t see how Deno is particularly notable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seems like the least of the negative impacts nextdoor encourages.i removed myself after months of watching people on this app become more and more paranoid, feeding off each other.the breaking point was when someonea put out a warning that someone had knocked on their door at 7:00pm, “the wife and i were eating dinner when the rude knock came. we crept over to the window, peeked out, and didn’t recognize the person. be careful!”the person knocking turned out to be a 16 year old girl who lives three blocks away who unfortunately got a flat tire and was hoping to borrow a phone to call her dad.we live in an incredibly safe wealthy suburb and these people “crept” to a window like they’re in an old west shootout and decided to put out a warning on nextdoor about a little sixteen year old girl.we still laugh just thinking how crazy these people must have looked while creeping from their kitchen to peek out a window in one of the safest areas in the state at a time of day when people are still out mowing their lawns.nextdoor somehow just adds to these people’s already insane creeping paranoia."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"NextDoor: home of the dumbest people on the Internet. They must be proud of that.There are occasionally things I want to see on there: a new Costco going in where the OSH Hardware used to be, or whatnot. So I got the daily email digest. One email per day -- tolerable.Then it stopped coming. I wrote to Support, and their guy swore it was still being sent! I said &#34;no, it&#39;s not. I looked in Spam and Trash.&#34; He swore again that it was going out, and I should &#34;check with my email provider.&#34;I asked &#34;How do you know they&#39;re going out? Did you look in the Sent folder?&#34; He got all sniffy and said &#34;We are unable to disclose anything about our internal operations.&#34; Ooh, big secret!So I wrote to the Nextdoor handle on Twitter. They told me there was an experiment going on. I asked if they could take me out of it. They did and all was good again.Except other people on Nextdoor were also unhappy about being in the experiment, and asked me how I got out of it. I told them; they tried it; Nextdoor now refused to do it for them.Think about it -- almost every site on the Web is trying to get you to sign up for a daily email. Nextdoor already has one, and they&#39;re trying to take it away."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nextdoor wins my prize for the scummiest human manipulation to increase user signups I&#39;ve witnessed.I live in the UK in a cul-de-sac with about 25 houses in the street. We&#39;ve lived here about 4 years and have a dog so we have bumped in to all the neighbours and know all of them by name at least.I get a note through my door from NextDoor claiming to be from a neighbour in my street with a name that we did not recognise. Apparently this neighbour had signed up for NextDoor to keep our street safe and exchange important information yada yada yada...Needless to say it&#39;s total horse shit - none of us are using their scummy platform and have absolutely no desire to.So they&#39;re preying on people&#39;s fears, and hoping that some kind of FOMO plus the fear of being stabbed in your sleep if you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on in your street will get people on to their platform."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"HDMI offers so many protocols I didn’t know of.Before finding a way to use DDC on Apple Silicon [1] for Lunar (https://lunar.fyi), I contemplated creating a universal DDC/CI device that can change brightness, contrast, volume, input and colors of a monitor, by either receiving commands through HTTP, or acting as an Adaptive Brightness standalone device.In my mind, it would have been an HDMI dongle with an ESP32 that gets power through the 5V line of the HDMI port, and which has an ambient light sensor to adapt brightness by itself.In the end, I found the I2C APIs on M1 so this was not so sorely needed anymore, but given the limitations of the M1 Display Coprocessor, I still think it might be a good idea. I just have no idea where would I start with hardware distribution and mass production, this domain seems so intangible from the software development side.[1] https://alinpanaitiu.com/blog/journey-to-ddc-on-m1-macs/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; For example, let&#39;s imagine you invite an external guest for a presentation inside your company. You offer to connect to a video-projector so he can show his slides. This is the perfect opportunity for the guest to hack the video-projector. Next time an employee connects to this projector, his laptop is hacked back.Is there a single proof of concept of this out there? This seems wildly theoretical to me.Seems like you have to know:* the projector/TV model/firmware* the employee laptop and firmware* a bug in the projector/TV that would let you insert arbitrary data in a way that will stay around and be sent to other devices that connect to HDMI* a bug in the laptop that would let you install something malicious with the data could get the projector to send* your hack wont be detected by software on the laptop or the IDS/whatever on their networkThat’s pretty heavy lifting. I mean is any of that reasonable outside of nation-state level attacks?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The main thing I&#39;d be interested in blocking is Ethernet:* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI_Ethernet_ChannelWith televisions having all sorts of questionable software installed that wants to phone home, it&#39;s probably best not to connect them directly, but rather stream things to the display from either your mobile device or a box (e.g., Apple TV).Of course if you accidentally do connect it online via a box that does have Internet access, who knows what kind of Lovecraftian horrors will be enabled on the television."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I do a considerable amount of long term travel carrying about half of this, but it all depends on what you&#39;re trying to optimize for. My personal design goal is that my bag fits under airline seats, so I never have to worry about gate checking a bag and risking lost luggage.  The main tradeoff is that I do a lot of laundry in sinks - you really learn the effectiveness of detergent when you see the color of the water coming off some clothes you thought were pretty clean.  These days I&#39;m a bit lazier and try to end up somewhere with a washing machine every week or two to break up the hand washing chore.  I&#39;ve done the towel wringing trick but it&#39;s not all that necessary with my clothes unless I&#39;m in a damp environment and am short on time.The two things that I mostly agree with - eSIM is a massive improvement (I also use Airalo), and I&#39;ve also tried to standardize on USB-C (except for my headphones, where I haven&#39;t found a good replacement).  /r/onebag does have some good product recommendations but is somewhat skewed to young backpackers.I would encourage everyone to ignore anyone telling them they&#39;re &#34;doing it wrong&#34; when traveling. You know yourself, make your own decisions. Personally, making an effort to meet digital nomads all around the world sounds like hell on earth to me. Also, it&#39;s wasted effort. Trust me, they&#39;ll find you and tell you all about themselves."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is interesting because I tend to think of packing as a dirtbag thing rather than a nomad thing... when I&#39;m hotel hopping for extended periods I just bring normal luggage. Maybe I should start bringing my backpack instead.My first impression is that this is a LOT of clothes and the electric stuff is a bit weird.A few differences between dirtbag and nomad (the latter AFAICT is mostly hotel/airbnb hopping?):First, you think a lot about food and water. Especially water, and especially sans car. It&#39;s VERY heavy and very necessary.Second, my emergency pack is almost completely different. No vitamin shoppe merch. An ACE bandage, 8 aspirin per day from civ, 1 dose of imodium per day from civ, gauze, anti-bacterial cream, tape, suture kit, and one dose of a more powerful pain killer for serious emergencies if you can get it. No rapid tests (travel usually required a PCR anyways), but a couple KN95s. Cash in both USD (clean, unfolded, new bills) and the local currency. Maps.Third, weight really matters.Fourth, cleanliness really matters. You&#39;re essentially homeless. Diners and cafes kick out homeless people if you try to stay 9-5. In addition to organizing my life around being clean, I also had a whole separate emergency &#34;Not A Dirtbag For A Day&#34; kit.I guess the other big difference is that all of my day-to-day stuff fit in roughly 15L so that I could carry 5L water and my gear could consume the other 20L."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve spend months at a time, e.g. Sicilian island hopping, with less than this. For me the critical issue, which drives all clothing choices, is being able to independently do laundry. That is easier in frequent small batches; I can&#39;t imagine traveling with eight T-shirts!After washing clothes, layer them in a large wringable synthetic pack towel, roll, and twist. Then they can be hung without dripping, and will dry in a fraction of the time. Wring out the towel and repeat. Or, if one has just arrived at a hotel with towels for four, get busy before they clear three of them in the morning.One needs an ample supply of travel-scaled clothesline and clothespin equivalents. I last traveled with tiny Nite Ize Gear Ties, and a few larger ties with loops for securing the clothesline ends. Be thoughtful about attachment points; foreign construction quality can often be surprising.I can&#39;t praise highly enough merino wool T-shirts, even in the hottest weather. I found mine on closeout; they can be expensive.The Aranet4 CO2 meter is an interesting pandemic choice. I own one for monitoring my classroom assignments; they&#39;re very well made."</p>

					<h3><a href="https://dynomight.net/ikea-purifier/">Contra Wirecutter on the IKEA air purifier</a></h3>
				</div>
				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31812259">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Wirecutter is a highly flawed review site, but at least it&#39;s a real one. There are vanishingly few left for general consumer products. There&#39;s WC, Consumer Reports, and what else? They&#39;ve seem to have all been killed off. When I&#39;m researching some category of product, I feel lucky if I find any professional reviews written by people who have actually touched the thing they&#39;re reviewing. I know we&#39;ve all had the experience googling &#34;reviews of X&#34; only to get overwhelmed with SEO spam. Forget finding something written by somebody who has experience with it. It&#39;s hard enough to find something written by a human."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article actually makes a bunch of claims itself that are false. For example, it claims that the Wirecutter believes air filters work like sieves. Whereas the Wirecutter review page for air purifiers goes into how they do not behave like sieves and also references a NASA study that shows how HEPA filters are good at capturing both particles smaller and larger than the 0.3 micron test standard.It’s pretty obvious that the Wirecutter has used HEPA standard filters as a filter for whittling down the many air purifiers that exist in the world. They eliminated the IKEA filters because they do not meet HEPA standards (this blog’s focus on he true-HEPA marketing term is misguided, because the authors own referenced wiki link shows that E12 is not considered HEPA). However, they also reached out to IKEA about this, and the IKEA spokesperson told them their focus is on PM2.5.They don’t recommend the IKEA filter based not on its inability to capturer finer particles, but because it’s not AS efficient as capturing finer particles as HEPA filters, AND because of its lower CADR.It doesn’t meet the standards they set, so they don’t include it for price comparisons.Maybe they haven’t set the right standards. Maybe they should have allowed for lower CADRs or for filters that meet lower filtration standards than HEPA.However, the insinuation this article makes that they don’t seem to understand what they’re talking about is completely wrong.Maybe this author should try reviewing over 20-30+ different air purifiers at a minimum without setting arbitrary thresholds up front and then get back to the Wirecutter folks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wirecutter is like Leetcode interviews.The goal is not to find the &#39;best&#39; option, but minimize false positives under intense time-pressure. Their recommendation is usually the 8/10 solid option that you can blindly buy and be moderately satisfied with. In the process, they drop out or misrepresent other comparable options, but their final recommendation is never shoddy.This is in stark contrast to other reviewers like IGN who give 10/10 to every new cash-cow game, and The-Verge that tows the &#39;mainstream&#39; line to play it safe. Additionally, Wirecutter&#39;s guides are up-to-date and cover every imaginable category. Are rtings, Anandtech, LTT, Crinacle, notebookcheck, gsmarena, etc. better ? Yes, a 100%. But each of them cover a small niche and particularly leave out appliances of all types.I agree with Dynomight on Wirecutter being mediocre. But, consistent mediocrity is incredibly hard to execute at at scale.I would never use wirecutter unless I absolutely had to. But, often, I absolutely have to. Because no one else remotely trustable is going around reviewing humidifiers and vacuum cleaners."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel like hating on Jira is the pastime that is now passed down from each generation of programmers to the next.I&#39;m going to stick up for Jira. I certainly don&#39;t &#34;love&#34; Jira, though I do think they&#39;ve made significant improvements with &#34;new Jira&#34; (I think they call them team-managed projects now).The problem I have with the incessant Jira bitching is that I rarely feel that bitchers have a true understanding for the extreme difficulty of the organization-wide problem Jira is trying to solve. It&#39;s always taken on from the position of &#34;well, it didn&#39;t make my specific use case easy&#34;, but never with an appreciation with some of the complexity that Jira needs to solve for other users at your company, never mind other companies.Obviously some of the complaints (speed, stability) are very valid, but here&#39;s a question I think is just as valid: why don&#39;t you think some other company has come along and toppled the Jira crown? Certainly tons of them have tried, and while many have their supporters, they are almost equally likely to have their detractors.The fact is, building a generic project management and tracking tool is a really difficult, hard problem. In my old age as a programmer I feel like Jira is kind of like our form of government: &#34;Jira is the worst project management tool, except for all the others&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"OK, so what don&#39;t I like about Jira?1. It&#39;s extremely slow.2. It&#39;s difficult to predict the effect of making any kind of change.3. The permissions system is so convoluted, I can be the admin of a board, and yet not have permission to see a ticket on it.4. It relegates the conversation to a second-class UI element, when this is the most important part of any project management system.5. Trying to operate on a bunch of tickets all at the same time (e.g. move all tickets in this status into some other status) requires a lot of time.6. Every Jira setup is so different, trying to compare a piece of work from one area of the organisation to a similar piece of work elsewhere is useless.7. The UI is extremely buggy. I can add a mandatory field to a ticket, then when I try to use a shortcut to create a new ticket, it won&#39;t work because I can&#39;t fill out that mandatory field.8. There are random side-effects when one person does something on one bit of the system, and VOILA everybody&#39;s workflow is broken, with no obvious warning that would happen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish the comments were more specific about which features they don’t like.For me a particularly frustrating aspect is the way the UI moves around a lot. I’m quite anxious to click anything until all the loading spinners have stopped in case I click the wrong thing. Then I could be taken to a page or feature I’ve never seen before.Also it’s really annoying when I try to copy something from a ticket description but it starts editing the whole description field.EDIT - I&#39;d also like to add that as a developer, once I finish my ticket I assign it to a QA. Then I can never get back to the ticket. I&#39;d like a really easy way to see all of the tickets I&#39;ve ever completed. But completed tickets aren&#39;t assigned to me, they&#39;re assigned to QA."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31808093">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One big advantage not mentioned in the article particularly relevant to this audience:  git diffs (or your VCS of choice).  One sentence per line means diffs will operate per-sentence, rather than per-paragraph.  This way the diff can capture the restructuring of the paragraph (adding/removing/replacing a sentence), which gives much more insight than swapping out the paragraph wholesale.  It also means minor changes (e.g. typo fixes) will only add+delete a single sentence, making it much easier to identify what has actually changed from one commit to the next.I take this a step further and will often split out a single sentence into a clause per line, but this is a judgement call rather than a hard and fast rule."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I personally use this approach but mostly because a lot of what I write ends up in a git repository and diffs make way more sense when there is only one sentence per line. I also find things much easier to manipulate in vim when sentences don&#39;t span lines."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember struggling to write essays when I was in highschool. Well, I was fine, but my teachers insisted it was long-winded gibberish. Concerned, my grand’mother told me: “Ask Sonia” I knew she was her friend, and they liked to argue a lot, but I was a bit confused by the advice.It turns out, editing was Sonia’s job: she was the head reader at a very prestigious publishing house, meaning she was giving notes and feedback to very famous authors, including four Nobel Prize laureates. You kind of have to know what you are doing when you are sending a manuscript full of red in the margins and the person can respond “I’ve got a Nobel Prize and you don’t.” She definitely had the icey stare to match.Oddly, her advice was incredibly simple, and fitted in two very short pieces:* Subject, Verb, Complement –– in that order. If you see two verbs, but a period between them.* Things are confusing if you don’t put them in order: start by the beginning, find the widest piece of context that explain the rest.I don’t apply her rules every time, but for every technical document, every time I’ve tried, it’s been night and day.That typographic argument is really resonating with me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"First of all, I really like the concept of grid based flow charting. It&#39;s one of the popular metaphors used in &#34;wiring&#34; software based musical instruments and effects and works really well for a significant percentage of signal flows that don&#39;t have too many back looping or crossing virtual wires.However, would it be possible to make the flow go vertically rather than horizontally?I find that a vertical direction of flow is- more practical because of the ubiquity of mouse wheels for easy up/down navigation compared to the various less common ways of navigating horizontally- the much more common direction for sequential steps in programs or scripts- more culturally global, since there are quite a few right to left languages (as in addition to the left to right language used on this site :-)- distance between boxes is easier to keep constant vertically while still allowing different size boxes (due to longer or shorter labels)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey all, author here. Graphs are used for tons of purposes across a lot of disciplines, but we don&#39;t have a fast general-purpose graph editor. That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do with knotend [0]. It&#39;s a keyboard-driven directed graph editor. I made it for myself for planning project dependencies. It&#39;s also a great tree editor.I actually posted a very early version as a Show HN [1] which you can see was mostly met with question marks, and rightfully so. It was literally a grid, with the gridlines rendered, and had very cryptic keyboard shortcuts. I&#39;ve spent the last year just working on the UX, to make an intuitive and fast editing experience.I&#39;d love more feedback especially about any UX issues. It&#39;s free to use the purely client side version, and you can join the waitlist [2] if you want a user account to persist graphs to the backend (I&#39;m slowly onboarding people).- [0] https://www.knotend.com- [1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27256861- [2] https://www.knotend.com/waitlist"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; After dragging around boxes for a few minutes you need to take a break and ice your wrists. It&#39;s just too slow, there&#39;s too many micro-interactions, and it distracts you from what matters most: defining your dependencies.This is an interesting claim. I&#39;ve programmed LabVIEW professionally and didn&#39;t have to take breaks every few minutes. And neither do PC gamers.What about PlantUML and other text-based diagramming solutions? How do those compare here?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are many such memorial plaques on the pavements of Vienna. They are almost part of the landscape, easy to walk by without noticing, yet every so often, when one stops rushing and reads a few of these (it was often whole families being deported, not just individuals), it hits again. And it is important that it never stops hitting and reminding us of this horror and of the need of avoiding repeating it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Think few people realize how bad the Apple situation is. If your company just ships like an iOS app and an Android app maybe you don&#39;t really notice or maybe don&#39;t care.But work at a company where you try to build something like new hardware devices or systems without having to resort to building either an iOS app or handing over 30% to Apple and the situation becomes very worrying to dire. Simple things suddenly become impossible or have workarounds piled on top to get their browser to function in the ways their desktop one does or Android&#39;s browser does.You can feel some of their engineering choices are actively hostile against anyone trying to exist outside the App Store ecosystem. Sure I know some advocates push this as a good thing but I think they&#39;ll disagree when the endgame plays out.Because in 10 years, what currently exists as the only option on iPad and iPhone will be the only option on MacBooks too. There is a reason why the last WWDC was all about making the iPad feel more like MacOS and making parts of MacOS feel like iPadOS.I used to be a huge Apple advocate but I&#39;m really worried with where they&#39;re heading as I&#39;m trying to create new technology and Apple causes so much pain when you try to make anything other than an iOS app.I do love my M1 MBP, have a lot less love for my iPhone these days but I&#39;m worried where the tide is moving. It&#39;s all absolutely fine, until it isn&#39;t and then the problem is it&#39;s completely locked down from the touch screen to the silicon..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a good article in many respects, but its logic unwittingly falls down when they try to have it both ways, advocating for an outcome that is functionally impossible. From the article—&#34;It’s great when Apple chooses to defend your privacy. Indeed, you should demand nothing less. But if Apple chooses not to defend your privacy, you should have the right to override the company’s choice. Facebook spied on iOS users for more than a decade before App Tracking Transparency, after all.&#34;The important thing to appreciate is that App Tracking Transparency isn&#39;t something Apple can enforce with code. It&#39;s not an API or operating system feature which shields users against tracking. Enforcement is purely the threat of retribution by Apple, made legal by the terms of the agreement which all developers sign. Apple&#39;s monopoly on iOS app distribution means that a wilful breach of Apple&#39;s privacy policies is a dangerous path for any developer to take.I cannot see any plausible scenario where an Apple made impotent through legislation could possibly result in a net gain of privacy control for consumers. And even if there is a better way, how about we get that working BEFORE tearing down the current imperfect system?That paragraph is a layer cake of wishful thinking. How does the EFF propose to enforce a consumer right to override Apple&#39;s choices over privacy within iOS? This kind of rhetoric is unhelpful, eliding reality on so many levels. The notion of consumers self-policing their own privacy is a nice sentiment, but as an idea that must be implemented in reality... rather optimistic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s worth mentioning the case of tumblr - a giant social media company that was literally worth hundreds of millions of dollars. People remember the whole &#34;wow, tumblr was so stupid for banning porn&#34; but forget that the reason they did so was because Apple threatened to remove all of their users from tumblr if they didn&#39;t. Apple gave tumblr unreasonable &#34;safety standards&#34; that almost single-handedly killed a gigantic site for the vast majority of users.Apple should not have this type of power. Maybe they used it for good with Facebook, but I wouldn&#39;t count on it always being the case. Apple can kill entire social media platforms if they want to. IMO, it&#39;s a matter of time before they start charging an &#34;adult tax&#34; (that just so happens to be barely below the profits a company makes from adult content via Apple users). Maybe the only thing preventing them from doing so is regulatory pressure."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This might be the most interesting and important point:&#34;The thing is, this banning/terminating/deleting troll crap has been going on since I first got my modem in 1986. I’ve been on every popular web platform, every one — and I’ve been “un-platformed” each time, because of specious complaints. The emerging media companies court early adopters, and then they can’t get rid of us fast enough.&#34;She participated in the famous WELL, back in the 1980s. It is interesting how long this particular struggle, over moderation policies, has been going on.She makes a good point that each of these companies has followed a similar pattern of first courting the kinds of radical experimenters who blaze new trails, and then later kicking them off platforms because they are not respectable:&#34;This has been going on for decades now. It isn’t just Google, it’s all the majors: Apple, Amazon, FB, Twitter, Microsoft, AOL, on and on. I could name a dozen others who’ve disappeared in the social media mist. It’s cruel that each of them censor the very people who created their original incubators. Did you know that On Our Backs was the first magazine, of any kind, to publish with an early Apple computer and Adobe Pagemaker 1.0? Yes, we were. I was on The WELL in the 80s. Our idealism and commitment was ferocious!&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks like the account got restored. Seemingly, nothing got erased, the account was just temporarily unavailable.&gt; Needless to say, the OOB lecturers were fully clothed and rather obsessed with our historical narrative. Anyone not interested in feminist politics would have probably fallen asleep.The lecturers perhaps, but the streamed lecture contains full-screen examples from pornographic magazines that obviously should be flagged for verification by any porn detecting algorithm.Youtube does state that explicit materials are allowed for educational content, but if their copyright machines can&#39;t even distinguish white noise from copyrighted music then I have very little hope that context like &#34;educational discussion&#34; will ever be recognised automatically.As a society, we may need a platform where educational/government institutions can upload content (with content warnings, if necessary) because Youtube is a terrible fit for content like this. Youtube&#39;s scope is too large to be managed by humans who can understand context and their advertiser seeking behaviour provides an incentive to &#34;punish&#34; videos containing even allowed nudity in their self-learning algorithms. Requiring every institution to set up their own video hosting infrastructure is unnecessary and even wasteful of public funds."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The First Amendment, or anything close to it, is MIA on the Web.... she declared, uncensored, from her self-hosted journal.A multinational Fortune-500 megacorp declined to host Cornell&#39;s content for free because they have standards the content violates. Cornell has more than enough cash in the ol&#39; war chest to spin up their own video hosting. This is almost a non-story because it&#39;s either telling us something we already know about how corporations treat potentially-embarrassing-to-them content or how society treats the content Susie Bright creates.ETA: In addition, YouTube does not appear to have decided not to host the content after all (it was likely found initially objectionable because they can code a recognizer for &#34;objectionable&#34; more accurately than a recognizer for &#34;educational value&#34;). This doesn&#39;t change the fact that YouTube is within their rights to choose not to associate with Cornell as a business arrangement, but it perhaps matters that here, they didn&#39;t even make that choice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Orkut was nothing like current social networks. It didn&#39;t have any kind of feed. You had to manually visit user pages if you were looking for something. Also, user pages had no &#34;blog space&#34; for posts, just main description, &#34;testimonials&#34; (for friends describing you) and scrapbook (like a public email inbox, later turned optionally private). Oh, and a photo gallery.Another thing that was massive in orkut - but still niche as most users didn&#39;t use this feature - was community forums. It was great to be able to read and talk about any topic using the same account, in the same website and the same layout. Worldwide, what filled this gap was obviously Reddit, but it&#39;s still English-only for most subjects. Also the format is different, Reddit is not a typical flat internet forum."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish him the best on this endeavor. We&#39;ve bought, rebuilt, redesigned Fotolog in 2017 and we failed to lift the social network, even with 50M users. The only solution I saw to this problem, isn&#39;t technology but convincing people to come back or use this social network over others.I have learned that social networks obeys to generations more than to features. People only switch when a new generation operates on the social network. So, in order to make Orkut succesful, the founder will have to work hard to convince the new generation (those who know have 15yo onwards up to 24yo) to use the platform and gain ownership."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Orkut was big in India too. But far from fake profiles or hate groups, brigading groups etc. The reason it got so big was the users were from populous countries. 
Also, one main reason for its success I believe was that we did not have mobile phones or landline phones and we had lost touch with our friends and it was a platform to reconnect. There was no number portability. If you had lost the landline number of your friends or if they had moved to different regions, the number would have changed. With Orkut groups it was easy to find and message and connect. But later with Facebook and LinkedIn, most of them got on there. 
I cannot comment on what the new platform will do to keep on a mission that it did not fulfil earlier.Shameless Plug: I am working on a social platform with a similar mission and might do a Show HN in the coming months :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ah this article put the finger on why I don&#39;t trust my &#39;new dentist&#39;:The operation is just too slick from a business POV. As someone familiar with SaaS or in general this kind of recurring business model, you can sense all the little operational policies and procedures designed to increase your LTV.It&#39;s a well-oiled machine. Without fail, the hygienist recommends cleaning not once every 12 months or even every 6 months, but every 3 months. When pressed on why, eventually they&#39;ll admit it&#39;s how nice it feels to have clean teeth and how important your smile is - but NOT strictly necessary for health.This particular dentist also will shut down and take their entire staff to a resort for a week every winter if the team &#34;hit their targets&#34; for the prior year. That&#39;s the literal phrase they used to explain the trip. When I asked what those targets were, the person turned bright red.So dentistry has a trifecta of factors that will encourage dark-patterns: (1) a true health-related reason for going both preventatively and to deal with problems; (2) a cosmetic / vanity-related reason (white teeth), and (3) the air of higher-educated medical authority.Wrap that all in a lucrative recurring business model and of course it&#39;s going to lead to people taking advantage or at least overpaying for what they really need.Just writing all this out made me realize I shouldn&#39;t be going to my current dentist! Thanks OP. :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Throwaway because I run a large dental software company.Dentistry is practiced as a business focused on maximizing revenue. Dentists are routinely coached to deploy sales tactics to increase their treatment acceptance beyond what is needed. If you walk into a dental office, you need to protect yourself from being abused. A second opinion unfortunately puts you in the same position, but now with a new dentist who will play into the narrative of only needing to monitor your condition for a while.The business of dentistry is unfortunately antithetical to conservative treatment, which is almost always in the interest of the patient, because it results in significantly lower patient lifetime value."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a truth about corporate dentistry, and it common in family practices but less so.I used to know a few dentists. One was a conservative, family dentist with a small home office in a small home (and a mountain of savings). He had a good rep bc he earned it. The other two had a bit more extravagant lives, and they earned it through specialization (and in my opinion, probably a little bit of this article).What consumers should be most concerned about is the end of family practices, and the start of corporate 1800-DENTIST/Supercuts for dentists. Issues like this article are the norm, and instead of a local dentist to seek resolution with, you’re doing the equivalent of filing a Jira ticket with a faceless insurance conglomerate.This is the trend the industry is going bc of the costs and difficulty of owning a practice. If you can, I recommend finding a young dentist who has recently bought into a home office partnership, and stick with them until corporate dentistry takes over. It is the only way to consistently avoid situations like this article."</p>
