								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is one of those medical revolutions that I am waiting dearly for.Facilities that are not hospitals(to avoid the risk of  occupying medical devices that sick people need) built to _regulary_ check up otherwise healthy people for preventive care.Heck, I have so many alerts defined on my monitoring setup for servers to watch for signals of failure before they get too big. But, my own body is not observed until something bad needs treatment. Why can’t we observe ourselves medically and analyze that record for early signs of trouble before it becomes serious?!All the advancement in technology in recent years, this ought to happen sooner than later."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"0.5% false positive rate is actually quite high. I don&#39;t have the numbers, but I&#39;d be surprised if more than 1% of the people that would receive such a screening actually already have cancer, which would mean that it produces about as many false positives as false negatives.Picture a population of a million people, all receiving the test. 1% of them have cancer (unknown to them) - half of those people get a negative screening result and half get a positive one (51% successful identification), and 0.5% of the full population get a negative screening result. Those numbers are roughly equal.That doesn&#39;t make it useless by any means, but it&#39;s not nearly as &#39;specific&#39; as it sounds on paper."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those interested in reading the actual paper, this appears to be it (open access too):https://www.annalsofoncology.org/article/S0923-7534(21)02046...I’ve only skimmed it, but seen quite a few limitations, notably those with “non-malignant conditions at enrolment” (it would be nice to know more what that means), previous cancer or recent corticosteroids use were excluded. Additionally, it’s a case controlled trial which don’t always translate to screening tools (as mentioned in their own discussion).The problem with screening is that you are doing something on healthy patients, so particularly for rare cancers even a small risk of a false positive is significant. In this case it’s 99.5%. So if you test 1,000,000 people, 5000 (*correction from 500) people will come up positive. This is great for common diseases, but if it’s rare and only 1 in a million has it then you have got 5000 false positive for every 1 positive.I think this will likely be a useful test (if it translates well to a wider screening population), but it’s not as good as it first seems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Many years ago I added the feature to xbox.com to allow you to easily cancel your Xbox Live Gold subscription. We built a UX that was ideal for consumers - a couple of clicks, no &#34;Here&#39;s what you&#39;ll be missing...&#34; screens. It was awesome.Before this feature was released you had to call Xbox support to cancel.Once word spread that you could do it on the web, huge numbers of customers, that had been stuck paying for an Xbox Live Gold subscription they weren&#39;t using, began cancelling.So our PM got a call from a VP. We were instructed to remove it from the site immediately. We fantasized about telling the VP to stick it and quitting en masse, but we knew it wouldn&#39;t change anything. We&#39;d just be replaced by someone that would.So we complied, but we all lost a little bit of our faith in Xbox that day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related PSA: many customer support chat integrations on websites today give the rep a real-time view of all input changes before you actually send anything.Think twice before pasting unknown clipboard contents, typing while angry, etc. Best, explicitly copy your finalized reply from another app and paste it into the chat.(I confirmed that first hand when a support person replied to specifics of my message while I was editing the phrasing.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was doing my taxes on taxact a year or two ago, when I noticed a small lag every time I switched fields.  Every time I went to the next field, a network request was being made to some third party analytics thing with the data I entered.Somewhere, in the back of my mind I know that all data I enter online is inevitably being hovered up and used for god knows what, but when you&#39;re suddenly made aware of it, it&#39;s really unnerving.Something about this makes me want to have a &#39;falling down&#39; moment.  Let me get this straight, not only is our tax system so complex and error prone i have to pay money to a third party to figure out how much I should be paying to our government, but the software company I pay then turns around and sells my data?  The government does nothing to remedy this?  It really goes to show who our government serves, and it sure as hell isn&#39;t &#39;the people&#39;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have worked in team with some kernel developers at Samsung, years ago, so let me put some perspective for those who do not understand the dynamics.In some companies, the amount of patents or Linux kernel patches you get accepted is direct measure of your success.As you know, whatever you measure becomes a target -- these guys feel very pressed to get ANY kernel commits accepted, no matter how small, irrelevant or nonsensical. Because in the very end almost nobody sees the amount of value that a company creates for Linux users. What everybody is looking at is that &#34;Company X is nth on the list of biggest kernel contributors&#34;.So &#34;KPI grabbing&#34; is meant to mean the practice of not caring for the value or quality of your contributions but rather for the count of the commits or LoC you can get accepted.This is damaging to Linux kernel developer community because it just creates work for maintainers without creating much or any value at all.These maintainers are absolutely critical resource for the project and their number and availability translates directly to how much stuff can actually be done. So no wonder people are irked by it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The year is 2050 and your dingy old toaster has finally given up it&#39;s last crumbs. You hop onto Amazon in hopes of finding a suitable replacement as there&#39;s no longer any box stores you can travel to. Dumb appliances have been phased out and newer internet connected appliances have taken over. It&#39;s better for the consumer they claim.Not wanting an overtly fancy contraption you pick a no frills unit that includes a touch screen along the side. A few hours later it arrives. Setting it up was almost as easy as your old one. Plug it in, enter your wi-fi password, and a credit card to start your free pro trial of the monthly subscription service that tweets at you when the toast is done. It says you can cancel at anytime but it requires a 5 day waiting period. It also requires access to your contacts.Tired and just wanting your toast you agree. You insert two slices of white bread and press the big red GO button on the touch screen. An electrical motor whines from inside the toaster at it begins to retract the toast into itself. There&#39;s a few seconds of silence as the toaster slowly heat ups. While awkwardly standing there you notice the touch screen flickers and begins to display a buffering icon. An ad for I Can&#39;t Believe it&#39;s Not Butter begins to play. To make matters worse you can&#39;t even ignore it by looking away due to a small tinny sounding speaker playing the company&#39;s jingle.This is your new morning routine.Welcome to the future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I do not blame cooler screen for selling this technology to anyone. But I want everyone to consider how much it takes to bring about a technology like this to a grocery store.If this is any of the big chain groceries, the manager doesn&#39;t even have the authority to put a sticker on the glass door. This was vetted by hundreds of people and none of them thought... glass?Business class tickets were purchased, hotels were booked, months of back and forth, daily meetings. Hundreds of thousands were spent on pilot programs like this one. Still no one thought... glass?In my opinion, it&#39;s a silly idea. But I applaud the person who had this silly idea, built a company around it, got deals with screens, door, glass, and cameras manufacturing companies, and then convinced a grocery chain to buy this for their store.I would really, really love to have been in that sales pitch meeting.Edit: What bothers me the most about this, is that it will actually work. Any surface where eyes may fall on, will be replaced with an ad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everyone here who’s worked for some moderately large corporation knows exactly why this was done: it’s a flashy pet project for some “labs” team in an otherwise boring retailer and maybe they’ll recoup some of the cost in ads, minus whatever they lose for it being an awful idea. Some charismatic product manager sold it to execs as “being the future of connected retail” or some other BS. In a few months they’ll be removed because it’s a stupid idea.When the company that made these was analyzing their market, I have no doubt they were targeting this exact scenario knowing that even the stupidest products have a place to make a boring brick and mortar retailer think they’re doing technology."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve built robots. I&#39;ve built greenhouses. I like software and the occasional bit of farming. Thirs looks cute and fun, and I hope they iterate, but it&#39;s not really solving the right problems, and introduces its own.1 - there are no straight lines on a farm. Maybe in a hydro setup built on concrete slab, in which case, why robot?2 - needs a way to cover more ground. If it&#39;s not able to travel linearly indefinitely in one direction along a bed, there&#39;s no way to scale.3 - grit. Precision CnC mechanisms and dirt do not mix. You can&#39;t keep farm things clean (unless hydro, and even then, things get wet and caked with fertilizer salt)Ditch the linear ways for something like bike tires. There&#39;s an open source solar farm robot which rolls around weeding (can&#39;t find at the moment, maybe was a video). Not limited by a box. They need robust mechanisms which can stand up to farm abuse and are easy to service, grease, and replace (unless you hermetically seal the components, which is harder than it sounds).Weeds are actually pretty easy to manage.If someone wants to make an impact in the farm tech space, come up with a cheaper alternative for scooping and dumping dirt. A ride-on tractor can be had used for $500-800. But as soon as you start talking loaders, it&#39;s $2-3000 used, and tens of thousands for new. Also the smallest tend to be a 4 foot wide bucket and a few hundred pounds lift. I want something half or a quarter of that. Able to scoop 50 lbs of dirt, repeatedly, and dig holes/trenches. That would have a massive impact in agrarian communities around the world."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh hey this is my industry (robots in agriculture).I don&#39;t like this. It feels way too &#34;Juicero&#34; to me. Too cute, to inconsequential. It feels likely one would spend more time on building and maintaining this thing than work it actually saves and a significant amount the benefit of having a garden is working it with you hands and watching that work grow in fruition.Bots in the farm though, they are the real deal. Reducing herbicide use by 80% or more, allowing the use of non-GMO crop while maintaining strong weed control and healthy crop, treating and optimizing every individual plant in a field, all things that will happen in the next 10 years due to robotics in the farm."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know cnc and farming, and I really don&#39;t see this product surviving. I can&#39;t find a shovel that lasts more than a few months on my small farm, I don&#39;t know how a big 3d printer is going to cut it in anything like real agricultural conditions. I would love to be wrong though, garden robots would be great, especially if they had lasers for slugs. Actually, forget the rest of the robot, all I really want is a slug laser."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I published my first Steam game on Linux as well as Windows and MacOS, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll do it again because for a single person developer (as indie as it gets) the time spent supporting Linux doesn&#39;t pay off. Within days of publishing my game I had support request emails that said &#34;so I&#39;m on this specific Red Hat version, with this oddball graphics driver and three monitors and full-screen doesn&#39;t work with your game properly&#34;. As I only officially supported Ubuntu I couldn&#39;t really help each exotic (to me) setup that came into my email inbox, and there was more than a few. Which I still think is a shame.But that was five years ago. I&#39;m pretty sure Photon supports my Windows builds on Linux better than I was ever able to do with the native executables, and at least there&#39;s that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At a Steam Dev Days event I hit up a dev from a popular flight sim that ran on Win/Mac/Linux and asked him to rank the support costs for different platforms. I was surprised by his answer. He said:Mac users were effectively the most expensive because his team was (then) spending a lot of time porting their graphics code to Metal.Linux users were the least expensive because they tended to be sophisticated users who were accustomed to solving their own problems. He cited a particular customer who he said had a solid track record of finding graphical glitches in the game, then opening bugs against Intel GPU drivers and getting them fixed.Windows users were somewhere in between.Of course we didn&#39;t discuss the opportunity cost of supporting Linux (financially probably not worth it), I&#39;m not sure how much his view was a function of (maybe) not having to personally answer support requests, or whether his experience could be generalized beyond his particular customer demographic, but I learned quite a bit from his response.==========If I ever ship my own game I hope to support Linux not because I think it&#39;s the right financial move, but because I think offering cross-platform compatibility is just part of being a good digital citizen. A lot of us lived through a time where Windows was about the only game in town, and I don&#39;t want to ever go back there. (Plus there&#39;s a selfish element: I develop on Linux, so I want to play on Linux!)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I shipped a tiny game on Steam developed entirely in GNU/Linux with Windows/MacOS/Linux builds all produced from within GNU/Linux without virtualization of other OSes.MINGW covered the Windows build, clang/osxcross for the MacOS build, and plain old gcc for Linux.  It&#39;s all oldschool autotools+pkg-config dances for the cross-compilation.  Plain C and SDL2+OpenGL under the hood, no engine.It&#39;s nice being able to do it all from my preferred GNU/Linux environment, and I was able to at least smoke test the windows builds successfully via WINE.  The main shortcoming currently is there&#39;s no MacOS WINE-equivalent that&#39;s mature enough to run a graphical GPU-accelerated video game AFAIK."</p>

People who post on marketplaces like Flippa or MicroAcquire or SideProjectors (there&#39;re dozens of them) have either:1. Realized the time it takes to maintain is not worth the revenues/profits2. Realized the income is not sustainable and are trying to cash out at the end of a great run3. Realized that some folks are willing to pay very high multiples and will list their projects at prices most (but not all) people will balk at.If you&#39;re really interested in taking over a project that&#39;s profitable, network with people, do cold emailing, and find opportunities to take over projects that the owners are simply not interested in any more.In other words, look for the elderly couple who is ready to move on from owning their profitable, outdated shop."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My hair started graying pretty much as soon as I graduated from college. It makes a lot of sense now. Around the same time, I:- bought a house (in 2007, yeesh)- got married- started my first job (which at the time felt like drinking out of a fire hose)Shortly after, my wife and I went through the stress of trying and failing to get pregnant. Then infertility treatments for several months. Then my wife had surgery. Infertility treatments no longer an option, we turned to adoption. 6 weeks later (seriously), we brought home our first child.After that, it was like kids fell into our laps every couple of years. After the second child, I struggled with a pretty severe addiction that nearly claimed my marriage. Since then we&#39;ve adopted two more. We now have kids aged 12, 9, 6 and 4.Has it been all stress all the time? Not at all. I feel incredibly blessed to be living this life. But the hair (mostly on the sides) hasn&#39;t gone back to its normal color either, so I guess either it&#39;s genetic or there&#39;s an undercurrent of stress I&#39;ve just become accustomed to.Edit: formatting"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe it was a coincidence but at my last job I was so insanely stressed and burnt out. My manager was terrible, treated me like an idiot, and my ideas were stifled day in and day out.I woke up one day and seemingly overnight my beard had a grey patch - almost white, in fact. It fell out in the week after.Almost a year and a half later, after leaving that job, I took the pandemic to really focus on my stress levels and be happier (I am). The grey patch is starting to fade away and some color is beginning to return. Certainly not the stark white that was there before, and definitely not grey either.Idk if I believe it, maybe something else was happening. But it sure seemed stress related at the time.EDIT: I&#39;m &lt; 30 and my family doesn&#39;t have a history of grey hair - quite the opposite. Forgot to mention this"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Stress is terrible.Work overloaded me and caused so much stress that I had stress-induced alopecia. My beard fell out in patches, and I had random patches of hair fall out on the back of my head, almost like perfect circles. Besides that, I couldn&#39;t really enjoy myself anymore, and I would often spend my non-work time vegetating.Then there&#39;s the teeth grinding and all the damage that comes with that.The hair came back, but the damage done to my teeth is not reversible.These are just the physical damages, the damages to mental health are either still on the mend or scarred."</p>

I&#39;ve been burned twice on operating hours, once for my local bank and once for a convenience store, driving over each time only to find the place closed. In both cases, the correct hours were posted on the business&#39;s website. I&#39;ve also seen bad KG results for medical conditions, listing the wrong symptoms or describing easily-treatable maladies as &#34;Incurable&#34;. Now I actively ignore the info box and intentionally click through to an authoritative non-Google website.To a non-technical user, I&#39;m sure the box looks like a human-curated result which they&#39;re more likely to trust. Maybe that&#39;s the goal of Google&#39;s UI choices. Couldn&#39;t be further from the truth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You should seriously consider suing for defamation if this isn&#39;t fixed within a few days.  This is an egregious error, especially if it was done by an automated system (and this could be a systemic issue affecting many others).I think you have a decent chance of getting a five figure+ settlement from this. Talk to a lawyer about your options.EDIT: When I search &#34;Hristo Georgiev&#34; (from US IP) there is no longer an image in the infobox. (As of 21:55:10 UTC, June 24, 2021)I think a google engineer saw this HN post :-D(You could still talk to a lawyer - remedying it now does not alter the fact that you were previously defamed.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It turns out that Google&#39;s knowledge graph algorithm somehow falsely associated my photo with the Wikipedia article about the serial killer. Which is also surprisingly strange because my name isn&#39;t special or unique at all; there are literally hundreds of other people with my name, and despite of all that, my personal photo ended up being associated with a serial killer. I can&#39;t really explain to myself how this happened, but it&#39;s weird. In any case, I am now in the process of reporting this Knowledge Graph bug to Google.I believe that there is a simpler explanation.The Wikipedia article is there in that side box because it is the top hit for &#34;hristo georgiev&#34; on Google&#39;s main search page. The picture is there because it is the top hit for &#34;hristo georgiev&#34; on Google&#39;s image search page."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Utterly astounded and dismayed to see this much of HN&#39;s audience completely fail to comprehend what they&#39;ve read here and paint this as some sort of sinister theft.This is the law functioning as intended.  Thiel&#39;s case is a one-in-100-million+ event.  He may have the only Roth IRA in existence that&#39;s valued at over $5 billion.  But he didn&#39;t do it by exploiting some sort of &#34;loophole&#34; or paying high-priced accountants to shield his assets in foreign entities offshore.  He put his investments in a Roth IRA just like any of you can do.  The only difference is his investments were in the top 0.0001% in terms of performance.  That&#39;s generally how people get to be billionaires.And that&#39;s not even to mention that the assets in a Roth IRA are essentially worthless to him - he&#39;s not old enough to make withdrawals or take distributions tax-free and you can&#39;t borrow against a Roth IRA.  The funds are essentially unavailable to him for years to come unless he wants to pay taxes and penalties.Again - this isn&#39;t a tax dodge.  This is someone who used the law exactly as intended without any illegal or shady dealings and happened to be incredibly fortunate.The whole article is a hit piece designed to get whip people into a furor.  And lately I&#39;ve been noticing propublica publishing a lot of those."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IANAL but this topic is of interest.Without commenting on whether this was legal at the time Thiel made this transaction, it appears it would not be permissible under current tax law. (Update: the relevant text in the statute appears to have been in effect as early as 1995: https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?hl=false&amp;edition=1994&amp;re...)
 Specifically, the law explicitly disqualifies anyone who is:&gt;an officer, director (or an individual having powers or responsibilities similar to those of officers or directors), a 10 percent or more shareholder, or a highly compensated employee (earning 10 percent or more of the yearly wages of an employer) of a person described in subparagraph (C), (D), (E), or (G)(Source: https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/4975)So the relatively plain language would almost certainly include anyone who&#39;s a co-founder involved in actively managing a company today.This kind of blatant tax avoidance is going to end badly for our tax regime, which is likely to overcorrect."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I don&#39;t understand about this whole maneuver is that Roth transactions must be made at arms length; ie, &#34;Transactions must be made at arm’s length and not involve the IRA owner or a member of his or her family.&#34;An example of this is that if you use a Roth to invest in property, you are not allowed to use it personally, not allowed to manage it or do maintenance yourself, etc.Prohibited transactions risk tainting (and thus exposing) the entire account.How is Thiel investing in his own company not considered a prohibited investment?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"NewsBlur&#39;s founder here. I&#39;ll attempt to explain what&#39;s happening.This situation is more of a script kiddie than a hacker. I&#39;m in the process of moving everything on NewsBlur over to Docker containers in prep for the big redesign launching next week. It&#39;s been a great year of maintenance and I&#39;ve enjoyed the fruits of Ansible + Docker for NewsBlur&#39;s 5 database servers (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch, and soon ML models).About two hours before this happened, I switched the MongoDB cluster over to the new servers. When I did that, I shut down the original primary in order to delete it in a few days when all was well. (Thank goodness I did that! It&#39;ll come in handy a few hours from now).Turns out the ufw firewall I enabled and diligently kept on a strict allowlist with only my internal servers didn&#39;t work on a new server because of Docker. When I containerized MongoDB, Docker helpfully inserted an allow rule into iptables, opening up MongoDB to the world. So while my firewall was &#34;active&#34;, doing a `sudo iptables -L | grep 27017` showed that MongoDB was open the world. More info on SO[1].To be honest, I&#39;m a bit surprised it took over 3 hours from when I flipped the switch to when a script kiddie dropped NewsBlur&#39;s MongoDB collections, and ransomed about 250GB of data. I am now running a snapshot on that old primary, just in case it reconnects to a network and deletes everything. Once done, I&#39;ll boot it up, secondary it out, and be back in business. Let&#39;s hope my assumptions hold.[1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30383845/what-is-the-bes..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From a quick skim through https://github.com/samuelclay/newsblur for models extending mongo.Document, it looks like the following private customer data has been breached:- all story content from all private feeds- any uploaded OPML files, including URLs for any private RSS feeds- User’s twitter/facebook account info and access tokens, if the user had linked those services with their newsblur account- all data that would be used to create a user profile page, including email address, whether the user had a public profile or notHowever most personal data, such as password hashes and billing info, was stored in postgres."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"10:35p ET: Looks like the snapshot will take 10 hours to make. Ordinarily this wouldn&#39;t be a problem becuase the service is running and a snapshot would be made on a secondary DB. But all of the Mongo DBs faithfully deleted their data, so I&#39;m taking a snapshot of a recent good backup. Once done, I can replicare the DB and we&#39;ll be back.9:54p ET: Holy moly, when I switched to a new Mongo DB server, a hacker deleted all of NewsBlur’s mongo data and is now holding NewsBlur’s data hostage. I’m dipping into a backup from a few hours ago and will keep you all updated.They&#39;ve also given some info on twitter https://twitter.com/NewsBlur that I haven&#39;t digested yet."</p>

They were just happy to please the big corporation.Hamburg is a favourite for such cases because they just have no clue about technology. They are just old fashioned.As a small indie developer, I could not afford to keep on fighting. I gave up. I was a psychological wreck. And since it is not binding, big entities can afford to sue you non-stop.Hamburg was the second time I was in a court. I got sued by the same big corporation. I won the first one.Despite not being binding Sony will use this as a precedent and they will start going against the bigger DNS players, till all of them have to comply with their demands."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"If anyone from Quad9 is still here, I have an interesting suggestion.While finding a legal solution, the resolvers could mark if a block was done due to a legal reason (ie. censorship), so that clients can react to that and ask another resolver instead. If enough resolvers would adhere to this practice, it would render these censorship attempts useless. Of course, client software would need to support this too.I haven&#39;t talked to the team yet here at https://safing.io/, but I think we&#39;d be willing to implement that in our DNS client."</p>

We can vote for the Greens without &#34;throwing our left-of-centre&#34; vote away and still preferring Labor to Liberal.

You don&#39;t have to go research the Natural Law Party or Animal Justice or whoever.The only cautionary tale is the whole horse-trading element of preferences does lead to some weird candidates making it in at the margins. We had someone who was semi-famous for engaging in a Kangaroo poo fight get in this way:https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/it-was-people-play-w...But this &#34;preference whispering&#34; is more of a big deal when preferences were allocated by parties - we had an option where you could vote a single &#39;1&#39; for a given party and it was their preferences that wound up being automatically applied (if you didn&#39;t go through hand-numbering all the preferences).

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This isn&#39;t very good reporting by NPR.  The downsides they list are just straw men easily dismissed by RCV proponents, and they give an appearance of fair-and-balanced coverage while making opponents of RCV sound like Luddites.  (It also seems like they got all their information from, say, chatting with people from FairVote and not by actually reading online discussions like this one here.)RCV does have some serious problems.  Eliminating the candidate with the least first-place votes at each round means a high probability of rejecting compromise candidates that may be a lot of voters&#39; second choice.  Also, placing your first-choice candidate first isn&#39;t always a safe choice.  RCV is non-monotonic, which means it&#39;s possible that ranking someone first might actually cause them to lose.  That&#39;s weird, and I think it&#39;s a good enough reason to investigate other options.I think we should use approval voting in single-winner state and national elections.  It&#39;s simple and it solves the problem of 3rd party candidates being spoilers (which is why most voting reform advocates dislike FPTP in the first place) without introducing any new problems.  STAR is also a pretty good system.Approval voting is currently used in Fargo ND and they recently adopted it in St. Louis as well.There&#39;s a lot at stake when we change our election systems.  I think one of the biggest risks is that we adopt RCV widely and then when people figure out that it&#39;s not actually all that great, they aren&#39;t going to want to try something different.  They&#39;ll either say &#34;democracy just doesn&#39;t work very well and there&#39;s nothing we can do about it&#34;, or they&#39;ll go back to FPTP because they were misled by a successful PR campaign that sounds like it has the backing of voting system experts.  Voting systems should be changed rarely, and when it happens we should use the best available system, not chase the latest fad."</p>

An hr later I had to leave to catch my flight, and i asked him where he was going - he said I&#39;d find out some &#34;pretty crazy shit&#34; about him next week, and that &#34;the doc was a bunch of BS&#34;. Two days later, I read Show Time had announced &#34;Gringo: The Dangerous Life of John McAfee&#34;.  In the brief time I spent with him, I have to say he had pretty positive energy for someone who was portrayed the way he was.[1] https://i.imgur.com/qThvR2S.jpg"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Was just reading about McAfee freebasing bath salts from old posts on an old Joe Rogan forum and not paying taxes seems like the absolute least he was up to:&gt;I&#39;ve processed 23 kilos of this stuff in the past year or so, and bump it myself every day - in fair quantities the hypersexuality... is beyond belief. I have had a number of acquaintances (both male and female) who have rubbed their genitals way past the point of bleeding and still couldn&#39;t stop.&gt;In all honesty, a first time user, or a user on a large dose, when presented with food, will simply figure out a way to include it in the ongoing sex play with their partner. If alone, they will figure out a way to fuck it, or shove it up their rectum. This is not a joke. Everything on the Tan becomes a sex partner or a sex aid. If only visually. I will not, anymore, let anyone on Tan be alone with my dogs for example.&gt;A local brothel owner (prostitution is legal in my country) talked me out of a large amount of Tan and provides it to his working girls and their customers. The idea was to simply increase business by having hornier customers and more authentic product. It worked for a while, and then girls started taking larger doses and giving customers larger doses. They began leaving and running off with customers - some after a single contact with the customer.&gt;If a person takes a large dose of the Tan and has the misfortune to have no partner at the time, then truly terrible things happen. A number of men, and women, have molested strangers after massive doses of the pure product (which is why I no longer provide it to anyone other than trusted friends - everything else is cut 50 to one). Twice, users on large doses have tried to molest my dogs.&gt;I have distributed over 3,000 doses exclusively in this country. They call it SPT (I named it) and it is a seriously hot underground topic here. I know of at least a dozen people who spend virtually full time playing with this, and hundreds trying to get samples, which I dole out with meticulous care. Anyone caught sharing this with another without my consent doesn&#39;t get any more.https://www.resetera.com/threads/john-mcafee-this-might-be-t..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One shouldn&#39;t expect courage from The Economist, but it&#39;s always wise to bet on their prudence.I don&#39;t read The Economist for facts or details so much as to get a sense of what topics a current establishment can no longer afford to ignore. The details are secondary to the neccessity that a writer, a sub-editor, and a senior editor with tremendous personal stake in maintaining access to the circles that define establishment media, have collectively recognized that to remain relevant as a publication, the risk/reward on any ensuing controversy still means the magazine has to acknowledge which way the wind is blowing.When The Economist says something is just starting, it means it&#39;s been brewing for at least several years and they need to comment on it. I don&#39;t think direct discourse on the topic improves the discussion on gender because the participants use a critical theory in which the promise of  discourse is just bait to corner political targets for their mobs. However, we (and even The Economist) can recognize that popular tolerance for these tactics has finally reached an inflection point, and this change in attitude is what will finally allow real analysis and insight by thoughtful people into topics about gender."</p>

They seem to be a bit of an exception in Central/South America.EDIT: From Wikipedia &#34;It is known for its long-standing and stable democracy, and for its highly educated workforce, most of whom speak English. The country spends roughly 6.9% of its budget (2016) on education, compared to a global average of 4.4%. Its economy, once heavily dependent on agriculture, has diversified to include sectors such as finance, corporate services for foreign companies, pharmaceuticals, and ecotourism. Many foreign manufacturing and services companies operate in Costa Rica&#39;s Free Trade Zones (FTZ) where they benefit from investment and tax incentives.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We really need two words for renewables: one for types that scale but don&#39;t provide power on demand (wind, solar), and the other for types that provide power on demand but aren&#39;t available at scale everywhere (hydro, geothermal).Costa Rica is blessed with plenty of the second type and uses it. Because we lump it all into &#34;renewables,&#34; it sounds like it should be easy for everyone to follow their example, and that&#39;s not the case. No country has run on a high percentage of wind/solar/battery for a long period of time."</p>

Especially for an early stage startup, the performance, scalability, or reliability of your stack isn&#39;t going to kill you.  A long time to market will kill you,  reinventing the wheel will kill you.  When I see django apps built and developed, a shockingly high amount of effort is dedicated to actually solving business problems vs other less opinionated frameworks."</p>

Accounts - can’t stay anonymous, ml systems working around the clock to identify posters. My social justice focused friends have it worse, their online “friends” attack them publicly over every single little thing. They go quiet or form a tiny invite only groups to hide after an attempt to do something good that backfired because their skin is the wrong colour or they aren’t trans. They have panic attacks over the guilt and stress"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I very often type out comments on HN and then delete them. As Snowden alludes to, everything we submit to public forums is logged and stored. There is no doubt in my mind these comments are easily associated to my real identity with very little effort.Another side of censorship I consider often is signal to noise. There is no reason to prevent people from saying whatever they want if no one will ever see it. I recall a stat I heard that YouTube receives ~400 hours of content uploaded every minute to their site. Or the long-tail of Twitch streamers with 0 viewers.Finally, there is a threat of violence. We all know what happens to high-profile journalists because of their high profile. I often wonder how many nobodies disappear for some string of comments on some no-traffic forums/blogs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is possibly a unique angle, but by being in taboo art circles (erotic art specifically), I&#39;m struck at how much I see this topic resonating with my fellow artists.I know so many, too many, far more than I can count on my hands who have simply given up posting kink art because they keep getting mobbed, doxxed, slandered, and harassed simply by posting art (or seeing their friends getting shredded as well). I know so many that have forced to bounce from platform to platform from instagram to tumblr to twitter because either the algorithm censors you or the mob abuses the &#34;report user&#34; button if they simply don&#39;t care for your art.I know so many who have had to host on friend&#39;s servers because big-name hosts ban erotic art and kinks in tiny print in the TOS and it&#39;s just not worth it to fucking bounce from host to host unless if it&#39;s an actual friend who supports true artistic freedom.I know so many who are winding up in making zines as a last resort, because zines can be printed at the home computer, so they&#39;re one of the last truly uncensored artistic mediums in comparison to the internet. And yet - how many trailblazing artists have we lost from that crushing top-down censorship even with that one meager avenue open?So yes, this is relevant and urgent, and in more ways than it appears."</p>

(Third party browsers like Netscape Navigator or Opera implemented a HTTP-stack of their own, but IE relied on the built-in implementation.)(Because of this flaw, keep-alive was broken, as well, and requests stalled until they timed out.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;I am not convinced that removing any optimization which can be used in a timing-based side channel is sustainable.&#34; basically boils down over two decades of JavaScript (now WebAssembly) API and language design, where one subset of the committees fervently argues against any feature or primitive that could possibly be used to acquire timing information, no matter how useful. It&#39;s tough, because they are ALSO trying to make sure any advertiser on the planet can run code on your PC without your permission, so it is pretty important to stop that code from using timing side channels to capture your credit card number or something. Once it was proven that JavaScript could trigger rowhammer (I remember having debates about this during wasm spec meetings at the time when it was still speculative), that kind of guaranteed that the side-channel people would remain in control, I think. SharedArrayBuffer is the biggest example - we basically had safe multithreaded memory access available in browsers but it got disabled due to spectre/meltdown, and we only started getting it back relatively recently with lots of additional constraints to try and make it &#34;safe&#34;. Want high-precision timestamps? Not anymore you don&#39;t, it&#39;s a side-channel!Similarly, when a new browser update goes out it may or may not make all the web apps you rely on slower (or break them), so any web benchmarking also needs to be re-run from scratch on a regular basis. New Chrome and Firefox releases &#34;ride the trains&#34; every 6 weeks or so, and they quietly push changes to the browser more frequently than that which can occasionally impact perf or behavior too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Previous related discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26328758If things go as planned, this may become a paid, ad-free, zero-tracking search engine. I can&#39;t express how exciting this is to me.Over the past few years, I have made several attempts to replace Google Search with DuckDuckGo. But they have all failed and I always ended up changing the default search engine back to Google. I mean, DDG worked fine for 95% of time, but the remaining 5% failure often led to some extreme frustration that I just couldn&#39;t stand. I would imagine Brave Search to have similar issues, at least in the beginning, but they did something smart to make it less painful:&gt; Brave Search beta is based on an independent index, the first of its kind. However, for some queries, Brave can anonymously check our search results against third-party results, and mix them on the results page.So, if I am not satisfied with Brave&#39;s result, Google&#39;s result is on the same page, or just one click away."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; On 6 June 2020, a Twitter user pointed out that Brave inserts affiliate referral codes when users type a URL of Binance into the address bar, which earns Brave money. Further research revealed that Brave redirects the URLs of other cryptocurrency exchange websites, too. In response to the backlash from the users, Brave&#39;s CEO apologized and called it a &#34;mistake&#34; and said &#34;we&#39;re correcting&#34;.Brave is just a &#34;pop-privacy&#34; company.  I will skip this one..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apparently, they have their own search index, which they say covers ~95% of queries, and if the results aren&#39;t in the index, it will then get it from Google or Bing.I&#39;d love some more details on how this works. They probably aren&#39;t scraping the whole web. Are they just mirroring Bing and Google indexes? They seem to have their own page ranking algorithm that they&#39;re hoping to get trained."</p>

That &#39;hyperfocus&#39; that occurs either with deadlines or on a passion project is a symptom, as is the inability to get excited about projects you simply don&#39;t want to do - especially given your otherwise positive reviews and your ability to clear your mind and hyperfocus near a deadline, it&#39;s something to consider.I was diagnosed at 33, and it changed my life infinitely for the better. YMMV, and you may not have ADHD, but if you do, it is nothing to feel guilty about - it, in fact, gives you some insanely useful abilities that others simply don&#39;t have, as evidenced by the number of comments on this post explaining you have no guilt to feel, and your positive performance reviews.But being able to understand why we do these things, and being able to understand how to adjust for them (whether through medication or coping mechanisms) is, alone, insanely relieving.Consider picking up &#39;Driven to Distraction,&#39; or &#39;Delivered From Distraction,&#39; or check out these posts by Mark Suster which was what led me to get started on the path:* https://bothsidesofthetable.com/how-to-know-if-you-have-add-...* https://bothsidesofthetable.com/why-add-might-actually-benef...* https://bothsidesofthetable.com/developing-an-action-plan-fo..."</p>

Having employees who have extra capacity is incredibly important for an organization that wants to get things done; if you&#39;re constantly hard at work on something important, when something else comes up (someone has a question, there&#39;s a bug or an outage, whatever), you either have to delay the thing you&#39;re already working on, or delay the thing that came up. This tends to have a cascade effect on most kinds of work, locking up all your people resources.Plus, those other things you&#39;re doing sound like they overall, in the long-term, probably give you a wider range of knowledge, improving your usefulness.Just wanted to add a voice against that sort of Taylorism perspective on work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is exactly why I&#39;ve concluded trying to go my own way is the best long-term plan for me. Before learning about YC and HN and such, the thought never really occurred to me.When I&#39;m working on a personal project I&#39;m really passionate about, my productivity is literally orders of magnitude higher than at any day job I&#39;ve had. Months or years are compressed into days.For any ambitious personal project that I&#39;m intrinsically motivated by, I&#39;m working on it and designing it pretty much every free moment I have. It&#39;s actually crazy to me how much I can get done if there&#39;s absolutely zero &#34;ugh field&#34; [1] inhibiting me. It doesn&#39;t feel like work at all. I&#39;d happily take 20% of my current salary if it meant I could do that all day instead.Even if it&#39;s stressful and even if I might fail miserably, I think life should be lived. If there&#39;s even the tiniest sliver of a chance that I could support myself just doing something like that, I know I&#39;d be much happier. And if turning such a thing into a job or organization sucks the fun out of it, then I&#39;ll just keep trying again and again until I can find a project with a sufficiently viable enjoyment:financial stability ratio.[1] https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EFQ3F6kmt4WHXRqik/ugh-fields (Regarding the author&#39;s username: yes, it&#39;s that one.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great work! Hacker News still seems to have a deeply skeptical culture with regard to machine learning - not sure why. There&#39;s always someone saying it&#39;s &#34;not novel&#34; and it&#39;s &#34;just doing x&#34;.Overfitting is a known issues in machine learning, people.  If you still think all neural networks are doing is memorizing the dataset completely in the year 2021 - you might want to revisit the topic. It is one of the first concerns anyone training a deep model will have and to assume this model is overfit _without_ providing specific examples is arguing in bad faith.Sentdex has shown his GAN is able to generalize various game logic like collision/friction with vehicles and also learns aspects of rendering such as a proper reflection of the sun on the back of the car.He also showed weak points where the model is incapable of handling some situations and even did the impossible task of &#34;splitting a car in two&#34; to try and solve a head-on collision. Even though this is a failure case; it should at least provide you with some intuition that the GAN isn&#39;t just spitting out frames memorized from the dataset because that never happens in the dataset.You will need to apply a little more rigor before outright dismissing these weights as merely overfit.@sentdex Have you considered a guided diffusion approach now that that&#39;s all the rage? It&#39;s all rather new still but I believe it could be applied to these concepts as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like your YouTube videos in general and think this content is a great benefit to the community.I wouldn’t take the few negative comments personally - I’ve seen many GAN architectures that heavily overfit (including my own bobross pix2pix) get a lot of praise, while ‘less violating’ models (like yours) get more skepticism.  Skepticism isn’t bad! But I’d wager in your case it may be because you’re a YouTuber, and other ml YouTubers are notorious for ripping off content (eg Siraj).Not really related to this, but I’d personally love to see the difference in training times it would take an RL agent to adequately learn to drive a car in gta versus adequately flying a helicopter."</p>

It’s also not that hard to keep track of how much you spend and make sure it’s less than how much you make.For almost anything personal finance related there is free information available all over the Internet if you care to spend a couple minutes googling for it.Likewise with taxes, if you have a regular W2 job, taxes are not hard, just read and follow the instructions. It doesn’t help that people keep repeating the dumb meme that if you make a typo on your tax return the IRS will immediately throw you in jail.

Therefore, again imo, products that focus on privacy and such will remain niche.I suspect that the world is ready for paid services that provide a better Ux. I am thinking about how Netflix supposedly put a dent in piracy. People were willing to pay for content with a better Ux.Aside from saving battery and no surprised mobile data charges, the list many other benefits:  * No ads 
  * No annoying registration 
  * No mandatory tutorials 
  * No noisy email spam 
  * No push notifications 
  * No crapware

I wonder if a project could charge a small monthly fee if they focused on these user benefits that everyone cares about, and partially use that money to support OSM and partially use the money to support themselves?"</p>

I have taken these kinds of cases pro bono in the past for small companies (including through the EFF attorney referral list, https://www.eff.org/pages/legal-assistance), and I know that others have as well.There are definitely low-cost and pro bono (free) options out there for very small businesses. The EFF attorney referral list is a good place to start.I&#39;m also happy to talk it through with you if you&#39;d like more specific information - my contact information is here: https://shawkeller.com/attorneys/andrew-e-russell/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been through similar situations.  The &#34;find a lawyer&#34; comments are less than helpful, since you probably don&#39;t know where to begin and most lawyers will happily take your money without necessarily having an expedient path to resolution for a small one-person company.  So here&#39;s what you do:Write to each of your competitors, explain the situation and ask for a referral to their lawyers.  You&#39;d be surprised how many are more than willing to make a referral against a troll Also search around for any other attorneys who have filed against this troll and contact them as well.  They should all be willing to do an initial call for free.You are trying to find an attorney who has a successful blueprint for dealing with this particular troll, ideally this particular claim.  If the attorney is able to leverage their prior work or knowledge, your costs are greatly reduced.  Also, if the troll has unsuccessful experience with a particular attorney they may just give up.  Good luck!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You have to talk to a lawyer.  No one other than a IP attorney experienced in dealing with patent trolls will be able to give you accurate advice on this.Also you should add &#34;[ask HN]&#34; to the beginning of your post.edit: A good way to find a lawyer is to talk to good lawyers you have worked with in the past.  They will not be able to help you themself if they practice in a different area, but will likely have referrals for someone who does."</p>

I&#39;ve messed up repos a few times, and it&#39;s never good.
It&#39;s always -- &#34;what&#39;s the magic want I have to wave now&#34;?The truth is, while we use git every day, most people really don&#39;t understand how it works.There I said it. And I&#39;m not ashamed.I don&#39;t really know how Git works. And I think I&#39;m not the only one.What does &#34;git reflog&#34; or &#34;git reset --hard ....&#34; do? What are the implications?We don&#39;t really know.I feel stupid. But hey, at least I&#39;m honest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m sorry, but how many bits of git&#39;s UI do we have to force users to manually replace before we realize that the entire problem is git&#39;s UI?Between the tone deaf responses here about &#34;using a GUI client is the problem,&#34; to the tone deaf responses of &#34;you just have to learn it&#39;s internal architecture,&#34; it should be obvious what the problem is. The problem is not just being able to undo a mistake (though that&#39;s certainly one of the problems). Git is an incredibly user-hostile experience, and someone needs to fix or replace it. Can we just say it out loud and stop pretending that the problem is the literally thousands of users who have problems using it?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Quick tips for people that find git confusing:- Use a recent version of git. The error messages have improved a lot, have been localized (unless you do `LANG=C git …` to be able to search it on internet), the UI has improved, `git status` is more helpfull, …- Create an alias for `git log --graph --decorate --oneline --all` or something fancier with `--format`. `--graph` should help you a lot to visualise stuff.
 - Don&#39;t use `git reflog` but `git log --graph --reflog`, it&#39;s much easier to visualize.- Never use `git checkout`, but `git switch` and &#34;git restore` that were introduced in git 2.15 IIRC. They are much less confusing and error prone.- `--patches` (`-p` for short) can be used with `add`, `restore`, `reset`, `log`. It helps a lot with commit hygiene.- Most complex rebase are easier to do with `--interactive` (`-i`).- Activate `rerere` in your git config (it will reduce conflict merges during rebases)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"When the stock goes from 200 to 3500 in 10 years, and consistently goes up and to the right, you won’t find too many of the workers complaining no matter how bad the job conditions are. I have a friend up in Seattle who is suffering, to the point of being hospitalized for mental health issues, but refuses to leave.So HR and leadership believe that their system “works” but it’s really that their employees are willing to put up with straight up torture. They are deluded into thinking that their metrics and PIP plan work well because their best employees are staying but it’s really just the stock price.If the stock price starts to drop for whatever reason. All the best employees will leave in droves. That’s what I saw at Uber post IPO."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had joined Amazon as my first job out of school. I was super excited and would not mind working the long hours as the project was interesting. I enjoyed working with my team and manager. Just near the end of the year, my manager quit. The new manager ran my performance review and assessed that my performance didn’t meet expectations. I was not put on PIP. Instead, there would be a development plan that I had to complete. I was shocked and tried hard to not cry during my review. I had never been told earlier that there were any issues with my performance.This review crushed me. It destroyed my confidence in my programming abilities. To be fair, I had made some mistakes during my first year at Amazon - had fewer commits and SLOC compared to my teammates. Being on a work visa meant I could not quit immediately. I had to endure working there for almost a year before I got a new job.I took me quite some time to gain back my confidence. To this day, my time at Amazon makes me dread performance reviews."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a current Amazon employee I can confirm this is no longer the case or only applies to such a select few pieces of software that it doesn&#39;t actually mean what you think it does. The amount of day to day stuff that is relied upon that runs on greasemonkey scripts and web scraping is insane. API&#39;s for a ton of things don&#39;t exist or are have heavy gatekeeping. (eg. contact x to get onboarded to our API and they just ghost you). Of course you can get a high level leader to tell you to use a proper API in a mailing list email thread where you are trying to get help to solve a problem but they will not actually help you get working API access, all talk no action. A perfect example is there is this basic CRUD app that I rely upon and I see the current maintainer is working on all these feature requests, the problem for me is that the site has a ton of AJAX and takes like 20 mouse clicks to get retrieve basic information. So I  open a ticket / feature request just to get a basic REST API for the reads and they politely tell me I am an idiot and close the request. So much pointless work is created at Amazon from lack of API access."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How far does this principle scale? I&#39;ve heard of this strategy and thought &#34;that&#39;s kinda cool.&#34; Amazon is obviously successful in its domain, so it would be easy to assume some causality.And yet, there&#39;s another big tech company, fruit symbol I think, that has played the long game of continually fine tuning the interaction points to make the integration of their parts more than the whole. They get credit for attention to detail, leveraging their integration and their ability to move in ways they do because of their thorough integration across their whole hardware/software stack. They&#39;ve recently been in the press because of just how much they were able to tune their integration to the problem with their first desktop computing chip. Again, we credit their success with some causality due to this strategy, which (to me) is very different than the Amazon strategy.Is it because Amazon is a cloud company and Apple is a hardware company that they have these different approaches to product development and each enjoy success? Or at the end of the day, are these &#34;do it this way&#34; less responsible than we&#39;d like to believe?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at a company that read the Amazon memo virtually straight after it was published and decided to copy it. The CIO at the time predicated every system&#39;s teams&#39; bonus on it.No API, no bonus.What followed was 18mths of people building enterprise messaging systems and &#34;buses&#34; of various types. Hundreds of pages of documentation on APIs was prepared and released.I think 2 API&#39;s with maybe 40 methods actually went live.There were no bonusesMany people leftThe people who stayed were unhappyIt never happened, everyone quietly forgot about it after 18 mnths.The CIO stayed for another 3 or 4 years - he only left when a new CEO came in due to internal promotion. The new CEO used to run one of the P&amp;L&#39;s/business units and hated the CIO with a passion.So... it&#39;s not the API mandate that made the difference at Amazon."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think the biggest problem with Twitter is that we can’t determine a denominator. Twitter knows, but we don’t know.100 people tweeting about how this guy is bad might be indicative of a general consensus or might just be 100 people out of a billion Twitter users. People then interpret it as general consensus and pile on.We know the numerator but since we don’t know the denominator of people who didn’t comment, or disagree, or never saw, or don’t care. So we can’t figure out a ratio and many people assume the denominator is the numerator and the ratio is 1.“The world won’t do business with this guy, I better fire him” doesn’t make sense if it’s just a very small ratio as who cares if 100 people are upset and 1,000,000 customers don’t care.I wish Twitter had some ratio of who viewed vs who acted. Or had downvotes or something. Currently, people assuming that a few commenters is everyone is doing bad things.This coupled with there’s always someone or a small group who holds an opinion so putting too much weight into a few commenters is not smart.

It&#39;s just pouring gasoline on the fire.These people will never say &#34;oh, you learned from your mistakes, I guess I&#39;ll back off&#34;. Most of them don&#39;t really care about the truth, they care about signaling. So an apology only vindicates them.As far as I can tell, the thing to always keep in mind is if you wait a few days these things always pass pretty quickly. The internet has a very short attention span. As long as you never give those people a confirmation that you did something you regret, you&#39;re much better off in the future.Of course you should privately apologize and make amends for things you&#39;ve done wrong; but those things are always more effective privately and personally done anyway."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Former AWS engineer here.I worked on a pretty critical product in AWS (big AWS service with lots of traffic) and I can safely say that it&#39;s totally up to your manager and pre-existing conditions which make up the job. My manager was great as a person but would always lack in my career-oriented goals (bigger projects, promotions, etc)But what really sucked for me was the pre-existing conditions. Our on-call was pretty bad (40-60 tickets a week) and there was very little investment being put in to improve it. We had a lot of little scripts here and there which would solve extremely specific situations but no focus was ever put on in building a general framework or trying to reduce the ticket count. This often led to engineers taking the day off after their on-call due to the load and honestly it made people quite grumpy. And upper management was always much more interested in feature delivery since the focus was always on promotions and the more you delivered the better it looked for your manager. So now you have engineers with such a terrible on-call load along with pressure to deliver new features and projects within the atrocious tight deadlines that would be set. It was, to be blunt, a shit show.Code quality was atrocious. We had one enormous Java method (&gt;1000 lines) which would take care of nearly every single request coming into our service... With only about 7-8 unit tests. It was so difficult to get even basic things done to the point where any ticket that needed to be done would take a minimum of 4-5 days regardless of complexity. And of course managers and senior engineers would estimate small tickets to take around 1-2 days and then be shocked when 2 days later it&#39;s not even close to being finished. I will give Amazon credit that they do grill design reviews pretty harshly so those are done well in general. But code reviewers didn&#39;t care about quality or best practice. If it works then ship it.I&#39;m just not 100% sure about the whole PIP scene. Our service was extremely critical and we were extremely understaffed. So I don&#39;t think it applied to anyone in our org but I know of other teams who would have no issues in taking in a fresh college grad, making them do work for 6-12 months and then just randomly putting them on PIP. Sad but I&#39;ve seen it happen a few times in my time there.I&#39;m glad I got the Amazon stamp on my resume and left. When I left, more than half my team and my manager quit around the same time too. It was definitely a wild experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I interviewed with Amazon and Facebook in the Spring/Summer of 2020. The difference was night and day. Amazon felt like I was part of a huge cattle herd. The recruiter contacted me and told me they needed to hire a bunch of people in my area. I was immediately given a course of study, link to common LeetCode questions and told I had a couple of weeks. That fine. I enjoy solving puzzles. Facebook felt VERY different. The recruiter had a conversation about career goals, told me how wonderful it is to work at FB, and then quizzed me on some basic CS concepts. The ensuing rounds for each got even more divergent. The Facebook interviewers constantly made me feel like my success was a &#34;win&#34; for them. It felt like a team! Amazon felt like they were waiting for me to screw up so they could disqualify me. In the end, I dropped out of Amazon because it felt disgusting. And I could tell, if this is how they bring me in, I can&#39;t see any reason why it&#39;ll magically get any better once I was &#34;in&#34;.My feeling on those who use LeetCode as some sort of indicator. Great. You&#39;ve found the people that do the brain-teaser puzzles at Cracker-Barrel. I&#39;m one of those people. Some of the best people I&#39;ve worked with, would fail those tests immediately... yet, they&#39;ve built scalable, performant enterprise software. I now see those tests as nothing more than a way to reduce the number of applicants."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at a company that hired several people out of Amazon. Amazon is a big company, so there is significant variation from team to team.However, several of the ex-Amazon employees were clearly scarred from their time working at Amazon. Whenever something went wrong (delays, outages, missed deadlines) one of them went so far as to spend hours or days preparing documents showing how it was actually someone else&#39;s fault, not his, because he thought it was necessary to avoid being fired. He said his experience at Amazon was basically one large game of &#34;not it&#34; whenever it came time to assign blame for the latest issue, and everyone had to become very good at blaming someone else. The worst was when he was actual at fault for something, because he would panic and scramble to distract from the issue he caused by raising concerns about everyone else around him. Easily the most toxic person I&#39;ve worked with in the past few years.On the other hand, I&#39;ve known other ex-Amazon people who said their work was nothing like this, so YMMV"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This really deserves more love.Who remembers Ken Thompson&#39;s &#34;Reflections on Trusting Trust&#34;?The norm today is auto-updating, pre-built software.This places a ton of trust in the publisher. Even for open-source, well-vetted software, we all collectively cross our fingers and hope that whoever is building these binaries and running the servers that disseminate them, is honest and good at security.So far this has mostly worked out due to altruism (for open source maintainers) and self interest (companies do not want to attack their own users). But the failure modes are very serious.I predict that everyone&#39;s imagination on this topic will expand once there&#39;s a big enough incident in the news. Say some package manager gets compromised, nobody finds out, and 6mo later every computer on earth running `postgres:latest` from docker hub gets ransomwared.There are only two ways around this:- Build from source. This will always be a deeply niche thing to do. It&#39;s slow, inconvenient, and inaccessible except to nerds.- Reproducible builds.Reproducible builds are way more important than is currently widely appreciated.I&#39;m grateful to the nixos team for being beating a trail thru the jungle here. Retrofitting reproducibility onto a big software project that grew without it, is hard work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a big deal. Congratulations to all involved.In Software, complexity naturally increases over time and dependencies and interactions between components become impossible to reason about. Eventually this complexity causes the Software to collapse under its own weight.Truly reproducible builds (such as NixOS and Nixpkgs) provides us with islands of &#34;determinism&#34; which can be taken as true invariants. This enables us to build more Systems and Software on top of deterministic foundations that can be reproduced by others.This reproducibility also enables powerful things like decentralized / distributed trust. Different third-parties can build the same software and compare the results. If they differ, it could indicate one of the sources has been compromised. See Trustix https://github.com/tweag/trustix"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t see a single comment doubting the value of reproducibility, so I&#39;ll be the resident skeptic :)I think build reproducibility is a cargo cult. The website says reproducibility can reduce the risk of developers being threatened or bribed to backdoor their software, but that is just ridiculous. Developers have a perfect method for making their own software malicious: bugdoors. A bugdoor (bug + backdoor) is a deliberately introduced &#34;vulnerability&#34; that the vendor can &#34;exploit&#34; when they want backdoor access. If the bug is ever discovered you simply issue a patch and say it was a mistake, it&#39;s perfectly deniable. It&#39;s not unusual for major vendors to patch critical vulnerabilities every month, there is zero penalty for doing this.The existence of bugdoors means you have to trust the vendor who provided the source code, there is no way around this.You have to trust the developer, but in theory, reproducible builds could be used to convince yourself their build server hasn&#39;t been hacked. This isn&#39;t really necessary or useful, you can already produce a trustworthy binary by just building the source code yourself. You still have to trust the vendor to keep hackers off everything else though!Okay, but building software is tedious, and for some reason you are particularly concerned about build servers being hacked. Perhaps you will nominate a dozen different organization that will all build the code, and make this a consensus system. If they all agree, then you can be sure enough the binaries were built with a trustworthy toolchain. A modest improvement in theory, but that introduces a whole bunch of new crazy problems.You can&#39;t just pick one or two consensus servers, because then an attacker can stop you getting updates by compromising any one of them. You will have to do something like choose a lot of servers, and only require 51% to agree.Now, imagine a contentious update like a adopting a cryptocurrency fork, or switching to systemd (haha). If the server operators rebel, they can effectively veto a change the vendor wants to make. Perhaps vendors will implement a killswitch that allows them to have the final say, or perhaps they operate all the consensus build servers themselves.The problem is now you&#39;ve either just replaced build servers with killswitches, or just replicated the same potentially-compromised buildserver.I wrote a blog post about this a while ago, although I should update it at some point.https://blog.cmpxchg8b.com/2020/07/you-dont-need-reproducibl..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think a lot of the replies in the thread so far have focused on tech (understandably, this is HN after all) but that&#39;s missing something obvious - the 4 day week would apply to everyone.In tech it&#39;s very likely someone going from 5 days to 4 days could still achieve the same amount of actual work. As other commenters have said, many tech workers don&#39;t do productive work all the time they&#39;re present. Retail workers, factory workers, people who fill in the holes in roads, telephone support people, etc aren&#39;t contending with pointless meetings and busy work though. They can&#39;t do 40 hours of work in 32 hours by removing some of the hours they&#39;re not really working. What they do doesn&#39;t compress like that.Consequently looking at this from the context of tech workers is far less interesting. The Japanese government isn&#39;t saying &#34;Let&#39;s get rid of pointless meetings and busy work!&#34; In tech removing the pointless nonsense isn&#39;t actually reducing the amount of real work people do. Instead, Japan is saying &#34;Our country is wealthy enough and advanced enough that our people can actually do less work.&#34; That&#39;s fascinating.If you see this as &#34;removing the wasteful time spent on things that aren&#39;t useful like meetinga&#34; then you&#39;ve missed the point. It is that, but it&#39;s much, much more than that too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s an open secret at least in the tech world that absolutely no one is putting in a productive 40 hours of work a week. This was true well before the pandemic and is more pronounced than ever now. Everyone needs to be &#34;present&#34; for 8 hours a day 5 days a week, but spends their time in pointless meetings, preparing documents and powerpoints that no one will read,  faux social/teambuilding events, hour long lunches, goofing off on the internet, all to maintain the pretense of office culture.Companies that shuffle things up to prioritize productivity over simply showing up will be set to succeed over the next generation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The social contract in Japan was that you’d give your life to your employer in exchange for a fair wage and stable employment until you retired. Neither of those things are true now. Wages are low and companies either ignore their legal obligations or hire people as contractors, who have less rights  than full time “employees”.Now, many people, especially women* and young people are finding that it’s possible to run a small business for 3-4 days a week and make more money than an entry or even mid-level full time office job.So, I think Japan finally enforcing rules against abusive behavior at the workplace and pushing for a 4-day week, if it really happens, is a reflection of where society is at right now.*Women have a low wage ceiling because they are expected to quit and have children at any time."</p>

Essentially a salted version of the devices passcode is uploaded to the apple server which he could then bypass the rate limit to brute force it.Isn&#39;t this a backdoor that would enable passcode bypass like was requested for the San Bernardino and Pensacola shooters phones?This vulnerability is a massive deal. With the passcode determined there&#39;s nothing stopping bad actors surreptitiously access your data.After all this a $2,180,000,000,000 market cap company offers a reward of $18,000.

- reducing the bountyIt’s like they still treat a white hat hacker as a risk, instead o cooperating with them. I don’t get the corporations. The white hat hacker is in this case your best friend. They proved their ethics already by reporting it to them, and they know it already because they found it. There is literally no reason to try to keep the white hat hacker in the dark, not update them, etc. The white hat hacker could have exploited the vulnerability already!"</p>

I believe that part of this is that Coq uses different mathematical foundations than traditional mathematics, which mostly uses set theory (ZFC, although most people don&#39;t care about the specifics). So it can be hard or unnatural to express something like &#34;subgroup&#34;. I don&#39;t know if Lean fares better in that respect. Coq documentation is also IMHO almost impossible to understand unless you&#39;re already very deeply knowledgeable about the system.We will probably still need some more iterations, to get more user friendly assistants with better documentation and to get adequate teaching resources etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Things I have learned about SSDs:If you want to go fast &amp; save NAND lifetime, use append-only log structures.If you want to go even faster &amp; save even more NAND lifetime, batch your writes in software (i.e. some ring buffer with natural back-pressure mechanism) and then serialize them with a single writer into an append-only log structure. Many newer devices have something like this at the hardware level, but your block size is still a constraint when working in hardware. If you batch in software, you can hypothetically write multiple logical business transactions per block I/O. When you physical block size is 4k and your logical transactions are averaging 512b of data, you would be leaving a lot of throughput on the table.Going down 1 level of abstraction seems important if you want to extract the most performance from an SSD. Unsurprisingly, the above ideas also make ordinary magnetic disk drives more performant &amp; potentially last longer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This page tells me a lot about SSDs, but it doesn&#39;t tell me why I need to know these things.  It doesn&#39;t really give me any indication about how I should change my behavior if I know that I&#39;ll be running on SSD vs spinning disk.I&#39;ve always been told, &#34;just treat SSDs like slow, permanent memory&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My opinion is probably... not technically correct... until you have to deal with drive reliability and write guarantees, but I don&#39;t think programmers actually have to know anything about SSDs in the same way that developers had to know particular things about HDDs.This is out of pure speculation, but there had to be a period of time during the mass transition to SSDs that engineers said, OK, how do we get the hardware to be compatible with software that is, for the most part, expecting that hard disk drives are being used, and just behave like really fast HDDs.So, there&#39;s almost certainly some non-zero amount of code out there in the wild that is or was doing some very specific write optimized routine that one day was just performing 10 to 100 times faster, and maybe just because of the nature of software is still out there today doing that same routine.I don&#39;t know what that would look like, but my guess would be that it would have something to do with average sized write caches, and those caches look entirely different today or something.And today, there&#39;s probably some SSD specific code doing something out there now, too."</p>

There seemed to be an overwhelming amount of evidence over the last year that this repurposed drug is effective at treating Covid during a variety of stages (preventative, first positive test, ICU admittance, and even long haul). But since there hadn&#39;t been a randomized trial the drug had, not only been dismissed, but heavily censored over social media. I still cannot believe how much the discussion has been silenced in the same way people discuss &#34;covid vaxx causes magnetism&#34;. The fact the interview between Bret Weinstein and Pierre Kory was banned from youtube for non-WHO/CDC/NIH approved covid treatments is a tragedy. I truly hope in the coming years the censorship of this topic will be the catalyst for allowing free speech to prevail on social media."</p>

What are the rules?&gt; &#34;By enabling this service, you can be quickly notified if you’ve likely been exposed to the virus by another MassNotify user, allowing you to reduce risk to your loved ones, seek medical attention, and slow the spread in your community.&#34;In this case it seems that the same goal could have been better achieved by SMS that do not depend on the brand of your phone. The dependency on proprietary app stores and OSs seems a risk for the continuation of a free and reliable communications.The only thing that is impossible to achieve without an app is to allow the user to select contacts to whom send a notification. Corporations like Google, and Apple know the list of all your contacts. So, it seems that the intention of the app is to reduce friction and send notifications as easy and effortlessly as possible to avoid that procrastination causes people to delay the warning.But, instead of the silent install the government could have spend money in advertisement campaigns to assure a correct amount of installations. It costs money, but, people pay taxes so the government can engage on this type of initiative at a scale. This could have been a very good alternative, even if it means increasing the budged. Medical emergencies are worth the investing."</p>

Privacy-respecting Android distribution that replaces Google spyware with MicroG, so you can have your cake and eat it too. Most everything will work as you&#39;re used to, but it does still talk to Google to make that happen.GrapheneOS: https://grapheneos.org/
Very much like Calyx, but extra-hardened and with no MicroG. No involvement with Google at all.LineageOS: https://lineageos.org/
The successor to CyanogenMod, will work with many different phones. More privacy and control than stock Android.There are also many others: Sailfish, Replicant, eHardware-wise: CalyxOS and GrapheneOS run best on Pixel 3, 3a, 3XL, 4, 4a, 4XL, 5. The path of least resistance is to get one of these phones and run CalyxOS (if there is an app you need to use that needs Google services like Firebase Cloud Messaging...note that many that can use FCM will run fine without), otherwise run GrapheneOS.You can also buy a Librem 5 https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/

I am a FreeBSD committer and help maintain FreeBSD&#39;s GNOME packages and (very recently) the graphics drivers.The reason why Windows is full of UI inconsistencies is (largely) because of one thing: backwards compatibility.While backwards compatibility has it&#39;s perks, it also means having lots of old code in Windows that can&#39;t be touched very easily without breaking compatibility, And that means many old UI elements may stay, that&#39;s a side effect.While desktop Linux/BSD isn&#39;t exactly well known for it&#39;s UIs, I found GNOME 3/40 to be more consistent UI-wise than Windows 10, being a user of GNOME 3 on FreeBSD at home (which I am typing this comment from), and helping port GNOME 40, while (unsurprisingly) using Windows 10 at $DAYJOB.But then GNOME, KDE, Apple, et al. is more willing to break things than Windows is. They aren&#39;t as bound to legacy compatibility, so old UI elements can be shed easily."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the Run dialog and the folder properties menu and others that have been untouched since the early days. Their utility has been proven and so much muscle memory has been built up. I can not possibly imagine a revision that could be done to them that would have more benefits than simply leaving them be.All of the Fluent/Metro designs have made things markedly worse. For example, check out the Metro control panel widget for selecting a default program for a file extension. It&#39;s a list view with 5 file extensions visible at a time, with no search. That&#39;s what I think of when I hear about a Windows UI update, and I&#39;d love to be proven wrong."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This issue is way overblown here on HN.In day-to-day usage, I have rarely been annoyed by these &#34;inconsistencies&#34;.The best example to illustrate this article is: Installing a driver with the Windows XP layer. That&#39;s probably something that will only happen to people installing very old hardware with drivers from over 10 years ago. I consider that a backward compatibility win: It is great that it even works in Windows 10."</p>

We all know that’s not why he was arrested but the law is clear, he was breaking the law, and they enforced it. So the individual incident dots it’s I’s and crosses it’s t’s as long as you don’t bring up the dreaded ‘uneven enforcement’ issue which is at the heart of everything wrong with the law in America. I have no evidence for the theory but it makes sense with the multiple issues involving this guy mentioned in such a short article.Next interesting point. Is giving a speech about how to treat a broken bone considered ‘practicing medicine’? Who gets to decide the answer. Is a PHD candidate writing an exploration of the efficacy of the various methods for treating a migraine practicing medicine? What if he’s selling copies of his paper on the checkout counter at the drug store? I use medicine instead of engineering because I think it’s easier to discuss but the point should hold the same regardless of which licensed profession we are discussing.Shit I have to run but hope to return to this conversation to discuss the other fun questions raised."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Texas may do a lot of crazy things when it comes to state government, but one thing I think we definitely got right is the Texas Sunset Commission (https://www.sunset.texas.gov/). Basically, all boards set up by the state government are automatically abolished every 10 years I believe unless the state legislature passes a law to continue the board.  So every 10 years the Sunset Commission evaluates agencies/boards about to expire and gives recommendations on if they should be merged, eliminated, etc.The whole idea is to prevent these little long-running fiefdoms from continuing indefinitely, where board members just become more concerned about their own power than their stated purpose.People being people it&#39;s not perfect, but it does go a long way to cut down on this type of abuse."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ve noticed that in the time since I was a kid, the focus of public school has shifted from about the 40th percentile student to the 5th percentile student. In my school, the entire focus of the operation was the decent student... the one who showed up, put in a decent effort, did at least three quarters of their homework. The school had tremendous resources for these kids to go to college, and the very best colleges for the very top students. There was honors, accelerated, standard, and remedial and the kids who were really trying would never be sent to remedial because that’s where the true losers were sent (in a different building) where they couldn’t disrupt anyone else’s learning. Nobody cared what happened to those kids including in many cases their own parents.Now in my kids school I see way too much focus on this segment, which is by its nature low ROI — the number of teacher years it takes to turn one of those kids into someone worthwhile is like 10x the amount it takes to turn an average bright kid into a future surgeon or researcher."</p>

Web sites should start as largely static HTML documents that you read, and then if they need to use JS then they should be required to ask permission to do so, the same way any other executable code is managed in any other computing environment.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I know this is so different, but I can&#39;t help but think of the 1950&#39;s DoD Heavy Press Program[0]. I think about these special industrial monsters a lot when I read about semi fabs.In WW2 after examining the components from aircraft kills, german wing spars would often survive. It was discovered that Germany used unique forged alloy wing spars to achieve their excellent aircraft performance, perplexing allied engineers. These wing spars&#39; strength and weight is critical to the structural properties of modern air frames. Without them, jet air craft like the f-15 would have been impossible.Machining these advanced alloy parts proved difficult, expensive, error prone, and impossible to manufacture but a die forged alloy wing spar was stronger, lighter, cheaper and beyond the industrial capability of every allied nation. We did not have the metallurgical technology to create such a large forged alloy wing spar in 1945.After the war, the US and Soviets recovered designs for the extremely large press assemblies required for advanced air frames. In the 1950s, a huge national program was geared up to create absolutely massive Heavy Press machines. The Soviets had a massive 30,000lb press for these parts, and we created a couple of monstrous 50,000lb machines[1] that are still in operation today. These things are older than we are and still out there cranking out air frame parts today for modern air frames in 2021.Without this kind of national investment in this kind of unique manufacturing, we would be unable to fly without importing 747 parts from wherever they could be created.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_Press_Program

China will expand its semiconductor sector, regardless whether it is economical feasible, because it is a matter of national security.The countries that are going to be hurt by these US semiconductor subsidies are going be Taiwan, South Korea, Japan ... not China."</p>

Then I remembered that I was at a famous boarding school for five years, the most miserable years of my life. Thirty years later I’m still coping with the aftereffects. I think of that place as a form of institutionalised child abuse, and frankly if someone pipebombed it, I would not shed a tear.One simple thing: it wasn’t authoritarian adults or teachers. If anything, they were AWOL. It was the students that really made each other’s life hell. Of course, we were teenagers. Much later, I stopped blaming the individuals and started blaming the institution.Here’s a tiny anecdote. One guy, who I think was genuinely evil, took psychology as a minor subject. As an experiment, he decided to drive another, younger, vulnerable pupil mad. Gaslighting him, messing with his head, that kind of stuff. And he succeeded!"</p>

Kids forced to sit in corners for days at a time, ambulances not being called for kids who had very seriously self-harmed, strip searches (administered by other kids), physical restraints... I could go on. The place had a cult-like atmosphere that was centered on the headmaster and his weird homegrown therapeutic method.I had nightmares for years afterwards and still haven’t fully come to grips with what happened there."</p>

I kick-started the bot on a server remotely and only then discovered it&#39;s an endless loop. It required server admin rights to stop it, which I did not have.I couldn&#39;t immediately reach server admins so had to physically drive there. An hour or so later somebody helped me kill the process.The emails already sent could not be cleared out server-side, which meant that recipients had freezing email clients for over a week, unable to handle the volume, a typical 300K new emails per recipient. They had to Ctrl+A and Delete 100 emails, do this for the next 100, and so on, whilst not deleting real and useful emails.I pretty much destroyed email for those people.I don&#39;t just destroy things at scale though, also at home. Around the time we had our first home broadband internet connection, I set up a web server and just kept my PC running. Unknown to me, the web server software included an email server with open relay enabled by default.About 3 days later, my dad complained about the internet connection not working. The IPS detected the issue (millions of emails sent out via my home server) and gave us a red card, fully shutting us down, permanently."</p>

It surprised me greatly that people wouldn&#39;t want to read the doc at ahead, give it time for thinking and researching, and then come to the table feeling prepare to contribute to the best if your ability.Now, I understand and deeply appreciate this method. I believe it provides lots of benefits. It drives towards better docs that can be understood quickly by non-experts. When there are just a few minutes to review the doc, we don&#39;t have time to go digging for information on our own - the critical information must be provided in the material given. There will also be SMEs in the room who can clarify any shortcomings here. Because the audience of the docs is non-SMEs, it drives towards inclusion of other teams. From this, you get more diverse viewpoints, considerations, and experience. It also contributes towards cross-team awareness and education. It makes it much easier to participate as a contributor to the meeting while simultaneously less impactful when you don&#39;t. It let&#39;s us timebox our attention span - you won&#39;t accidentally spend hours rabbit-holing into a doc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazonion here. The purpose of doc writing is for the author to dump their ideas and convey the critical pieces of information. It lets the reader consume the information at their pace, and re-read even after the meeting. The document starts the conversation and let’s the reader understand the problem, why it’s important, what things we have or have not considered, what trade offs have been made, and how we arrived at the conclusion or solution.There are many, many things Amazon does not get right. The document writing culture is probably one of our not so secret, “secret weapons”.At many companies I worked at, we had a PowerPoint or presentation driven culture. And the purpose of those meetings is to listen to the presenter, at the presenters pace. The meeting becomes about the presenter and what they think is important, as opposed to being about the reader. In presentation driven meetings, the presenter talks and questions actually distract from the presentation - often times presenters will bluntly ask for questions to be saved to the end.My own team has a strong culture of getting engineers to write, and help them write well. It’s not about perfect English, but it is about touching on the key points and letting readers comment and ask questions.Meetings without documents often go completely off the rails - especially because if the kinds of problems we’re solving. Without focus, meetings delve into tangents and branches off of those tangents. To be fair - this still happens if the document hasn’t been adequately prepared, but often because you find the document owner hasn’t fully thought through the problem or fully did their homework."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having witnessed this through a flood of incoming ex-Amazon folks I agree that it brings so much more content and focus on a meeting. It is amazing. The silence, the reading, the staying on topic (apart from tangents that sometimes need to be brought up, but are vulnerable to being just dismissed with the power of The Document) all helps to get the attention and feedback you need.The thing is though, that while the article mentions briefly challenges with the writing, it does not shine light on the hours and hours or reviews, rewrites and re-reviews when preparing the document. The endless and often times pointless arguments and bad blood between people on how to write a sentence so that it would be &#34;correct&#34; and every word and number counts. Arguments if a given word should be &#34;benefit&#34; or &#34;impact&#34;. If the word should be &#34;system&#34; or &#34;solution&#34;. It does not feel productive and I am not sure if counting the hours spent would actually add up classical &#34;hours wasted&#34; in a typical 10 person &#34;pointless meeting&#34;. And also when usually a piece of writing has some soul of the writer, in these documents they end up being soulless, blank format robotic texts only aiming to convincing the reader to fund your project or sell your idea over others. And that leads to quite an Amazonian culture that is a subject of many different articles.I just felt there was something omitted by OP. So while it has benefits, it does have a cost associated."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Two interesting takeaways:&gt; This is the beautiful thing about having a company that isn&#39;t on the stock market. Imagine you have a company that goes slower and slower every quarter, and then you confront the shareholders with the statement, that the way to solve it, is to do absolutely no new features for a quarter or two, refactor the code, learn new methodologies etc. I doubt that the shareholders would allow that. Luckily, we don&#39;t have any shareholders, and we understand the vital importance of this investment in the long run. Not only in the project, but also in our skill and knowledge, so we do better next time.This is reassuring the notion of what I think actually matters, what the real essence is of developing a product, may that be a piece of art and entertainment (like here) or a productivity tool etc.There are creators and there are consumers. We split them up by developers, designers, domain experts and so on, but what matters is that all the other participants, especially those who can exert power traditionally are not part of the essence and if not being careful and responsible, can easily add complexity and limitations that are entirely accidental and can even be harmful.This reminds me of the agile manifesto, modern UX approaches and other processes that are driven by creators, but are often and very unfortunately being bent over backwards to fit into hierarchical power structures.&gt; TDD actually is the constant fast swithing between extending the tests and making them pass continously. So as you write tests, you write code to satisfy them basically at the same time. This allows you to instantly test what you write, and mainly use tests as specifiation of what the code should acctually do, which guides the thought process to make you think about where you are headed to, and to write code that is more structured and testable from the very beginning.The important notion here is that TDD is not about tests and correctness, but about development. It continuously checks assumptions and explores the surrounding code, state and data until a sufficient solution is found.If we squint a little we can see how closely related TDD with REPL Driven Development is. In essence it is the same thing and even has similar results, where the tests or REPL code can be left as an artifact for further, likely historical understanding.We know now that neither is sufficient for a high degree of correctness, but they are certainly useful for understanding and development."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d be curious to hear what kovarex thinks in 2-3 months.TDD is often sold as a fix-all solution, which is incredibly appealing to mgmt and quite fun for most programmers as a new paradigm, allowing for quick adoption.It also has its uses, especially in the enterprise space where requirements aren&#39;t often clear. But I don&#39;t know many good programmers that truly stick to the dogma after the honeymoon period. It becomes just another tool in your toolset.Uncle bob is a salesman, not a &#34;craftsman&#34;."</p>

Some UI expert might be better able break it down but here is my braindump of some key factors:* at a basic level, generally smooth handling of drawing of a legible map and basic UI functions (esp. compared with some other foss openstreetmap apps, no need to name names :-)* considerably narrows down the map editing options. by presenting controlled choice lists the novice editor feels &#34;safe&#34;* uses simple and innocent gamification (scoreboards, &#34;unlocking&#34; websites etc)There are ofcourse glitches and indeed a keen openstreetmap enthousiast may &#34;outgrow&#34; it relatively quickly but assuming the devs get further support and build on the initial success it could be a reference point for highly usable open source apps targeting larger audiences"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I personally have problems with doors, and stuff that should be locked. I can never be sure I locked properly.Totally did backtrack unreasonable distances just to check if I had closed the door.It&#39;s all fine when it&#39;s my door. Worst case scenario, I get robbed.However it&#39;s more of a problem when it&#39;s someone else&#39;s door. Worst case scenario, they get robbed, and that&#39;s a different story. Or pets get out...Obviously I can&#39;t take the door on my front seat... So my solution is to take a picture of me trying to open the door, a kind of proof that it&#39;s closed.And, would you know it, it works!

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember a panel on a news program years ago where the one guest was a psychologist who was treating &#34;untreatable&#34; drug addicts by getting them &#34;hooked&#34; on running or weightlifting or martial arts.  They would stop drugs but would instead be doing martial arts for hours a day or running 20 miles every morning.  Then he would start treating the addiction personality and causes, but in many cases the patients would just stop coming and live three or more hours of every day in the gym.The other guests were various degrees of horrified.His patients went from literally living on the street as heroin addicts to doing 3 hour gym sessions and holding down a job; and his peers thought he shouldn&#39;t be allowed to practice.Recently I was reading a book on ADHD and the author was quite adamant that you could only be diagnosed with ADHD if your life was worse than  &#34;the norm&#34;.  In this view, if you have symptoms of ADHD but can, for instance, hold down a good job then by definition you don&#39;t have ADHD.  I deleted the book from my Audible account."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve read most of Scott&#39;s blog posts and he rarely mentions OCD and when he does it tends to be &#34;this is what I think people with OCD experience&#34; and not &#34;this is what my patients have told me&#34; which leads me to believe that he is not an expert in OCD.I have OCD and it&#39;s ruined my life in ways that are hard to articulate. Which is why I can point out two good reasons why what&#39;s being described might not be a good idea. First, giving into compulsions just legitimizes them and reinforces the patterns that are central to OCD and can ultimately make things worse. Secondly, OCD has a habit of changing how it manifests. Sure, maybe the woman is no longer bothered by the hairdryer, but what happens when it becomes changes to worrying if the oven is on? She&#39;ll be right back where she started.I doubt that the anecdote actually happened as described. It&#39;s way too contrived, simplistic and borders on &#34;Psychiatrists hate her! Cure your OCD with this one simple trick!&#34;. Realistically, OCD is incredibly insidious and if it were that simple to cure then nobody would have OCD. What&#39;s described is, at best, a short-term fix and half the psychiatrists likely knew that such things rarely stick.I&#39;ve had the same thing happen to me more times than I can count. I think I found the silver bullet, a way to permanently defeat my obsessive thoughts. If I&#39;m lucky then it&#39;ll last a week before my OCD comes back in full force. But the truth is that you cannot directly fight OCD, it&#39;s like squeezing dough. When you clamp down in one spot, it just squirts out somewhere else. There&#39;s a quote that I think describes it perfectly &#34;To hate me is to give me breath, to fight me is to give me strength&#34;. Fighting OCD or giving into its demands is just falling into its traps. You only truly win when you reach a point where you don&#39;t respond to it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I appeciate how Schmidhuber puts focus on non-US-centric history of Deep Learning and modern AI.He sometimes overdoes these. Even when something is not related to Deep Learning and modern AI. He tries to push very narrow and one-sided views without much room for nuance.For example- &#34;Turing used his (quite inefficient) model only to rephrase the results of Gödel and Church on the limits of computability.&#34;He is trying to say that Turing did nothing new, his work is a mere extension of Godel&#39;s (!), and he only accounted for practical computational reality. That is not true.He goes on further by saying, &#34;Later, however, the simplicity of these machines made them a convenient tool for theoretical studies of complexity.&#34; Like, Turing and Church&#39;s work was only good for that. I digress. I believe that Turing&#39;s work is more seminal and paved the way for modern general computers.Another bit here says &#34;The formal models of Gödel (1931-34), Church (1935), Turing (1936), and Post (1936) were theoretical pen &amp; paper constructs that cannot directly serve as a foundation for practical computers.&#34;It is putting the works of Turing, Post, Church, and Godel all together. Like they are the same. I see the logic as they are all impractical, but they are different levels of impractical. Putting them all under one bracket like that makes no sense.I respect Schmidhuber a lot, but some of his behaviour is borderline childish which are more pronounced in his claims about AI history. You should be skeptical about what he says (and what anyone says).Despite all this, I did not know many things written in this article. I learned a lot and had fun reading it.I first read about Zuse in Isaacson&#39;s Innovators book. Did not know that he used a high-level language for a chess program. Fascinating. He is very underrated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How can you leave out von Neumann from such a list?Also, I feel like Schmidhuber tends to be German-speaking-centric.And overall, acknowledging that this is his signature shtick and it&#39;s good to have a voice like this too, he does a lot of anachronistic reinterpretations of early discoveries in light of later results. It streamlines the story as if it was always headed towards the today, culling aspects that didn&#39;t pan out or magnifying aspects that were at the time more minor and not considered the central issue or angle."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I would caution against just jumping into this and trying to be a real ISP if your experience is in software development, sysadmin stuff, or something kind of tech industry adjacent but you&#39;ve never worked for an ISP in a NOC environment, as a junior network engineer or similar for somebody else&#39;s medium to large sized ISP. There&#39;s a lot of missteps that can be made without experience.In general I would recommend thinking of starting a small ISP as a depth and breadth of knowledge base you need to develop, similar to how an apprentice electrician is expected to work under some more senior/experienced persons in their field for a number of years before being able to operate independently.I do not want to discourage anyone but I&#39;ve seen a myriad of &#39;oh my god why did they do that&#39; small WISPs with anywhere from 50 to 1500 customers. Going down the wrong network architecture/topology/business plan path can be very costly later on if you&#39;re 100% learning as you go.Overall I think a site like this is a great idea, but the sheer scope of things that would need to be written down in a wiki-like format for everything to start your own ISP, and what systems/subsystems/technologies you will want to be familiar with, could fill thousands of pages if printed in book form. It&#39;s a gargantuan task to make a website that has everything needed to start an ISP from scratch, assuming the reader hasn&#39;t been involved in somebody else&#39;s ISP operations first."</p>

I wasn&#39;t there at the start, but I ran the thing for 2 years, serving about 200 customers. I wrote the &#34;Internet Installation&#34; floppy disks that people used to install networking on Windows 3.1, and configured dialup icons on their desktop. I was the ONLY technical support they had.I learned that people don&#39;t use the same words we technical folks do, so if you get a support call and ask &#34;Have you installed anything?&#34; the answer they give is no, but, if you ask &#34;do you have any new programs or stuff&#34;, the answer will be yes.Why? - My theory is that they either didn&#39;t know what &#34;installing&#34; was (nobody opened up the computer to put something in), or they themselves didn&#39;t do it.You have to have a very strong ability to route around the person on the other end of the phones preconceptions of the world and get the right answers anyway.If you&#39;re going to be an ISP, you&#39;re going to be on call 24/7/365, and you&#39;re going to see weird shit.

We start out OK with bytes being distinct, but by the end we&#39;re talking about how a character is made out of several characters. If we think in terms of code points (Rust&#39;s native char type actually provides here a slightly different thing, a Unicode Scalar Value, which certain types of code point are not, but close enough) clearly a code point isn&#39;t made out of several code points, so we needed a different word.I like squiggle, if you&#39;re a text rendering engine you might want to use &#34;glyph&#34; although you might already need that word for something else.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I see a lot of people in the comments describe triplebyte as a “market leader” and discuss how good they are. I can’t believe how gullible everyone is especially on a startup forum. Let me spell it out to y’all, nobody pivots and changes their entire business model if they are crushing it. So the implication is that triplebyte are not crushing it. So, this probably has gone the same way as lots of other tech startups. They’ve raised a bunch of money spent it all on ads , distorted the market for a while (usually just the advertising market) and now are on the way out. No matter what fluff or spin they put on it, that’s what’s happening."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"By far the most exciting thing about this announcement is this feature: &#34;Detailed information on what a recruiter did with your application.&#34;I&#39;ve been wishing for something like this for years. Especially for early-career engineers or people from non-traditional backgrounds, this is insanely valuable because it helps you to know avoid wasting time on applications that will never go anywhere; avoid typing in your resume, line by line, into another form after already submitting your pdf. Avoid writing a cover letter to a job that&#39;s already been filled. Avoid applying to a posting that&#39;s really just out there for a company to &#34;gauge&#34; interest, not for filling a real role.If an application is rejected, fine. But getting a follow-up request 7 months after submitting a resume into a black hole is ridiculous, and I think any system that decreases the information asymmetry between the applicant and the employer that allows people to intelligently approach their career search is going to be tapping into something truly valuable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A benefit of Triplebyte to big enterprises not mentioned in Triplebyte’s discussion here: acting as engineering assessment proxy for engineering hiring managers stuck with pathologically risk averse enterprise HR departments.Often enterprise HR is paranoid of honestly evaluating anyone for anything, to the point that many HR teams tell one another and engineering hiring managers that it’s “illegal” to assess candidate abilities on the way in the door, at all.If you think about joining a dev team where no one checked if any candidate could FizzBuzz, you can imagine the workplace environment that can end up with.Triplebyte is able to provide engineering managers with a stack of pre-vetted resumes so an enterprise can interview by its lowest common denominator HR policies, while still having a prayer a team will at least be made of candidates who can code.The value of this to an enterprise stuck in this position is hard to overstate.Hopefully along with expanding the talent pool per this post, Triplebyte can figure out a way to get well paid for this ability to help land actual coders on actual dev teams despite enterprise HR.The need for this is huge.// I see a comment below from a Triplebyte PM about score matching: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27542621 … That would be slick: land candidates that genuinely raise the bar, but aren’t so far ahead as to be speaking a foreign language to the team.  Of course, this would require also assessing the target team, and oops, we’re right back up against that HR policy…"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a former felon, I&#39;ve learned first-hand the fallout from being named in crime stories. The AP has it right in that a lot of it isn&#39;t realized by readers or society.Upon being charged with crimes, I had to make my way through the court system. As a consequence of my actions, the courts punished me. Once I had showed that I was not a serial offender but instead someone who had moments of weakness, lost identity, and subsequently poor judgement, the courts let me go.Once I paid my debts to the court — figuratively and literally — I was free to live my life without the government watching over my shoulder or further being a burden to my future. My dealings with them had a fixed amount of time attached to it. Once that time limit expired, I was free.Society was far less kind, and hardly as forgiving.No, I&#39;m not talking about employment — I am and always have been very gainfully employed. No, I&#39;m not talking about renting an apartment, or getting a loan, or opening a bank account.I&#39;m talking about new acquaintances.As we have seen over the past 5 years, in the minds of many a website is a single source of truth. To a large number of people, simply having a website is enough to give confidence to the reader that what&#39;s written is an absolute and authoritative source. It is only correct, completely unbiased, and contains 100% factual sourcing.When there&#39;s a webpage with dirty laundry on it, it rarely gets updated to say &#34;later, Judge Judy found suspect to be of good character, and they&#39;ve since paid their debts to the court.&#34;No, it just has absolute worst moment on repeat, leaving out all the context and any depth that goes into a legal proceeding. It&#39;s entirely the worst part of a nightmare.I&#39;ve personally had a number of articles written in addition to a 15-second segment on the local evening news. Getting a call from a partner who is sobbing, &#34;my parents Googled you.&#34; is absolutely stomach-turning. Knowing my little sister had to go to school the day after the clip played next day was something I am more ashamed about than I can put into words. Thankfully she was too young for a cell phone and social media was still in its infancy.My partner very privy to my dirty laundry. When they first learned of it they were actually surprised. It didn&#39;t bother them though as they knew who I was as a person and that my days of making mistakes were behind me.Their parents were less understanding. They didn&#39;t know me like my partner did. They just saw a series of mugshots and some local news articles from mistakes I made as a young adult.It wasn&#39;t the first and it wasn&#39;t the last time it happened, either.I have always been transparent and forthcoming with mistakes I&#39;ve made. I&#39;m just as candid with friends as I am here on HN. Hell, my profile even says I&#39;m a former felon!One point does not make a pattern. Many minor crime stories are just a point. That point, on the internet, is a scar, and those who come across them out of curiosity, suspicion, or nosiness re-open the wound.Since my bad decisions, I&#39;ve had success in contacting the authors of the articles highlighting my worst-moment-kept-in-a-non-governmental-database asking if they&#39;d consider removing their article. I mentioned I had completed probation and was doing something with my life, and that the article was hurting me and my relationships with people. They obliged.Edit: This isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve mentioned I&#39;m a felon in a comment. I&#39;ve received a surprising number of emails over the years from other felons (or felons-to-be) asking &#34;how did you reintegrate into society?&#34; or &#34;do you have any advice?&#34;. If you&#39;re one of them and reading this, you&#39;re more than welcome drop me an email."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an interesting (and confounding) topic.On a corollary note, Austin recently experienced a mass shooting in a popular Downton area. 14 people were shot. One died. Another is paralyzed. The local paper of record explicitly declined to publish the description of the suspects as released by the police so as to not &#34;perpetuate stereotypes&#34;. The question I have is, what is the obligation to report the facts of a story, regardless of consequence? My belief is that reporting should report all the facts and let the chips fall where they may. But I also understand that reasonable people can disagree. (In this case, it seemed unreasonable to me as one shooter was still at large.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My interpretation of their intent is they will no longer name suspects in &#34;florida man&#34; style stories. Like, really, nobody needs to know that it was specifically 30 year old resident Pimble McGringleberry who lives on 1234 S Main St, nowheresville, arkansas was the lady who was throwing office chairs off the top of the target parking structure.The person is presumably dealing with the aftermath of whatever caused them to be in the news in the first place. There is no reason to give internet users a rope, or 6 lines by the hand of the person to hang them with.I think this is a positive move and hope to see more of it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had really bad nausea and pain, went to my doctor, who said I likely had a kidney stone, and the next step was to get an MRI. I was between jobs with no insurance and few funds, so I asked what it cost. The doctor had someone in his office call the hospital and got a quote for $1,500. I got the MRI knowing only that.A month later I got a bill for $3,500. I drove out to the hospital (2 hours) to ask wtf. They didn&#39;t help at all, wouldn&#39;t budge.So I went home and wrote them a check for $1,500, marked as paid in full, with a cover letter explaining my side of it. It worked. They cashed the check and I never heard another word. I&#39;ve done further business there with no problem. It&#39;s well worth pushing back."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I did some research into this for my current employer and the challenges are pretty well laid out here: the penalties are minimal ($300 / day or $~110,000 per year), the data is kept in the invoice or billing systems, which are complex, and the hospitals do not want to share the truly groundbreaking data, which is the per-provider costs.In addition, when you Google for competitors you don&#39;t find a lot of them, but once you start looking at hospital websites you find that quite a few of them (about 50% of the ones I looked at) have at least a partial solution, often provided by their analytics company as an add-on or footnote.It does not appear there is a great market opportunity here unless the penalties increase (which the CMS has talked about vaguely, but hospitals are already asking for relief until after the pandemic)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My wife is trying to work on price transparency at her practice by offering bundled rates for the surgery she does. She has worked with all the various providers - anasthesia, pathology, the hospital etc to come up with a cash rate that she publishes on her website for the surgery. Most of the parties are very open to it but also extremely worried about outliers. Patients that end up costing 10x what was expected due to complications.
For her this is a minuscule risk, but in her negotiations it has been their main worry."</p>

    Tor as an OS-level feature may not spark the best reaction. It&#39;s been given a bad name (&#34;deep web,&#34; silk road, etc) in mass media and many people don&#39;t understand it enough to think of it as anything other than bad.
    I think that it&#39;d be cool to have, but I don&#39;t think that Apple would ever implement it.

        jameshart on Oct 8, 2015 [–]

        Agree, it&#39;s phenomenally unlikely, but then again there is a part of me which could actually imagine Apple doing something like it. They wouldn&#39;t use Tor, of course, they&#39;d build a proprietary equivalent, and then come out on a black stage to &#39;introduce Apple Undercover, a revolutionary enhancement to personal network privacy and security&#39;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Props to Apple for the design of this service. It doesn&#39;t hit all the privacy targets that long-time personal VPN users might be looking for, and it doesn&#39;t get into the game of trying to circumvent region locked content*, but otherwise it&#39;s likely to be a solid privacy improvement for almost all users in a careful and deliberate way.I use a VPN for other reasons (downloading Ubuntu ISOs mostly) but I&#39;ll probably turn this on and leave it running on all my devices because of how transparent it appears to be. I trust Apple&#39;s onion-routing design more than I trust my VPN provider not to log things.* I&#39;m actually glad they don&#39;t try to get around region locks. I consume a lot of BBC content and live in the UK. I&#39;m constantly struggling with my VPNs (with UK endpoints) being blocked because others outside the UK could be using them. It would be nice if the BBC didn&#39;t block like this, but UK residents do typically pay for the content whereas those outside the UK are unable to."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been trying to point this out to people but YouTube personalities have a louder voice than anyone else so you end up with bad information.Props to Apple for offering an (albeit low entropy) onion router on their own infrastructure.  I can&#39;t imagine this is going to win them any friends in government circles but it&#39;s definitely a step in the right direction.I&#39;d also really like to see Apple come clean about the iCloud backup encryption debacle.  A lot of people are trusting it to be something it&#39;s not and it should really be clarified on-device what it is and is not before opting in."</p>

It&#39;s definitely interesting to see it has been used thousands of times on GitHub, and who knows how many more in proprietary code.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s buggy, but I now think it could definitely be improved.I think this shows an example of a big problem with StackOverflow compared to its initial vision.  I remember listening to Jeff and Joel&#39;s podcast, and hearing the vision of applying the Wikipedia model to tech Q&amp;A.  The idea was that answers would continue to improve over time.For the most part, they don&#39;t.  I&#39;m not quite sure if it&#39;s an issue of incentives or culture.  Probably some of both.  I think that having a person&#39;s name attached to their answer, along with a visible score really gives a sense of ownership.  As a result, other people don&#39;t feel enabled to come along and tweak the answer to improve it.Then, once an answer is listed at the top, it is given more opportunity for upvotes, so other improved answers don&#39;t seem to bubble up.  This is a larger issue with most websites that sort by ratings.  Generally they sort items based on the total number of votes, including hacker news itself.  Instead, to measure the quality of an item, we should look at the number of votes, divided by the number of views.  It may be tough to measure the number of views of an item, but we should be able to get a rough estimate based on the position on a page, for example.If the top comment on a HN discussion is getting 100 views in a minute and 10 upvotes, but the 10th comment down gets 20 views and 5 upvotes, the 10th comment is likely a better quality comment.  It should be sorted above the top ranked comment!  There would still need to be some smoothing and promotion of new comments to get them enough views to measure their quality as well.Such a policy on StackOverflow would also help newer, but better answers sort to the top."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; return String.format(&#34;%.1f %sB&#34;, bytes / Math.pow(unit, exp), pre);As a human, the first thing that I hate about this interpretation of &#34;human readable&#34; format is inconsistency in the number of significant digits. One digit after decimal separator is simply wrong, as when you jump from 999.9 MB to 1.0 GB you go from 4 significant digits to 2, instead it should be 1.000 GB, 10.00 GB and so on. This annoys me enormously when I upload things to Google Drive from Android phone and look at the number of data transferred as as soon it becomes bigger than 1 GB digits stop changing and I become anxious that it stopped the transfer and my Windows Phone nostalgia jumps over the roof (as WP was never infected with this problem by virtue of not using Java, and OneDrive on WP explicitly showed current connection speed, and frozen connection never caused any strange problems with uploaded files like it does on Google Drive on Android).As a human not from US, the second thing I hate here is lack of locale parameter to pass to formatter as decimal separator is different in different cultures, and in the world of cloud computing the locale of the machine where the code is run is often different from the one where the message is displayed.As a human from a culture using non latin alphabet, the third thing I hate here should be obvious for a reader."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Excerpt from the abstract:&#34;This paper presents the first publicly available cryptanalytic attacks on the GEA-1 and GEA-2 algorithms.&#34;[..]&#34;This unusual pattern indicates that the weakness is intentionally hidden to limit the security level to 40 bit by design.&#34;So in other words: GPRS was intentionally backdoored."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At the time when digital cellular was first designed, the main objective was to design sufficiently strong authentication to stem the rampant theft of service then occurring on the analog cellular systems. In the US this was estimated at roughly $2 billion/annum.Encrypting traffic for privacy purposes was less important. Prior analog cellular telephony systems were unencrypted, as were analog and digital wireline services. Thus, the privacy cryptography was intended to be strong enough to make it a little more inconvenient/expensive to eavesdrop on digital cellular than it was on analog cellular or wireline services without significantly impeding law enforcement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"All of the GSM algorithms were weak, and deliberately so. It is well known that the French wanted it that way, while the German side wanted a bit more safety on account of the ongoing Cold War. So compromises like the infamous A5 algorithm were created whose security was mainly based on the algorithm itself being kept a secret - the cardinal sin of cryptography."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a European, living in Europe, developing software. Lack of imagination is not our problem. It&#39;s so good that we supply our best talent to the US where it does extremely well revolutionizing AI, designing hardware for Apple, developing games, stream online music, etc. E.g. Amazon&#39;s CTO is Dutch. Basically the person that has been running AWS. The people and the education system are fine.Europe does have a few issues that make it unnecessarily hard to build successful startups here. People do start companies here but more often than not success is followed by US investment and before you know it the company is headquartered in the US. There are many reasons for that but a big one has to be that raising similar amounts of money in Europe is super hard. Investors drag their heels, founders have to take on more risk, etc.A second reason is simply that the US as a big homogeneous market is a nice one to tackle for European companies as well. And often that means having a (big) presence in the US. The EU is basically many markets unified by really complex rules, bureaucracy, etc. There is free traffic of people but companies have a harder time dealing with local variations in legislation, hurdles for billing and taxation (e.g. VAT), banking, bureaucracy, etc.That&#39;s much less of a thing in the US (though it is a bit of a thing there too between states). And that&#39;s before you consider language and cultural differences. Simply put, the same company in the EU will have a very hard time growing compared to doing that in the US. Being successful in the US market, means having the deep pockets to go international. Doing the same from a small country means you barely have enough to expand to another small country. Going international is hard work. Not something you do with your MVP. It&#39;s not very scalable either: you need to worry about cultural differences, bureaucracy, localization, understanding the local market, ramping up sales, marketing, etc. Especially with SAAS companies this is super expensive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I take offense at such massive overgeneralizations as &#34;Europe lacks imagination.&#34;What it lacks is freely flowing funding such that risky enterprises can be funded even if 1 out of ten or 1 out of hundred actually are successful. This kills business models which cannot show any profit whatsoever, and a large portion of the remainder are killed by data regulations forbidding &#34;alternate paths of monetization&#34; (to put it charitably.)Rather, a problem is that once a European project becomes successful enough, it soon becomes an American project, either by acquisition or by moving to where the investment money is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This problem will never get fixed. The author forgot to mention in depth the main reason why EU isn&#39;t even in the game: culture.In order to be innovative and compete, we need very flexible working laws, people with a big growth mindset, a less relaxing lifestyle and AMBITIOUS people.A lot of third world countries are years ahead of the whole EU continent in that aspect. I say this because I live in Europe for the quality of life, come from a third world country, and I see how kids and adults are spoiled here. Much of what they have was just given to them. At least for the strong countries in west EU, lifestyle is very relaxed and any ambitious is frowned upon, it is extremely demotivating, not to mention bureaucracy. Corporations and regulations will just drive your small company out of the market no matter what.I find for me more likely to save some money, move to my country and create my own business and sell in Europe. People here are too lazy to compete in the fast world we live in, there in my country there is so many skilled people, so little capital, here is the reverse. Good amount of capital and foreigners working in tech. For instance, I live in Berlin and almost all the &#34;working people&#34; from tech companies here are foreigners. Germans are generally the executives and/or management. It is quite rare to find a german software developer on Startups.I personally think(my opinion, not the ultimate truth)... that Europe is definitely a very interesting market for companies to come here and sell their stuff, but not to make it.Instead I think Europe should focus on its strengths, which is healthy market regulations, creating a good playing field for companies from above, rather on its weaknesses. It should also figure out a way to keep part of the profits inside the continent to benefits its inhabitants.More important than competing is to know where and when to compete."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My first job out of college was at a magazine. The two editors there were in their 70s and notorious for being bullies (although for what it&#39;s worth, one of them mellowed out after their editorial assistant committed suicide). There wasn&#39;t a day when I wasn&#39;t yelled at repeatedly, and the taint seeped down, with everybody lower down the rung yelling at anybody below them.  It was easily the most toxic environment that I&#39;ve ever experienced, and I&#39;ve worked in academia! People were breaking down in tears all the time. Ex editorial assistants would send in letters written in crayon from insane asylums. The funny thing was that instead of resenting their tormenters, most people adopted a very protective stance towards these editors, as if they were children. Sadly, the impression that I got was that a lot of other publications had similar problems--smart but extremely neurotic bosses who regularly demeaned their employees. This was in 2000, around the time when &#34;The Devil Wears Prada&#34; came out. The one upside was that it permanently scared me out of publishing, which turned out to be an excellent career choice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m very sorry to hear that Matthew Butterick had some bad experiences.  He&#39;s been a brilliant and energetic contributor to the Racket community.  Clearly, something went wrong.For what it&#39;s worth (looking at some of the comments from people not very familiar), my own experiences with Matthias Felleisen have been positive.  (I started contributing to what was then called PLT Scheme around 2000, have had lunch with him twice, and a few times over the years have had some mutually-candid conversations with him, about concerns affecting the project/community.)While I might describe Matthias as a freethinker and straight-talker, everything I&#39;m aware of that he&#39;s said or done in the two decades I&#39;ve been around seems to come from altruistic intentions.I know Matthias cares about the community.  (He was very welcoming when I started, and we&#39;ve discussed it over the years.)  I think he&#39;ll want to personally investigate and consider what happened that resulted in alienating Matthew B., and try to correct any problems that he can.This isn&#39;t just about Matthew B., but also about constantly seeing how we can be the best community for everyone.  That&#39;s not a solved problem, and I suggest it&#39;s best approached as an ongoing process of humility, honesty, and support -- everyone feeling safe to raise concerns/problems, and everyone feeling safe to examine how we can improve."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve followed Racket and the OP&#39;s work from a distance for some time.  This post rang bells for me, based on similar interactions with a few bad apples over about twenty years in the field of physics.I applaud the poster for the clear and measured language of his post,  for his bravery in calling out this kind of behavior, and for taking steps needed to remove himself from the situation. I hope the Racket community takes steps to eliminate the problem at the root."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really like the idea of this. Some thoughts:1. It&#39;s difficult for me to tell which spaces are open for play and which aren&#39;t -- the border is hard to parse. (Is that this cell&#39;s border, or the adjacent cell?) This isn&#39;t really an issue during placement, but it is an issue for signalling that a cell has been &#34;captured,&#34; which is hard for me to tell.2. Hexagon grid is absolutely the right call. :)3. The influence mechanic is very opaque: it&#39;s very hard for me to predict what will happen next, which makes me feel like I&#39;m playing a little &#34;intuitively,&#34; instead of planning out my moves with intention. Some way to see &#34;this is the current state and this will be the next state&#34; would help with that, but I think as long as influence is a continuous quantity it&#39;s going to be difficult to visualize and predict.4. Making the board itself hexagonal (ala Hexxagon) will give you an odd number of cells, preventing ties. Might also be nice to smooth out cell-strength discontinuities around the top and bottom edges.5. Balancing the first-player advantage by making the first move a &#34;weak stone&#34; was very confusing to me, because an adjacent move by player two will &#34;capture&#34; my initial stone with a single stone of theirs. I didn&#39;t understand this until I saw your comment about it here. I think the pie rule would work well in this game, but it&#39;s hard for me to reason about since edge moves are offensively weaker but defensively stronger... I&#39;m not sure how well it would shake out, if you haven&#39;t tried it already.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_rule"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi, a couple of comments.First, I understand you were trying to make an approachable presentation, but the rules as you presented them are incomplete (how does influence work? what is a &#34;threshold&#34;?), and I think for a board game that&#39;s a big mistake. What makes games like those cool is that rules work deterministically, even for games that involve randomness. Having to guess the rules is something I actively dislike.Second, have you considered a square board instead of an hexagonal one? Using Go terminology, it feels like the groups have too many liberties.Other than that, the game is pretty good. I feel it captures the attack/defense territory-based gameplay of Go perfectly.Have you tried to measure the first move advantage?edit: Wow this thing is a drug. Hard AI is deceptively good, I managed to tie a game 25-25 after several attempts, but you definitely can&#39;t afford to be sloppy if you want to stay afloat!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At the end of every turn, each tile influences its neighbors and imparts some of its color. Tiles with a dark border can no longer be selected.The rules are simple but it takes awhile to master. What is your best score against the Hard AI? I got 27 (me on green) – 23 (AI).Would you want to see some sort of match-making to play against others online?See demo gameplay or view the source code at https://github.com/jawslouis/Influence-Game"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s great to allow your kids to take risks, and we do this with our own as much as we can (they&#39;re 1 and 3, so &#34;within reason&#34; is still doing some heavy lifting. I pick ticks off of them now and then and patch up their share of bruises).But fundamentally, what I want most is to be somewhere my kids can ride bikes or walk alone to school, to friends, to the shop, etc. from the age of 7 or so. As best I can tell that pretty much means the Netherlands, parts of Denmark, or perhaps Japan (more for transit than cycling).Children can&#39;t drive, which means unless you&#39;re lucky enough to live very close to your friends, and ideally on the same side of the street, your home is effectively your prison in the US and Canada.And yes, I suppose you _can_ let your kid ride a bike to school alone in the US at 7, but you would be risking arrest, and death. It&#39;s often forgotten that drivers are, by far, the leading killers of children. Far more than people with guns. I was an avid cyclist in the US for the first 30 years of my life and I still have a bruised rib and too many memories of very, very close calls with death.NotJustBikes, who moved from Canadian suburbia to the Netherlands, explores this in more depth at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul_xzyCDT98"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the problem &#34;de-risking&#34; childhood is only an instance of the bigger problem of what Roger Scruton calls &#34;Risk De-aggregation&#34;. Risk Deaggregation is taking a single point of risk (and its associated metric), and optimizing to reduce that risk as if it exists in isolation from other risks. I.e. Risk occurs in aggregate, not as individual threats. Risk deaggregation happens everywhere from Climate Change policy, to Covid, to children.I think this type of risk deaggregation arises from the fact that in a sufficiently complicated space (climate, economy, children, etc) there are really only two heuristics:1) Ignore all but a manageable number of variables and optimize for them2) Recognize a larger number of necessary variable, acknowledge there is no optimal solution, and balance the trade offs between those variables. [0]Heuristic 1 is the easiest, requires no nuance, and seems the type of thing our political and media class love to latch onto. Heuristic 2 actually requires admitting you don&#39;t get everything you want, or at least the things you want will cost you something you dont.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve got five kids. The more I loosen up and let the kids take risks and learn for mistakes the better. The challenge is when the adults inject a ridiculous level of risk to something that should be a learning experience. For example, allowing police to arrest and charge a child for bad behavior at school (i.e. won&#39;t obey the teacher, outbursts - not for actually criminally violent behavior). Another is lifetime academic and other records. When risk is too high, learning stops and risk avoidance takes over."</p>
