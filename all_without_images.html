								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nat was a great CEO. The best that could have happened to Github after the acquisition IMO.The one time that I won&#39;t forget about Github under Nat, was when they stood up for Iranian developers [1]. They went the extra distance to get a permission/license from the US government specially to offer full Github to developers from Iran. Many other companies didn&#39;t do something similar.[1]: https://github.blog/2021-01-05-advancing-developer-freedom-g..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most people probably say this just to be like “I know Nat, look at me.” I don’t know how to phrase this to avoid that:Nat is an incredible person. I’ve been lucky to get to know him over the past couple months. Not only is he super chill, but he’s also not afraid to ask basic questions. Many of you might roll your eyes at that, but it’s a real problem: when you’re organizing something, you feel pressured to know everything, or else you’ll lose people’s confidence. So all the people who try to act confident also rarely ask basic questions.Hackers are the opposite. We’re always focused on breaking down problems into the most basic components, and then building up complexity once we understand the system.When Nat reached out to me, I didn’t know what to expect. But I certainly didn’t expect him to be a fellow hacker that happened to be famous. I think it’s incredible that someone can go so long without losing that spirit — imagine suddenly having a boatload of money. Most of us would probably take things easier.Another surprise is how incredibly chill he is. When things go seriously wrong, he’s totally cool about it, in a way that’s hard to put into words. I learned the phrase “No stress, friend” from him, and I’ve used it a few times to soothe other people. As cliche as it sounds, sometimes it’s the one thing in the world you need to hear.I wish I could tell a certain story to underscore the point, but Nat’s stories are his to tell. I hope he writes a book someday — nothing fancy, just a raw thought stream of all his experiences.And I wish I could share his future ambition. It’s so exciting that I can hardly contain myself. It might not work out, but that’s true of everything.I don’t know if anyone will see this. But I just wanted to write a little note to say how rare Nat is. He actually cares — deeply — and also cares about you. Most leaders don’t.If someone reading this has the opportunity to work with him on his new project, I encourage you to leave your cushy job on that basis alone. It’ll be fun in a way you won’t experience elsewhere."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"No, it is not. Neither is Roblox or Fortnite, or VRchat. A single game or world is NOT the metaverse, what is so hard to understand about that for journalists and companies?The metaverse is the immersive internet, as a successor to our current one that is more 2D oriented around photos/videos/text today. It&#39;s a paradigm shift in how we interact, but most importantly there will be many of these virtual worlds/spaces interconnected together to form an actual network that nobody outright owns. To get to this future, we need protocols/standards to allow virtual worlds to talk to one another and agree that users can hop back in forth between them seamlessly, across all platforms.More specifically, the way we use the web today to navigate from webpage to another is how we we traverse the metaverse. The core problem that needs to get solved right now is interoperability, to enable the &#34;web of 3D&#34;.Look to WebGPU, WebAssembly, and WebXR as cornerstone technologies here. Our startup is building the &#34;3D/VR web&#34; in this way, and our current focus is getting proper HTML5 exporting from the native game engines, currently Unreal Engine. We&#39;re also building out a suite of tooling to empower developers and creators along with our hosting/discovery platform that includes advanced texture compression + asynchronous asset fetching to enable 3D/VR websites that load as quickly as a regular 2D page. If you&#39;re a developer and are interested in our work, you can join our Discord here:https://discord.gg/zUSZ3T8"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“What is so hard for people to understand” says HN commenter: “the metaverse clearly means [my definition of the metaverse] why can’t people see this?!!”Well, Zuckerberg didn’t give a clear definition, the term itself is made up, and it doesn’t currently exist (otherwise, what would we be building?).So no you don’t know what it means or how it will turn out, and neither does Zuckerberg. He might have a vision of what he’d like it to be and how he’s going to make money out of it, but he’s very probably very wrong.It’s obvious a deeply immersive experience will eventually arrive but it seems far from obvious how it will be used, much like predicting the rise of Tik Tok in 1990 based on email and usenet.The best way to predict the future is to make it. Hackers built much of the early internet, so let’s go build the early metaverse and at least make something insanely experimental and magical and beautiful before the next Zuckerberg comes alone and devalues it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Apropos of nothing, I&#39;ll share one of the reasons why I&#39;ve been a loyal customer since 2010. In 2013 I booted up a dormant 2006 Macbook to prep for lending to a friend. Shortly thereafter I received the following email:===Hi Robbie (first name guessed from email address)-This is NOT an automated email, I&#39;m typing this live.
You have the very very last computer on earth running
an ancient version of Backblaze (version 1.5.2.390) that
NO LONGER WORKS (too old, needs updating).You are paying for a service you are not using.
You have two choices:1) Upgrade your Mac OS X 10.5 computer called &#34;rlmmbp&#34;
    to the latest Backblaze.  Just visit our homepage
    and download it and install right over the top of
    what you have already, here is a URL:
    https://secure.backblaze.com/update.htm
    (Will take less than 5 seconds, totally free,
    you are already paying!)2) Do nothing -&gt; in 7 more days I will delete that
     machine&#39;s backup and all of the files in the backup,
     and you will be paying for an unused license.
     (I can provide instructions on how to cancel your
     billing if you need them.)If you have any questions, feel free to contact me
at the email address below:- Brian Wilson

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an interesting moment to reflect on the wacky nature of IPO vs ICO valuations.  Backblaze and Filecoin are, roughly speaking, in the same business (providing bulk file storage).  Backblaze is looking to raise ~$100 million at a valuation of about $0.7 billion.  Filecoin raised $250 million in their ICO, and the coin has a current &#34;market cap&#34; of about $7 billion.  Backblaze owns about 1.8 EiB of storage, Filecoin has about 13 EiB &#34;pledged&#34;, so if you consider those measurements comparable the $ of valuation per EiB is similar.  Businesses generally get valued more on what they bring in than what they own however, and Backblaze takes in ~$65 million/year revenue (~$175K/day).   I&#39;m not entirely clear what would be analogous to revenue for Filecoin, but they &#34;mine&#34; ~330K coins per day, which at current prices is about $21 million (or $7.8 billion per year?).  Now here&#39;s where it gets crazy... based on the current average reward if Backblaze dedicated all of their storage to Filecoin mining they could (theoretically) generate about $2.5 million a day (or $900 million/year, about 13x what they bring in now).Backblaze did look into farming Chia at some point[1], don&#39;t know if they&#39;ve done similar experiments with Filecoin, but it definitely seems like there is a profound disconnect between these two worlds (which could be the result of some other factor, like the USD value of Bitcoin).[1] https://www.backblaze.com/blog/chia-analysis-to-farm-or-not-..."</p>

Why is this option hidden away in &#34;Developer Tools&#34;.The biggest &#34;secret&#34; not mentioned here is keyboard navigation.  It is incredibly cumbersome to operate &#34;Developer Tools&#34; on a small form factor computer without a mouse.Here is one solution: In Chrome&#39;s, F12 to open Developer Tools, then Ctrl-P then type &#34;&gt;&#34;.Then can scroll all available commands using Up/Down or start typing and use autocomplete to search for commands.  Whether this is faster and more effective than pointing+clicking/tapping on tiny screen areas, ticking/unticking tiny check boxes and scrolling around in tiny menus is a question for the reader.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I loved every minute of my time working at Netflix.  Great, talented coworkers who I could constantly learn from, management chain from bottom to top of former engineers, so they understood when you would say, &#34;I worked on this for a week but have no results because it didn&#39;t work&#34;.  Plenty of resources to do what you needed to do, and lots of autonomy to do what you thought was right.  Very little process and upper management actively moved to eliminate what little process there was.  Unlimited vacation time that was real -- management took long vacations to set an example and would actively encourage everyone to do the same.  And of course a great paycheck which included 10%+ raises because they made sure that new people didn&#39;t make more than veterans.I&#39;ll be the first to admit it&#39;s not for everyone.  As they say, they are a sports team, not a family.  Perform well and be rewarded handsomely, perform poorly and get cut with a big check.  I personally thrived in that kind of environment, where you always have to keep proving your value.  But not everyone wants to work that way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve never worked for a big famous tech firm, but I will absolutely tell you how I&#39;ve managed to avoid hating work for 30 years:Find a relatively small firm, still owner-run and controlled. Avoid public firms. A corporation cannot show loyalty, but a HUMAN can. A manager has no real control -- their manager can reverse them. When you work for the owner, you can trust things a bit more IF you&#39;re working for a trustworthy person.This means small. But it doesn&#39;t mean cheap. ;)That said, I&#39;ve probably left money on the table working this way, and I&#39;ll never get IPO stock or similar, but stability and ethical behavior in a workplace go a LONG way."</p>

Yes, we&#39;re hiring.The best thing about the company are the people who are already here. The basic hiring criteria are &#34;clever, competent and kind&#34;. That doesn&#39;t mean we never have disagreements, but they tend to be technical disagreements about the best approach to reach the same goal. Before the pandemic, and hopefully after it, the kitchen was the center of the company: casual questions turned into great discussions, explanations... there&#39;s a big whiteboard wall in the kitchen, and it got used a lot.That goal, incidentally, is to drive down the cost of good portfolio analysis until it&#39;s within everyone&#39;s reach. We&#39;re succeeding: there are clients who have programs where people start their investments with $50/week.Our folks are reasonably diverse in terms of background and talents.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just finished my latest project, building a CNC-machine from scratch using an Arduino Uno, GRBL and 40x 3d-printed parts. It’s able to mill wood and aluminium, up to ~20mm thick.As with all my other projects, I think they should be executed in the open where other people can learn from my mistakes and get inspired to build their own things! Therefore I’ve spend a lot of time writing a free complete tutorial of the build, documenting every step with text and detailed images, creating a complete bill of materials (including STL-files for the 3d-printed parts) etc. I don’t want any dependencies on DIY-websites, so I’ve hosted it on GitHub, where anyone can clone it locally.I built this machine to gain more knowledge about mechanical engineering, electrical wiring, stepper motors, GRBL, CAD, CAM etc. Also, I guess I can build new fun things with the machine? Overly-engineered birdhouses maybe?Setup:* It’s running on an Arduino Uno, CNC-shield and GRBL.* 40 parts are 3d-printed (all the red parts in the video)* It’s based on Ivan Miranda’s blueprints, but I’ve adjusted some parts and structured the bill of materials.* It uses 2x 19:1 geared NEMA17 stepper motors for the Y-axis and 1x for the X-axis. The Z-axis is using a standard NEMA17 motor.* HTD5M belts and pulleys are used for X-axis and Y-axis. GT2 belt and pulleys are used for the Z-axis.If you have any questions, feel free to contact me. You’ll find my email in the top of the guide :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does anyone have suggestions for making a CNC mill that&#39;s quiet enough to run in my apartment?  I&#39;m thinking about getting one of the cheap $250 Aliexpress specials (I only want to mill PCBs), but I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s going to be too loud to run in a building where other people live.  If I can make some performance tradeoff for relative quietness, I&#39;d love to do it.(Maybe it&#39;s as simple as putting it in a foam enclosure or something?  That sounds bad for spindle cooling, though.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d love to have an open source CNC machine to design joinery with http://ma-la.com/tsugite.html
Ideally a whole house and most of the furniture...If anyone has any ideas on how to accelerate build times of open hardware, that&#39;s something I&#39;m trying to solve. Creating high quality instructionals is a huge amount of work and I think instructionals should be automatically generated by computer vision and have interactable elements, ideally AR, but even just highlighting wiring diagrams on hovering would be hugely helpful. Even if things are well documented, replication is still insanely pyrrhic without economy of scale or universal fabrication. It&#39;s time consuming because it&#39;s hard to replicate knowledge/tool environments quickly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This bit really caught my attention:&gt; In contrast, this website runs on an off-the-grid solar power system with its own energy storage, and will go off-line during longer periods of cloudy weather. Less than 100% reliability is essential for the sustainability of an off-the-grid solar system, because above a certain threshold the fossil fuel energy used for producing and replacing the batteries is higher than the fossil fuel energy saved by the solar panels.This, in particular, is an amazing take:&gt; Less than 100% reliability is essential for the sustainability of an off-the-grid solar systemSaying that sacrificing uptime is a good thing for achieving a particular goal is a take that&#39;s so wildly out of line with what most of the industry believes is refreshing, because it really makes you think. What would the world look like, if instead of being obsessed with SRE we simply assumed or accepted that there will be downtime, and treated it like something perfectly normal. Maybe a nice message at ingress/load balancer level, telling everyone that the site will be back in a bit.I have no illusions that any company would want something like that, or that it&#39;s even feasible for many industries, e.g. healthcare, though the Latvian &#34;e-health&#34; system is an accidental experiment of this at the cost of around 15 million euros of taxpayer money: https://www-lsm-lv.translate.goog/raksts/zinas/latvija/par-e... .However, if companies have working hours, why couldn&#39;t websites? What a funny thought.Edit: on an unrelated note, it&#39;s wild how different setups can be.For example:&gt; The web server uses between 1 and 2.5 watts of power...While at the same time, i have two servers with 200GEs (essentially consumer hardware) running in my homelab, with a TDP of 35W each, though with the UPS and its inefficiencies, as well as the 4G router, the total energy consumption that i have to deal with is around 100W. Granted, i also use them for backups and as CI nodes, but there&#39;s still a difference of 20 - 50 times more power usage between one of my servers and one of theirs. I guess one can definitely talk about the differences between x86 and ARM there as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As they describe being open to ideas and feedback: maybe using static compression could help. The concept is to pre-compress files (have foo.html.gz available next to foo.html) so that the web server does not have to compress on-the-fly. nginx supports it[0] and gzip_static does not appear in their nginx config[1].It might not make a difference if nginx has a in-RAM cache of the compressed files. Otherwise, it has the potential to be pretty significant assuming most requests are made using &#34;Accept-Encoding: gzip&#34; and assuming the web server does not prefer other compression algorithms (eg. Brotli).[0]: https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_gzip_static_module.h...[1]: https://homebrewserver.club/low-tech-website-howto.html#full..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The amount of energy wasted due to poor caching strategies alone could power small countries. Made far worse by the current trend to maximize code readability and organization by using as many dependencies as humanly possible for even the simplest of tasks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The way the last administration rolled this out was certainly with a political narrative, but my guess is it originated with people that weren&#39;t thinking at all about politics.The simple story is that core infrastructure is of strategic national importance, and an elevated risk that infrastructure is compromised can never be worth whatever the benefits are of using a particular supplier&#39;s equipment.  There is no practical way to 100% ensure that every piece of software, and every chip, in every piece of equipment is clean.  Chips are especially scary (the push to have domestic chip fab by the US and other countries is about more than just supply chain).This is true when it comes from what are considered trustworthy suppliers as well, but you&#39;re dealing with probabilities.  I think that regardless of whether this move fits into a political narrative about China, or &#34;economic warfare&#34;, the practical basis is that for some types of equipment, the risk is just too large and the ability to mitigate too limited, in general.Unfortunately this was figured out with Huawei/ZTE after the fact, but tbh I don&#39;t think the specific company matters at all, it just happened to be they were in this business at the time &amp; based in the wrong country."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"ANSSI, the French agency for information systems security, has severely tightened authorizations for vital infrastructure. Though Huawei is still kosher in many network functions, French telcos have had to remove a few thousand nodes they had already deployed, especially in network cores. All authorizations are temporary - between three and eight years.This is not just about security in a narrow definition, but in a large part about ensuring that mastery of strategic functions remains with European firms.Like armaments, telecommunication infrastructures are not a normal market."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I could put on my conspiracy hat... Perhaps this is related to Canada&#39;s detention of he Huawei executive. Someone put their foot down and said Chinese hardware is spying on us, and perhaps they forced China to give up how.At it&#39;s core, the world absolutely cannot trust China. Because Huawei is a de facto company owned by the Chinese government, it stands to reason that the distrust must be extended to Huawei. The product may be good, but China has very little credibility anymore, and should absolutely not be trusted."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thank you, whomever did this!  I asked for it in a comment recently.This video basically is making fun of a common situation of Google at the time, where a person wants to serve up some data for analytics, but the sysadmins expect the person to follow a process intended for much more complex and high availability services run by teams of skilled engineers.It parodies SRE as a BOFH sysadmin, even though in general SRE are quite easygoing and helpful.It helped poked fun at a number of overly stuffy processes and also helped push people to make hosting modest datasets (like this 5TB one) easier."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Background: https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2021/10/30/5tb/This video was hugely influential on changing the way Google does internal tools and operations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a Googler, it&#39;s often easier for me to setup a GCP consumer account, AWS, or Heroku account to demo something, compared to using anything internal. I remember the most annoying situation was like 10 years ago when me and other engineers ported Quake 2 to run in Chrome, we were in a time crunch to demo it multiplayer, and I ended up setting up an AWS account to serve it. But then I left it running and forgot and ended up getting a few hundred dollars billed to me because the Quake2 server was chewing CPU."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is really cool.  I&#39;m 30 right now, and only just recently finished my bachelors and have been looking to get a PhD, but it&#39;s really hard to find a program that will let you work full time while doing it. It doesn&#39;t help that a part of me does sort of feel &#34;too old&#34; to do this sometimes.  The PhD system in the US is really tailored around the assumption that you haven&#39;t entered the corporate world yet.Anyway, it&#39;s really inspiring that someone almost three times my age pushed himself through the program. I guess it&#39;s important to remember that you really shouldn&#39;t give up on your dreams."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is very inspiring. I too am young and been in the work force for several years, but unlike the other comments in this thread I am
not settled down as an older student returning to school.I am willing to give up a high paying salary to return back to school as a PhD student and I am
not tied down with a mortgage or anything else.I find mathematics simply too interesting to not learn at the highest level. Working in industry will simply not teach me the material I want to learn. I’m considering going back for either a  PhD in Math or a math heavy PhD in CS. I read math textbooks for fun and worked with tutors to ensure my proofs are done correctly. I can do this for hours on end without external motivation. I taught myself a lot of math and can see myself doing this as a career. I want to do research.Most people my age say the same things in the comment sections in this thread (tied down to a mortgage, make too much money to return). I’m glad generalizations like these don’t apply to me and can’t wait to get back to school"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a university student in my last year of undergrad, I&#39;ve been tempted to go work as a software engineer, even though I&#39;m interested in doing research. The opportunity cost just seems too large to give up. Working as a SWE will allow me to earn a massive income in my 20s, during which I have few defendants and a lot of leisure time. While many of my peers are planning to do graduate school right away, I feel like my quality of life would simply be better by going to work in industry right now.With that said, I still love learning and diving deeply into topics like math and the history of science. I hope that I can one day retire off my savings as a SWE and return to graduate school (maybe in my late 30s or 40s). Has anyone done this before? Is there a stigma against graduate students (both Masters and PhD) who are not in their 20s?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A lot of the engineering math associated with splines (NURBs) and surface approximations came from Citroen, Peugeot and Renault, the car makers, in the mid-20th century. I read a great book on this back in the 80&#39;s and can&#39;t remember the name. It was about the early days of CAD and its origins.Like, the control points on splines were called &#34;ducks&#34;, which were weights attached to spring steel suspended from the ceiling of the studio, which caused the steel to bend into particular shapes computed mathematically beforehand by the design engineers. These curves were used to guide model making. It was a fascinating book."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I did this after seeing this before on HN. There were a few processes that were manual that benefitted from the technique in the article.Learn from my folly: I even called them “do nothing scripts,” referencing this article. However; I was judged by peers for not writing the full automation versions as they didn’t appreciate the idea of gradual automation (programmer hubris?). Saying “do nothing scripts” in meetings did catch the awkward attention of leadership.As a description, “do nothing” communicates a lot. As a brand, “do nothing” can use some improvements.My short prescription of turning “do nothings” into “do some things” into “do all the things” didn’t help. We had some new people join the team and they had fun turning the do nothing scripts into a document. * Sigh *I still build these type of process description scripts still. I usually don’t advertise them to peers until they do some of the things nowadays."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My experience in corporate IT convinced me that even if an entire release could be automated down to a single press of a giant red button (and even if undoing the release could be another, single button), then culturally our organization would still figure out a way to turn the pressing of that button into a six hour ordeal requiring the participation of twelve people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The idea here can be generalized to a primitive programming construct: The magic function &#34;wish&#34;, which can do anything you want, just give it a string description.For example:    wish(&#39;copy these files to this host&#39;, files, host)

You can augment this further by allowing the program to specify a return type from the wish, and magically the wish will produce the type you want. So for example:    data = wish(Path, &#39;the path of the data files I need&#39;)

Of course, the wish is actually implemented by sending a request to some human user. In my &#34;wish&#34; library for Python http://rsyscall.org/wish/ you can have a stack of handlers for wishes, just like exception handlers.  If later you want to automate some wish, you can specify a handler which intercepts certain wishes and forwards the other ones on (by wishing again, just like an exception handler can re-raise)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Super frustrated by the state of videos for kids on youtube, especially in the arts and crafts department, i decided to launch  a channel and start creating my own content. Basically, all videos start half decent but for some reason end in a big noisy mess, weird sounds, spoiling food, questionable product placements, zero creativity and always incentivize more watching and trapping viewers in the infinite ‘next video’ loop.Instead, one of the goals for my videos will be to take a step back and inspire to create, zero commercial interest, not too much distractions and something parents can trust.Still in the process of figuring out all the parameters, camera, editing, setup etc but its a lot of fun learning new skills. I have a million ideas for the content already so enough work to be done. If there is little to no ‘success’ in terms of viewers, i really don’t care since i enjoy all aspects of it and im building a nice catalog of creative videos to watch with my kid later. I have no public videos yet (coming very soon) but here are two samples of what to expect:https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_3e0tawk45Ehttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mBZStuxOUlc"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hah this thread is perfect. I just finished building my new four axis robot arm design. It’s all open source. Three months ago I started playing with a new planetary gearbox concept, where the first stage is in the middle with second stages on both sides. The first sun is driven by a shaft that goes through a hole in the second stage sun. The result is a very balanced joint design with parallel outputs. A good configuration for weak materials like plastic. And then the gearboxes and the frame are all integrated together, so this is not something where you assemble a gearbox and bolt it to the frame. The gearbox members and the frame members are unified.I’m very happy with it so far! Video here:https://twitter.com/tlalexander/status/1455320442642714625?s...It’s open source, CC0 licensed. Please fork the design files here!https://cad.onshape.com/documents/d663661f8c0c34e7a29bbfa6/w...EDIT: you may prefer to watch the project and wait to fork it until I have fleshed out a few more things. In that case feel free to star this git repo and I will update it as I make progress.https://github.com/tlalexander/brushless_robot_arm/"</p>

The article itself says that Truth Social is &#34;antithetical&#34; to Mastodon&#39;s values, but that there&#39;s nothing they can do about the usage of their software other than license violations. It sounds like they have a bias to enforce their license in this case.If Mastodon has a weak history of enforcing their license to other organizations, does it weaken the case? I&#39;m wondering if selective enforcement in the software-licensing world hurts the authority or credibility of a license, in the eyes of the law.My wondering was somewhat inspired by the way Nintendo aggressively polices the appearance of its video game trademarks on places like YouTube and basically the rest of the internet. I hear an argument is that if they don&#39;t aggressively enforce their trademark policing, their legal position wouldn&#39;t be as strong if they want to pursue a big violation in the future."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"General grumpiness about this particular design decision aside, it appears that since the T2 Macs, the main SSD was being used to store core system firmware. On T2 I think it&#39;s BridgeOS that sends the EFI image to the Intel side to boot it, and it does the firmware verification and loading.This setup has a benefit; namely, it is now impossible to brick the system with a bad BIOS/EFI flash, and you&#39;ll never need to use a hardware SPI flasher to recover. Just like the iPhone, you can enter Boot ROM DFU mode, which can&#39;t easily be overwritten, and restore all of the firmware on the system that&#39;s writable.This is great for restoring systems to a known good firmware state, including SSD, EFI, BridgeOS, RecoveryOS. On a normal system, there is plenty of non volatile storage that is difficult to recover or reset.The primary argument against soldering the SSD, or really any other part, down like this tends to be that &#34;Oh, now you can&#39;t just save money by upgrading it yourself|replacing it when it breaks&#34;. On the other side, these machines are engineered as appliances that should achieve a certain degree of reliability. The SSD is reasonably considered to last the &#34;lifetime&#34; of the product, and should it fail, I don&#39;t consider the inability to externally boot to be a huge problem, since whatever failure damaged the SSD is statistically likely to compromise the reliability of the rest of the board. Any failure is grounds for &#34;rework&#34; of the board on a hardware level if necessary,up to and including repair/replacement of the onboard flash, and not just a simple workaround in my opinion. Note that they don&#39;t force you to actually USE the internal SSD - you can still netboot or USB boot I think. It just has to work.Trivia:
-At least on T2 systems, the flash memory itself (the NAND chips) on the mainboard can actually be swapped between units after a DFU restore by unsoldering them and transferring them.The person that did this on YouTube notes that a common reason for SSD failure on T2 machines is due to SSD power regulator circuitry being located close to the intake vents on the side of the MacBook Pro. They recommend that users of these machines open them and clean the dust out often, since dust buildup on the actual power regulator combined with moisture sometimes causes a short circuit, sending high voltage to the SSD and damaging it.This kind of failure (high voltage parts close to low voltage ones, close to liquid damage prone areas, without any underfilling) is documented by Louis Rossmann. It is, however, not always feasible or possible to entirely prevent."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is good. The backing of stablecoins is a very real issue. As the Treasury points out, there&#39;s a very real possibility of a run. Two stablecoins have crashed so far, SafeDollar SDO, and $TITAN.  They went all the way to zero.Can Tether survive a net outflow? Probably not. They don&#39;t have the collateral.Dai is really a derivative of Etherium. Dai is backed by Etherium at 150%. So
value in Dai is at risk if the price of Etherium drops more than 1/3.  Etherium dropped by half back in May 2021, but recovered. DAI could have crashed at that time if it faced a net outflow. It didn&#39;t, though.The real question is what happens in the next recession."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; To address risks to stablecoin users and guard against stablecoin runs, legislation should require stablecoin issuers to be insured depository institutions, which are subject to appropriate supervision and regulation, at the depository institution and the holding company level.&gt; To address concerns about payment system risk, in addition to the requirements for stablecoin issuers, legislation should require custodial wallet providers4 to be subject to appropriate federal oversight. Congress should also provide the federal supervisor of a stablecoin issuer with the authority to require any entity that performs activities that are critical to the functioning of the stablecoin arrangement to meet appropriate risk-management standards.&gt; To address additional concerns about systemic risk and concentration of economic power, legislation should require stablecoin issuers to comply with activities restrictions that limit affiliation with commercial entities. Supervisors should have authority to implement standards to promote interoperability among stablecoins. In addition, Congress may wish to consider other standards for custodial wallet providers, such as limits on affiliation with commercial entities or on use of users’ transaction data.AKA StableCoin operators should be banks. (Stable Coins will be bank notes)?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting to read this with an eye on the authors&#39; mindset.  Their understanding of stablecoins seems largely centered on Tether (and to a lesser extent, BUSD/USDC).  A lot of their understanding is incorrect when applied to algorithmic stablecoins like Dai, eg. there is no central issuing authority; Dai is minted in exchange for Ethereum (and other cryptocurrencies), not fiat currencies; the effect of a run on Dai is unlikely to spill over into the mainstream financial system; a &#34;custodial wallet&#34; in DeFi is not a company but just an Ethereum address, i.e. a hash of a public/private keypair.Overall I get the sense that the government is still people/organization centric and cannot wrap its head around a future where reality is determined by computer code and people are bit players in the script."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was a pretty interesting thing to mitigate - we added some support around it to GitLab after it was reported to us, which shipped in the latest security release: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/commit/3fb44197195b57... (you can actually see it in effect on that commit&#39;s examples, which is quite meta). These characters have valid use-cases in right-to-left languages like Arabic, Japanese etc, so it had to be configurable for project-owners if they have legitimate use-cases for it. Our focus was on making sure that repository maintainers could see these characters in code reviews.The homoglyph attack is interesting but it really should be noticed as part of a code review process, as it requires adding the imitation function calls at some point too. It&#39;d also likely be pretty frustrating to end users if we were to highlight every single unicode character that looks like the latin alphabet.It&#39;s certainly a good lesson in not copy/pasting random snippets from the internet and pasting them into a root shell, however :D (we do always highlight the bidi characters on GitLab snippets, though)Aside: this was a royal pain in the arse to figure out if I had live examples in the specs, because vim also just rendered them &#34;correctly&#34;. I ended up checking the files in Windows Notepad on another machine to sanity check them.Thanks to the authors for responsible disclosure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As I previously noted on a related post:Interesting paper. Note, however, that the general problem is already known and there are a number of pre-existing works that discuss it. This is typically called &#34;underhanded code&#34; or sometimes &#34;maliciously misleading code&#34;. I&#39;m surprised that they didn&#39;t use the normal term for the problem nor cite the previous work on it - maybe they didn&#39;t realize this was a widely-known problem? Previous works on underhanded code didn&#39;t discuss Bidi to my knowledge (though other attacks on text like this have exploited Bidi).
Here are a number of other materials about underhanded code:The Obfuscated V Contest (http://graphics.stanford.edu/~danielh/vote/vote.html) was created by Daniel Horn in 2004 and is the earliest “underhanded” programming contest that I found. It was a contest to create source code that looked like it did one thing, but actually did another.Underhanded C Contest (http://www.underhanded-c.org/) has run in many years. Per its FAQ, &#34;The Underhanded C Contest is an annual contest to write innocent-looking C code implementing malicious behavior.&#34;My PhD dissertation &#34;Fully Countering Trusting Trust through Diverse Double-Compiling&#34; discusses how to counter the &#34;trusting trust&#34; problem &amp; includes a section about maliciously misleading source code. See: https://dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/The JavaScript Misdirection Contest announced the winner on September 27, 2015 http://misdirect.ion.land/My paper &#34;Initial Analysis of Underhanded Source Code&#34;, (by David A. Wheeler, April, 2020, IDA document: D-13166), discusses underhanded code and the effectiveness of several potential countermeasures. It also includes a number of citations to other works on underhanded code.

And I&#39;m older, so I have &#39;habits&#39; that don&#39;t tend to change.My rent has gone up 30%.  What used to cost me 100 something in groceries now regularly goes into the 200s.I&#39;m nothing if not an observationalist, but this CPI is horse dung.For someone like my family, I wouldn&#39;t believe any number less than 20%.The sad thing is, I&#39;ve never talked to a single friend or family member that said otherwise.So what is the government reporting?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many older people saved large amounts of money in their bank accounts, and were expecting to live off the interest in their savings account once they retired. The interest they were due was effectively stolen when the central banks started giving away free money, it was a massive transfer of wealth.Many of that same generation counted on Social Security, and CPI adjustments to help save them from poverty.  The CPI numbers were pushed down to keep the costs of benefits those retirees were entitled to receive artificially low.  Another transfer of wealth / theft.Now the rest of the population has seen their crappy but steady wages evaporate on a whim, and will no longer settle for less than an actual living wage.  A rebalancing is going to have to take place, and somehow the wealth needs to be transferred back to the working class, or things will get very violent, very quickly. Once that kicks off, our near peers will funnel weapons into the US, and a civil war will make us the latest 3rd world country."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My read on this is that it seems like the equivalent of a subtweet about pay inequality.If that is indeed the case then they should be arguing for something I wrote the SEC about a couple of years ago which is to have public companies report their salary costs broken down by executive pay and non-executive management pay and non-executive non-management pay. And to report the population of individuals in each cohort.That &#39;pie&#39; of payroll costs can be split up anyway a company chooses, but the weighting of it will allow investors to understand the future prospects of a company that under pays its rank and file relative to its executives and management."</p>

And if it&#39;s not a small thing then you&#39;re just a conspiracy theorist that hates democracy.In the past the EU passed a directive that required all ISPs to save what websites you visited.

It also allows you to monitor their conversations way that respects the kids&#39; privacy.Contrast this with iMessage, where literally anyone can randomly message a child using their Apple ID, and there are zero controls available to parents for monitoring or approving contacts.Look beyond messaging, and the Apple store targets kids with crappy apps filled to the brim  with creepy ads. YouTube recommends creepy, addictive, unmoderated, content.Facebook, and maybe Microsoft, are literally the only companies making products that are actually designed for kids."</p>

Parents get to authorize all contacts and review all communication; kids get fun photo and video chat tools, with all sorts of kid-friendly filters and such, along with loads of minigames. The UI is so dead-simple that illiterate youngsters have no problem using it.So, yah, I&#39;m not at all surprised to learn that they target 6 year olds. _They have a product clearly intended for them_."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Probably what&#39;s going on is that someone on the board of trusties gets money from the political establishment in Florida and is worried that they&#39;ll lose it if the voting barriers are fixed and different leadership is elected.This has similarities with the shenanigans pulled by Sinema and Manchin around the Build Back Better plan. Political horse trading to advance the agendas of special interests, at great expense to millions of people.I wonder if the tech community could get involved to increase transparency around this stuff. Imagine if we had an open graph of the money flow so we could write a SQL query like (pseudo code) &#34;select * from donors where payee in (select id from trustees)&#34;. Let people crowdsource the data and then maintain a page of declarative queries so that anyone can instantly see the web of money around public officials. It could be part of a build system that automatically creates a NASCAR jacket for each official so we could see who their donors are in AR.Maybe such a thing already exists. It&#39;s traditionally been accomplished by investigative journalists and lawyers, but why couldn&#39;t it be public? It seems like it would be an effective way to end the bribe system."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a colleague who does environmental litigation. (Think Erin Brockovich.) They have a big civil case against a large energy company in a southern, “energy-friendly” state. They had an expert witness all lined up - a professor at the (public!) state university. Well this expert happened to be up for tenure and was (allegedly) told in no uncertain terms that, should they testify as an expert witness in this case, tenure was off the table.It’s absolutely outrageous that we allow those in positions of power to manipulate the justice system in such a way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Public education institutions are potentially the most politicized arenas in our nation today.Especially K-12 education, where you have to somehow bridge a new chasm between insane ideologies while also keeping a classroom full children working &#34;productively&#34; towards pointless standardized testing objectives. All of this despite most of their dopamine loops being totally burned out from hours of smartphone use before they even get to school.The whole education system is heading towards &#34;totally fucked&#34;. This UF politics issue is just 1% of the puzzle behind why everything sucks so hard now. If you personally know any teachers working in K12, lend them your ear. You would be surprised how many people are internalizing the problems and don&#39;t even know who to talk to about it anymore. The rest have succumbed to apathy or new careers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a Model 3. The autopilot was acting weird while driving on the freeway, sometime disengaging, but mostly not tracking the lane smoothly. For an unrelated reason, I opted to view my camera footage, and was shocked to find that my camera was completely blurry. I’m driving down the freeway at 75mph, being guided by a camera that couldn’t pass a standard driver’s vision test.Tesla came out to replace the camera, and it appeared that a film had been deposited on the windshield, obscuring the camera.Living in Phoenix, my car is parked outside, facing south west. During Covid, I’d go many days at a time without driving, and in the summer, the interior temperatures can easily rise over 150f. Within the camera enclosure, there’s a reflection absorbing material, which likely creates a perfect miniature greenhouse.I believe the glue in the camera housing melted/evaporated at these elevated temperatures and deposited on the windshield.Concerned that others would experience this problem, I opened a case with the NHTSA. Crickets.There could be many people driving around on autopilot, with obstructed vision, due to this same failure mode. It’s something Tesla could easily check, and something NHTSA should be investigating.For something as safety critical as a forward facing camera, you’d expect both Tesla and NHTSA would be investigating. I have no indication that anything has happened as a result of my filing. Possibly because nobody else has reported the issue - maybe because nobody else is actively viewing their camera footage? There’s no other way for a Tesla owner to be aware of the issue. Frustrating."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I drive a Tesla. If my car rear ends another car, that&#39;s my fault. Doesn&#39;t matter if I had Autopilot on or not.Imagine if you were rear ended by a Toyota and the driver said &#34;it was on cruise control, shrug.&#34; Would you talk to NTSB or NHTSA about that? Probably not.The only scenario I can imagine that&#39;d warrant investigation is if the driver were completely unable to override Autopilot. Similar investigations have been started by NTSB when Toyota had issues with their cruise control systems several years ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The driver said she was using Autopilot, that an OTA update had had a problem earlier in the day, and that she had actually had the same kind of collision on Autopilot previously!So she continued to use it? That&#39;s insane.It&#39;s worrying that there are tons of videos on YouTube reviewing Tesla&#39;s Autopilot and FSD where the cars do something incredibly scary and dangerous, and the drivers just laugh it off, go &#34;well, it&#39;s a beta!&#34; and continue using it instead of turning off the feature that almost got them into a car accident. I don&#39;t want to share the road with drivers who think dangerous driving is a funny game."</p>

(the songs are produced in similar DAWs.) You won&#39;t be able to recreate the vocals, but you should be able to recreate the backing track almost identically. Put the original in right ear, your version in the left ear, and iterate until switching between versions sounds identical.Over 100s of hours, this will train you ears, and you will appreciate the production quality of today&#39;s pop music.This just covers the production and mixing, not the writing. Catchy pop songs sound deceivingly simple, which is the point and why they are so difficult to write."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to make music as a teenager. Spending many hours in the &#34;studio&#34; certainly shapes your aesthetics and how you approach new music. Even understanding just the basics and tiny bits of underlying techniques makes you listen differently, makes it easy to become a snob to be honest. Overall though, and generally, making things of any sort lets you appreciate the creative process as an overarching art in itself, an appreciation you can often transport to other fields, even those not conventionally regarded as artistic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Whether you like Ableton Live or not relative to other options is a matter of preference, but regardless, the folks who run Ableton are pretty cool:- run by real musicians who play shows, it came out of a scratched personal itch- so far, good new owners of Cycling 74, the bug squash numbers in the last couple of releases were stellar- totally hacker friendly, they know people release disassembled Python code for control surfaces, and basically said &#34;we can&#39;t support individual users doing this, but we know it&#39;s out there and won&#39;t do anything to stop it&#34; (this was what actually got me on the bus!)- really good educational outreach initiatives, and they give away a very capable light version for peanuts (or free with many controllers)I find their prices high, all things considered, but am happy to be a long time customer, and as a serious musician musician (university educated, etc.), I think it&#39;s great that it has become such a gateway to appreciation of instrumental music by making music creation a more accessible hobby.And the fact that I can script the heck out of such a full featured commercial product in Scheme by writing a Max/MSP external is fantastic (plug, I wrote Scheme For Max, which allows you to run lisp in your Ableton...)"</p>

Anti-bot software is nonsense. Its snake oil sold to people without technical knowledge for heavy bucks.If this guy got to experience how systemically bad the credential stuffing problem is, he&#39;d probably take down the whole repository.None of these anti-bot providers give a shit about invading your privacy, tracking your every movements, or whatever other power fantasy that can be imagined. Nobody pays those vendors $10m/year to frustrate web crawler enthusiasts, they do it to stop credential stuffing."</p>

I guess the other sides of those we don&#39;t see much. People doing actual black-hat work probably don&#39;t post about it on public forums, and most of the over-broad anti-abuse is probably a side effect of taking some anti-abuse tech and blindly applying it to the whole site just because that&#39;s simpler, often no tech people may be really involved at all."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Getting anything out of a subshell that isn&#39;t from STDOUT is impossible. So you can&#39;t define an array in a subshell and then use it outside the subshell, and you can&#39;t return an array (or anything that isn&#39;t a string) from a subshell. If you only use subshells and want to use any kind of data structure that isn&#39;t a string passed from STDOUT, you have to do it globally. And subshells are slow. So nobody uses subshells.If you use Bash for programming, you have to stop thinking in terms of the holier-than-thou software engineer, whose ego believes that a superior, &#34;clean&#34; design makes a superior program. You should embrace globals. You should switch between using or not using the enforcement of set variables or program exit status. You should stop using Bashisms and subtle, obscure language features unless you absolutely have to.Bash is not a &#34;real&#34; programming language, so do not treat it as one. Do not look for hidden features, or try to do things in cute ways that nobody else uses. There is no superior method or hidden knowledge. Just write extremely simple code and understand the quirks of the shell."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Well, because it simply doesn&#39;t work for them: returning from a function does not trigger the EXIT signal.It doesn&#39;t trigger EXIT, but it does trigger RETURN. Just trap both:    #!/bin/bash

        trap &#34;echo &#39;Cleanup!&#39;&#34; RETURN EXIT

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s an interesting bit of...abuse :) Since Bash is effectively stringly-typed, it can be used as a functional programming language, with pipes similar to function composition.e.g.: wtfp.sh    #!/usr/bin/env bash

It&#39;s the single most controversial book that I&#39;ve read about piano technique and playing that I&#39;ve found.The author, is not even a player himself (!!!). There&#39;s a great summary of reviews about the book here (https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php?topic=38247.0), if you&#39;re starting into piano, stay away, get a decent teacher."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the last section in Chapter One, titled &#34;Jazz, Fake Books, and Improvisation&#34;:&gt; In summary, the process of learning this genre consists of practicing the chords and scales sufficiently so that, given a melody, you can “feel” the right and wrong chords that go along with it.That&#39;s only scratching the surface and will not get you playing jazz. Listening to and copying the greats - Bird, Monk, Evans, Coltrane, Rollins, et al. That&#39;s how you learn to play jazz.&gt;It is clear that this genre is here to stay, has great educational and practical value, is relatively easy to learn, and can be a lot of fun.Relatively easy to learn??? Clearly the author hasn&#39;t or isn&#39;t playing jazz."</p>

Had no idea hay exchange existed, the vast majority of our sales were via craigslist and Facebook marketplace, with most being small-scale (50 bales or fewer). The rest came from word of mouth and our local 4-H group.Producing hay at this scale is extremely difficult. The start-up costs are in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and you&#39;re typically barely breaking even. This year is unusual in that supply was way down, so prices were a lot higher than normal. The only reason we can do it is that we have a relationship with someone who cuts &amp; bales a number of small fields for a per-ton fee.I could see a tool like this being useful for large-scale operations that are doing the big round bales yet don&#39;t have an established relationship with a buyer. For an operation like ours, where we are producing small ~60lb traditional square bales, I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to find anyone local enough who wants to buy at the quantity and size we have.

Dried ink on dead trees. And in the early internet age this book seller outperformed many more &#34;forward looking visionary&#34; startups.Billions and billions spent on making movies as polished as possible, yet &#34;I thought the book was better&#34; is what we always hear.The Metaverse will be programmed with text.The quarterly reports outlining its financial losses will be written in text.When journalists ultimately write its obituary, they will write text."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Metaverse is not bullshit. It&#39;s a sign of desperation.Facebook has _nothing_ for the future.* Blue app is already on it&#39;s death bed.* Instagram is already seeing a massive decline in quality and engagement as its getting close to the end of its lifecycle.* They managed to survive Snapchat, but I think that made them think Instagram is too big to fail. Thus, they didn&#39;t go after TikTok. It was a mistake.* What&#39;s App is not monetizable.* Oculus is not becoming the next PS4/Xbox like they hoped.Facebook is usually being compared to the likes of Apple, Google and Amazon. It&#39;s nothing compared to them. It&#39;s not even gonna be able to do a Microsoft/IBM pivot as it has no monetizable developer ecosystem.I personally think they should&#39;ve acquired TikTok last year when TikTok was looking to be acquired by Microsoft. They probably would&#39;ve extended their survival for another 10-ish years (lifecycle of a social media)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This thread feels like 1860&#39;s consilium on what future will look like 500 years later. The shape of the metaverse will be formed by a new generation, not by older guys (and not by fortnite addicts who play by the rules of the former) who know nothing better than drive a fancy “car” on the “road”, as if roads or a concept of physical movement or the euclidean rule would still be there for common use and not for museums. Virtual worlds up to date, like second life, were mostly just stupid copies of “real life”, which was designed after some physical limitations, or fantasy worlds of parallel earth-likes with a limited magic.If the only limitation of metaverse is Code and Content, and if that would be much easier to create, then in a blink of an eye it will turn into something absolutely inconceivable to mercedes benz drivers. What really is bullshit, is lack of imagination in people and a shitload of thought inertia. Personally, it feels like the article author has never ever been in the internet, confining themselves at a small circle of “social” networks bs. Those will live in an exact copy of their current environment, paying to bigcorps with their work hours to achieve “expensive” toys, to impress similar narrow-minded guys.

It&#39;s been passed around to relatives, but last I heard, it still works after what must be almost 40 years."</p>

You can see some playing on YouTube [1]I thought it would be interesting to 3D print additional records for the thing. Was super disappointed when I bought one for our daughter last year and found that they had changed it to a digital music player that only uses the records for song selection.A lot of the modern day versions of the original Fisher-Price toys don&#39;t hold up to the originals.  For example on the xylophone they replaced the Wood base with plastic and the thing sounds like crap.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphon[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk4zjQshq14[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soQLAvqnTOQ"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not sure how common this is in other countries, but here in Germany we have quite a few &#34;water playgrounds&#34;. There are some pumps in the sand, sometimes small aqueducts and the likes, so during summer, the kids can play with water. The pumps used to be real pumps. Now they are electronic. They have a sensor to detect how fast the handle is moving and at a certain speed you&#39;ll hear a clicking sound, a valve opens and the water starts flowing.I think some children will realize how these things work. They might start to find them dumb if they find out that the strenuous repetitive movement is in fact unnecessary. At least to me it feels like a dishonest contraption and I&#39;d prefer if they simply put a button on it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When you make housing an investment, by definition, it has to become less affordable in the future.Until a country decides to stop making policy to support this notion that a basic need should be an appreciating asset and not a depreciating one like food, transportation, etc, this completely unsurprising trend will continue. It is a strange world we live in where we collectively believe that a basic need should increase in price over time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m always a bit amused at this sort of article.At it&#39;s heart it is an attempt by someone who makes their living selling a thing (real estate) to instill a since of FOMO in order to motivate you to buy something now rather than perhaps later. You can&#39;t really fault them, it does tend to work.I happen to live in the &#34;red hot&#34; Bay Area and twice wince I&#39;ve been living in my house its value has gone DOWN year over year rather than up. I have never considered it an &#34;investment&#34;, rather it is a fixed cost that I have to pay to live indoors. My parents live in Las Vegas, and that housing market, which has been largely unconstrained, demonstrated exactly what that means. Houses in Vegas for a long time depreciated after you bought them, just like cars. They did that because there was so much new housing being built that you could buy a &#34;new&#34; house for the same price as a &#34;used&#34; house. Guess what, people opted for &#34;new&#34; and used houses needed to sell at a discount if they wanted to sell.One of the truisms for years was the value of a house was intimately tied to its location. This because it was close to jobs, or schools or what not. It is my hope that remote work really takes hold and you can work just as reasonably in a $100,000 house in Missouri as you can in a million dollar house in the Bay Area. That would really create some downward pressure on prices because of simple market dynamics."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unfortunately the article is extremely sloppy with the numbers and that makes it very hard to understand what is really going on.Primarily, they keep mentioning &#34;average house-price-to-income ratio&#34; but appear to be using average home price and median income.  Both housing price and income distributions are enormously skewed.  In the Unites States average income is almost double median income and that difference has been increasing over time.  So right there, even if median house price to median income has stayed constant, you would notice the pattern pointed out.I don&#39;t doubt the central premise that housing prices are rising faster than income within household, but unfortunately the article does nothing to show it."</p>

Even getting motivated to do things you want to do is hard, resorting to the laziest activity is often what happens, phone, social media, television. Sometimes I can&#39;t even get myself to play a video game and I love video games.And when the night comes, you&#39;d think sleep is what you need, but that same day of desk job actually gives you insomnia, falling asleep is hard, and while you sleep it&#39;s as if all of that mental activity is still happening in your head from the work day.If physical labor work paid me as well and provided the same benefits, I&#39;d probably switch back to it honestly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This analysis is solely focused on the &#34;job&#34; aspects of pre-industrial life and includes almost none of the domestic considerations. I&#39;m not sure if it would be fair to call all non-wage time &#34;leisure&#34;. Once work was still over there were still things to clean, fix, prepare, butcher, etc.Although, I think it goes without saying that before affordable lighting and heating, we all underestimate how lazy winters were for the average peasant, whether idyllic or not (accounts I have read make it sound incredibly, incessantly dull).And I think the best evidence we have that we are overrating the quality of pre-industrial leisure time is that people developed almost no leisure activities! Common people had almost no sports, no games (beyond precursors to Bocce or backgammon), no literature! They supposedly had half a year of doing nothing, and perhaps singing and drinking was sufficient to fill the time, but you&#39;d think they would show lots of other innovations. Or even steal the activities of the rich (organized sports)!Instead you don&#39;t see leisure activities develop until the rise of the 40 hour workweek and the availability of consumer appliances.Edit: I hope people understand that the argument the article presents is largely a romanticization of poverty."</p>

With code making use of the fact that we are running on known hardware, so we can optimize it rigorously.If you focused on supporting the official raspberry pi keyboard, mouse, and touchscreen you could circumvent a lot of the pains around driver issues. Then people could actually get up and running with your OS with real hardware, and you could start dogfooding it.I’ve heard people say that the software we use is up to 100 times slower than it needs to be. So my hypothesis is that if the software was written smarter, and used the fact that we know the hardware ahead of time, we should easily hit a 100 times performance increase across the OS.Also if it were possible, it would be cool if this OS supported a minimal boot mode, that could be configured to only run the bare minimum amount of apps required for a certain piece of software. So for example a game mode that ran the game, and the bare minimum amount of OS the game needed to run.And since we are in full on fantasy land we can take this one step further.

You then figure out how those pieces can work together to solve the problem. After that you can see the system as nested subsystems and interactions, which you can draw as diagrams and call it an architecture.So I see &#34;architecture&#34; more as a teaching and communication technique, applied after the fact. Altho since we&#39;re always moving between the details and the big picture, having organized abstractions (ie an architecture) in mind will help keep the design clean.The architecture evolves and sharpens as a system comes together. And this evolving architecture provides the team with a common terminology and overall direction.But you rarely start by choosing a specific architecture.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m kinda confused by the criticism of the industry and NASA not designing for Starship.The author argues that NASA doesn’t understand Tempe game changer that Starship is, but I don’t think that’s accurate. I think the risk to NASA of assuming the benefits of Starship before it’s proven are just too high.If NASA (or other industry players), assume Starship will deliver the benefits it promises, they to fundamentally alter their approach to space. But that leaves them with no backup plan in the event that Starship fails to materialize or deliver on its promises.Whereas this other approach, of treating Starship like a much better vehicle but integrating it into its old processes, gives them an out if Starship fails in some way. Because they’re still using the “old” assumptions, they can fall back to other “old space” style providers.I think once Starship has proven itself capable of deliver on its promises, you’ll see NASA changing its approach radically in the manner the author describes.So, fundamentally, I think it’s not a lack of “understanding”, but a different calibration of “risk”. This also applies to many existing space companies, and I also think this gives opportunities for new companies that have a higher risk tolerance to take advantage."</p>

When Miller showed his results to Urey, the latter suggested a paper should be published as soon as possible.

After Miller showed the impressive results to Urey, they decided to submit them to Science. Urey
declined Miller’s offer to coauthor the report because otherwise Miller would receive little or no credit. Knowing that a graduate student could have a difficult time getting a paper like this published, Urey contacted the Science editorial office to explain the importance of the work and ask that the paper be published as soon as possible. Urey kept mentioning the results in his lectures, drawing considerable attention from the news media.The manuscript was sent to Science in early February of 1953. Several weeks went by with no news. Growing impatient, Urey wrote to Howard Meyerhoff, chairman of AAAS’s Editorial Board, on 27 February to complain about the lack of progress. Then, on 8 March 1953, the New York Times reported in a short article entitled, “Looking Back Two Billion Years” that W. M. MacNevin and his associates at Ohio State University had performed several experiments simulating the primitive Earth—including a discharge experiment with methane wherein “resinous solids too complex for analysis” were produced. The next day, Miller sent Urey a copy of the clipping with a note saying “I am not sure what should be done now, since their work is, in essence, my thesis. As of today, I have not received the proof from Science, and in the letter that was sent to you, Meyerhoff said that he had sent my note for review.”Infuriated by this news, Urey had Miller withdraw the paper and submit it to the Journal of the American Chemical Society. Ironically, at the same time (11 March), Meyerhoff, evidently frustrated by Urey’s actions, wrote to Miller that he wanted to publish the manuscript as a lead article and that he wanted Miller—not Urey—to make the final decision about the manuscript. Miller immediately accepted Meyerhoff’s offer, the paper was withdrawn from the Journal of the American Chemical Society and returned to Science, and was published on 15 May 1953.https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Prebiotic-Soup--Revisi..."</p>

I sued Facebook in a California small-claims court to rescind my purchase of the Quest 1 (and all accessories and game purchases) after I declined the change in ToS adding the FB account requirement. It took a while (negotiated with their customer support, then sued, then finally months later got an intelligent response), but we settled for what I asked for. I can&#39;t be the only one who got my money back. I liked the product except for the added account requirement, and I would now consider buying again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It begs the question: if they host the social media account and VR account and can reliably identify / link them on their end, and the laws and terms allow them to do so, does it really matter if they’re different accounts?It&#39;s still a win if you don&#39;t have a facebook account.  For everyone else: I would assume that they will identify your accounts reliably."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Mark&#39;s statement was worded carefully in that he stated access would not longer require your _personal_ Facebook account.

Admittedly, that 37 cycle fixed cost is probably quite a bit higher, and I don&#39;t know how well the bit mixing compares.Parenthetically, a time equation (like t_cycles = coef * bytes + fixedCost) is a more convenient way to summarize performance of this kind of thing than the constant short string/long string mumble-mumble.  Yes, loop unrolling/etc. can create step-ish functions and a linear regression is pretty approximate (but my stderrs are pretty small above), but even so..much less tripping over words."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very grateful that my employer has committed to remaining flexible with remote work. Full time in the office, hybrid, or full time remote. It’s up to the individual. Full time remote has done wonders for my health - instead of a 2 hour commute I get to exercise. Instead of coming home stressed, annoyed, and sitting in front of the TV, I go outside for a solid hour+ after I close my laptop. I travel more liberally now that I don’t have to take time off to do so. My quality of life has never been better, and my gratefulness translates into feelings of loyalty towards my employer. Why would I quit if I’m treated well and have a nice work life balance? Why would I risk this situation by slacking off when I am on the clock?Prior to the remote shift, I was unhappy and I didn’t even realize. No exercise, no passion outside of work. All my energy went into my 10+ hour day (when you consider the commute).Since then I’ve lost 30lbs, become enamored with new sports and hobbies, and my social life outside of work exists again. I feel more “alive” than I have in a decade.I’ll never work for a company that doesn’t allow me that flexibility for the rest of my career, as long as I can help it. Companies that want access to good talent would be wise to follow this example."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; ... There is a more intriguing possibility, however. Work that is largely done remotely may be more efficient compared with an office-first model.I don&#39;t think in-person real-time communication is always effective. No, I personally think it&#39;s one of the least method of communication that can happen in an office environment when the topic gets slightly complex (that is, if the topic is complex enough for you to write a memo about it).For those topics, I love to communicate with some &#34;written&#34; form, such as in an email, posts etc. Because doing the &#34;writing&#34; part allow me to conduct some research and analyses on the topic (usually took 10 minutes), which will in turn increase the quality of my reply.If you standing right in front of me and asked a question that require a complex answer, then my reply will probably make me look like an idiot, because I might not able to discover all the information that I need to process and output within 30 seconds. Not very effective in my opinion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Blender is such an amazing tool. I have a side business where I create 3d printed jewelry with my customer&#39;s fingerprints on it in gold and silver (https://lulimjewelry.com) and I use Blender on the backend for all of the jewelry creation.I run blender headless in a docker container on google cloud run. When needed I invoke it with an image and have a blender script &#34;engrave&#34; that image on the jewelry and output an STL file.It is incredibly flexible to script in python, although its not very &#34;pythonic&#34;. The UI is quite stateful (edit mode, object mode, which items are selected, etc) and you have to keep track of that state in your program. But once you get around those issues you can do quite a lot, and its all a free program!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love Blender, but have been stuck on version 2.7 due to what I can only describe as some sort of icon dyslexia.For 2.8, all the Blender icons were replaced with monochromatic ones. This is a very popular trend and a lot of programs are replacing their icons in this way, so it&#39;s obviously fine for most people, and I realize this is probably a niche accessibility need I have.But, to use the new icons, I find I have to check each one every time to find the one I want. Instant recognition is no longer possible. For me, this extra cognitive load makes it difficult to use Blender for more than a few minutes at a time.Blender is a fantastic product and one of the best examples of what open-source can be, but I for one will be appreciating it from afar, and remaining on 2.7 until there is a way to get more usable icons."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The general guideline will be to keep Blender functionally compatible with 2.8x and later. Existing workflows or usability habits shouldn’t be broken without good reasons – with general agreement and clearly communicated in advance.Oh boy. How I wish so much that other software developers would follow this principle... It seems nearly every software I use and rely on has to change its appearance and interface every 6-12 months, breaking familiarity for no objective reason, and simply because &#34;it looks better&#34; to look at (and not necessarily to use!) to the subjective eyes of someone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; * The POSIX-blessed way of finding an executable program is command -v, which is consequently built into most shells. Given the standard alternative, Adams said, &#34;surely no one competent would choose to have a package depend on `which` when a standard POSIX utility can do a better job&#34;.*This feels a little tone-deaf to me.  I&#39;ve been using the *nix command-line and writing (and reading) shell scripts for 20+ years, and I&#39;d never heard of &#34;command -v&#34; until now.  Now that I know about it, I&#39;ll probably start trying to retrain my muscle memory to use it (though it requires 2x the number of keystrokes).Despite its lack of true standardization, &#34;which&#34; (along with &#34;type -p&#34;) has been the de-facto &#34;standard&#34; I&#39;ve seen in shell scripts for figuring out if a command exists.  It was a surprise to me to learn that &#34;which&#34; isn&#39;t a part of POSIX, even."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regardless of whether &#39;command -v&#39; is a better alternative, &#39;which&#39; is ensconced as standard practice in many shell scripts, and I would go so far as to say I think the majority of them that actually have to choose between the two use &#39;which&#39;.Given that, having it print out a deprecation warning without considering what that means to all the people that use it is irresponsible.  I help manage a few hundred servers.  We send root email to a list and actually review it all every day.  We make sure to sanitize anything run from cron so that we only get email output on error (STDERR).  Given that some of those cron jobs run quite often, this would have been thousands of emails to sift through if we used Debian.There were many possible solutions, as the maintainer notes.  Unfortunately in trying to remove themself from the decision, they forced a non-solution on everyone that is disruptive.  I can&#39;t think of any way this is a good choice for this particular set of facts (I can see a deprecation warning being warranted for some other things, but this case has little to do factually with those theoretical situations)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a descriptivist when it comes to standards. When everyone uses `which`, POSIX should add it. &#34;but it&#39;s non-standard!&#34; can be fixed by making it a standard."</p>

If China tried to extradite a U.S. citizen acting within the U.S. who published leaked information allegedly in violation of Chinese law, we&#39;d laugh them out of the courtroom, and rightly so.Adding insult to injury, publishing leaked military secrets is not even illegal in the U.S. due to the first amendment right to a free press. When the New York Times publishes leaked classified information, there&#39;s no trial or extradition. In the U.S., those who will have legitimate access to classified information first sign legally binding agreements not to disseminate it, and those who violate that agreement can be prosecuted.And in this case, that already happened: Manning served 7 years in jail for leaking the very information that Assange is being extradited over. With the leaker found and prosecuted, convicted, and sentence served, the U.S. Department of Justice should congratulate itself on a job well-done and move on to other things. It&#39;s absurd that they continue to pursue the publisher of the information almost a decade later."</p>

Ubuntu / Arch / Fedora were about 11% faster overall than Windows 11 Pro on this system. Meanwhile, Clear Linux was about 18% faster than Windows 11 and enjoyed about 5% better performance overall than the other Linux distributions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder how much of these results were actually due to compiler/benchmark implementation rather than operating system mechanisms.I expect file system related (not I/O) benchmarks would differ significantly in Linux&#39; favor as we&#39;d observed with WSL1 vs WSL2; but the rest? Are we to believe that DirectX 12, the API that’s supported by hardware vendors themselves, optimized to no end for first-class gaming, is actually slower than whatever&#39;s on Linux? (Not downplaying the significant achievements of Linux in graphics, but meagerly pointing out the fact that Windows is way ahead in graphics performance because of politics)For example, Windows 11 loses in all Java benchmarks. Coincidentally, Oracle has great investment in Linux as a platform. Is this really a fair operating system comparison?Similarly, GCC is optimized primarily for Linux. Windows is a second-class citizen there. It could be the same case with clang as well, I don&#39;t know. How are we supposed to be sure that compilers treat two OS&#39;s the same? Do benchmark apps get compiled with MSVC on Windows?I think OS performance can only be compared fairly with benchmarks specifically designed to measure OS performance, not performance of a specific application per se, simply because the developers have varying priorities for optimizing their apps for a platform.An OS benchmark could measure context switch latency, I/O latency, raw I/O throughput, certain responsiveness metrics etc, compiled with the preferred compiler of the platform."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at a company who made products on contract, but the contract stipulated the vendor we had to use to get the raw materials. The raw materials were just aluminum castings, but they were a custom shape specifically for this customer of ours. They could only be used for this one product.I noticed that the inventory levels of our vendor were dropping, but we weren&#39;t buying. Meaning our customer was ordering the same product from a competitor.I proposed that we spend the money to buy the rest of the material at the vendor. Basically denying our competitor the materials and forcing either them to come to us or the customer dropping the order and reordering through us. This would have been a risk because that&#39;s about a year supply of proprietary castings that we can&#39;t use for anything else, but I really thought it was a worthwhile opportunity.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe the claim is completely defensible and ultimately correct.A) This was a multi-factoral event certainly but all of these other factor are &#34;immediate causes&#34; which can themselves be traced to absolute maximum return on equity as a more final cause.B) No doubt &#34;hard to restart&#34; process are were involved. But the world relies on single-source, hard to restart, large scale production of many things today because these produce the highest returns for those who invest in them and the lowest prices for those who buy from them. And both kinds of actors have been willing to just stop producing rather than doing something that might be costly to keep production going (and they decided they didn&#39;t want backup before this for the same reason).C) Supply lines that stretch around world exist as a combination of economies of scale and &#34;labor market arbitrage&#34; and both these are driven by return, even though &#34;labor market arbitrage&#34; doesn&#39;t increase efficiency or robustness.D) Chip manufactures put money into &#34;up-date&#34; chip processes, notably leaving the sorts of chips actually used in cars woah fully under-invested and generally many sorts of lack of robustness can be traced down to money flowing only to the normally profitable. Shutting down production isn&#39;t necessarily that bad for a company - they don&#39;t wages and they can start back up once things stabilize. It&#39;s much less disastrous than making a bunch of stuff and not being able to sell it. Clearly, that thinking is guiding a lot of decisions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been testing one for a couple weeks, and a quick rundown on it: it has a quad-core A53, same CPU/SoC core as the Pi 3, with 512 MB of RAM.This means it can run 64-bit Pi OS, but it is memory-limited and even some of the benchmarks I ran needed extra swap space to complete. But for anything that does run in the 512 MB of LPDDR2 RAM, it is at least twice as fast as the Zero/Zero W, and sometimes 3-8x faster, depending on how things handle threading (4 cores is better than 1!).My biggest concern is overheating—even at the base 1 GHz clock, it will start to throttle after a few minutes in a case with no airflow or heat sink. You can overclock to 1.2, 1.4, or even in some cases 1.5 GHz, but it starts throttling a lot more quickly unless you have really good cooling."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Original RPi0 supposedly can idle at 0.4W, where-as the 3 (whose cpu this is based on) idles at &gt;1.5W. It&#39;s cool to have this great small package, but this is a very different offering than the first RPi0W.It&#39;s felt really weird seeing so little progress in available low power ARM over the years. Atmel/Microships SAMA5D3 / SAMA5D2 with it&#39;s 600 MHz Cortex A5 (2009) still seems like- half a decade latter- one of a rare few genuinely low power Linux running SoC available for purchase/use. I&#39;m forgetting what&#39;s available in the Cortex A7 line, which is a little higher power but which still has some very low power chips available for it, &amp; at significantly higher performance ranges. A7 has a lot of chips you can&#39;t buy, only available in some tablets &amp; or hard to get wearable chips, but I think there are some good offerings about too. ST has the ~$20 STM32MP1, to name one.Yet I just see so much non-materialization, non-availability. It feels like the rule. 2015&#39;s Cortex A35, 2016&#39;s Cortex A32, 2019&#39;s Cortex-A34... none of these chips seem to have really materialized in any genuinely available form. There are some off-brand tablets with A35 chips but generally that&#39;s about it. The low power segment has been rather ignored."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been running one of these for a few months too and was excited when I saw an ARMv7 CPU. In the open source and container world, many projects have stopped supporting the Zero and RPi1 due to its lack of RAM and slow CPU speed. Even running &#34;go build&#34; can take multiple seconds on a simple program. Starting Node.js was also fairly slow.The RPi zero shines for Python scripts that access hardware - for sensors and camera projects that are low power and cheap to make. It was actually perfect for the GrowLab project that we did over the summer with 20 others from the community https://growlab.dev - sensor data and camera images were aggregated to a more powerful RPi3/4 and then either uploaded to a static GitHub Pages site, fed into InfluxDB to create beautiful charts with Grafana.The new Zero 2 means that I can start to run ARMv7 or even ARM64 containers on the zero again, but with the limit of 512GB of RAM. The launch blog post explains why this couldn&#39;t be made higher.The first thing I tried out was not K3s, which I knew already suffers on a Raspberry Pi 3, but faasd. Faasd is OpenFaaS but built for pure containerd, no multi-node networking and no Kubernetes. It works fairly well for a few functions, even with NATS and Prometheus being deployed as part of the stack.So whilst you&#39;re not going to be building K3s clusters with these, they can run containers - with Docker, containerd, nerdctl and even as a full application stack with faasd.Where this gets more interesting for me, is hosting small applications, integrations or APIs. Perhaps with Ingress via a tunnel that can penetrate NAT/firewalls like Inlets, Argo or Ngrok.I&#39;ve ordered one of the release models to see how it performs. Look out for a blog post from me soon."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Many good points. I&#39;d like to add a common open secret that I believe is wrong: 1 upvote = 1 karma point.This might be true internally and initially, before any ant-spam, anti-upvote-ring detection takes place. Effectively, from a user point of view it is not - at least for me.When I look at the points one of my submissions get and compare my increase in overall karma it is very roughly 50% most of the time.   Needless to say that I never participated in things that would be considered unethically (voting-ring etc.). Also not a complaint at all, just an observation that goes against what is often written in &#34;about HN&#34; type posts (but not OP).EDIT:1. My observation is from more than a year ago, so things might well have changed.2. As lordnacho points out below this seems to be true only for stories. Regardless why it happens, awarding stories with less points than comments makes a lot of sense to me. After all posting a suitable story is much less effort than writing a decent comment."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is great news!  This is a wonderful project, and the fact that it wasn&#39;t accessible from Germany made me profoundly sad and angry.I hope the responsible copyright lawyers have a hard time sleeping because of this and consider changing their line of work.  If you are blocking people from reading books in the public domain, it is a good indication that you are one of the bad guys.Even worse, they only blocked people from Germany that didn&#39;t know how to use a VPN.  German courts really don&#39;t get how the internet works."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want state here on fact, the &#34;copyright&#34; is an rather new  anglon-saxon invention and was only later imported to Germany[1]. Interestingly, the era of the &#34;land of poets and thinkers&#34; and the economic rise of Germany was boosted by the fact - that there were no copyrights laws which hindered. Authors had to publish good and more work.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright#BackgroundQuote from WikipediaPrinting brought profound social changes. The rise in literacy across Europe led to a dramatic increase in the demand for reading matter. Prices of reprints were low, so publications could be bought by poorer people, creating a mass audience. In German language markets before the advent of copyright, technical materials, like popular fiction, were inexpensive and widely available; it has been suggested this contributed to Germany&#39;s industrial and economic success. After copyright law became established (in 1710 in England and Scotland, and in the 1840s in German-speaking areas) the low-price mass market vanished, and fewer, more expensive editions were published; distribution of scientific and technical information was greatly reduced.And from the history arctileHeinrich Heine, in a 1854 letter to his publisher, complains: &#34;Due to the tremendously high prices you have established, I will hardly see a second edition of the book anytime soon. But you must set lower prices, dear Campe, for otherwise I really don&#39;t see why I was so lenient with my material interests.&#34;It is not okay to claim other works as yours, publish private material or just don&#39;t give you a fair share upon your work. Probably we should have opted for another approach than &#34;copyright&#34; or &#34;patents&#34;. Luckily the US at least got &#34;Fair Use&#34; and maybe the idea of a &#34;Culture Flatrate&#34; from Germany is also a good idea."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m curious as to what changed PGLAF&#39;s mind. Blocking those specific works was all that the court ordered 3 years ago. Blocking everything was PGLAF&#39;s own decision based on perceived risk of further lawsuits about other works. Nothing has really changed to decrease that risk. The plaintiffs may have agreed that those are the only works they own that were in violation, and won&#39;t sue about anything else, but any other German who hold the copyright to works are still valid there but not the US still could."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; There was a rule in the Port of Los Angeles saying you could only stack shipping containers two containers high.This is incorrect.
There was a zoning rule which affected truck yards in Long Beach and Los Angeles. Truck yards. Not the port itself.As stated in the linked tweets actually.But if you don&#39;t believe that you can just google an image of the Port of Los Angeles from let&#39;s say 2019 and count how high the container piles go. Here is a randomly selected image from 2019 where 5 high piles can be clearly counted: https://www.joc.com/sites/default/files/field_feature_image/...Accuracy is important. I&#39;m not an expert on logistics, or zoning laws. But how could I trust the article&#39;s author when they clearly unable to parse their own sources?&gt; Normally one would settle this by changing prices, but for various reasons we won’t get into price mechanisms aren’t working properly to fix supply shortages.It&#39;s nice that the article is not going into that. Instead it hammers on that politicians regulate where and how many containers can you plop down. That is not the real issue.If you are moving containers into an area, and you are not moving an equal amount out then you are going to run out of space to store the containers. It is that simple. You can tweak rules to make a bit more space, for example by stacking them higher in the truck yards. But the real question is: why are the people who own these containers incentivised to move them back to where they want them to be filled?  If you solve that the problem solves itself. If you can&#39;t solve that piles of containers will fill up what little more space you won by tweaking. So the very point the article decides to &#34;not go into&#34; is the only one worth going into."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Someone correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but my understanding is that the &#39;stacking rule&#39; meant that people with more empties than they could stack 2 high on their property were &#34;storing&#34; empties on trailer chassis that carry one container.As I understood it, by letting them stack empties higher, it freed up trailers to be used by trucks to go get containers out of the port. When that happens the port then wants empties to put back on the ship (or full if they are going somewhere) and then the ship can continue on.So the &#34;win&#34; here was that more trailers would be available to take full containers from ships and that would move things along."</p>

These all use SFX PSUs and typically just an M2 SSD on the motherboard. They also have only 2 RAM slots.The days of needing a tower are over for most people. I&#39;m all about space-saving while still having a full-power PC.It&#39;s a niche, boutique market but there are some really interesting cases. My personal favourite is the Louqe Ghost S1 [1]. I&#39;ve built one PC with this (the Mk II). I bought a Mk III case but couldn&#39;t source a GPU so ended up just buying a CyberpowerPC prebuilt (which is actually a pretty nice PC, to be fair).They&#39;re not cheap and they&#39;re kind of annoying to buy. Louqe in particular has had huge distribution problems in the US (through Amazon&#39;s logistics service).Another popular one is the Dan A4 [2]. It&#39;s smaller. I personally prefer the Ghost for having better airflow, being more modular and being able to expand the case with &#34;top hats&#34;. This allows you to add a 240mm AIO and bottom fans for some pretty darn good cooling and airflow.Anyway, I&#39;m always excited to see entrants in this market.[1]: https://www.louqe.com/ghost-s1/[2]: https://www.dan-cases.com/dana4.php"</p>

That included replacing the keyboard and the touchpad (not 100% sure if the old keyboard and touchpad could have been kept; maybe they were replaced just because of the damage done to them by the expanding batteries). At the same time, the previous generation had battery problems and keyboard problems (as pointed out in sub-comments), which meant many were replaced for free even out of warranty (as it happened to me due to faulty battery).I suspect someone at Apple realized how much would have been saved if only the battery was not glued to the case.Edit: mentioned the keyboard problem, which would result in replacing the battery too it seems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ve never understood the value proposition for Copilot.In terms of difficulty, writing code is maybe on average a two out of ten.On average, maintaining code you wrote recently is probably a three out of ten in terms of difficulty, and maintaining code somebody else wrote or code from a long time ago probably rises to around a five out of ten.Debugging misbehaving code is probably a seven out of ten or higher.GitHub Copilot is optimising the part of the process that was already the easiest, and makes the other parts harder because it moves you from the “I wrote this” path to the “somebody else wrote this” path.Even during the initial write, it changes the writing process from programming (which is easy) to understanding somebody else’s code to ensure that it’s right before accepting the suggestion (which is much less easy).  I just don’t understand how this is a net time/energy savings?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Copilot is crazy. The other day, I was writing a Python function that would call a Wikipedia API. I pulled from the internet an example of a GET request, and pasted it as a comment in my code.  # sample call: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&amp;format=json&amp;list=geosearch&amp;gscoord=37.7891838%7C-122.4033522&amp;gsradius=10000&amp;gslimit=100

Then I defined a variable,  base_url = &#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?&#34;

Then, like magic, Copilot suggested all the remaining keys that would go in the query params. It even knew which params were to be kept as-is, and which ones would come from my previous code:  action = &#34;query&#34;  # action=query
  format = &#34;json&#34;  # or xml
  lat = str(latitude.value)  # 37.7891838
  lon = str(longitude.value)  # -122.4033522
  gscoord = lat + &#34;%7C&#34; + lon
  ...
  api_path = base_url + &#34;action=&#34; + action + &#34;&amp;format=&#34; + format + ... + &#34;&amp;gscoord=&#34; + gscoord

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been using this for weeks and it blooooows my mind. It comes up with crazy recommendations, just yesterday I wrote this big ass logic to do something, then I wanted to move that code to a function so I wrote the function name and I kid you not copilot suggested a one-liner that worked…  the thing is so useful and I’m not writing simple code (writing cryptographic code). And when it’s not doing that at the very least it provides auto-completion to lists where a counter has to increase and things like that. It’s just baffling, I don’t think I’m that directly impacted by AI, or at least this is the first time where I’m like “wow, AI really is changing the world RIGHT NOW”. Half-joking: can’t wait for it to just write my code.Also if this feature would be paid tomorrow, I think I would pay for it. It’s really noticeable when I don’t have copilot enabled now.Oh and, autocompletion doesn’t work with markdown files because of markdown plugins I think? But this is another level of insanity: when I’m writing english it figures a lot of the sentences I want to write. Makes me question if I’m just a deterministic individual with no choice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting. Usually my critique for products like this is something along the lines of &#34;great, but how are you going to access your data from the internet?&#34; Typically the answer to that is you need some sort of tunneling service like ngrok to get around port forwarding, CGNAT, firewalls, etc. I maintain a list of solutions here[0]. The problem with most of these services is that they&#39;re targeted at developers and aren&#39;t something the average user should have to mess with.In this case, the PiBox is being offered by KubeSail[1], a company which specializes in services like tunneling (they&#39;re already on the list mentioned above). It will be very interesting to see if they can bundle it in such a way that people don&#39;t have to worry about how the tunneling works. Extra points if they make it easy for users to buy/use their own domains.[0]: https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling[1]: https://kubesail.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m looking for something like this, but cheaper and for 3.5&#34; drives. USD$250, plus shipping to Australia puts that just too high for what it offers.I own Synology NASs, but adding an expander for that is expensive. (AUD$800)The ODroid-HC4 looks promising, but their &#39;toaster&#39; case design for it is awful, leaving the drives exposed and unable to put two atop each other.Ideally what I&#39;d like is:- 1-2x 3.5&#34; SATA drives- Gbit NIC- Enough grunt to run some kind of clustered filesystem (gluster, ceph, whatever)The idea being that I could start a cluster with say 3x of these devices, and then as my storage needs grow - add more.They don&#39;t need to have stellar IO, but enough to keep up with plex."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently did something like this myself with an RPi 4 and an external drive over USB to replace Google Photos (with PhotoPrism). For tunneling (and custom domain) I used cloudflared which works surprisingly well: https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared. I wrote about it here: https://domh.dev/blog/replacing-google-photos-with-photopris...That being said, I love that someone is working on making this stuff easier to do, it was finicky to get it setup myself. I would be backing it if I hadn&#39;t just done it already.I wish Kubesail all the best and I hope they succeed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hooray for him.Patent trolls have a business model, which he&#39;s disrupted:1) buy a patent, the broader and better-tested the better2) start threatening the easy marks; the ones who roll over and write you a check right away.  Their trick is to ask for a settlement small enough to say &#34;hey, it&#39;ll cost you more than that for attorney&#39;s fees!&#34;

3) use that money to threaten the harder targets: the ones who will fight back. Those people get asked for much larger sums.4) maybe actually go to trial with a very big target, one that&#39;ll get dinged for a 9-figure judgment if the troll wins. In the Eastern District of Texas, juries tend to do that.Researching the validity of a patent does not require $400/hour attorneys. Anyone with a basic knowledge of patent law and computer science can do it. (And no, I&#39;m not advertising for myself. I&#39;m retired.) Do you think those expensive attorneys do it themselves? It is to laugh -- they assign it to a junior who knows technology."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As others have said, there are more cost effective options than just getting your attorney to do a patent search for you. There are definitely plenty of companies that will do it for you for far less. But the quality is... variable, to say the least.As a point of shameless self-promotion, I&#39;m the founder of a company seeking to improve the patent system, starting with prior art search [1][2]. We&#39;re not one of those companies that will do it for you for less. Instead, we empower you to do it yourself, then have your attorney go deeper if needed. The idea being that you don&#39;t need to be a patent expert or lawyer to do it; anyone with knowledge of their technical area can search effectively.  Plus we&#39;ve got some collaboration features so when you&#39;re ready to hand off to your $500/hr attorney, you can. And not just hand off -- collaborate.If a patent troll is shaking you down, reach out to us and we&#39;ll do you a generous deal, no strings attached. We very much do not like patent trolls.[1] https://www.amplified.ai/[2] https://www.amplified.ai/en/blog/22062020/introducing-amplif..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Every time a company settles it just funds the trolls to wreak more havoc. This is especially true for companies larger than $100 million in revenue. I’m looking at you Texas Instruments, VIA Technologies, Renesas, ASUS, Caterpillar, Nuvision International, and Netgear, just to name a few of the companies that have dealt with Jason Nguyen’s Altair Logix. When you roll over and pay the trolls it hurts smaller companies terribly.I wonder if those companies consider this a &#34;feature&#34;?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Worldcoin issues tokens to people for scanning their retinas. Their magical orb device sends a biometric hash to their network.Here&#39;s my take on it: You can possibly replace their biometric device with a random hash generator.* If it works, it means the currency is not fairly distributed, but anyone sending valid hashes to their network is issued tokens, irrespective of whether the eyeballs described by those hashes exist. This is called a Sybil attack.* If it doesn&#39;t work, it means there is some secret or centralized check that the network performs, which means the currency is not open.This is why we still use proof-of-work in spite of its energy expense: it is simple to understand, it can not be faked, and it can be openly verified.So, do not support this biometric-gathering enterprise."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As I understand it, the distribution mechanism of Worldcoin is not part of the protocol. The protocol does not know anything about eyes.So the distribution seems completely centralized. A central authority distributes the coins however they wish.Today they might use a process involving eye scans. Or maybe not. There is no way to check. Tomorrow they might change their approach however they like. And we would have no way of knowing.The issue that seems to be overlooked is that there is no way to look at a hash and decide if it was created via scanning an eye. The hash is signed via some key that - according to the makers of WC - sits in an eye scanning device which behaves a certain way. But we have no way of checking that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; It’s also worth noting that end-to-end encryption is necessarily broken as messages to (and from) WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram pass across the bridge(s). The bridge(s) operates in Element’s trusted EMS environment, with no content scanning or datamining, but currently bridged conversations are not stored end-to-end encrypted in Matrix (they will be in the future).As a Signal user, I kind of don&#39;t want this to take off. I like knowing that when I message someone on Signal, it&#39;s for their eyes only. It feels like this service starts fragmenting some of the privacy guarantees of the bridged providers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Back in the day before the rise of Facebook, there was an open source service that combined all the popular messaging protocols - MSN, AoL, IRC, etc.It was called Pidgin[0], and it never got particularly big.I see the same thing here. While it&#39;s interesting, I&#39;m failing to see what the use case is. What&#39;s the niche that needs this solved in a big way?[0] https://www.pidgin.im/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is nicely timed.Brief history: when Hangouts was going away and Google Chat coming in, I pitched Matrix to my friends as a better alternative that didn&#39;t require unique phone numbers, awkward desktop limitations, and a better federated future. We stuck with Google Chat because inertia and networks suck that way.I revisited the instance I had setup and got the mautrix-googlechat bridge working. It&#39;s pretty nice but one friend lamented that he did not have the technical skills to self-host such a thing. And here comes this announcement! Sadly, there is a major hurdle: neither Google Chat nor SMS/GVoice are listed here and those are the major protocols that my social group uses.At the same time, my social group is conservative in adopting new core technologies and wary of cloud lock-in for critical roles (Google being both an unfortunate anchor and precipitator of that). I&#39;m not sure adding those protocols would tip the balance."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just upgraded to Monterey on my Macbook Pro 2018 15-inch and after rebooting, all of the USB-C ports stopped working, including the power adapter. I spent some time on the phone with Apple Support trying to figure out how to fix it. After about an hour and a half there was about 18% battery left before I started to panic and figure out how I was going to back everything up.After panicking, the 3rd Apple Support Representative and I endeavoured to try and reset the System Management Controller (SMC) [1] once again. At this point I had realised that the first few times that I tried this with a previous support representative would not have worked, as I was holding shift on the left-hand side of the keyboard (the previous support representative did not specify) and not the right-hand side as outlined in the support article for Macs with the T2 chip.Good luck!1. https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201295"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I haven’t seen this anywhere when I’ve looked, so I’ll ask here on the slim chance maybe they really added something I badly want and somebody knows…Is there any application forced sandboxing feature yet?Something users can control to forcibly stop bad behavior from certain “must have” apps. Chrome, for example, has been caught doing entire drive scans on Windows, and I’m not sure I entirely trust Zoom either. So I’d like to lock down what they can access in terms of files, paths, devices and so on and be fully confident that even if my employer demands I run some software installer provided by their “partners” that it hasn’t installed some creepy daemon and configured launchd to keep it running after I kill the app or even kill -9 the process.Yes we can use VMs for this, but Mac laptops aren’t generally beefy machines, so that’s not an optimal solution.There used to be sandbox_exec, but I’ve heard they removed it entirely from this version. We’re now supposed to get things from the (cr)App Store, which guarantees the app will only have entitlements that Apple approves. But vendors are abandoning the App Store in droves for many good reasons, and after recent events I don’t totally trust Apple to prevent malicious use piggybacking on top of a legit entitlement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SharePlay to Mac (I tested audio) is utterly broken. Shockingly so. I just tried it again, and my music isn&#39;t paused, yet is stuck at 0:02. Pausing and unpausing it, and the song starts ticking, 0:03, 0:04, and so on, but you can&#39;t hear any audio. Pause it again. It goes back to 0:02. Now try this with AirPods connected to your Mac. Connect your iPhone&#39;s Apple Music to AirPlay to Mac. The YouTube video you had playing on your Mac gets paused, for no reason. But at least you hear your iPhone&#39;s audio on your Mac. Now pickup your iPhone. Your AirPods have now switched to your iPhone, that&#39;s still AirPlaying to Mac. You can&#39;t hear your music anymore. You reconnect the AirPods to your Mac. You can hear your iPhone music for a few minutes. Suddenly you can&#39;t hear anything. Pick up your phone, the volume slider in the Music app went all the way to the left. You can&#39;t move the volume slider to the right, like it&#39;s frozen; but the song is still playing. You go to Control Center, and finally manage to increase the volume. A minute later, the volume goes to zero again. If you were hoping to compensate for Spotify Connect not being on Apple Music, you&#39;ll be disappointed.Also, Safari has a bug that ignores your setting to not reopen non-private windows, and reopens them anyway, so if that&#39;s important to you, you may want to temporarily switch to another browser.And yes, it still has the &#34;occasionally laggy trackpad cursor&#34; bug on M1 for me.But other than that, it seems quite a bit faster than Big Sur, and so far (past 2 weeks), very stable on the core stuff."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So glad to see PouchDB included. We use it and have generally had a great experience! We use it with CouchDB on the backend, and Couch seems like a fantastic way to go for use cases involving syncing data between devices with an offline mode and syncing between clients. It was built from the ground up with replication in mind.Biggest bummer of CouchDB? If you’re not hosting it yourself, there’s only one major player in the market that I know of: IBM Cloudant. They contribute much to Apache CouchDB though, and hosting it yourself doesn’t seem too difficult, especially for small, simple use cases.Anyone else using CouchDB?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Last write wins is not a strategy for conflict resolution, it&#39;s a surrender.So I&#39;m glad to hear something else apart from Pouch actually handles it. Anyone familiar with rxdb and can chime in on how they do it?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not directly related to the post (which is focused on which database to host for your app), but I&#39;m writing desktop apps (think DAWs) in C++ and Rust (not JS), and want to synchronize settings through a Dropbox or Google Drive (so I don&#39;t have to host my own cloud sync servers). What&#39;s a good library or schema to achieve this?Personally I usually don&#39;t have multiple instances of the same app open on multiple machines, but other people might open the same or different files on their desktop and laptop.- Not all settings should be synchronized (don&#39;t include machine-specific &#34;recent files&#34; paths).- How should settings be stored locally (if I may have multiple instances of my app open on a single machine)? Registry (Windows-only)? INI with atomic saving (requires care and locking to prevent multiple instances from trampling or racing with each other)? SQLite?IMO Stylus is a pretty good implementation of offline-first cloud settings sync over Dropbox/etc. It&#39;s currently based around one JSON file per CSS file (Dropbox/Apps/Stylus - Userstyles Manager/docs/uuid.json), and what appears to be a transaction log (Dropbox/Apps/Stylus - Userstyles Manager/changes/number.json). Cloud sync has been 100% reliable in my experience, though I do notice temporary file lock errors when switching between different machines in my dual-boot setup (but sync seems to be eventually consistent nonetheless).uBlock Origin is worse. Instead of merging settings, it expects the user to upload and download the entire settings blob at once (and pulling an old blob can erase changes you&#39;ve made locally). And in the past it&#39;s entirely failed to sync because the blob was too big to upload to Mozilla&#39;s servers. (Right now it &#34;works&#34; but takes several minutes for one computer to see a config uploaded from another computer.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My experience is, # of engineers is directly related to # of product people, which is in turn related to quantity (not quality) of ideas that the founders/leaders are desperate to try out.Higher quantity of ideas == More engineers. Higher quality of ideas == Fewer engineers.WhatsApp success is not about what WhatsApp did, it&#39;s about everything they didn&#39;t do. No desktop, no browser (until after reaaaaaaallly long), no account creation (your phone number is enough, thanks), no hidden ad engine, no hundreds of stupid features that product people stuff down in the name of experimentation.There are some leaders who want anything and everything: Throw 100 darts in the wall. Leave what sticks (don&#39;t touch or nurture it). Go back to throwing 100 more. The other guy does that? We want that too. Mobile? Yes. Desktop? Yes. Browser? Yes. Different affiliate channels? Yes. Custom features for B2B partners? Yes. Merchandizing? Yes. Build a mini Ad engine? Yes. Multi user profile management systems? Yes. Yes, yes, yes, every requirement is a go.The crucial difference is: What happens when you have a restricted pool of people, but insist on doing 100s of things? Some leaders simply treat this as an &#34;org structure&#34; problem, not a problem of focus. They slice and dice the org until the 30 people become split into teams of 2-3 with a manager for each, running into coordination hell on each step – just so that more quantity of features can be seen on paper. This is how most startups are, except for those rare few which don&#39;t &#34;talk&#34; about focusing, but actually focus."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m honestly not that surprised about the size. In my experience, efficiency and the number of engineers have not necessarily correlated.For example, I used to work for a company with about 500 employees (relatively large by German standards) and now work for a competing company in the same industry with less than 150 employees. The core engineering team only consists of a dozen engineers.The output is noticeably larger. The number of new features and especially the stability is significantly better. It is noticeable that due to the small team, each project has one or two &#34;heroes&#34;. They are responsible for most of the commits and know the system inside out.These &#34;heroes&#34; have been working on the same or similar systems for over 30 years in some cases and have experienced a lot in their careers. As such, they can bring experience and advice that is just out of reach for others.Given the choice, I would always prefer a small team over a large team."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I looked at it this way. The thing most engineers, hero&#39;s or not, want to work on is new projects and to build products customers enjoy. The last thing they want to work on is maintenance. In my last personally owned company, small as we were, the engineering team and I documented how things worked as part of what we did every day. We found that by having the inner workings documented so that anyone in the team could effect a repair or update a piece of code freed us to work on new products and services. Just having the system continually documented freed our minds and kept us mostly happy (everyone has a challenge from time to time) and productive.The documentation, not that it really matters, was done in a MoinMoin wiki. It was written by engineers, for engineers. We didn&#39;t stop marketing or sales or anyone else from reading it, but the target audience was the engineering and operation staff thus no one had to over-explain the vocabulary of our architecture."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here. I&#39;m surprised to see my hobby project on Hacker News.I know this kind of stuff spark the ``it&#39;s meaningless to rewrite everything (especially Linux) in Rust&#39;&#39; debate. I agree 100% that rewriting Linux in Rust (or your favorite language) is just a waste of time and such a project won&#39;t live long.That said, what I&#39;d say here is that it&#39;s fun. Really fun. Implementing ABI compatibility requires you to understand under the hood of the kernel. You can learn how printf(3) works. You can learn what happens before main().Especially, in Rust, it&#39;s inspiring to explore ways to write a kernel safely and expressively. One of my favorite part is the implementation of read system call [1].Lastly, You can try this OS on SSH. Hope you enjoy :)    ssh root@kerla-demo.seiya.me

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just to clarify goals of the project:&#34;I completely agree that rewriting existing large, feature-rich, and robust operating system kernels is not a good idea. However, a question came to my mind: what are the pros and cons of writing a practical UNIX-like OS kernel in Rust from scratch? How does it look like? This is why I started this project.&#34;[1][1] https://seiya.me/writing-linux-clone-in-rust"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Rewriting the Linux kernel in rust would be a rehash of why we ended up with Linux in the first place: rewriting an older OS from scratch.I would love to see a solid implementation of a real micro kernel based OS based on a message passing core in Rust to become a viable alternative to the now 50 year old Unix architecture. This would give us a possibility of some real progress on the security and process scheduling front, both of which are severely lacking in the Unix model."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For C++ many standard library functions can&#39;t be implemented in standard C++. And it not only shows some very obvious compiler built-ins in the library, but the library can depend on behavior guaranteed by the compiler which is otherwise undefined by the standard. Therefore it&#39;s not always wise to learn techniques from the standard library, as it can depend on implementation defined behavior, and this dependence can be subtle too.Not too long ago it was impossible to implement std::vector in standard C++, as constructing objects next to each other formally did not create an array. Therefore pointer arithmetic on the resulting pointers were undefined behavior, as pointer arithmetic is only defined within an array.This was fixed by the array being implicitly created in certain circumstances."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My advice would be: to learn a new language, simply start writing some non-trivial projects in it (a few thousand lines of code or so). In some languages (like Python), the standard library is the actually important feature, in other languages (like C), it&#39;s better to mostly ignore the stdlib. Example: I started learning Zig by writing a Pacman clone (https://github.com/floooh/pacman.zig) and a home computer emulator (https://github.com/floooh/kc85.zig), the Pacman clone doesn&#39;t use any Zig stdlib features at all, and the emulator only minimally for memory allocation, parsing command line args and loading data from files.Zig&#39;s stdlib is much more useful than C&#39;s, but it&#39;s still entirely possible to write useful programs without it and instead focus on learning Zig&#39;s language features first.But on the other extreme, the whole reason why I learned Python was its &#34;batteries included&#34; standard library."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; To learn a new language, read its standard libraryTo learn a new language, read its standard libraryYes, but also no.The standard library is often more complex and uses more advanced features then you often need for most projects. I.e. collections in std are supper general purpose, but if you need to write a collection it&#39;s normally specific to the purpose you need it for.I.e. std is the &#34;most&#34; general purpose library you normally find so even if it&#39;s written with &#34;KISS&#34; in mind it&#39;s still often not so simple.Then it sometimes uses unstable language features you normally can&#39;t use (as it&#39;s often made &#34;in sync&#34; with the language) and/or optimizations which in most other cases would count as &#34;pre-mature&#34; optimizations.Through without a question you can learn a lot there, you just should be aware of the points above."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was at Lambda when they announced the switch from 9 to 6 months and the elimination of paid team leaders. The feedback was universally negative. In a channel for open student discussion, Austen Allred deleted a poll from Slack because of how lopsided the reaction was. He explained the deletion by saying the poll was &#34;misleading.&#34;Students then got a survey &#34;explaining&#34; why the change was actually a good thing by asking questions such as &#34;Do you understand why companies value mentoring experience?&#34; Not just failing to reveal the truth (these were cost-cutting measures), but not even taking the effort to come up with a convincing lie.It was destabilizing: Austen&#39;s twitter account would read ambitious, hyperoptimistic; meanwhile, drastic changes would be made within the program with vague rationales (&#34;after speaking with hiring managers, we&#39;ve made these changes...&#34;), and probing further simply got deflections or gaslighting surveys.There were a ton of good people in the program, and I learned a lot there. But fundamentally there needs to be trust between institution and student when you&#39;re asking people to make this level of time and financial commitment. And at no point did I feel like Lambda at its top level prioritized student wellbeing over PR, costs, or metrics to be sold to investors."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It isn&#39;t just Lambda School. I mentor for [insert large coding bootcamp here] and I will say things have been going badly across the board for more than 50% of students. They recently had to cut a lot of staff, and completion rates seem to hover around only 50-60% when you take into account all the students they remove from this calculation when they withdraw for &#34;personal reasons&#34;. The employment numbers I don&#39;t have as much insight into but I have definitely had students who I don&#39;t think will get hired easily, and students reach out via LinkedIn 6th months later still looking for a job and wondering if they can work for me.That said, two of our best junior devs (at Arist YC S20) are Lambda School and Ironclad grads respectively, and neither of them had any background in programming and went right from bootcamp into their current positions. So it definitely works for some people.One thing I&#39;ve tried to emphasize with my mentees is the need to go beyond the curriculum (because it simply doesn&#39;t cover enough) and do personal projects. I always tell them the narrative about how back in the early 00s, the only resources available were things like w3schools.com, documentation, and the occasional dubiously accurate blog entry. I was able to learn almost everything I learned not for the sake of learning it but because I wanted to build X or Y. Bootcamps will teach you a vertical slice of some skills that are relevant in [current year], but they do not do a very good job of getting you started on a lifelong process of self-learning and side projects, which is the only way you get anywhere in this industry. Plus the only way to stand out when you went to a bootcamp anyway is having a very exceptional github profile with open source contributions that demonstrates you actually have an interest and do things beyond what is required by the bootcamp."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really wish we had less kneejerk cliche-recycling (eg &#34;don&#39;t be evil&#34; comments) commenters here just looking for confirmation bias because this is a difficult issue.First, kids use sites and apps when they&#39;re below the ToS age (usually 18 or sometimes 13, at least in the US). How are you meant to know that as a service provider? Don&#39;t get me wrong: it doesn&#39;t excuse you from doing due diligence. There&#39;s such a thing as wanton disregard for the truth. But we all know under 18s use IG, Snapchat, Tinder, etc. I&#39;m not sure fining a company billions of dollars and putting executives in jail is the outcome anyone really wants if a 17 year old uses Tinder.Second, what is personal information, exactly? It&#39;s not as obvious as you might think to the point where lawyers who work for these companies can&#39;t agree among themselves. There are obvious things (eg IP addresses, dates of birth, SSNs, addresses, names). But what about media? Photos, videos and sound files may all contain PII, technically.Third, some will say &#34;well don&#39;t store anything&#34;. Well, if a photo contains PII (which it can) then you can&#39;t operate a photo-sharing service at all for risk of storing PII of children. Also, this ignores legal obligations. If the Feds show up with a warrant about a particular user&#39;s actions then the argument &#34;we log/store nothing&#34; won&#39;t get you as far as you think.So I&#39;m not saying Google didn&#39;t do wrong here but knowing the complexities I am sympathetic to the idea of resisting broad legislative overreach as you can end up with bad laws that do just that.And if we&#39;re going to start singling out tech giants for lobbying Congress, my question is why them in particular? We currently have a Senate that is essentially beholden to the personal interests of one unelected rich guy: Charles Koch. Koch lobbies against health care, taxes on the rich and infrastructure in the Senate. Around the country, he has been instrumental in defeating public transit and many other initiatives in many cities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; A week before the meeting, the Federal Trade Commission announced that it was considering making changes to its interpretation of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, which prohibits companies from collecting information about kids under the age of 13 without parental permission.How would that work in practice? A lot of us here operate websites. Your website gets a request. How are you supposed to tell the age of the person that request came from? Maybe Google / Facebook have enough data to identify the person and their age, but ironically, they would have to collect information about them to determine that it&#39;s a person they shouldn&#39;t collect information about.Certainly no child in the history of the Internet has ever lied to a website when asked their age."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;We have been successful in slowing down and delaying the [ePrivacy Regulation] process and have been working behind the scenes hand in hand with the other companies,&#34; the complaint quoted Google executives as saying in a memo ahead of the meeting. The August meeting could &#34;find areas of alignment and narrow gaps in our positions and priorities on child privacy and safety.&#34;This sounds like a starting point for further investigation.Perhaps the litigation will reveal more about what is going on inside Big Tech."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Am I the only one who&#39;s seeing &#34;sealed&#34; classes as an unfortunate development?I can&#39;t count how many times I had to resolve to using PowerMock and hacking bytecode just to mock something in one of the libraries I use because it&#39;s ingenious author &#34;final&#34;-ed the whole API surface of the library (and bits of the implementation usually).Now this gives even greater tool to people who love to lock everything up and think that they know better than me what I need."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unfortunately it looks like Java is going to evolve enough to take the wind out of the sails of Kotlin and Scala for most dev shops. I guess the positive take is that those improvements might not have happened without the efforts to develop better JVM languages."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Glad to see Java improve, but I still would like to see more ML features:- ~Exhaustive pattern matching~ it’s here!- Algebraic data types- Tail call optimisation- Do notation- Operator overloadWhy not use another language? Well, the name “Java” guarantees buy-in at this point. Maybe it will eventually be a Trojan horse for ML :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For a moment I thought this was going to be a version of the site with megabytes of javascript, 50+ third-party tracking/ad network/analytics scripts, facebook/twitter/reddit &#34;share&#34; links, a cookie consent dialog allowing me to accept all or &#34;manage my preferences&#34;, autoplaying videos about an unrelated story on each page, a sidebar with thumbnails + clickbait headlines that distracts from the main content, and a popup window that appears once I scroll down past 30% inviting me to subscribe.I was pleasantly surprised."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With a different registrar to ycombinator.com, this is likely not owned by Y Combinator, and therefore difficult to trust that it won&#39;t start being malicious in the future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This solves a longstanding problem. When recommending &#34;hacker news&#34; to people, they would immediately get suspicious. What&#39;s up with this weird address? Why combinator? It would immediately devolve into weird discussions. It&#39;s actually linked to Haskell Curry, who was neither Indian, nor Greek, despite this lambda thing. And no, this is not a new Covid variant. A real nightmare. But thankfully, all this is over now."</p>
