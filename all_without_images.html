								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Looks like it uses system webviews instead of bundling a copy of Chromium? This to me seems like the real headlining feature, but strangely I had to dig pretty deep to find it: https://tauri.studio/en/docs/getting-started/technical-detai...I kind of wonder why it took this long for someone to try this approach. It just makes a whole lot more sense on the surface.Interesting thing I just thought about: since users don&#39;t get to choose their system webview, I wonder if this has the potential to broaden browser diversity a little bit?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This kind of makes me think... is there room for a much more stripped down version of Chromium that is suitable for lower memory footprint? Or is this impossible?It looks like Tauri uses system webviews, which use a lot less memory, but the burden is then on the developer to make sure that they build essentially 3 (maybe more) UI&#39;s on platforms that might change under their feet. That&#39;s why the Electron approach is simpler - it trades of performance for uniformity of experience across the major platforms.But I&#39;m wondering if it really has to be this way. Do modern browsers really need 2G of RAM in order to send and receive messages in a chat box (looking at you, Slack)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A more common scenario I see is that people start with a monolith that ends up inheriting all the conceptual debt that accumulates as a project evolves. All this debt builds up a great desire for change in the maintaining team.A champion will rise with a clean architecture and design in microservice form that addresses all high visibility pain points, attributing forecasted benefits to the perceived strengths of microservices. The team buys into the pitch and looks forwards to a happily-ever-after ending.The reality though is that the team now has multiple problems, which include:- Addressing conceptual debt that hasn&#39;t gone away.
- Discovering and migrating what the legacy system got right, which is often not documented and not obvious.
- Dealing with the overheads of microservices that were not advertised and not prominent at a proof-of-concept scale.
- Ensuring business continuity while this piece of work goes on.I would propose alternative is to fix your monolith first. If the team can&#39;t rewrite their ball of mud as a new monolith, then what are the chances of successfully rewriting and changing architecture?Once there is a good, well functioning monolith, shift a subset of responsibility that can be delegated to a dedicated team - the key point is to respect Conway&#39;s law - and either create a microservice from it or build a new independent monolith service, which aligns more to service oriented architecture than microservices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hahaha. I have been saying the same for years but have either been punished by my managers or mercilessly downvoted on HN.Somehow mentioning that microservices might not be perfect solution in every case triggers a lot of people.I have actually helped save at least one project in a huge bank which got rolled from 140 services into one. The team got also scaled down to third of its size but was able to work on this monolithic application way more efficiently. Also reliability, which was huge issue before the change, improved dramatically.When I joined, I have observed 6 consecutive failed deployments. Each took entire week to prepare and entire weekend to execute (with something like 40 people on bridge call).When I left I have observed 50 consecutive successful deployments, each requiring 1h to prepare (basically meeting to discuss and approve the change) and 2h of a single engineer to prepare and execute using automation.Most projects absolutely don&#39;t need microservices.Breaking anything apart brings inefficiencies of having to manage multiple things. Your people now spend time managing applications rather than writing actual business logic. You have to have really mature process to bring those inefficiencies down.If you want to &#34;do microservices&#34; you have to precisely know what kind of benefits you are after. Because the benefits better be higher than the costs or you are just sabotaging your project.There are actually ways to manage huge monolithic application that don&#39;t require each team to have their own repository, ci/cd, binary, etc.How do you think things like Excel or PhotoShop have been developed? It is certainly too large for a single team to handle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with creating a dichotomy between &#34;monolith&#34; and &#34;microservices&#34; is that... well... it doesn&#39;t make any sense. You describe your &#34;microservices&#34; and I&#39;ll explain how it&#39;s really just a monolith.&#34;So let me get this straight, you have a Billing package and an Ordering package. How are these organized again?&#34;-&gt; &#34;We have a distributed system.&#34;&#34;So you you compile them together and deploy them horizontally across many machines? Like a distributed monolith?&#34;-&gt; &#34;No we use microservices. The two packages are compiled and deployed separately so there is no code dependencies between them.&#34;&#34;Okay. So if I understand this right, you develop each package separately but they both access the same database?&#34;-&gt; &#34;No no no no! Microservices are not just about code dependency management, they are also about data ownership. Each package is developed and deployed separately and also manages it own database.&#34;&#34;Ah, so you have two monoliths?&#34;-&gt; &#34;...&#34;You see the problem is that the above terms are too broad to describe anything meaningful about a system. And usually &#34;monolith&#34; is used to described the dependencies between code whereas &#34;microservices&#34; is used to describe dependencies about data. It turns out there is a lot of overlap.Design and implement your systems according to your use-case and stop worrying about how to label them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m so disappointed in this. Whatsapp is a functional tool. It was successful since it worked.Facebook has entirely failed to utilise it - to allow external systems to connect in so that businesses can do business on there. The voice calls are also a disaster.They&#39;ve now come along to start messing with the privacy to start selling ads.  It is insane that they&#39;re able to make such a mess of this. Is there a word for anti-innovation?Considering that they&#39;re linking Facebook ad platform with the chats, and they&#39;re forcing this upon everyone, why isn&#39;t this covered by the monopoly laws? Most of us paid some money for the app."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s absurd this article doesn&#39;t try to describe what the changes actually are. The privacy policy change doesn&#39;t functionally change anything about what data is collected or shared with Facebook. Metadata collection for ad targeting has been allowed by the privacy policy since 2016."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly, as an engineer, looking at the way FAANG are becoming middle-men in just about every part of human life, I would rather ban all social media and more generally mass communication software outright than try and regulate it. It feels to me like it&#39;s gotten to the point where this type of software is doing more harm than good.I know that the software itself is not the issue, the tech has potential to do good, but as humans we are just better off without it, if you ask me.PS. Not looking to argue. Just wanted to vent."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I keep warning small time (ie most) FB page owners who advertise on FB to be very very careful as they are being subjected to a beefed up version of the psychological manipulation that regular users face as they, not the regular users, are the main customers.Facebooks corporate incentive is to get you to FEEL like your getting good value out of advertising on Facebook and to get you addicted to doing it.Not to actually deliver results.So don&#39;t trust any metric they show you, because even if its not a total fabrication it&#39;s still presented in a way to deceive you to think its better than it is.Always monitor your ROI and always calculate it using your truly end goal (sales, or in the case of civil society some sort engagement off Facebook that&#39;s tightly bound to you mission). Likes, shares, comments and reach should NEVER be the goal. Even if FBs interface is trying to convince you otherwise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It took time, and many thousands of dollars, before I realized that the vast majority of “likes” my pages received as a result of paid campaigns on FB were from accounts which were clearly not real people.A simple look enough of their profiles revealed that, like would he expected from any fly by night CPA network, FB was using bots, or at least straw man accounts run by low-cost staff, to like and view content which FB was paid to advertise.Worse, I found that the clickthrough metrics reported by them to off-FB destinations I advertised NEVER was anywhere close to what was reported on the destination, including when tracked by Google Analytics.In short: like-fraud, click-fraud, and more.I cannot be the only person to notice these things. I assume it persists because most people, self included, simply complain and move on once we notice the “game” but don’t sue."</p>

If it does anything it will just encourage the behavior.If it is any consolation lots of other people receive nasty kookmail messages -- I know first hand, in addition to the ones I get directly some of the kooks like to send massive carbon copy blasts-- as a result I have a bunch of very strange mail rules, like discarding any email that copies both a whitehouse.gov email address and Jeff Bezos, or another if both George Soros and Noam Chomsky are copied."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When making changes to a block of code or block of text, I frequently just comment out the code and rewrite it anew. I might copy-paste existing code (just to avoid stupid transcription errors). If its too large to see both what I&#39;m writing, and the old code, at the same time, I just use two windows on the same file.This is relevant to writing fiction or non-fiction as well.For example, I didn&#39;t like this, so I commented out:&gt;though his companions jogged just behind him, he would have barely seen them at all had he look. They ran, with their heads down, attentive only to their feet slapping the muddy earth, tracking the path they followed, their breath ragged.and wrote this, using the commented-out text as a reference:The fog was now so dense that he could see nothing ahead of him. He ran with his head down, breath ragged, attentive only to his feet slapping the muddy earth, tracking their path. His companions followed close behind."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sad to see so much judgement in this thread from developers who can&#39;t fathom why others would need this. &#34;Sounds like trial an error.&#34; &#34;Develop a better memory.&#34;Programming is not black and white, there is no right or wrong way to do it. OP discovered a problem they had and wrote a solution for it, believing that others might need to solve the same problem. Clearly they were correct based on plenty of others chiming in with their own anecdotes, or tools they&#39;ve discovered that help alleviate the same issue in other ways.If you&#39;ve never had to UNDO/REDO a block of code to revisit a previous state before moving forward again, kudos.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My experience doing perf optimizations in real world systems with many many people writing code to the same app is a lot of inefficiencies happen due to over fetching data, inefficiencies caused by naively using the ORM without understanding the underlying cost of the query, and lack of actual profiling to find where the actual bottlenecks are (usually people writing dumb code without realizing it&#39;s expensive).Sure, the framework matters at very large scale and the benefits from optimizing the framework become large when you&#39;re doing millions of requests a second over many thousands of servers because it can help reduce baseline cost of running the service.But I agree with the author&#39;s main point which seems to be that framework performance is pretty meaningless when comparing frameworks if you&#39;re just starting on a new project. Focus on making a product people wanna actually use first. If you&#39;re lucky enough to get to scale you can work about optimizing it then."</p>

I try to make sure each endpoint makes only a couple of queries. Each query may have multiple CTEs, but it&#39;s still only a single round-trip.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Really interested to see what this does to Deliveroo. I live in central London on a pretty busy street and it&#39;s really wild how many Deliveroo drivers there are. In front of most of the popular takeaway restaurants there are 3-5 drivers waiting at any given time. The increase in delivery and decrease in normal foot traffic during the pandemic has made this really stick out.Deliveroo already totally robs these restaurants. Even for a click and collect order where I get the food myself Deliveroo takes ~20-30%. I assume this will cause Deliveroo to either increase fees or reduce service which may inspire more restuarants to hire their own delivery people again.Overall I think this is a good thing, especially now. These gig workers have been absolutely essential to society over the past year. People have been able to safely shelter in their home while these guys (it&#39;s mostly guys) go out and take all the risks. Let&#39;s pay them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The court made very specific arguments:1. Uber set the fare which meant that they dictated how much drivers could earn
2. Uber set the contract terms and drivers had no say in them
3. Request for rides is constrained by Uber who can penalise drivers if they reject too many rides
4. Uber monitors a driver&#39;s service through the star rating and has the capacity to terminate the relationship if after repeated warnings this does not improveEven if this does hurt Uber short-term, it sounds like the gig economy will be just fine, as long as companies change their behaviour with respect to the above points."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know anything about how the law works, but it seems to accord with the reality of how people tend to think of jobs.Have you ever met an Uber driver who didn&#39;t give the impression that this was what he did all the time? I haven&#39;t, though I imagine not everyone is full time. It&#39;s quite a way from the idea that anyone with a car can give someone else a ride. For instance, I&#39;ve never met a driver who happened to be going where I was going, or someone who thought they&#39;d just make few extra bucks on their day off. They must exist but it seems to not be the norm.At the same time, we&#39;re shoehorning old ideas of what&#39;s work into a modern setting, because it&#39;s reasonably quick to become a driver, and communications with the employer are minimal. Uber doesn&#39;t seem like the kind of firm where drivers might have a teambuilding excursion, though perhaps I&#39;m wrong."</p>

In this case, that was Raj, a colleague of his in India, and a senior Citibank official in Delaware named Vincent Fratta.The names of these individuals seems like an unnecessary detail, especially since the article names the software interface as the culprit.  I can&#39;t help but think about the recent NYT/SSC incident."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To be sure, this is an ugly UI but this is not necessarily a pure UI issue at root.Internal applications have to be more complex that external applications - that&#39;s why you sometimes have to call a company to do something the consumer frontend doesn&#39;t support. The employees are expected to operate a more powerful/flexible system than the customer, and I think there&#39;s always a risk inherent there.In this case, it&#39;s likely that it&#39;s not just a dumb UI thing that the employee &#34;needed to set the &#34;front&#34; and &#34;fund&#34; fields to the wash account as well as &#34;principal.&#34; I suspect thank &#34;front&#34; and &#34;back&#34; are actually real business concepts in how the bank models transfers which the employee/reviewer did not understand well. Instead they expressed a different model of a transfer (an external one) which is a totally legitimate use case, just not the intended one.That&#39;s kinda one level of empathy, I suspect this really happened because these users think about these operations as &#34;I check this box, then I check that box&#34; rather than &#34;I get how transfers work and I am going to express my intention using that understanding.&#34; So it&#39;s probably much more of a training issue, because to give these people a very narrow and polished consumer-style frontend would take away the flexibility they likely need to actually execute their roles."</p>

So exited for all the sciencing this nuclear-powered, sample-drilling, laser-zapping behemoth can do when it joins its friends on the only planet (known) to be inhabited solely by robots.Edit: Percy is about to release its two 77 kg Cruise Mass Balance Devices (is this what NASA calls &#39;weights&#39;?) to setup the right lift-to-drag ratio for entry. Mars InSight will be listening for the 14,000 km/hr impacts of these weights, providing useful calibration data. We wrote about this in this week&#39;s issue of our space-related newsletter, Orbital Index - https://orbitalindex.com/archive/2021-02-17-Issue-104/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something I don&#39;t understand: when they say &#34;X is 1 minute from happening&#34;, does that mean it&#39;s really 1 minute from happening or does that mean &#34;in 1 minute we&#39;ll receive the signal that X has happened&#34;?Maybe my question makes more sense in the case of &#34;X is happening right now&#34;, because then I should either understand &#34;we infer that X should have happened right about now&#34; or &#34;we have confirmed via signal that X has happened&#34;, and that&#39;s a big big difference.I know in some cases they explicitly say the latter, so I guess my real real question is, do they just keep the communication delay implied in all countdowns &amp; references in discussion, to avoid confusion?(ETA: No need to let me know about simultaneity problems in relativity — earth and mars are, relative to c and to macroscopic time scales, essentially not moving relative to each other AFAIK, so that simultaneity is essentially well-defined. My question was about a much more boring classical-universe problem.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a great achievement with some really interesting work done on the landing algorithms with terrain recognition and it seemed to have worked exceptionally well.Looking forward for the next landing in May of the Chinese rover and all the science these robots will produce. Also, the test of Ingenuity, the helicopter, will be very interesting to watch, that could really pave the way for a different exploration style in the future.And finally, maybe the next transfer window will already see some Starships, that would really change everything."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was at PowerBI in Microsoft, all the execs hailed it as Startup within Microsoft. Come work here instead of Uber. I worked like a dog, sometimes till 2am in morning. My manager would routinely ask us to come on weekends. I was naive, I thought we are growing customer base, this is what a startup looks like.The ultimate realization was in a startup you have equity, a decent amount in a good startup. At Microsoft it was a base salary and set amount of stock. What we did moved very little of the top revenue metric. It made little difference if I worked like a dog, or slacked. The promos were very much “buddy buddy” system.In the end I realized you can’t have startups in big companies (esp as an engineer you don’t have the huge upside  if the startup is successful, your upside is capped)Startups work because you have skin in the game, when you build something people want, you get to reap rewards proportional to it. That correlation and feedback loop is very important.At big companies you don’t have the the same correlation. Some big shot exec they hired reaps far far more on the work you did.Equity is what builds wealth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I mean, sure, but it also misses the point a bit. &#34;Startup in a big company&#34; doesn&#39;t mean &#34;yo take some cashdollar and try build and release something to the public&#34;, but it does mean &#34;hey, take a small team and do your own thing with less oversight and process overhead from higher-ups&#34;.The team I worked in at AWS was like this and it felt a lot like startup teams I&#39;ve worked with. That didn&#39;t mean we could take &#39;brand and legal risk&#39;, and if that&#39;s what you want then definitely go and start your own thing.If you want more autonomy and higher velocity than is normal at corporates, then a &#39;startup within a big company&#39; might actually work out for you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not sure why everyone seems so focused on the cafeteria thing. I&#39;m not sure people and their attitudes towards amenities are really the problem here.From my understanding, the differerence is the companywide attitude to risk. A startup has a &#34;grow at any cost, or maybe perish&#34; attitude. If things go south, bankruptcy will take care of the leftover excess risk (barring criminal charges). A bigco cannot easily go bankrupt, even less a single department. There are tons and tons of capital to eat through if the accumulated risk is realized in cost. So a bigco has to do something about that risk somehow, because most of the company wants to keep what capital it has, only a small part of it really wants to risk things. So the only means to have a situation where you don&#39;t risk bigco for a single department is not making it a department. Make it a Ltd. in a holding or something."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good riddance, in my opinion. 40 million copies of a thick catalog with glossy pages means a couple shittons of not just trees but petroleum and petrochemicals for production, distribution, and disposal. Every year! And ten years ago, it was nearly 200. https://archive.is/rHAhGCan you even imagine a stack of one million catalogs?That&#39;s space, trees, plants, mammals, birds, insects, mushrooms, ... all being squeezed for a glossy catalog, most of which will get thumbed through once or twice and sent to the landfill to rot.These catalogs do not biodegrade well, by the way, because they&#39;re not just paper.I love paper books, and I enjoyed browsing this catalog just like many others in this thread, and yet I don&#39;t think I will miss this one. Hopefully, other thick glossy catalogs will follow suit.Production of catalogs like this squeezes our biome, and if we don&#39;t turn back, it will pop, and we&#39;ll be left with only enough resources for a small fraction of us to survive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am genuinely upset about this. I have such fond memories of thumbing through endlessly as a teenager and dreaming of having my own spaces that were so wonderfully busy and eclectic. My wife and I were just at IKEA last week picking up a new bed for our growing toddler, I glanced at the catalogs as we passed and decided against picking one up. I hope I can still get my hands on a couple old copies to keep on my bookshelf.Edit: Just placed an order for the specific catalog year I have so many memories of reading. One of my sillier purchases, but it feels like a piece of personal history."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Somewhat unrelated IKEA has been brought to it&#39;s knees during the pandemic and it has made their online ordering completely useless.  For a company shifting focus to online only I would think they would want to be able to ship some things purchased online.Stock is also low in the Portland store, but even the few items available can&#39;t be purchased online and shipped to me. I&#39;ve tried to order a number of things recently and they won&#39;t ship anything to my house."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I would normally be appalled by such an action, but the supply issues for RTX 30x0 cards are beyond ridiculous. Mining trashes the environment and, for the majority of crypto assets/volumes, does not provide genuinely valuable economic activity besides speculation (I say that as someone who has put thousands of dollars into crypto in the past). Why should people who want to try some ML/DL at home (maybe they even need it for a class they&#39;re taking), and might also want to play the occasional game, have to pay an arm and a leg to get their (remaining) hands on a modern, efficient card?I really wish Nvidia would do this across the RTX product line.Edit: the &#34;Syrian refugee crossing into Europe&#34; trope might pop up as a counter-argument for crypto. I am Syrian and still have relatives there. Refugees&#39; assets are a drop in the ocean of speculators&#39; mining and HODLing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sounds like it&#39;s time to crack some NVIDIA drivers. I already do it for the video encoding limitations, why not this too? Miners are willing to go to some really hacky extremes, reflashing firmwares, custom fan mods, extreme overclock configurations, etc to maximize hashrates and certainly won&#39;t care if they have to jump through some hoops to patch a specific version of the Linux driver or enable unsigned drivers on Windows, as long as they make more profit.Good luck with this one NVIDIA but you&#39;re playing a losing game. As soon as one un-restricted version of the driver exists, this is as good as useless and demand will be the same as ever for these cards unless they&#39;re able to ship CMP cards at a very high rate, but my understanding is the restriction here is silicon.Let&#39;s not forget that last time they produced &#34;mining only&#34; cards, people managed to crack the drivers to render graphics too... this is no exception.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY4s35uULg4"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Gamers hate miners, they&#39;re driving the price up, make hardware impossible to get ect ... It&#39;s a really problematic situation. Almost 6 month after launching new graphic cards from AMD / NVIDIA good luck gettting an RTX 30xx or 6800.On a side note all those virtual currency are just plain wrong on the environment side, it does not make any sense in 2021 to have a currency that need heavy computation thus increasing power consumption. When people designed those currency they def did not think about that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A key part of this legislation is the requirements for tech companies to provide selected news organisations with advance notice about changes to ranking algorithms. This has been generally overlooked in the reporting and discussion but I believe it is the actually the most important part of the legislation. It will give the selected news organisations an enormous advantage over other companies not included and protect them from new competitors, basically entrenching the current media landscape for the foreseeable future.Given the current Australian government&#39;s cosy relationship with a particular media company that currently dominates the media landscape here, I don&#39;t think it is coincidence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I live in Australia and while I&#39;m excited to see less Facebook use, I see a lot of comments saying things like, &#34;good, Facebook monetized an addiction model and this curbs that&#34;. While true, the proposed law that has pushed them to do this is incredibly dangerous. The law doesn&#39;t just apply to Facebook, it applies to whoever the Treasurer of Australia[0] says it applies to - it isn&#39;t metrics/rules based: https://i.imgur.com/7RSqXDJ.pngThis means you as a business owner may wake up one day to find that you are now classified as a designated digital platform corporation and are on the hook to now negotiate contracts with every registered news business corporation, AND provide each of them with the secret sauce behind your ranking algos. The only thing that needs to be done to do this is for the Treasurer to file a decision in the Federal Register of Legislation[1]. It&#39;s a shocking amount of overreach, lack of visibility to the process, and a single point of failure in the system.Overall I&#39;m very curious to see how this plays out. Facebook took the nuclear option here, and I highly suspect that news corporations will feel quite a sting from the loss of traffic / platform. I truly feel like Facebook &#34;winning&#34; here and having the law dropped is the lesser of two evils.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasurer_of_Australia[1] https://www.legislation.gov.au/Browse/Results/ByRegDate/Legi..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can certainly see a lot of parallels with Oculus / Facebook.Perhaps unusually, I actually wanted FB to impress itself more strongly on Oculus post acquisition because, frankly, Oculus was a bit of a mess.  Instead, Oculus was given an enormous amount of freedom for many years.Personally, nobody ever told me what to do, even though I was willing to &#34;shut up and soldier&#34; if necessary -- they bought that capability! Conversely, I couldn&#39;t tell anyone what to do from my position; the important shots were always called when I wasn&#39;t around. Some of that was on me for not being willing to relocate to HQ, but a lot of it was built into early Oculus DNA.I could only lead by example and argument, and the arguments only took on weight after years of evidence accumulated.  I could have taken a more traditional management position, but I would have hated it, so that&#39;s also on me.  The political dynamics never quite aligned with an optimal set of leadership personalities and beliefs where I would have had the best leverage, but there was progress, and I am reasonably happy and effective as a part time consultant today, seven years later.Talking about &#34;entitled workers&#34; almost certainly derails the conversation.  Perhaps a less charged framing that still captures some of the matter is the mixing of people who Really Care about their work with the Just A Job crowd.  The wealth of the mega corps does allow most goals to be accomplished, at great expense, with Just A Job workers, but people that have experienced being embedded with Really Care workers are going to be appalled at the relative effectiveness.The communication culture does tend a bit passive-aggressive for my taste, but I can see why it evolves that way in large organizations.  I&#39;ve only been officially dinged by HR once for insensitive language in a post, but a few people have reached out privately with some gentle suggestions about better communication.All in all, not a perfect fairy tale outcome, but I still consider taking the acquisition offer as the correct thing for the company in hindsight."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"9 years @ Google, and I too came from a company acquired by Google. (In my case, Google did not keep our product or tech stack around, so.) And yes, I can say many Googlers are entitled. It&#39;s a fair descriptor. And the pace of work is slower than a startup. In general.And I too have many criticisms of Google. But.Google has entirely different revenue constraints. It can afford an entirely different way of working. That pace allows a more sustainable cadence of development. It can be a more humane place to work, in general.Google can on the whole accomplish its revenue goals without being a meat grinder. So why be one? I think there is a bit of a problem with this guy&#39;s POV where he&#39;s come to fetishize the actual process of the making of the sausage versus the sausage itself.Projects need not be run under insane stress if there&#39;s a steady supply of talent and money to make things happen. Google can afford that. Pace will be slower. Perhaps less competitive. But the core business continues to do excellently.For many of us Google is not an &#34;exciting&#34; place to work. But it&#39;s a pretty good job to have and it pays well and gives access to both great benefits and to interesting technology. And that compensation in _most_ people does yield a sense of responsibility for delivery. But maybe not the survival-of-the-fittest-meat-grinder panic that this guy somehow seems to love."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While he has valid points of how corp life is different from startup, he seems like a horrible, entitled person to work for.General attitude that comes out of it to me, is that your employees growth doesn’t matter, only his vision of product matters. He complains about people being entitled, and at the same time he complains that as CEO of subsidiary of one of the biggest company in the world, he cannot say offensive things in his talks.And most entitled one - he’s sold his company (that he actually didn’t own, from the beginning, like with most startups) and he cannot control it fully anymore? And complaining that he cannot fire people on the spot?He should check his entitlement before complaining about other being entitled by not wanting to put his product vision above their wellbeing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It feels a bit hypocritical when Apple laughs at FB for complaining about their new tracking pop-up yet when the shoe&#39;s on the other foot and Apple may actually have to compete on its own platform they double down and defend their right to be judge, jury and executioner.Apple competing with third party app stores on iOS is going to be amazing. No computer platform should be allowed to prevent sideloading or other stores from competing.This isn&#39;t the case on Windows.
This isn&#39;t the case on Android.Or Linux for that matter.It&#39;s more disappointing it takes 10 years for regulators to step-in and say &#34;that&#39;s bad, no more, open up your platform&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A bit OT, but I still fail to grasp why Apple is allowed to restrict all browsers on iOS to the Safari rendering engine. Microsoft had to pay big because they didn&#39;t asked their users properly for alternative browsers, yet Apple doesn&#39;t even give other browsers a fair chance to compete on iOS.Consumers suffer because Apple controls about 50% of the mobile market and if Apple decides a certain feature will not be available in Safari (e.g. Push API), no other browser vendor can even offer a solution.Sounds to me like totally abusing their market position to uphold their anti-competitive behavior."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can hardly wait to use Amazon App Store to install Amazon and then open up the Epic Game Store to install random game and then open up EA Game Store to install random game and then open up Facebook App Store to install Facebook and then open up the Apple App Store to install the Blizzard App Store to install Hearthstone and then go back to the Apple App Store and update the Blizzard App Store so I can get the latest Hearthstone updates.Going to be super fun!My gaming computer is already filled with like 8 different app stores each completely different then the other and a variety of privacy/security issues on each. All of them need their App Store running in order to play their games, so half the time my computer has 4-5 App Stores running in the background so I can play a single game. And they are all electron/qt webkit apps cause nobody builds apps anymore so each one consumes about 500mb of ram.And each App Store also has their own chat system along with the others like discord.I don&#39;t agree that Apple should have a complete monopoly, but the alternative is not better. And while Android does have the main Google Play Store, and there isn&#39;t to many &#34;alternative&#34; App Stores at the moment. Just give it time, the same thing that is happening to TV Streaming/Game App Stores will happen on Android."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As usual, context matters. If you&#39;re trying to convey complex thoughts about abstract matters, then language is the way to do it. If you are trying to convey deep emotional states, then a photo or video is probably better. You cannot convert the 1st amendment into photos, and you cannot convert the Mona Lisa smile into words.Just try to use words to describe either of these photos and see how they fall short:https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2015-10/19/1...https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2015-10/19/1...Between recorded voice and written text, I personally prefer written language. I like the ability to consume at my own pace, go back and re-read tricky bits, and easily search or quote. Plus it&#39;s much easier to use TTS to convert text to speech than the other way around (at the moment). Maybe someday technology will remove this boundary but currently that&#39;s my stance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The question is whether these advantages are because text is a better communication medium, or because of the limitations of our technology?Take using a computer to type a word versus draw a picture: Effectively everyone who uses a computer can type a word, but I&#39;d bet less than 10% could draw a circle.But put a piece of paper in front of someone and effectively everyone can draw a circle.This points to there being a limitation in the technology for working with other forms of media, not the effectiveness of the communication medium itself.This isn&#39;t to say that text isn&#39;t also a better communication medium, but it is to say, until the technology has improved for communicating with other media, it&#39;s difficult to compare without basing the decision on the limitations of the technology.In other words, most of the perceived advantages of text are really advantages of text being easier to represent digitally (or generally reproduced, e.g., printing press), not advantages of text as a communication medium itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Text is not the oldest - nor easiest to use -, text is a heavy abstraction born somewhat recently in human history.The oldest and easiest is the visual in 3D, then comes the visual in 2D.Those exist since we have eyes.Our brain have dedicated and sizeable infrastructure for that. Children can communicate in 3D (gestures, posture, expressions, objects) and in 2D drawings before learning textural communication with great effort.Text is more regular and reliable in certain contexts (not always, sometimes a pictogram or others are better), when the circumstances are proper for that.Text has its uses, just like all the other forms, not being paramount, not at all!(I&#39;d also argue about that we could read old texts. Sometimes yes, but sometimes we cannot read present ones neither if the cultural and knowledge background is inadequate. Which is just aggravated by the ages)"</p>

				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26174269">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Imagine having a business model so fragile that your only line of  defense is to obscure the cancellation process through these tactics. Do they really think that they can curve their churn this way?I mean best you’re doing is getting maybe another month or so of revenue from a customer who is just pushing the pain of cancelling because they are busy or lazy.And at the end instead of getting what could be a dormant customer who can sign up later again, what you get is someone who hates your company.What an incredibly stupid way to erode the brand of a publication, whose major asset to survive is precisely its brand."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just cancelled and it was relatively painless, to their credit.When they asked the reason, I said that political coverage was unfair. Left is OK, unfair is not.I don&#39;t consider myself &#34;on the left&#34; but I really don&#39;t mind a publication being left of center or right of center. If it&#39;s good, I will pay for it (I subscribed tp The Atlantic at least twice, and the New Yorker once, and probably others in a mix of print and digital).But the NYT has drifted too far down the path of politically-correct fashions, and away from robust debate and discussion of challenging topics and how they intersect with real events.It feels more like they want to persuade me to hold a set of opinions (which shifts rapidly), rather than informing me and letting me form my own. &#34;Persuade&#34; is even the wrong word; more like &#34;pressure&#34; or &#34;coerce&#34;. If it&#39;s all ads, so be it; but when I pay, I expect that I am the customer and not the product. So I don&#39;t pay as of the end of my billing cycle.Also, the NYT cheers on, and even participates in bullying. Scott Alexander being a recent example, but there are a lot more when it comes to politically-charged topics.I should reiterate that this is not a right-left thing. I would have remained subscribed if the NYT had simply drifted left, and concerned itself mainly with arguments betweed various left-of-center factions. Lots of worthwhile things to discuss and debate there, and lots of events to tie it to."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a similar issue with the Wall Street Journal a few years back, and despite having spent the majority of my career working on Wall Street, I’ll never buy a subscription again.I signed up for a really good deal for 6 months of digital + paper delivery, but my paper always arrived a day or two late, so before my 6 months were up I tried to cancel, but couldn’t figure out a way to do so on their website. I messaged support asking them to not renew my subscription, and told them that the paper always arrived late. They responded back that they were going to give me a free subscription until they could figure out the paper delivery. I should have held firm and cancelled, but it seemed lke they were trying to provide good customer service.Nothing changed with delivery, and I followed up a few times to see what was going on. I was told they were looking into it.One day, out of the blue, I received a large bill from them. I called to see what was going on and I was told that my trial was up and since I hadn’t cancelled that it had renewed. A proceeded to tell the about my problems with delivery and that customer service was supposedly working on fixing the problem and not charging me until they could. The person on the phone told me that that’s not possible since they don’t provide same-day delivery to my address. I recounted exactly what had happened, and they basically told me I was a liar, and would not refund the charge because the user agreement says they don’t have to, even though I called within a few hours of the new charge and subscription renewal.The part that really stung was that I was a PhD student and could get an entire year for less than what they charged me for a month. I’ve never had a company treat me so poorly before."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am sorry about the position you&#39;re in. For the last several years I have been balancing taking care of my terminally ill wife who recently passed away, all while working remotely in the web hosting industry. It&#39;s hard to balance. Harder than you think. Setting boundaries will be vital to being successful in any WFH role.Now that that&#39;s out of the way: You need to focus. You&#39;ve described your abilities and that&#39;s fine, but you lack focus. Your qualifications are great, but your presentation is all over the place. You need a single one page resume that focuses on one aspect of your knowledge and experience, and lightly mentions the others. Make multiple resumes, each with a focus on one thing. Use the resume that&#39;s best for the job. I recently saw somebody who must have had 20 different resumes to match the jobs they were applying for. It worked.Also, you might consider looking into the Web Hosting business. If your temperament is as you describe, and you like talking on the phone or live chat, most web hosts will overlook any technical gaps. Those can be taught. In fact that can lend to your focus! Focus on the fact that you know things that can&#39;t be taught: Customer Service, talking down angry customers, talented writing, friendly and always willing to find a solution under dire circumstances. Those are GOLD. Once those are on the table, the rest is negotiable. I&#39;ll email you a link to at least one that is hiring full remote entry level.Additionally, you need to step up your confidence level. Let an employer know that your family is important to you and that you&#39;re dedicated to working hard so that you can support them- and leave it at that. They don&#39;t deserve the other details, and they aren&#39;t relevant.I hope this helps."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey anon, I feel for you, and most of the answers here are giving you a 12-month plan when you need a 1-month plan.If you know Linux well enough to configure Wordpress, how about tech support for a hosting company?  Try making some short email approaches to old-school hosting companies (I used to run one).  They might be flexible enough to take a chance depending on how confident your approach is.They have lots of customers bashing away at Linux, making mistakes, often without the patience to see their own problems through.  Their business problem is that these customers need hand-holding but only pay a fixed, monthly fee.  (the hope is eventually they stop asking and keep paying for years).The combination you can offer those companies could be basic Linux knowledge (no need for advanced cloud stuff) and whatever flexibility you can offer them - especially if they&#39;re not in your time zone.The larger ones might be a tall order, all listing locations by default (Gandi, Leaseweb, GoDaddy, Hetzner etc.), but maybe someone here will have an inside track.I agree with other posters - never mention difficult circumstances in a job application, particularly a cold application.  Just talk about how keen you are to solve their difficult customers&#39; problems, how well you work in a team, and keep the initial approach brief.Good luck! And please update us if you can."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just an anecdote for you- in 2009, I wanted to drop out of college because I preferred partying. I obviously needed income and was dissatisfied with the jobs I’d had in the past (fast food, waiting tables and hotel customer service). Like you, I had always been a tech “nerd” and had built websites and recycled computers for my church/charities in the past. One day I came across a job post for a small SEO firm that was looking for a “web developer” aka clicking around Wordpress, writing some CSS, and writing SEO content. It paid $11/hr. I sent an email and he agreed to interview me. I must’ve charmed him because he agreed to give me a 90 day trial. It worked out and I worked for him for about 2 years before a recruiter found me and got me a job at a “real” software company on a team of 15 engineers. After a couple years there, I founded my own SaaS side business (which went viral on HN circa 2014). It grew to become much, much more than a side business and was eventually acquired by a PE firm.I just wanted to say to keep your head up, remain persistent, keep learning and stay curious. It can be done and hard work (usually) pays off.Stay flexible - even if a job doesn’t seem super relevant to your core interests you never know when it’ll come in handy later. For example, my experience in fast food gave me great insights into POS systems (which I ended up building) and my time working at a luxury boutique hotel taught me how to provide excellent customer service even in difficult situations (one time I didn’t call a customer’s room at the request wake up call time and he missed his flight- eek).Best of luck to you!Ps- just sent you an email"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I previously submitted this story a few days ago[1], where it garnered some discussion and a bit over 100 upvotes, but never made the front-page due to some down-weights in HN&#39;s algorithm. I&#39;m reposting this story at Daniel&#39;s suggestion. He agreed it deserved a second chance to break out.--I noticed that it&#39;s commonly accepted that Bloomberg&#39;s 2018 stories on the Supermicro hack were bogus, costing them a huge amount of reputational damage. However, Bloomberg stood by the stories. I&#39;m very curious to see how this one will be received. I was never quite convinced by the naysayers or the denials by the government, Apple, or Amazon. I think it&#39;s quite likely that Bloomberg will be proven right in the end, this story having been accurate but suppressed for &#34;secrecy&#34; reasons all along.Notably, one of the criticisms at the time was that Bloomberg didn&#39;t name credible sources with first-hand accounts of the events — understandably given the sensitivity. This time, it seems they have been able to do so.Either way, I&#39;m thrilled to see an outlet do original reporting and stand by their work in the face of universal condemnation. We are better off for having strong dissenting views informing us and expanding the narrative. I&#39;m finding myself increasingly distrustful of the work of journalism outlets, but this (and those gone independent on Substack) gives me hope.[1]: Previous discussion here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26112436"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Its weird to see a follow-up to this that doesn&#39;t even begin to acknowledge the broad skepticism of claims except for saying that the previous push-back from the alleged targets was a drop in the bucket.I don&#39;t doubt there are highly-targeted supply chain attacks that happen at the whims of state level actors but the specifics presented by this and its previous reporting still are difficult at best to believe with the reporting as it is presented."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;They shared one other trait; U.S. spymasters discovered the manipulations but kept them largely secret as they tried to counter each one and learn more about China’s capabilities.Putting aside the concerns with the believability of this particular Bloomberg article... how many legitimate security holes are ignored in software purely on the basis of &#34;the NSA figures it&#39;s NOBUS (nobody knows but us) and it&#39;d be good to use it on China?&#34; I&#39;m personally convinced that the spymasters are more worried about keeping a good stock of security holes in reserve instead of actually securing infrastructure."</p>

I&#39;ll have to play with it more, but I was set up in mere minutes and it works at extremely low latency.The fact that this does bidirectional audio is icing on the cake; can&#39;t wait to share this with some quarantined bands.Magic, well done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll chime in with the same intense positivity. In the early days of the quarantine I set up a &#34;walk in theater&#34; on my property where I wanted friends to be able to watch the film without bothering my neighbors with a massive stereo system. The natural option was headphones and I chose between setting up an FM transmitter and trying to get everyone to buy a walkman... or... trying to come up with a network streaming solution. I found the open source implementation of VBAN and tried to write a python script to launch the server and manage finding new connections. It failed absolutely miserably and I ended up setting up an amplified audio system in the rain, much to the trouble of my neighbors also.Needless to say, I love this. The only thing that&#39;s stopping it from being truly wonderful is an Android app &lt;3"</p>

I designed a pair of nice 3D printable headphones [1] and my plan was to make them Wifi headphones so I could roam the house while listening to them. I made a battery powered raspberry pi zero with a nice DAC and set up shairport sync as an Apple Airplay device. That works fine for Spotify, but there’s instances (watching videos while walking in and out of the office) where the latency is a problem.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; during the first year of grad school I realized that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax.I had a similar realization during grad school about a lot of the popular topics at the time (early 2000s). I even used to call them &#34;the hoaxes of computer science&#34;. Things like grid computing or formal methods of software engineering had a lot of resources behind them, but nobody was able to use the results. Instead, very different formats of these ideas are what took root: cloud computing and advanced type systems.&gt; the low end eats the high end: that it&#39;s good to be the &#34;entry level&#34; option, even though that will be less prestigious, because if you&#39;re not, someone else will be, and will squash you against the ceiling.I wish every grad student had been forced to memorize this statement. Build something useable, not clever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This comment really resonated with me, I found myself in this exact situation at 25, in a &#34;very prestigious and selective place&#34; for AI nonetheless. It took me a couple years to realize the smart people are just playing the game, the unsuspecting losers are &#34;playing it straight&#34; and getting endlessly frustrated. I found my balance by, frankly, taking advantage of a system that is FUBAR. Incidentally, I also took some art classes and because they were not for credit, I just flowed and drew ( https://lingxiaolingdotus.firebaseapp.com/art ). Tbh I felt more alive placing some hasty marks on paper than I ever did doing &#34;research&#34; in a lab.&#34;I&#39;m only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns. Here I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in the hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again about to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine, but they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the students wouldn&#39;t require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn&#39;t require the students to learn anything.&#34;"</p>

Personalized addictive content is on the rise (tiktok, YouTube, even Facebook and Twitter curate your newsfeed &#34;for you&#34; ), and these ml-determined feeds drive engagement to the highest possible levels, leading to an incredible waste of time, a distorted world view (mostly the posts with the highest engagement will be those that call for outrage, which leads to radicalization [1]), and just in general a society where our information consumption is determined by black boxes with opaque goals that do not optimize for the common good.I attribute a significant part of the political rift and radicalization that has occurred in the western world in the past few years to specifically this feature, the algorithmically determined, engagement maximizing, feed.[1] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00550-7"</p>

I&#39;ve been trying to break away from Facebook for a while, and recently (the past year or so) I started realizing that my Facebook feed always shows me the exact same posts in the exact same order for days, to the point where I know exactly what post will be first when I open the website.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Amazon has a problem with fake reviews and it seems they are ok with it.I bought a replacement screen from Amazon and it wasn’t working properly. I thought I did something wrong so I contacted the seller/manufacturer and they told: oh yeah, it‘s defective, we‘ll just give you your money back. I agreed and then the person said „cool, now in order to process your request, please click these buttons on Amazon” and they sent me a screenshot showing how to leave a 5 star review. wtf.I refused and asked them to process the refund. First they said they can’t process the refund technically without me pressing those buttons and then that their job depends on it.I requested a refund through Amazon and tried leaving a 1-star review saying that the product was defective and the seller tried to condition me into giving them a 5 star review. This review was not accepted by Amazon, saying that seller feedback should be given on the seller page.  This does make sense if you have multiple sellers selling the same product, but it was not the case here. These guys were the only ones producing and selling it and if the score of 5-star reviews is from people being coerced to leave a review, then it should be there, not on the seller page where it’s very easily buried.In the end I also contacted Amazon support with screenshots and I had to explain the problem 3 times as the customer representative said they didn’t understand what more can they do since I already received my refund. I’m the end, they said “they forwarded the message to the proper department, have a nice day”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazon loves fake reviews as long as they are 5 star. The more it looks like people buying stuff using amazon are happy, the better that marketing is for Amazon. Look at all these people who are so happy to be buying stuff on Amazon, so much better than the alternatives.Amazon could clean this up and then watch the average drop. From the removal of the fake fives but also it makes it look more &#34;socially accpetable&#34; to leave 4 and 3 star reviews. So it costs Amazon to do the right thing by the people parting with money for stuff so they don&#39;t.Amazon are well aware of /their/ incentives and when their incentives align with what looks to me a lot like fraud they&#39;ll play the plausibly deny game.Or perhaps I&#39;m wrong they don&#39;t know and there&#39;s nothing they can do. Amazon employees will probably confirm that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like the fake reviews are merely the tip of the iceberg.Over the last 5-10 years, Amazon&#39;s main shopping website seems to have gone from a reasonably reputable location to an internet cesspool to rival ebay or craigslist.For example, looking for an item one is presented with a wide variety of almost identical products from a wide variety of almost identical, completely unknown brands, with no trust or confidence in any of them.Now obviously, these brands/products are most likely nothing to do with Amazon, they&#39;re just using Amazon as their storefront, and sometimes fulfilment, but it still reflects upon Amazon, and ultimately taints their brand with the same brush.Maybe Amazon makes more money in this way, by taking a cut of this flow through various service fees, but for me it makes Amazon less useful to go to when I don&#39;t know exactly what I want already, and more often pushes me to go direct to a more trusted source."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you haven&#39;t tried SQLite, please do. For years I ignored SQLite and used MySQL (it does the job) but once you see how fast SQLite is, and advantages of having a DB contained in a single file... just go play around with SQLite instead of ignoring it for years like me. It&#39;s neat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An interesting consequence of this characteristic of SQLite is that it makes it a really good fit for GraphQL.GraphQL has the N+1 queries problem pretty much baked into it. You can work around it to a certain extent with a lot of effort implementing data loader patterns, but someone will still likely be able to cow up with a query that triggers a cascade of SELECTs.Or, because &#34;many small queries are  efficient in SQLite&#34;, you could use that instead.I built a Datasette plugin that exposes a GraphQL API to an existing SQLite database and it works so well that I switched from being a GraphQL skeptic to a GraphQL advocate.https://simonwillison.net/2020/Aug/7/datasette-graphql/Here&#39;s an example nested GraphQL query that executes 32 select queries. It&#39;s pretty snappy: https://datasette-graphql-demo.datasette.io/graphql?query=%7..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The Appropriate Uses For SQLite page says that dynamic pages on the SQLite website typically do about 200 SQL statements each. This has provoked criticism from readers. Examples:&gt; &#34;200 SQL statements is a ridiculously high number for a single page&#34;&gt; &#34;For most sites, 200 queries is way, way, way too much.&#34;&gt; &#34;[This is] bad design&#34;Funnily enough, at a recent workplace the guideline was &#34;if it only does 200 queries, you&#39;ve optimized it enough&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wonder how difficult it would be to implement a language for specifying Factorio factories without worrying about physical layouts. This post provides a lot of good insights into how that could be done. Once a factory is specified, a compiler could turn the high-level specification into a blueprint or a valid save file to be loaded up in the game.Of course, the compiler would have no way to lay out the factory with respect to available resource deposits. Maybe that would have to be part of the specification as well? Or maybe the programmer (player?) could pass an empty map file as a compiler argument.Also, this doesn&#39;t give any consideration to the tech tree or enemies within the game. I guess those could be compiler flags, as long as we&#39;re dreaming.Look, all I&#39;m saying is that it would be really cool to be able to check factories into version control."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can definitely see the point the author is trying to make, and I agree that it naturally lends itself to a functional model of how the game works.On the other hand, and this is speaking as someone who has played the game for an embarrassing number of hours all the way into endgame &#34;megabase&#34; territory: my mental abstraction of the game isn&#39;t really functional. It&#39;s directed graphs. Sure, the two views can be equivalent representations, but I find thinking about the game as a directed graph (and reasoning about throughputs in a graph representing a network) to be the perspective that gives actionable insights most readily."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Factorio is a genre-defining game, and I think the number of clones is a testament to that.Factorio is often compared to programming, but it&#39;s closer to Excel where the logic and the output live in the same space. The game does a great job letting the user build with programming-like constructs without them ever having to understand any theory."</p>

It&#39;s very hard to stop even in a two-person household, because so many of the &#34;products&#34; most people in the Western world are used to buying and using since an early age are violators. I am blessed with being quite sensitive to most of them, so it&#39;s an endless struggle with partners and cohabitants.Basically anything bought new has it: furniture, clothes, cars, anything plastic, dyed, glued, particleboard.&#34;Cleaning&#34; products: sprays, detergents, most &#34;soaps&#34;, shampoos, creams, conditioners, have this type of crap in them.Even most stuff which claims to be &#34;eco-friendly&#34; is bullshit, and has all the same crap in it if you look at the ingredients.And it feels like online there is a whole army of &#34;rational scientific defenders&#34; ready to jump into action anytime I mention it. It feels like there is a whole playbook for discrediting this type of comment, and calling into question how &#34;scientific&#34; it is, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Keep in mind this is a meta-analysis using data published in papers that are up to 30 years old and from overseas including China, then applying it to California&#39;s carcinogen list (prop 65) and California commute times.I am sure a followup study will be done to see if this is actually a problem in the USA in 2021.The article is published here (Open access) : https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016041202...Edit: I found this news article from 2003 discussing the issue of carcinogenic new car smells and how manufacturers were trying to eliminate the the dangerous smells while simulating what consumers expect a new car should smell like:https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a15133792/new-car-smel..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So here&#39;s what I&#39;d love if other people here could help me understand.Sensitivity to VOC&#39;s is extremely dependent on the person. My father, for example, had the carpet redone cheaply in his office, and worked there happily 8 hrs/day without smelling anything and without any ill effects.For me, on the other hand, the smell was noxious but bearable, but I&#39;d start to feel lightheaded after about 15 minutes in there. My brother would get a terrible headache after just 5 minutes. (And this is us as adults, same size as him.)Memory foam (e.g. in a pillow) also affects me, even after it&#39;s offgassed for weeks. I don&#39;t smell a thing, but it gives me a burning sore throat after I&#39;m close to it for a couple of hours. But again, zero effect on my dad.And so my big question is: I&#39;m well aware that people have drastically different responses to VOC&#39;s. But does that mean VOC&#39;s harm people differently too, or are we all harmed the same?In other words, does my dad have some kind of &#34;protective&#34; genes where the VOC&#39;s don&#39;t bother him because they harm him less, so he doesn&#39;t avoid them? Or are my brother and I better off because we&#39;re super-sensitive to them, so we escape the harm he might be suffering?It seems like such an urgent public health problem, especially given how many people use memory foam mattresses and pillows. It just boggles my mind that I get a sore throat after just a couple of hours with one, while other people sleep peacefully all night."</p>

 Dunno whether they fixed trying to create such a basic measurement for Texas plants, but it doesn&#39;t seem like it.If you want to know some of the specifics about what &#34;winterization&#34; means in practice for a power plant including natural gas ones, you can read some of the details in that report.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love this. I started laughing when I read the description. I laughed because a Harvard physicist (funded by people like Bill Gates) had the same idea to use cooling towers for their DAC project in Carbon Engineering (linked in your post). But as you say, it is still expensive. They are bragging that their design took hundred of man years!And then you two guys come in with the idea that in hindsight seems completely obvious, use all the cooling towers already out there! The most start up thing ever.I used to be an engineer at an ammonia plant. Many of them already capture and sell CO2 from their process. So they have the infrastructure to compress and sell CO2 already on site. The plant I worked at was in Augusta, GA. Might be worth checking out ammonia plants as a growth market."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Huh, smart idea to piggyback off existing infrastructure. Have you contacted Stripe Climate? They are directing money from stripe businesses to fund carbon removal, and they just put out a call for new companies to contact them.Believe I saw it within past 7-10 days on Patrick Collison’s twitter. Here’s the link. Has details and an application: https://mobile.twitter.com/orbuch/status/1359926307149148162Btw for anyone with a business using stripe: stripe climate is now open for anyone worldwide. I set it up to contribute 1% of my revenues. And it should be deductible as a marketing expense: Stripe let’s you out it on your checkout, invoice and receipt. The founder of Nomadlist found it increased his conversions. Haven’t tested it personally but plausibly it’s actually profit generating.Probably the most impactful climate decision you can make with your business, takes 30 seconds to set up, and may boost your revenue.https://stripe.com/climate"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you&#39;re not injecting the CO2 underground in a stable form, how does this reverse climate change? It sounds like it&#39;s simply a cheaper option in some circumstances for sourcing CO2 from the air (compared to traditional solutions by Airgas). Not to take away from your efforts! I think this is a fine improvement to CO2 process needs if you can replace more expensive air extraction techniques, but it doesn&#39;t contribute to improving climate change without sequestering the harvested atmospheric CO2."</p>

Instead, it had detailed characteristics for a lot of products, with corresponding filters in the catalog; and good user reviews. Since Yandex is good at dealing with unstructured text, even poor data exports by vendors end up organized decently on the service. Since Yandex had millions of users on its other services, they all could leave reviews without much hassle. And since Yandex is primarily a search engine, it knows when a bogus review is spammed across the web.Alas, it&#39;s only available in Russian since it works with Russian shops. Every time I need to look for a product on the English web, I lament that there&#39;s no service that is quite that solid.

We have RSDN (rsdn.org), which is somewhat like StackOverflow, but in Russian.Social networks largely unknown outside of Russia? We have&#39;em (vk.com, ok.ru). Reddit equivalent? See pikabu.ru. IMDB? See kinopoisk.ru.There&#39;s a Russian browser (Yandex.Browser), Russian map service (Yandex.maps), tons of Russian e-mail, hosting and cloud services, Russian Spotify (Yandex.Music), Russian Netflix (several of them, actually), Russian Uber (Yandex.Taxi, which actually owns Russian Uber).You&#39;ll see lots of Yandex services here, it&#39;s sort of Russian Google (except it predates Google by a year or so). Yandex&#39;s primary business is search and advertising, but just like Google, they diversify a lot. And even in primary area, they sometimes manage to beat Google. Yandex&#39;s reverse image search (when you upload the image to search for similar ones) is FAR superior to Google&#39;s.And there&#39;s a lot of unique Russian content on global sites like Facebook, Livejournal (owned by a Russian company nowadays) or Wikipedia."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve found my experience designing gearboxes for Boeing has applicability to software design. For example, the fundamental idea with airplane design is not to design components that cannot fail, as that is impossible. The idea is to design the system to be tolerant of failure. Every part in the system is not &#34;how can we make this part never fail&#34; but &#34;assume it failed. How does the airplane survive?&#34;This is a fundamental shift in viewpoint.It seems pretty well established that making secure software is impossible. Time to pivot to designing software systems that are tolerant of inevitable security breaches.One example of this is compartmentalization. A single breach must not have access to all the sensitive data. Another is backups must be air gapped (or put on physically read-only media) so ransomware cannot compromise them.Compartmentalization is used in battleship design, aircraft design, spy networks, etc. Time to use it in software systems design.P.S. Just to be clear, one still strives to design airplane parts so they won&#39;t fail, it&#39;s just that one does not rely on them never failing.P.P.S. It&#39;s really really hard to sink a battleship as they are so compartmentalized. See the sinking of the Bismarck and the Yamato."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Largest impact, sure. But architecturally it was a relatively simple formula - compromise a widely used package and sleep on it until it was pervasive enough to be a valuable hack. I disagree with this being the most sophisticated though. Unless I&#39;m missing something about this hack, the Stuxnet[1] architecture, complexity, and long term planning feel far more sophisticated than the SolarWinds hack.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I mean, it&#39;s 100% going to happen again, and it was plainly obvious it was going to happen to begin with. We did a Black Hat talk about this (checks notes) 14 years ago, after being paid by a client to audit something like 12 different agent-based management systems:https://web.archive.org/web/20061215050427/http://www.matasa...Agent-based endpoint management is super convenient and is mainstream in modern IT management. But nobody grows up wanting to write the communications software for enterprise server inventory software, so the code quality on these products, which are ubiquitous, is awful. But 99% of enterprise buyers aren&#39;t even slightly motivated by software security when making purchasing decisions, and everyone knows it, so vendors buy fig-leaf audits from vendors who will sell public-facing documents for 2p1w engagements, and IT purchasers, whose performance reviews are based on completing projects and not protecting their companies from $500,000 purchase orders for what is effectively malware, accept those bogus reviews and get on with their lives.Nothing is going to change about this, because nothing is going to alter the incentives. Reporters like Nicole Perlroth will try to blame it on ex-NSA hired guns (as if you needed the exploit chains NSA buys to break any of these systems), but I can&#39;t think of any realistic policy that could be applied to stop these kinds of attacks, not without massively disrupting the technology industry at the same time.Best get used to it, is I guess my point. I mean that sincerely, not as a sort of appeal to right the ship; the ship is already upside down."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Israel feels like the only nation taking the importance and urgency of vaccination seriously.Here in Europe, articles are coming out complaining that the slow vaccination could be harming the economy which, well, fucking duh. (https://www.brusselstimes.com/news/belgium-all-news/154626/c...)Fast rollout. Involve pharmacies. Involve the army. Distribute widely and efficiently. Prepare for months before the vaccine is here. Follow-up campaign to convince vax holdouts. A real War Effort.There&#39;s barely any calls for volunteering here in Belgium. Hospitals and vaccination centers will complain to the government that they are understaffed but you seldom hear them urgently asking for new volunteers to assign to COVID teams and vaccination centers. We spent a ton of time debating whether the social bubble should be 2 or 3 large, whether kids should be 12 or 14 before they count for it, etc etc and those spending that time were the same people who didn&#39;t prepare for the eventuality of a vaccine, and started doing so in late December.Sorry this has veered off topic. The number of articles that can be summed up to &#34;Vaccines work, are good, and israel is doing it right&#34; frustrate little european me. :("</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Google COVID-19 statistics for Israel show that cases and deaths are declining, but not at a faster rate than elsewhere in the world. Reported deaths lag behind sometimes for weeks and new deaths were caused by infections weeks ago, so vaccination may not have much effect on deaths, yet. But the number of positive tests should have gone down considerably with 50% of the population vaccinated. Are all these aymptomatic cases or do the is this due to part of the population not keeping any rules? Does anybody have information why the numbers are sill that high?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The vaccine has 95% efficacy in initial controlled trials. It is almost impossible to reach (within 1%) of that same level of effectiveness in the real world as claimed here. The real world has a big chunk of the population with an immune system that doesn&#39;t respond nearly as well to the vaccine (such as the elderly).Here is an overview of an Israeli study that was finding a more realistic effectiveness of 70% https://dalewharrison.substack.com/p/israeli-vaccination-dat...If anyone has a link to the actual study, please post it! It is really annoying to see news articles posted about studies that don&#39;t link to them or even provide any basic information to find the study."</p>

Edit: Here is a link to an explanation for the form, in English, which was revamped in 2020: https://www.skatteetaten.no/en/person/taxes/tax-return/tax-r...The submission form is essentially a wizard that asks you questions related to your situation and your past year. Depending on your answers, it expands different parts of the form. Other parts, such as tax exempt donations are automatically filled out based on information that the recipients filled out for you.I visited the UX department of the Norwegian equivalent to the IRS (Skatteetaten), and they had almost every device you could think of (eye-tracking being the most fun). No wonder they made good forms.I understand that some people object politically to taxes, but as long as it&#39;s one of the certainties of life (death being the other), I cannot understand why filling out the submission seems so hard in most countries..."</p>

Using the app was a 1:1 copy of the official paper forms. Disregarding the complexity of the german tax law, you had a reference to the papers. So it was kind of easy to use the digital counterpart one was accustomed to.It was disimproved by hauling it into a web app, which breaks with all the usual connections you built with the paper equivalent and is the most UX unfriendly monstrosity one could create. From this year on you HAVE TO USE IT. I deeply disrespect this regression, which forces many people into paying a tax office for their private tax submission.I wish for a swedish/norwegian system, where the state courts you for YOUR money.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve brought this up before, but I wonder if a &#34;JS constraint spec&#34; could be added to the JS standard that guarantees against this sort of (already uncommon) dynamic behavior in certain cases, so that code can be more aggressively optimized when possibleIf you&#39;re already using TypeScript to constrain your code, why couldn&#39;t it generate interpreter/compiler hints?These could take the form of a language-agnostic metadata file, similar to source maps, that optionally ships alongside the JS bundleEdit: Several people have misunderstood, so I must not have articulated this well. What I meant was not a new/stricter subset of JS that forbids certain dynamic behaviors across the board. What I&#39;m talking about is having TypeScript (or otherwise), which knows things at compile-time about how specific pieces of code are and are not called, manifest this information in a way that V8 can digest and act on directly, for that specific codebase. V8 already tries to guess this information and uses it to decide which things to optimize and how, but it&#39;s treating the JS bundle as a black box even though in many cases, an earlier stage of the pipeline already had this information on-hand and threw it away.In addition to being more granular, this (like TypeScript itself) would allow parts of a codebase to continue being fully dynamic while other parts are well-constrained."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"By putting the number of arguments onto the stack, we end up making the stack larger for every single function call.   We also require every access to any stack variable to do math to figure out where on the stack it&#39;s arguments are.That seems an insane overhead for the common case...  If this really does make benchmarks faster overall, it suggests an even better solution might exist out there that does not add overhead for the common case...Perhaps it might be worth keeping track of how many arguments a function is typically called with, and recompiling code for each case?    Then all the checks for argument counts can be entirely removed in the optimized code."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Salary is a negotiation between parties. Looked at soberly, you&#39;re the business, your employer is your customer, and the salary they pay you is really the price you charge for your services.They have no obligation to pay more for your services than they think they have to, compared to alternatives on the market. And you have no obligation to charge less for your services than you can get from other &#34;customers&#34;. Either of you can negotiate the price up or down, and the other is free to take it or leave it.It&#39;s not about who &#34;deserves&#34; what. It&#39;s a simple negotiation, like every other business transaction.The more valuable (and less replaceable) your services are, the more pay you can successfully negotiate for. I guarantee you there are plenty of people at these &#34;location-based pay&#34; companies who&#39;ve negotiated for considerably higher pay than others in their location. Just as there are many businesses (e.g. Apple) who&#39;ve found a way to charge more for their products than their competitors have.So it&#39;s worth learning to negotiate. And, perhaps more importantly, it&#39;s worth learning to provide massive value that&#39;s hard to replace. Or accepting the tradeoffs if you choose not to.Let&#39;s say you mould your skillset to fit perfectly into a commonly-open job description: front-end software engineer. Well great, the benefit is you have lots of jobs you can apply for, so you can easily &#34;fire&#34; one company to go work at another. The downside is you&#39;re now in direct competition with a million other people who&#39;ve shaped themselves to have the same common skillset, so it&#39;s easier for companies to fire you. Competition drives prices down and makes you more easily replaceable. But it gives you some safety due to redundancy. That&#39;s often a reasonable tradeoff to make, but you should be aware you&#39;re making it. If you want the big bucks, it helps to be rarer, and to work at places and in roles where it&#39;s easier to demonstrate your value."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a Bangladeshi, I can tell you that the workers in my country don&#39;t have proper unions. They can&#39;t negotiate. Salary is the last thing on their minds, they can&#39;t even negotiate safe working conditions. They are uneducated, so they don&#39;t know what they deserve. See here -&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Dhaka_garment_factory_fir...So, the cheap stuff that you&#39;re getting is because someone is getting a super bad deal, by exploiting the heck out of workers. Same in China.The garments factory owners are walking away with tonnes of money, leaving the workers high and dry.The more _subtle_ point that the author is making, is that, &#34;wait, if people realize that they can get awesome developers in developing nations for a lower price, I&#39;m not going to get hired any more in my over-priced city&#34;.Good, move to a place where your salary is worth more, and work to enrich that community. Why should SF and NY get all the benefits of economic growth?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you&#39;re running a remote company, there&#39;s another reason (besides fairness) that location-based pay is a bad idea: it makes it harder to create a compensation structure that incentivizes high performance.If Person A is outperforming Person B, but is getting paid less because they happen to live somewhere else, you lose the ability to claim that you compensate people for performance without sounding like you&#39;re talking out of both sides of your mouth. Not only is Person A not going to be happy about that, Person A is not going to believe that compensation at your company is based on performance.Companies that want to hire and incentivize the best people need to be congruent in their messaging around compensation and performance. Claiming that compensation is performance-based and then including a factor (location) that has no bearing on performance is incongruent and will not help to develop the right culture in this regard."</p>

Double doses, 5x what was needed in monkeys, gold standard adjuvants.I would not be amazed in the slightest if they decide to half-dose the vaccine or do away with the second shot or even both. They probably didn&#39;t have time to run the trial any other way"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So many people in the comments are just certain that more money wouldn&#39;t have made any difference to vaccine production, and that economic considerations had nothing to  do with it. The arguments they make fail to simple comparison tests:&#34;If we paid Tesla 2x as much per car, could they really not produce more cars?&#34;They also fail to privileging the status quo - &#34;If we paid Tesla half as much money, would they produce fewer cars?&#34;Obviously, they would. Money influences how easily they can produce cars.  At the margin there must be decisions related to turning money into efficiency every day. And the same thing must apply for vaccines.  The best vaccine expert in the world asked for a yearly sabbatical - 200k wasn&#39;t enough to keep them.  Double that to 400k?  Oh actually it can wait til next year.The question for people who deny money&#39;s ability to produce more vaccines is: why do you admit that any lower price for a vaccine would reduce supply - but you deny that any higher price would increase supply.

Somewhat more of a sober tone than Scott&#39;s typical writing, but still with a dash of his typical wit:&gt; I don’t want to accuse the New York Times of lying about me, exactly, but if they were truthful, it was in the same way as that famous movie review which describes the Wizard of Oz as: “Transported to a surreal landscape, a young girl kills the first person she meets and then teams up with three strangers to kill again.”I have only gained respect for Scott, and lost respect for the NYT, throughout this while saga. Hopefully this is the end of it.Edit: in the spirit of moving on, here are two of my favorite articles since his return, one enlightening, one funny:&#34;WebMD, And The Tragedy Of Legible Expertise&#34; -- https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/webmd-and-the-tragedy-...&#34;List of Fictional Cryptocurrencies Banned By The SEC&#34; -- https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/list-of-fictional-cryp..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Steven Pinker maybe says it best, in a thread where he links to some notable SSC posts:A typical essay by Scott Alexander is deeper, better reasoned, better referenced, more original, and wittier than 99% of the opinion pieces in MSM. It&#39;s sad that the NYT can see him only through the lens of their standard political &amp; cultural obsessions.Perhaps Alexander&#39;s ultimate virtue is epistemic humility: His pieces are long, sometimes inconclusive, and accompanied by diverse commentary because he&#39;s committed to his own fallibility and lack of omniscience.  We should all live by such standards.https://twitter.com/sapinker/status/1360787817459253251"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The NYT article[1] can hardly be called a hit piece at all, considering how little &#39;dirt&#39; it actually contains.What is telling however is the lengths to which they went to connect Scott to anything negative at all.Look at how they &#39;connect&#39; him to Peter Thiel for instance: Scott is a prominent figure in a loose group of &#34;Rationalists&#34;. Some rationalists are concerned about AI. Some people who are concerned about AI also donated to MIRI. Guess who also donated to MIRI? Peter Thiel!The author then goes on to rattle off a bunch of other names who are in turn connected to Peter Thiel in some ways.Like... really?I just can&#39;t figure out why that paragraph should even be the article. Speaking of which, what is that article even about? If there&#39;s supposed to be some story or thread stringing it together, I can&#39;t see it.It&#39;s essentially:1. He deleted his blog.2. Here&#39;s a list of unrelated things people he may know have done.3. He now has a new blog.Cool story, NYT.[1]: https://archive.is/b1tyQ"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Neat concept.  Exploring the difference between what successfully compiles vs. what won&#39;t seems like a great way of getting more familiar with the language.I&#39;ve written a little over 1,000 lines of Zig at this point and I really like it.  I think its key feature is a rich compile-time imperative programming environment (&#34;comptime&#34;).  If you can have full compile-time imperative code execution, you can get a lot of the benefits of more complicated language features (like C++ templates) &#34;for free.&#34;In C++ templates are &#34;a language within a language&#34;, but even templates with all their complexity cannot solve all of the problems you might want to solve at compile-time, so C++ has been gradually expanding its compile-time code execution features so that more and more of the language is available at compile-time (constexpr, consteval, etc). Zig jumps straight to the finish line by making most of the language available at compile-time from the outset, and in doing so avoids the need to add the complexity of templates in the first place.Having &#34;slices&#34; as a first class type feels like a general and powerful solution to the problems that std::string_view and std::span are trying to solve.I am comparing Zig to C++ a lot, which many Zig fans would probably take exception to as Zig does not aspire to be a better C++, but rather a better C.  Indeed many key C++ patterns like RAII are explicitly out of scope.  But to me Zig bridges the gap between C and C++ by solving many of the problems that make C feel too spartan without jumping to the incredible complexity of C++.There are a few things about Zig that give me pause.  I&#39;ve noticed that compile-time feels like a very lazy environment, meaning that functions do not seem to undergo full semantic analysis unless they are called from somewhere.  You can write a function that compiles successfully, leading you to believe the function is syntactically and semantically coherent, only to find that when you add an actual call to that function, the compiler now flags errors inside that function.  This adds some friction to development, because the act of writing a function is no longer a self-contained activity.  Writing the function feels more like sketching it; later when you actually call it you have a new set of compile errors to contend with.I also miss tools like ASAN to catch memory errors.  I&#39;m guessing things like that will come with time.Overall I feel very positive on Zig."</p>

It became a bit of a hang spot, and at some point we had a pretty consistent group of folks who&#39;d go to both. Marisa realized Rust could use something similar to NodeSchool, and started hacking on Rustlings during these evenings — which now a few years later has really taken off!It&#39;s really cool to now see other languages in turn be inspired and follow from Rustlings ^^"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am not surprised that the cost of context switching due to I/O readiness can often be roughly equal between async tasks and kernel threads. Normal blocking I/O can be surprisingly efficient because of various factors, such as a reduced need for system calls.Think about it this way—if you have a user-space thread which wakes up due to I/O readiness, then this means that the relevant kernel thread woke up from epoll_wait() or something similar. With blocking I/O, you call read(), and the kernel wakes up your thread when the read() completes. With non-blocking I/O, you call read(), get EAGAIN, call epoll_wait(), the kernel wakes up your thread when data is ready, and then you call read() a second time.In both scenarios, you’re calling a blocking system call and waking up the thread later.Of course, there are scenarios when epoll_wait() returns multiple events, which reduces the number of context switches. But the general result is that it’s not always easy to beat blocking I/O and kernel threads."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; People often see that there&#39;s some theoretical benefit of async and then they accept far less ergonomic coding styles and the additional bug classes that only happen on async due to accidental blocking etc... despite the fact that when you consider a real-world deployed application, those &#34;benefits&#34; become indistinguishable from noise. However, due to the additional bug classes and worse ergonomics, there is now less energy for actually optimizing the business logic, which is where all of the cycles and resource use are anyway, so in-practice async implementations tend to be buggier and slower.I disagree with this. I feel like using Async programming is actually much more powerfull and expressive than theaded programming, especially with Rust combinators on streams of futures (for examples: futures_unordered), which allow to trivially express complex concurrency patterns (such as: wait for the first two requests to return something and discard the third request&#39;s response, and btw also cancel that request). Async programming also allows for structured programming, where each task is an owned resource of a parent tasks, which means that lifetimes of tasks can be controlled and runaway threads can&#39;t exist (if one is avoiding tokio::spawn). I&#39;ve been developping [Garage](https://git.deuxfleurs.fr/Deuxfleurs/garage) for some time now (a simple distributed object store that implements a subset of S3, not ready for production!), and I&#39;ve been in awe about how easy it was to write these complex patterns using async Rust."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The throughput increase in I/O scenarios with many tasks is due to the number of supported concurrent processes and Little&#39;s law; it has little to do with context switching time, which has a negligible impact on the throughput in these use-cases: https://inside.java/2020/08/07/loom-performance/Low context switch latency only matters when the number of tasks is very small (their data all fits in the cache), and the workload is entirely computational. Otherwise, even the fastest implementation is ~60 ns, which is the cost of a cache-miss, and the compiler can&#39;t optimise things into a simple goto because the dispatch goes through a scheduler that has a megamorphic call-site.So memory is much more important for I/O use-case throughput, and while it is true that the kernel doesn&#39;t commit the full stack memory on thread creation, it&#39;s misleading to think that you get good memory usage. For one, once the memory is committed, it&#39;s never uncommitted (although it can be paged out). For another, the granularity is that of a page, i.e. at least 4K, which can often be much higher than what a task requires.&gt; It is hard to pin down exactly how the alleged advantages would arise.For I/O use-cases the answer is here:&gt; the async version uses about 1/20th as much memory as the threaded version.This could translate to 20x throughput -- due to Little&#39;s law -- although usually less because there are other limits, like network saturation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The fundamental challenge of GUIs is that they have state as a core concern. Unlike most systems, state is not an implementation detail that can be refactored away. It is central to the problem domain. The end user sees and cares about having a stateful system.The hardest part of dealing with state in a complex system is maintaining consistency in different places. Some instances of this this can be avoided by creating single-sources-of-truth, but in other cases you can&#39;t unify your state, or you&#39;re dealing with an external stateful system (like the DOM), and you have no choice but to find a way to keep separate pieces of state in sync.I should probably write a blog post on this"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here is my personal opinion on it (not sure if it&#39;s the right one, though): Write the GUI independently of the model, let the GUI components update and communicate among each other as they like, and perform some validation in these GUI components. Translate between model and view only at one well-defined point at which there is also a final validation at the model side, and make sure model and view are only loosely coupled.Good GUIs have way too many requirements to be controlled (via a controller) by the model. As a typical example, the fact that a button should only be activated if there is data in a textbox has usually nothing to do with the underlying model. The model should only ever contain valid and consistent data."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great discussion on the challenges of designing UI for complex applications.In the aggregate, what ends up being most effective for me, is rapid prototyping, and “paving the bare spots.”[0]I find that I do a terrible job of predicting user mental models.The rub with prototypes, is that they can’t be lash-ups, as they inevitably end up as ship code. This means that a lot of good code will get binned. It just needs to be accepted and anticipated. Sometimes, I can create a standalone project for code that needs to go, but I still feel has a future.So there’s always a need for fundamental high quality.What has been useful to me, is Apple’s TestFlight[1]. I write Apple software, and TestFlight is their beta distribution system.I start a project at a very nascent stage, and use TestFlight to prototype it. I use an “always beta” quality approach, so the app is constantly at ship quality; although incomplete.It forces me to maintain high quality, and allows all stakeholders to participate, even at very early stages. It’s extremely motivating. The level of enthusiasm is off the charts. In fact, the biggest challenge is keeping people in low orbit, so they don’t start thinking that you are a “WIZZARD” [sic].It also makes shopping around for funding and support easy. You just loop people into the TestFlight group. Since the app is already at high quality, there’s no need for chaperones or sacrifices to The Demo Gods.I like that it keeps development totally focused on the actual user experience. They look at the application entirely differently from me.[0] https://littlegreenviper.com/miscellany/the-road-most-travel...[1] https://developer.apple.com/testflight/"</p>

I like for one drawer to be &#34;workout clothes&#34; and have the mix of gym shorts and t-shirts. To me this feels &#34;obviously&#34; right because the use-case requires both items so why pay for two costly &#34;open drawer&#34; IOs?Similarly, she is very organized with her paper files, I just throw mine into a box. In the rare event I need something (eg when doing taxes) I don&#39;t mind scanning through the whole mess.

After all, given that the NYT was now so much a part of the story, writing anything good would be pretty hard.But no, kudos to them, they found a third way: Just write a poorly written article that alternates between interjecting disconnected ideas and making vague attempts at guilt by association, and carefully ignore anything inconvenient.&gt; He denounced the neoreactionaries, the anti-democratic, often racist movement popularized by Curtis Yarvin. But he also gave them a platform. His “blog roll” — the blogs he endorsed — included the work of Nick Land, a British philosopher whose writings on race, genetics and intelligence have been embraced by white nationalists.So he denounced the works of one person who believes bad things, but he also linked to a second person, who may or may not believe bad things, but is liked by a third group of people who also believe bad things, so...logically...that must mean he actually does...support the first person? Despite denouncing them, because he didn&#39;t link to them, which proves...something...?It feels weird even writing this argument down. If you link to someone who supports X, then you&#39;re actually supporting every other person who has ever supported X?

He divides political views into quadrants, Competitive/Collective vs Optimistic/Pessimistic, then says &#34;The only public figure I can think of in the [Collective + Pessimistic quadrant] with me is Charles Murray.&#34; This is what is described as aligning himself with Murray. The paragraph makes Scott sound like a flaming racist. It&#39;s just totally dishonest writing. It&#39;s hard to believe they&#39;re arguing in good faith there, but who knows.The anonymity thing seems to have been well and truly discarded – flung in his face, more like.

We call any remaining invalid value a niche, and this space may be used for type layout optimizations. For example, in Rust 1.28 we introduced NonZero integer types (like NonZeroU8) where 0 is a niche, and this allowed Option&lt;NonZero&gt; to use 0 to represent None with no extra memory.I didn&#39;t know about this, and it&#39;s super cool.

But if it did, then not only is it probably not the first lab-origin pandemic, but it&#39;s also not the first time the WHO initially excluded that possibility.The 1977 Russian Flu pandemic was genetically near-identical to a strain from 1950, without the expected mutations that should have appeared after 27 years of undetected circulation among humans or animals. It&#39;s been widely suspected in mainstream literature to have escaped from a research or vaccine manufacturing accident, to the point that the NEJM casually wrote:&gt; The reemergence was probably an accidental release from a laboratory source in the setting of waning population immunity to H1 and N1 antigenshttps://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra0904322But at the time, the WHO said:&gt; Laboratory contamination can be excluded because the laboratories concerned either had never kept H1N1 virus or had not worked with it for a long time.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2395678/pdf/bul...And it&#39;s absolutely bizarre to me that people are asking why the origin even matters. After thousands of people died in Bhopal, did it matter whether better chemical safety standards could have prevented that?

This might be a annual membership, in return for which you get ... early access to annual roadmap pdf.  Or an online video from the main devs explaining what they are doing for five minutes (#)What if there existed something to Make the above easy and simply to do - a small foundation who&#39;s job is to keep membership rolls and accept payments from companies on behalf of any foss project that signs up (it&#39;s something I imagine patreon could offer). They then ensure that the (minimal contract) is adhered to in some manner.(#) Seriously - you could set up a zoom call with 1-5 devs and just hit record once a year - I promise that 99% will see this as unbearable imposition and then talk for two hours.  And that&#39;s &#34;actionable paid insights into the future of this tool we depend on&#34;So the point being, if your FOSS project gets traction, then sign up to this foss-patreon, tell everyone to click to subscribe and you might might get a sponsor or two."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of people here are accusing Google of embrace, extend, and extinguish, but you have to realize that the incentives here are different from Big Tech&#39;s point of view. I&#39;d first like to point out Python is a programming language, not an internet standard or file format. It gets its utility merely from the ability to develop in it, even without an established ecosystem or network effect. The barrier to jump in, or fork off and start over is far lower compared to a browser or file format.So what&#39;s in it for Big Tech? Well, in a situation where controlling the technology or suppressing it is difficult due to the low costs of starting over, it is in their best interest to promote the ecosystem rather than control it. When they put in the time, money, and engineers to make it better the return on investment can be massive, because of the help they get from the community to grow, maintain, and keep compatible this core component at less cost than if they did it themselves.The incentives align and benefit everyone, especially if there is a fair governance system mediating between all parties involved. The biggest threat to an open source project is therefore not Big Tech collaboration, but project abandonment and lack of maintenance. I hope this makes everyone a little more optimistic about the direction of open source, especially as companies realize the real value it can have for all involved."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The argument of specialist vs generalist is futile. They simple fit in distinct parts of the journey and evolution of a software product.Generalists are highly valuable for many types of orgs and projects especially nascent projects. But sometimes you need the precise output of a specialist to achieve something.If my business has a product that is highly dependent of let&#39;s say OpenGL, then an OpenGL specialist will generate more specific output that someone who knows a little of OpenGL and a lot of other things.However, there&#39;s always the counterargument that generalists can compensate with their holistic view and understanding of problems throughout the whole stack. I understand this and agree with it, but I think there&#39;s a point in every innovation where the generalist contribution declines sharply. And I&#39;m saying this as a generalist.If you are a generalist and you feel undervalued, you&#39;re likely in the wrong project or too involved in phases of a project where your contribution can&#39;t move the needle significantly anymore."</p>

Broadly put, PM&#39;s are good at figuring out the theta, and Engineers are good at the r.I think that with the perspectives that short fat engineers have, they can play enormous roles as &#34;PM&#34; or &#34;Engineering Manager&#34;, and definitely as ICs during early stages of startups. But they clearly don&#39;t enjoy depth, and this can be counter-productive for that 1% of the time where you really, really want depth.I don&#39;t buy the knowledge vs wisdom thing though, there&#39;s plenty of wisdom to be gained from going deep into a subject.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Chick Corea was a god.I learned Spain on the bass in the hopes that one day I could play my meager rendition for him. In a concert at SFJazz he picked people out of the audience to paint their portraits with his piano. How lucky was I to be placed upon such a seat where Chick dismembered me with his eyes, eviscerating my soul upon a platter. He stared at me with the eyes of a musician who had searched heaven and hell for the most tempestuous chordal mixtures. The two minutes I spent in that seat where he painted my portrait with his keystrokes are some of the most treasured moments of my life. I felt like I had been seen, chewed up, devoured, and reincarnated as the everloving Chick Corea sycophant I had always known myself to be.The man was a goddamn monster on the boards and we are all at a loss with his passing. Rest in Power Chick, you&#39;re in my heart forever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The night I turned 18 I was drinking with Chick Corea.
It happened that in 1995 he had a classical music project involving some local orchestra musicians in Modena, Italy, where I was living at the time. One of the musicians was a friend of mine&#39;s brother who invited me to the dress rehearsal in a renaissance villa. Concert was good.After the concert, I got introduced to him and he asked me if I liked it. Shortly after I was drinking with him and others, and I turned 18 right there.:)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a huge fan of Chick Corea; he is my favorite jazz pianist.  I was saddened to hear this news this afternoon.  My very first jazz album outside of smooth jazz was “My Spanish Heart,” which was my introduction to jazz fusion.  I then discovered Return to Forever and the Elektric Band, and I also learned about Chick Corea’s post-bop work.  Chick Corea’s music has been a mainstay in my life for the past 15 years.  I love the playfulness of his piano playing and his compositions, which I feel is missing in a lot of music.  He has helped inspire me to play: I received an electronic wind instrument (EWI) for Christmas that I’ve been practicing.The jazz community lost a legend.  RIP Chick Corea."</p>

This is not a compilation of &#34;K8s sucks, here are 10 reasons why&#34;, which is what my kneejerk expectation was. (maybe I am too cynical...).Overall, this is a fantastic index to some very interesting resources.There&#39;s an old saying that you learn more from failure than from success (whose analogue is a blogpost with a title &#34;look how easy it is to set up k8s in 15 minutes at home!&#34;). If you really want to think about how to deploy nuanced technology like this at scale, operational crash reports such as these are invaluable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The current trend goes to multi-cluster environments, because it&#39;s way too easy to destroy a single k8s cluster due to bugs, updates or human mistake. Just like it&#39;s not an very unlikely event to kill a single host in the network e.g. due to updates/maintenance.For instance, we had several outages when upgrading the kubernetes version in our clusters. If you have many small cluster it&#39;s much easier and more save to apply cluster wide updates, one cluster at a time."</p>

During this ongoing process, my father, who’d been receiving chemotherapy treatments passed away.Being the “technical one” it fell to me to manage his various accounts. I logged into his gmail from the same browser I’d used LinkedIn, and started to contact people he knew but was out of touch with.The next day, I started receiving email, from my dead father, from LinkedIn. Claiming he’d just joined the service and wanted to connect to me.I still don’t have the words for this, years later.What exactly is wrong with these folks at LinkedIn? They seem like caricatures of actual humans to me now, and I no longer even bother to visit the site.If anything positive comes from cancel-culture, canceling LinkedIn would be my preference."</p>

Then LinkedIn started emailing people because I moused over their post and stuff. Some contact emailed me to ask what I needed from her and it was so weird.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s a shame. I had high hopes at the beginning that S4TF - and the investment in Swift from Google - would help Swift break out of the iOS ghetto and cement it as a mainstream language.Swift&#39;s a delightful language to use.  It has a lot of the nice things about Rust&#39;s type system, but is a heck of a lot easier to use at the expense of a bit of performance.  For a lot of use cases, I think this is a great value proposition.  ML/data science is a great example where practitioners could benefit from a more grown-up type system than what Python has on offer, but would still be able to keep low level details at arms length.I think Serverless would be another ideal use-case for Swift, where the productivity, clarity and correctness tools it offers would be a huge benefit.Some very interesting things came out of the S4TF project - like the work on autodiff, and python interop.  It&#39;s a shame the project never really seemed to get legs, it seems like it just languished for years with no clear direction.These days I do most of my work in Rust, and I&#39;m happy to do so because the tooling, community, and ecosystem is really amazing.  But there are a lot of language concepts and features I miss from swift.  I guess it goes to show that the governance and availability of a language have a lot more to do with adoption than the merits of the language itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Back when I was doing a lot of Swift programming, this seemed like such a great idea. Since then I moved on to Julia. And when I looked at the ML code for Swift and compared it to Julia, I was thinking &#34;How on earth could anyone think this was ever a good idea?&#34;Doing machine learning stuff in Julia is simply much more user friendly than doing the same in Swift. Swift is nice for iOS development, but I think in data science and Machine Learning Julia will always be a much better choice.It is a pity Google did not go for Julia. Julia has gotten exceptionally far despite limited resources. With Google style resources, Julia could have been massive.Despite modest investment, the Julia JIT beats almost anything out there. It would have been amazing to see what they could have pulled off if they had put the kind of resources that was put into the JavaScript V8 JIT into the Julia JIT.Julia uses a method JIT, which are quick to implement, but which makes latency gets bad. Meaning if you load a whole new package, running the first function can cause some delay. With a JavaScript style tracer JIT added into the mix one could have probably managed to have both high performance and low latency.Alternatively with more investment they could have had better precompile caching, meaning libraries that had been loaded in the past would JIT really fast. Julia does that today, but it could have worked a lot better than it currently does. It isn&#39;t that it can&#39;t be done, but it just requires resources."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"S4TF lost out, not to Python, but to Python&#39;s AI/ML ecosystem -- people, projects, libraries, frameworks.Despite its many shortcomings, Python has become the lingua franca of AI and ML, to the point that whenever I come across a newly published AI or ML paper that I find interesting, I expect to be able to find code implementing it in Python.For example, yesterday I saw a post on HN about approximating self-attention matrices in transformers, which have O(n²) computational cost, with a seemingly clever approach that has O(n) computational cost: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26105455 . &#34;Huh, that looks interesting,&#34; I thought, &#34;let me see if I can find some code.&#34; Three clicks later, I found myself at https://github.com/mlpen/Nystromformer -- the official implementation... in Python. A few moments later, I was playing with this thingamajiggy. No other language comes close to having this kind of ecosystem in AI and ML.Julia still has a shot at becoming a viable alternative to Python, especially if the Julia developers can shorten the &#34;time to first interactive plot&#34; to make it as fast as Python&#39;s, but they face an uphill battle against such an entrenched ecosystem."</p>

At this point I don&#39;t even put a SIM in my phones any longer, and only permit them access via a travel router (which does have a SIM, for LTE backhaul) which runs a VPN client and on which I have root to inspect/block traffic.  My latest blog post shows the dozens of dozens of connections that a Mac running Big Sur will make just sitting idle at the desktop on a fresh install.Apple&#39;s products are only private if you want privacy from their commercial competitors. If you want privacy from Apple or the US federal government to which they provide tons of user data (without warrants(!) or due process), you&#39;re in for a constant uphill battle.Using everyday devices should not be creating hardware-serial-linked permanent records that the state can download at any time; to me that&#39;s stuff of a true dystopia.Apple has not yet integrated this viewpoint, and seem to regard privacy as only important against companies that aren&#39;t Apple.  Device backups (full message history and attachments), as well as Photos stored in iCloud, are not end to end encrypted permitting Apple (and by extension the state) to read and access all of it without your involvement.It&#39;s a bummer they&#39;re extending this attitude to browser-related traffic too. There seems to be a new trend inside of Apple that they&#39;re still figuring out here (see also: the addition of ContentFilterExclusionList in 11.0, and then its quick removal in 11.2).Did you know that if you entirely block access to all Apple hosts, you can&#39;t even add a Gmail account to an iPhone?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"These stories usually spur more enthusiasm for buying cryptocurrency, but ironically those buyers aren’t interested in spending cryptocurrency using their MasterCard.They’re hoping other people will buy cryptocurrency from these announcements, driving the price up. Or, more likely, they’re just hoping other people will buy cryptocurrency and not use it in these spending systems.Spending cryptocurrency would result in selling that cryptocurrency, which would drive the price down. That’s not what cryptocurrency investors actually want.Should also note that MasterCard crypto transactions almost certainly won’t be settled on the blockchain. Not with $8 Bitcoin transaction fees.  They’ll just be denominated in cryptocurrency and people can deposit/withdraw in certain cryptocurrencies. MasterCard only needs to buy and sell on the blockchain as needed to provide an FX window. The actual transactions would be stored in traditional database systems (aside from customer deposits/withdrawals, just like Coinbase)Why? Because MasterCard would get to act as an exchange and collect exchange fees. Exchange fees are a great way to charge consumers for spending their own money in 2021, when normal credit cards actually pay people 1-2% to use them. Cryptocurrency’s inefficiency is their financial upside."</p>

Paypal!Since you cannot transfer your bitcoins out, when you sell your bitcoins, Paypal pays you whatever they like.So far, Paypal only offers this in the United States. And do the Americans take this offer? Yes! They buy over a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin per month on Paypal. If this continues, it means that every American from toddler to senior buys $50 worth of Bitcoin per year.Other companies in the finance industry will want the same free lunch. Run on crypto in 3..2..1..This will continue until the first companies will start to offer you to transfer your crypto out. Then slowly the market will normalize. Now everyone has crypto.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Correction: The Fed&#39;s policies have taken $50T of wealth from the Bottom 90%.When you bail out irresponsibly over-leveraged and nearly bankrupted banks and corporations, and pay for those bailouts with tax-payer money, you steal from the poor and give to the rich.Most importantly, when the Fed decides to print money ad nauseam, they create massive asset inflation, which steals from the poor and gives to the rich. This is because those dollars that are printed go directly into bonds, equities, and assets that only a small amount of the population owns a significant amount of. When money is &#34;printed&#34; the Fed actually injects money into financial markets through buying assets. This asset inflation caused by money printing gives more money to the rich to buy more assets, thus driving up the prices of financial products, real estate, and all other valued assets in society. Thus, cost of living skyrockets, but only the rich are actually increasing their net worth (which is increasing exponentially). All of this happens while minimum wage, and most wages, are stagnant.Wealth inequality and social unrest in America is DIRECTLY related to corrupt and/or incompetent (you choose) Fed policies. It amazes me why most people do not grasp this. I think it is lack of education."</p>

But the more polite way to phrase it is that the rich benefit from societal structure 1000x more than the poor and are able to acquire wealth at an accelerated pace because of these structures. Asking the wealthy to pay a greater share to improve society is perfectly reasonable. The fallacy in complaining against taxes for the rich that are already higher than their proportional of wealth is ignoring the fact that so much of taxes goes towards systems that just increase the rate of wealth accumulation. The wealthy reap the benefits of power in compounding ways."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The framing in the article is ahistorical. The post-WW2 period was a period of exceptionally _low_ inequality. If you look back to just the 1800s there were swings in inequality comparable to the present day. We&#39;re now moving back to the historical baseline.There are some contributing factors to the shift in inequality, a major one being that labor is now oversupplied compared to the post-war period, and the competition is driving wages lower. The U.S. has much higher immigration rates now, which contributes to the oversupply of labor. The late 1800s and early 1900s had similarly high immigration and high inequality. [1]Whether the historical baseline for inequality is the best amount of inequality is a different question though. It&#39;s clear that as redistribution flattens the income curve there is dead-weight loss as highly productive people stop wasting their time doing taxable work. It&#39;s also clear that investing in children who would otherwise be malnourished or lack education or healthcare is a net positive for society. It&#39;s not clear to me that the current level of inequality is the wrong one - we&#39;re admitting a lot of immigrants who are vastly improving their life prospects as a result, the economy is growing, and technology is amazing. Spending more money on health care would have limited benefits [2]. I don&#39;t really have a strong opinion on whether inequality should be higher or lower (it&#39;s hard to find a good-faith analysis in these terms), but the Time article uses an arbitrary timeframe and doesn&#39;t shed any light on the question.[1] See Ages of Discord for a much more detailed dive into this. http://peterturchin.com/ages-of-discord/[2] Robin Hanson gives an argument with lots of evidence here: https://www.cato-unbound.org/2007/09/10/robin-hanson/cut-med..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I still cannot get over this product.  They whole selling point of a dyson fan is the &#39;air multiplier&#39; tech, which creates a low pressure zone that propels air through the ring.  According to dyson, this tech can move 15x more air than the fan in the base of the unit.  Why in the world would you build an air filter around a system that does not directly interact with 93% of the air it moves?https://www.jameco.com/Jameco/workshop/Howitworks/dysonairmu..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve spent many hours navigating the air purifier market and it is one of the most opaque and customer-unfriendly ones I have ever seen. Beyond the advice given in the article, it&#39;s also important to check what the filter exactly is. Some filters are washable, but it often means that they are not as thorough as HEPA filters, which is a big deal if your goal is to avoid the dreaded PM2.5 that are as far as I can tell the main threat to health and the pursuit of happiness.A more general problem is that there is a conceptual contradiction between low noise and high filtering. It will be difficult for a silent filter to be quick at filtering your room.The good news is that even a relatively crappy, low CADR setup can still filter a bedroom over time so long as it remains closed. You will however be paying for replacements more often and it might not be worth it if you have to ventilate daily and the filter takes many hours to give you a clean environment.I like the work that Smart Air China is doing. I am not affiliated with them, but they have essentially done and made available the same sort of research as the one highlighted in the article and have long promoted the no bullshit use of a simple box fan with filter combo for lower income and highly polluted regions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bought an expensive Dyson air purifier for a couple of reasons. It has a remote so I can turn it on from bed. It looks attractive. The sound profile is much different than a box fan for sleeping at night. It can analyze the temperature, humidity, and air quality in real time and turn on if it notices air quality is getting bad. It also oscillates.That said yes it was expensive, but it replaced needing a fan for cooling and an air purifier, and if I needed a heater it could have done triple duty."</p>

A huge positive while waiting for it was the regular, informative status emails from the founder.Now they are on to v2 [1] with backlighting and better keycaps.The &#34;Agent&#34; firmware is also regularly updated and makes customising the keyboard a breeze.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Over twenty years I&#39;ve spent too much money trying to get a keyboard that really worked for me... and I finally gave up and I now use the cheapest disposable crap from hole-in-the-wall electrical / electronics shop that I can walk to.Nearly all the DIY keyboards I&#39;ve seen are ruthlessly minimalistic and I really would prefer a larger keyboard with more keys, so I don&#39;t have to remember lots of meta-key combination short-cuts.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve memorised all the keyboard short cuts in a given piece of software in a decade... I just don&#39;t really use one particular thing enough to make it worthwhile.That keyboard with the active LED keycaps came out in what... 2006?  I expected a regular keyboard with small set of active keycaps for macro keys would have existed by now. Come to think of it, I never used an Apple laptop with that active TouchBar thing either but that doesn&#39;t seem to have achieved enduring popularity.  but I guess there&#39;s no real market for that either."</p>

One is just to compress trash plastics into blocks, with no sand.[1] Another is a process more like brick making, where the material is melted.[2] That process is 20% recycled plastic, 80% sand etc.There are problems. UV deterioration. Cracking at low temperatures (probably not a problem in Kenya). Flammability. Poor adhesion to mortar.

Also, the plastic might crack from constant UV radiation under the Kenyan sun.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Regarding SQLite&#39;s performance, some things I&#39;ve found very useful:Use WAL mode (writers don&#39;t block readers):  PRAGMA journal_mode = &#39;WAL&#39;

Use memory as temporary storage:  PRAGMA temp_store = 2

Faster synchronization that still keeps the data safe:  PRAGMA synchronous = 1

Increase cache size (in this case to 64MB), the default is 2MB  PRAGMA cache_size = -64000

Lastly, use a modern version of SQLite. Many default installations come with versions from a few years ago. In Python for example, you can use pysqlite3[0] to get the latest SQLite without worrying about compiling it (and it also comes with excellent compilation defaults).[0] https://github.com/coleifer/pysqlite3"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “But nobody writes production applications with SQLite, right?&#34;We&#39;ve been doing it for 5 years now. Basic tricks we employ are:Use PRAGMA user_version for purposes of managing automatic migrations, a. la. Entity Framework. This means you can actually do one better than Microsoft&#39;s approach, because you don&#39;t need a special unicorn table to store migration info. A simple integer compared with your latest integer and executing SQL in the range is all it takes.Use PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL alongside PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL for maximum throughput while supporting most reasonable IT recovery concerns. If you are running your SQLite application on a VM somewhere and have RTO which is satisfied by periodic hot snapshots (which WAL is quite friendly to), this is a more than ideal way to manage recovery of all business data while also giving good throughput to writers. If you are more paranoid than we are, then you can do FULL synchronous for a moderate performance penalty. This would be more for situations where your RTO requires the exact state of the system be recoverable the moment it lost power. We can afford to lose the last few minutes of work without anyone getting yelled at. Some modern virtualization technologies do help a lot in this regard. Running bare metal you need to be a little more careful.For development &amp; troubleshooting, being able to copy a .db file (even while its in use) is tremendously powerful. I can easily patch up a QA database I mangled with a bad migrator in 5 minutes by stopping the service, pulling the .db local, editing, and pushing it back up. We can also ask our customers to zip up their entire db folder so we can troubleshoot the entire system state.Being able to use SQLite as our exclusive data store also meant that our software delivery process could be trivialized. We use zero external hosts, even localhost, for our application to be installed or started. We don&#39;t even require a runtime exist on the base operating system. Unzip our latest release build to a blank Win2019 server, sc.exe the binary path, net start the service, and it just works. Anyone can deploy our software because it&#39;s literally that simple. We didn&#39;t even bother to write a script because its a bigger pain in the ass to set powershell execution mode.So, its not just about the core data storage, but also about the higher-order implications of choosing to use a database solution that can be wholly embedded within your application. Because of decisions like these, we don&#39;t have to screw around with things like Docker or Kubernetes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Solutions such as Kubernetes tout the benefits of zero-downtime deployments but ignore that their inherent complexity causes availability issues.&#34;This is completely accurate. I&#39;ve seen several teams do kubernetes, only to both spend 50% of their dev time on ops, AND cause outages due to kubernetes complexity. They do this all while boasting about zero downtime deployments. It&#39;s comical really."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t have any specific knowledge of this event but I did work for a smart cities company for a while and can explain some of what hypothetically leads to messes like this.Most municipal infrastructure automation is run by SCADA systems. SCADA systems are designed to be closed ecosystems by default, which means they don&#39;t have access to the internet. Cables are run and point to point connections are made to transport these signals. If you&#39;ve seen a big shiny aluminum box on the side of the road, that&#39;s a SCADA system.Consumer demand has changed a lot since SCADA was first thought up. These days people want to be able to log into a portal and see their billed water usage by the day. Cities want to be able to turn off a meter remotely at the click of a button rather than rolling a truck. They want pressure loss, contaminate, and fault detection. They&#39;d like to balance pressure in the water system dynamically. They want to perform detailed reports on total water loss, which means instrumenting pumps, retrieving telemetry data, auditing that data against every home usage, identifying faults, and producing a report out of it. All of these things don&#39;t work very well with closed ecosystems as they generally require a certain amount of external information. In response, cities have either crafted their own devices because they don&#39;t have the money to hire an integrator to design and produce them a device that will survive extreme weather conditions, be fault tolerant, make minimal use of power, and employ standard security measures or they hire an integrator. Even certain integrators can do shotty work.The takeaway from this isn&#39;t that SCADA is bad or the infrastructure version of &#34;the sky is falling!&#34;. It&#39;s that we desperately need to be thinking about how different generations of systems can be modularized and be built upon to minimize cost while maximizing security, capability growth, and reliability.For the folks talking about &#34;who tests what&#34;, I don&#39;t know what I can talk about in regards to specific programs but I feel confident that I can say that the FBI tracks this vigorously and works with companies that work in public infrastructure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My wife is a sewer commissioner for a tiny sewer district up in the mountains. It is a state of the art facility from a water treatment perspective since the treated water exits into a mountain stream. However, they recently needed to update their control systems because they all currently run on Windows98 and can no longer get spare parts from their vendors etc..At her request I sat in on a meeting with their vendor to ask some stupid questions (but less stupid than what the commissioners would have asked) about their proposal for updating the control systems.Some crazy things discovered:* it&#39;s all windows, all the time. I don&#39;t know why but I find this disturbing, but apparently all the drivers for these systems only work on windows. I guess Linux is only just starting to penetrate this market.* yes, remote access is a thing (even in the old system), especially in this case where the plant it under 20 feet of snow half the year. They claim the system can only monitor things, not control things, but I wonder how locked down that really is. Security is via a VPN.* the vendor at play here seems to be a tiny shop of a few people that basically serve a few dozen sewer treatment plants in the area. They deal with replacing the hardware and programming these interfaces in.. kind of a crazy local cottage industry I just wasn&#39;t really aware of.Having a background in web services / unix left me pretty unprepared to really do much more than ask some stupid questions around security / obsolescence, but the vendor had reasonable answers to my concerns. Just a very different world than what we think about every day."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great write up.  Think I&#39;ll get the kids, sorry technicians to walk through this.  Actually, I think I&#39;ll learn just as much but I have to keep a little bit aloof as MD!Networks are tricky to run and networking is proper hard to do.  TCP/UDP int al are pretty bloody good at shuffling data from A to B.  I find it quite amusing when 20 years is considered old for a bug.The Millenium bridge in London is a classic example of forgetting the basics - in this case resonance and being too clever for your own good.  It&#39;s a rather cool design for a bridge - a sort of a suspension bridge but flatter and some funky longitudinal stuff.  I&#39;m a Civ Eng grad.  It looked too flat to me from day one.When people walk across a bridge and it starts to sway, they start to lock step and then resonance, where each step reinforces the last kicks in and more and more energy causes sway, shear and what have you forces.  It gets worse and worse and then failure.  Tacoma Narrows is another classic example of resonance but due to wind - that informed designs that don&#39;t fly!Civ Eng is way, way older than IT and we are still learning.  24 years is nothing for a bug.  However, IT is capable of looking inward and monitoring itself (unit tests, ping etc) in a way that Civ Eng can&#39;t (OK we have strain gauges and a few other tools).The real difference between physical stuff and IT is that the Milli bridge rather obviously came close to failure visually and in a way that our other senses can perceive - it shook.  The fix was to put hydraulic dampers along its length.In IT, we often try to fix things by using magic or papering over flaws with &#34;just so&#34; stories.  Sometimes we get the tools out and do the job properly and these boys and girls did just that: the job properly."</p>

That seems silly! Surely we can do better than that?This article from Agoric is extremely relevant here, from a previous such incident (re: the event-stream package on npm): https://medium.com/agoric/pola-would-have-prevented-the-even...Put simply: in many cases, the dependencies you install don&#39;t need nearly as much authority as we give them right now. Maybe some of these packages need network access (I see a few named &#34;logger&#34; which might be shipping logs remotely) but do they need unrestricted filesystem access? Probably not! (They don&#39;t necessarily even need unrestricted network access either; what they&#39;re communicating with is likely pretty well-known.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This doesn&#39;t surprise me. Horrify.. yes.I&#39;ve noticed more dev teams succumbing to the temptation of easiness that many modern package managers provide (NPM, Cargo, Ivy, etc.) - especially as someone who has to work with offline systems on a regular basis.Because of that ease there are fewer tools and tutorials out there to support offline package management.  There are more for using caches, though these are often along the lines of either &#39;the package manager will do this for you and it just works (but in case it doesn&#39;t, delete node_modules or cargo clean and re-try)&#39;, or stand up a dependency server on your own machine with these proxy settings (which has it&#39;s own security issues and is frequently disallowed by IT cybersecurity policies).As an example, many blog articles I found a while back suggest using yumdownloader from the yum-utils package. This is unfortunately not reliable, as there are some packages that get skipped.I have found I need to script reading a list of dependencies from a file; then for each dependency: create a directory for it, use repotrack to download its RPM and it&#39;s transitive dependency RPMs in the dependency&#39;s directory; then the script aggregates all the RPMs into one directory, removes the OS installed RPMs, uses createrepo to turn that directory into a RPM repository, and then makes an USF ISO image out of the directory for transfer onto offline system and installation."</p>

Bitcoin is a complete, self-contained monetary settlement system; Visa transactions are non-final credit transactions that rely on external underlying settlement rails. Visa relies on ACH, Fedwire, SWIFT, the global correspondent banking system, the Federal Reserve and, of course, the military and diplomatic strength of the U.S. government to ensure all of the above are working smoothly.Any energy comparison must take the above into account – including the externalities from the extraction of oil, which implicitly backs the dollar. As those who make this comparison inevitably fail to mention, the dollar’s ubiquity is partly due to a covert arrangement whereby the U.S. provides military support to countries like Saudi Arabia that agree to sell oil exclusively for dollars.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"At that rate and assuming 4tx per second a single Bitcoin transaction consumes 165kWh. A Tesla battery is bit over 50kWh. So let&#39;s round that to 3 full charges of Tesla battery.That&#39;s 350km/220 miles of range per charge. In total 1050km or 660 miles of driving.So basically if you want to transfer money and the recipient is closer than 660 miles from you it&#39;s more efficient to just get a bunch of bills, drive there with a Tesla rather than send a Bitcoin transaction. Or alternatively 330 miles roundtrip. For each single transaction.It is hilariously inefficient system. It is literally better to drive a full car and give things physically than use Bitcoin.A small addenum: Visa apparently uses 146kWh for 100000 transactions. Coming at 1.46wH per transaction. That can drive a Tesla for 9 meters (0.4 seconds of driving at 80km/h) or alternatively keep a nice led lamp lit for an hour. And that includes everything the company does, not just the actual transaction but the upkeep of their offices etc divided by the amount of transactions they perform per year.EDIT:Apparently on 2020 it was 741kWh per transaction in practice and/or I made a tiny error in my calculation. Either way it&#39;s even better!https://www.statista.com/statistics/881541/bitcoin-energy-co...That simply increases the ranges so that it becomes a 3600 mile trip. Or 1800 mile roundtrip."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Since this is posted here I&#39;ll ask a question that has been bugging me for the last year: Who does the captions on these YouTube videos? Is it automated? I ask because every CS193p video starts with the same opening scene/music and the caption describing the music is different on every single one. Is this an auto-caption algorithm just getting it wrong? Or is there a person having fun behind the scenes waiting for someone like me to notice and spend an irrational amount of time wondering what happened? I feel like it has to be a person, right? YouTube&#39;s captioning wouldn&#39;t give 12 different results.Edit- For anyone curious, here&#39;s how the music is described in the captions at the beginning of each lecture:1. regal music2. mellow ambient music3. light music4. gentle music5. air whooshing6. gentle music (turns out there is one repeat)7. peaceful music8.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m so glad that Paul Hegarty is teaching this. Not only does he know the material through experience (I think he was an early employee at NeXT and continued on at Apple), he also explains things really well and works through lots of examples. It&#39;s also clear that he enjoys teaching the course, which makes a big difference.I watched an earlier iteration of the course, and it&#39;s the reason I know iOS development today. I don&#39;t often write reviews (and certainly not on HN), but I absolutely have to recommended this course for anyone interested in learning mobile development."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Similar thing happened to me. I built an online Japanese - English dictionary and used AdSense to monetize it. One day I got an email saying that my domain has been permabanned because my website appears to be promoting rape and pedophilia. As an example of one of the many offending pages on my domain they sent me urls to the definition and translation of words &#34;pedophilia&#34; and &#34;rape&#34; in Japanese.Of course none of my competitors using the exact same data set had any such problems.I tried for YEARS to appeal it. There are simply no humans working at Google and nobody reads your emails.Edit: Actually, I did get a response a couple times but it was obviously automated. They just said to remove the ads from the pages where such words are displayed. So I added a simple rule and a column in the database to hide ads for those keywords. That just triggered the bot to move down the list of their &#34;obscene&#34; language. Next it was the names of various sexual positions, acts and fetishes (Japanese does have a very rich vocabulary in that topic), then manga slang, even silly sounding onomatopoeias that when explained in plain English are &#34;vulgar&#34;, etc.. It seems once your website is flagged there is simply no way get clean."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think what we&#39;re learning from many debacles on YouTube, Amazon, and Google is this:Algorithms are not even close to substituting for human customer service, human moderation, and human judgment.Maybe this means web-scale sites like Amazon&#39;s marketplace aren&#39;t viable. I&#39;m fine with that implication. Stores like Target and Walmart seem to have the same prices with human-curated inventories, and I don&#39;t really miss the millions of extra products Amazon has."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nowadays when I want to buy anything on Amazon it takes so much effort to go through which listing is the Sponsored/ad-based listing vs organic in search. Once that hurdle is crossed, it comes to going through the reviews to see which reviews can be trusted and which can not be. And even after that hurdle, once I place order, I am not sure the item I received is counterfeit or genuine. Too much work and definitely not customer-focused experience!I guess going to Target is much easier to get the necessary shopping done."</p>

There was a permit application that was released a few years back that shows the true scale of their expansion plans.https://www.swf.usace.army.mil/Portals/47/docs/regulatory/pu...If this goes through it could made Samsung&#39;s S2 fab larger than even TSMC&#39;s monster gigafabs."</p>

Intel famously flies a lot of its consumables from abroad.Samsung will have similarly to transport its consumables by air if they go with this plan."</p>

The lawyer is probably using an ancient dell computer with this software and hasn&#39;t used video chat on it before this.This is extra hostile, because it&#39;s separate from whatever video chat application they were using - so it would have been harder to know about and turn off.As an aside, Microsoft fought in court to force OEMs to not install this crap alongside Windows (reasonably since it was damaging their brand and making the machines less secure), but they lost.

Refactored code is almost always radically better, even when it&#39;s in the same language, for reasons that might be insulting to explain on HN.Point is, this is not an apples-to-apples comparison.(I&#39;m not arguing Rust isn&#39;t better.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another reason not to use EST/EDT is that they are overspecifying the time zone in most cases. If you ask for output in EDT, but the date is in December (which is not part of daylight savings time) then should the date output be UTC-4 or UTC-5?  Technically you asked for EDT.Using EST as a shortcut isn’t a good idea, either - most software will “know what you mean” and use EST or EDT appropriately... except, both The USA and Canada have been toying with the idea of dropping daylight savings time, so it’s very possible at some point in the future that 6:00pm on July 1st will be EDT in America/New York, but EST in America/Montreal (or vice versa). This is already true for CST - Saskatchewan doesn’t use DST.  And there have been times where one country or another changes the start date or end date of DST too, so there’s no reason to assume those will always be the same between Canada and the US."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only situation where our datetime instances deal with timezones is on a one way trip to a user&#39;s display, document or email. If you are playing around with parsing timezone strings, you are probably making a huge mistake unless you are parsing someone else&#39;s trash data.I feel the standard interchange format for datetimes really should be 64 bit Unix timestamps. These are trivial to store in any database as a native type, can be compared using the fastest arithmetic instructions possible, and are a locale agnostic representation suitable for direct business logic comparisons.Trying to carry timezone information around is a mistake. This is state that should be terminated and normalized at both ends, not passed through the system.The only thing I would store pertaining to timezone is for user profile or server environment configuration. These would be settings in the application that are used to produce locale-specific UI and reports.There are probably some other use cases I am not thinking of, but that is the extent of how we do it and we have a really complex app that has to serve customers who operate in multiple timezones at once."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#39;There is no good reason to use short timezone codes like EST, CST, PST — doing so will only bring you pain. Either use the tzdb name like America/New_York, or use an offset from UTC, depending on what you want.&#39;All you need to read/remember is this, this applies everywhere not just with date."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to work as a scholar of Britain (specifically executions in Early Modern England, but you pick up a lot along the way) and I&#39;ve tried to explain to a lot of people the amount of influence and control that the monarch actually holds.  I&#39;m not sure that this is such a bad thing.  The Queen can&#39;t create legislation, she can restrain it.  She is purely a moderating influence in this sense.  She could, in theory, name new people to the House of Lords, but the Lords is no longer a hereditary body and there is a mechanism for the House of Commons to override the Lords.Parliament does have power over the monarch in some senses, of course, in that there is precedent for Parliament changing the order of succession or introducing a regency.  This happened without the monarch&#39;s assent, though admittedly over a hundred years ago.  But the British constitution is one that replies on precedence, not a formal document.I&#39;ve characterized the Queen&#39;s powers as &#34;reserve powers&#34; inasmuch as, if everything goes wrong and Parliament dies from a meteor strike, the government still legally operate provided there is a monarch (even if you have to reach deep into the line of succession to find that person).  By law she has to call elections within a certain amount of time.  Obviously there&#39;s nothing to force her to follow the laws, but that&#39;s true of any country.  She (or her heirs) are the leaders of last resort."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The most obvious difference between the American and British legislative systems is the presence of a foundational document like the Constitution.The British system is strictly about convention and precedent, whereas Americans have a little more explicit guidance from the Constitution.I think what we&#39;ve learned as Americans in the last few years is that it isn&#39;t enough to have a foundational document.  Convention and precedent indeed play a large role in the function of how the well government works.  Congress is now terminally defective, largely because of the loss of the norms and violations of precedent, starting roughly in the mid 90&#39;s.Perhaps the idea that convention and precedent is the only thing holding the British system together makes it stronger."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Isn&#39;t Britain a Constitutional *Monarchy*?Did they forget that? There&#39;s still the House of Lords and the House of Commons for a reason. The monarchy and the landowners are still a thing and are still a ruling class."</p>

The building blocks for a web app have been around with Phoenix and Ecto for quite some time. LiveView was introduced to make more user friendly frontends.
