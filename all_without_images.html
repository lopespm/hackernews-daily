								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I met John in an Atlanta airport lounge years ago[1]. I recognized him immediately as I&#39;ve always admired him, and I decided to go up to him and tell him as much. He invited me to sit down, and told him about when I was a teenager in the 90s learning about tech entrepreneurs at the time, I always thought he was pretty cool and had good ideas. I told him I respected him, and that I was sure he&#39;d lived an incredible life and thanked him for his contributions. He was clearly totally sloshed(inebriated) and insisted he called his wife so I could recount the story to her. I did. An hr later I had to leave to catch my flight, and i asked him where he was going - he said I&#39;d find out some &#34;pretty crazy shit&#34; about him next week, and that &#34;the doc was a bunch of BS&#34;. Two days later, I read Show Time had announced &#34;Gringo: The Dangerous Life of John McAfee&#34;.  In the brief time I spent with him, I have to say he had pretty positive energy for someone who was portrayed the way he was.[1] https://i.imgur.com/qThvR2S.jpg"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Was just reading about McAfee freebasing bath salts from old posts on an old Joe Rogan forum and not paying taxes seems like the absolute least he was up to:&gt;I&#39;ve processed 23 kilos of this stuff in the past year or so, and bump it myself every day - in fair quantities the hypersexuality... is beyond belief. I have had a number of acquaintances (both male and female) who have rubbed their genitals way past the point of bleeding and still couldn&#39;t stop.&gt;In all honesty, a first time user, or a user on a large dose, when presented with food, will simply figure out a way to include it in the ongoing sex play with their partner. If alone, they will figure out a way to fuck it, or shove it up their rectum. This is not a joke. Everything on the Tan becomes a sex partner or a sex aid. If only visually. I will not, anymore, let anyone on Tan be alone with my dogs for example.&gt;A local brothel owner (prostitution is legal in my country) talked me out of a large amount of Tan and provides it to his working girls and their customers. The idea was to simply increase business by having hornier customers and more authentic product. It worked for a while, and then girls started taking larger doses and giving customers larger doses. They began leaving and running off with customers - some after a single contact with the customer.&gt;If a person takes a large dose of the Tan and has the misfortune to have no partner at the time, then truly terrible things happen. A number of men, and women, have molested strangers after massive doses of the pure product (which is why I no longer provide it to anyone other than trusted friends - everything else is cut 50 to one). Twice, users on large doses have tried to molest my dogs.&gt;I have distributed over 3,000 doses exclusively in this country. They call it SPT (I named it) and it is a seriously hot underground topic here. I know of at least a dozen people who spend virtually full time playing with this, and hundreds trying to get samples, which I dole out with meticulous care. Anyone caught sharing this with another without my consent doesn&#39;t get any more.https://www.resetera.com/threads/john-mcafee-this-might-be-t..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good or bad, what a sad ending to a colorful life.The guy was troubled and had many shortcomings, but he was colorful and also achieved success and arguably was one of the seminal figures in the nascent AV industry.Sad to see his fall from grace and into a world of extravagance, deceit and cheating (taxes) and, if allegations true, even worse; then to end it on the floor of a jail -all by his own hands."</p>

There are more blind people than trans people.  There are more people with Alzheimer&#39;s than trans people.  There are more people in the US who have lost a limb than trans people.I don&#39;t mean to downplay what is happening because it is happening but do you not think the amount of outrage this topic generates surpasses the level of impact we can have assuming we fix it?  It just feels like we&#39;re being distracted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One shouldn&#39;t expect courage from The Economist, but it&#39;s always wise to bet on their prudence.I don&#39;t read The Economist for facts or details so much as to get a sense of what topics a current establishment can no longer afford to ignore. The details are secondary to the neccessity that a writer, a sub-editor, and a senior editor with tremendous personal stake in maintaining access to the circles that define establishment media, have collectively recognized that to remain relevant as a publication, the risk/reward on any ensuing controversy still means the magazine has to acknowledge which way the wind is blowing.When The Economist says something is just starting, it means it&#39;s been brewing for at least several years and they need to comment on it. I don&#39;t think direct discourse on the topic improves the discussion on gender because the participants use a critical theory in which the promise of  discourse is just bait to corner political targets for their mobs. However, we (and even The Economist) can recognize that popular tolerance for these tactics has finally reached an inflection point, and this change in attitude is what will finally allow real analysis and insight by thoughtful people into topics about gender."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Is there an easy answer as to why Costa Rica is doing so well? They seem to be a bit of an exception in Central/South America.EDIT: From Wikipedia &#34;It is known for its long-standing and stable democracy, and for its highly educated workforce, most of whom speak English. The country spends roughly 6.9% of its budget (2016) on education, compared to a global average of 4.4%. Its economy, once heavily dependent on agriculture, has diversified to include sectors such as finance, corporate services for foreign companies, pharmaceuticals, and ecotourism. Many foreign manufacturing and services companies operate in Costa Rica&#39;s Free Trade Zones (FTZ) where they benefit from investment and tax incentives.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We really need two words for renewables: one for types that scale but don&#39;t provide power on demand (wind, solar), and the other for types that provide power on demand but aren&#39;t available at scale everywhere (hydro, geothermal).Costa Rica is blessed with plenty of the second type and uses it. Because we lump it all into &#34;renewables,&#34; it sounds like it should be easy for everyone to follow their example, and that&#39;s not the case. No country has run on a high percentage of wind/solar/battery for a long period of time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The update is telling:&gt; Update 3/17/2021: Our original article stated &#34;Costa Rica Has Run on 100% Renewable Energy for 299 Days.&#34; It was pointed out to us that while Costa Rica&#39;s electric grid does run primarily on renewable energy, a better title would have been &#34;Costa Rica Has Run on 100% Renewable Electricity&#34;. Below the article says that the government had not burned any oil to power the country, but this would technically imply that the government does not own gasoline powered vehicles, which couldn&#39;t be true.Accounting for the origins of energy is tricky business. Want to squeeze out internal combustion engines? Go electric. Where do the batteries come from, and how much non-renewable energy does it cost to produce them? For that matter, how many goods are important with non-neglibile carbon footprints? Because carbon emissions can be exported.&gt; In other words, a country can be considered carbon neutral while still using fossil fuels by planting trees that offset the carbon, or funding conservation programs which aim to reduce the amount of carbon in the air.How long do those trees you&#39;re planting keep CO2 out of the atmosphere? When they die, a good chunk of that carbon may be released."</p>

Currently it&#39;s something like, Poster Name &lt;notifications.github.com&gt;, but that means you can&#39;t tell who the poster was from the email content itself.I use Apple Mail and have a contact for GitHub since that provides benefits like an avatar, easier search, etc, but now the contact clobbers the name field and I just see every email from &#34;GitHub&#34; with zero indication who wrote the comment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"if someone from github is looking at this, can u please include Gitlab&#39;s &#34;Scoped Labels&#34; in this - https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/labels.html#scoped-l...it seems that the new issues are going to operate on the basis of labels (as it should). Scoped/Nested labels are a godsend. For example, I can tag an issue with a label &#34;UI::App::Android&#34; and i should be able to filter on the basis of &#34;UI::App&#34; and get all issues.One of the things i still notice about the boards is that it is created on the basis of status. Gitlab&#39;s boards are created on milestones/status...or LABELS. https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issue_board.html#org...Most importantly, dragging tickets across boards will change the labels. This is far more powerful than just hardcoding them on statuses."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It floors me that they haven&#39;t addressed the underlying architecture issues that made Issues unusable: Issues are only for a single repo. Business users don&#39;t (and shouldn&#39;t) know what repo to add an Issue to. This is why we moved away from Issues and none of these new visualizations make the product usable until they deliver multi-repo issues."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The title here is a bit misleading: the first few paragraphs of this are a really enlightened description of the challenges of engineering for a startup regardless of what framework you are using.Even if you have no interest in Django at all I recommend reading the start of this.&gt; I wrote this guide to explain how to write software in a way that maximizes the number of chances your startup has to succeed — by making it easy to maintain development velocity regardless of the inevitable-but-unknowable future changes to team size, developer competence and experience, product functionality, etc. The idea is that, given the inherent uncertainty, startups can massively increase their odds of success by putting some basic systems in place to help maximize the number of ideas, features, and hypotheses they can test; in other words, maximizing &#34;lead bullets,&#34; to borrow the phrase from this blog post by Ben Horowitz."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a big Django fan and a former (unsuccessful) startup founder. I only took a quick look at this but wanted to leave a comment for anyone else sifting through new. My initial impression:1. There&#39;s a bunch of things a I disagree with in here.2. This is very well written.3. It&#39;s well organized.4. It&#39;s both concrete and high-level.5. There&#39;s a ton of info here.I&#39;m so burnt out on shallow content, it&#39;s really refreshing to see something well argued, whether I agree with every conclusion or not."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article is very nice, some great advice, and like others said it&#39;s not just relevant to Django.One part I don&#39;t agree with is about frontend. Frameworks have stabilised quite a bit, pick React or Angular and you can expect support for years to come. I still maintain a 5+ year old React frontend with lots of logic, updating hasn&#39;t been an issue at all (codemods), since we moved it to CRA it has been even easier.Things like formatting dates: you can wrap it in your own function then it takes a few minutes to swap the library, but you likely won&#39;t have to change it if you follow the tips in this article about dependencies, which are very good!Anyway, great article, very good advice. I think it does a good job of explaining that you should think about why you do things and focus on what matters and makes a difference."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; For fear of losing a job, or of losing an admission to school, or of losing the right to live in the country of your birth, or merely of social ostracism, many of today&#39;s best minds in so-called free, democratic states have stopped trying to say what they think and feel and have fallen silent.There are a lot of topics I won’t touch any more, more every year. Accounts - can’t stay anonymous, ml systems working around the clock to identify posters. My social justice focused friends have it worse, their online “friends” attack them publicly over every single little thing. They go quiet or form a tiny invite only groups to hide after an attempt to do something good that backfired because their skin is the wrong colour or they aren’t trans. They have panic attacks over the guilt and stress"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I very often type out comments on HN and then delete them. As Snowden alludes to, everything we submit to public forums is logged and stored. There is no doubt in my mind these comments are easily associated to my real identity with very little effort.Another side of censorship I consider often is signal to noise. There is no reason to prevent people from saying whatever they want if no one will ever see it. I recall a stat I heard that YouTube receives ~400 hours of content uploaded every minute to their site. Or the long-tail of Twitch streamers with 0 viewers.Finally, there is a threat of violence. We all know what happens to high-profile journalists because of their high profile. I often wonder how many nobodies disappear for some string of comments on some no-traffic forums/blogs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is possibly a unique angle, but by being in taboo art circles (erotic art specifically), I&#39;m struck at how much I see this topic resonating with my fellow artists.I know so many, too many, far more than I can count on my hands who have simply given up posting kink art because they keep getting mobbed, doxxed, slandered, and harassed simply by posting art (or seeing their friends getting shredded as well). I know so many that have forced to bounce from platform to platform from instagram to tumblr to twitter because either the algorithm censors you or the mob abuses the &#34;report user&#34; button if they simply don&#39;t care for your art.I know so many who have had to host on friend&#39;s servers because big-name hosts ban erotic art and kinks in tiny print in the TOS and it&#39;s just not worth it to fucking bounce from host to host unless if it&#39;s an actual friend who supports true artistic freedom.I know so many who are winding up in making zines as a last resort, because zines can be printed at the home computer, so they&#39;re one of the last truly uncensored artistic mediums in comparison to the internet. And yet - how many trailblazing artists have we lost from that crushing top-down censorship even with that one meager avenue open?So yes, this is relevant and urgent, and in more ways than it appears."</p>

However, HTTP frames relied on HTTP chunks, which were fundamentally broken in the Win-HTTP-stack implementation. (Third party browsers like Netscape Navigator or Opera implemented a HTTP-stack of their own, but IE relied on the built-in implementation.)(Because of this flaw, keep-alive was broken, as well, and requests stalled until they timed out. Which is, why everyone set the request timeout to just a short period and you couldn&#39;t type a HTTP request manually in a terminal anymore.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Previous related discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26328758If things go as planned, this may become a paid, ad-free, zero-tracking search engine. I can&#39;t express how exciting this is to me.Over the past few years, I have made several attempts to replace Google Search with DuckDuckGo. But they have all failed and I always ended up changing the default search engine back to Google. I mean, DDG worked fine for 95% of time, but the remaining 5% failure often led to some extreme frustration that I just couldn&#39;t stand. I would imagine Brave Search to have similar issues, at least in the beginning, but they did something smart to make it less painful:&gt; Brave Search beta is based on an independent index, the first of its kind. However, for some queries, Brave can anonymously check our search results against third-party results, and mix them on the results page.So, if I am not satisfied with Brave&#39;s result, Google&#39;s result is on the same page, or just one click away."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; On 6 June 2020, a Twitter user pointed out that Brave inserts affiliate referral codes when users type a URL of Binance into the address bar, which earns Brave money. Further research revealed that Brave redirects the URLs of other cryptocurrency exchange websites, too. In response to the backlash from the users, Brave&#39;s CEO apologized and called it a &#34;mistake&#34; and said &#34;we&#39;re correcting&#34;.Brave is just a &#34;pop-privacy&#34; company.  I will skip this one..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apparently, they have their own search index, which they say covers ~95% of queries, and if the results aren&#39;t in the index, it will then get it from Google or Bing.I&#39;d love some more details on how this works. They probably aren&#39;t scraping the whole web. Are they just mirroring Bing and Google indexes? They seem to have their own page ranking algorithm that they&#39;re hoping to get trained."</p>

That &#39;hyperfocus&#39; that occurs either with deadlines or on a passion project is a symptom, as is the inability to get excited about projects you simply don&#39;t want to do - especially given your otherwise positive reviews and your ability to clear your mind and hyperfocus near a deadline, it&#39;s something to consider.I was diagnosed at 33, and it changed my life infinitely for the better. YMMV, and you may not have ADHD, but if you do, it is nothing to feel guilty about - it, in fact, gives you some insanely useful abilities that others simply don&#39;t have, as evidenced by the number of comments on this post explaining you have no guilt to feel, and your positive performance reviews.But being able to understand why we do these things, and being able to understand how to adjust for them (whether through medication or coping mechanisms) is, alone, insanely relieving.Consider picking up &#39;Driven to Distraction,&#39; or &#39;Delivered From Distraction,&#39; or check out these posts by Mark Suster which was what led me to get started on the path:* https://bothsidesofthetable.com/how-to-know-if-you-have-add-...* https://bothsidesofthetable.com/why-add-might-actually-benef...* https://bothsidesofthetable.com/developing-an-action-plan-fo..."</p>

Having employees who have extra capacity is incredibly important for an organization that wants to get things done; if you&#39;re constantly hard at work on something important, when something else comes up (someone has a question, there&#39;s a bug or an outage, whatever), you either have to delay the thing you&#39;re already working on, or delay the thing that came up. This tends to have a cascade effect on most kinds of work, locking up all your people resources.Plus, those other things you&#39;re doing sound like they overall, in the long-term, probably give you a wider range of knowledge, improving your usefulness.Just wanted to add a voice against that sort of Taylorism perspective on work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is exactly why I&#39;ve concluded trying to go my own way is the best long-term plan for me. Before learning about YC and HN and such, the thought never really occurred to me.When I&#39;m working on a personal project I&#39;m really passionate about, my productivity is literally orders of magnitude higher than at any day job I&#39;ve had. Months or years are compressed into days.For any ambitious personal project that I&#39;m intrinsically motivated by, I&#39;m working on it and designing it pretty much every free moment I have. It&#39;s actually crazy to me how much I can get done if there&#39;s absolutely zero &#34;ugh field&#34; [1] inhibiting me. It doesn&#39;t feel like work at all. I&#39;d happily take 20% of my current salary if it meant I could do that all day instead.Even if it&#39;s stressful and even if I might fail miserably, I think life should be lived. If there&#39;s even the tiniest sliver of a chance that I could support myself just doing something like that, I know I&#39;d be much happier. And if turning such a thing into a job or organization sucks the fun out of it, then I&#39;ll just keep trying again and again until I can find a project with a sufficiently viable enjoyment:financial stability ratio.[1] https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EFQ3F6kmt4WHXRqik/ugh-fields (Regarding the author&#39;s username: yes, it&#39;s that one.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great work! Hacker News still seems to have a deeply skeptical culture with regard to machine learning - not sure why. There&#39;s always someone saying it&#39;s &#34;not novel&#34; and it&#39;s &#34;just doing x&#34;.Overfitting is a known issues in machine learning, people.  If you still think all neural networks are doing is memorizing the dataset completely in the year 2021 - you might want to revisit the topic. It is one of the first concerns anyone training a deep model will have and to assume this model is overfit _without_ providing specific examples is arguing in bad faith.Sentdex has shown his GAN is able to generalize various game logic like collision/friction with vehicles and also learns aspects of rendering such as a proper reflection of the sun on the back of the car.He also showed weak points where the model is incapable of handling some situations and even did the impossible task of &#34;splitting a car in two&#34; to try and solve a head-on collision. Even though this is a failure case; it should at least provide you with some intuition that the GAN isn&#39;t just spitting out frames memorized from the dataset because that never happens in the dataset.You will need to apply a little more rigor before outright dismissing these weights as merely overfit.@sentdex Have you considered a guided diffusion approach now that that&#39;s all the rage? It&#39;s all rather new still but I believe it could be applied to these concepts as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like your YouTube videos in general and think this content is a great benefit to the community.I wouldn’t take the few negative comments personally - I’ve seen many GAN architectures that heavily overfit (including my own bobross pix2pix) get a lot of praise, while ‘less violating’ models (like yours) get more skepticism.  Skepticism isn’t bad! But I’d wager in your case it may be because you’re a YouTuber, and other ml YouTubers are notorious for ripping off content (eg Siraj).Not really related to this, but I’d personally love to see the difference in training times it would take an RL agent to adequately learn to drive a car in gta versus adequately flying a helicopter."</p>

It didn’t take a classroom lecture to realize that spending more money than I earned was not a sustainable practice. It’s also not that hard to keep track of how much you spend and make sure it’s less than how much you make.For almost anything personal finance related there is free information available all over the Internet if you care to spend a couple minutes googling for it.Likewise with taxes, if you have a regular W2 job, taxes are not hard, just read and follow the instructions. It doesn’t help that people keep repeating the dumb meme that if you make a typo on your tax return the IRS will immediately throw you in jail.

In my opinion, people have given up caring about privacy and expect to receive an inferior experience from products that proclaim this. Therefore, again imo, products that focus on privacy and such will remain niche.I suspect that the world is ready for paid services that provide a better Ux. I am thinking about how Netflix supposedly put a dent in piracy. People were willing to pay for content with a better Ux.Aside from saving battery and no surprised mobile data charges, the list many other benefits:  * No ads 
  * No annoying registration 
  * No mandatory tutorials 
  * No noisy email spam 
  * No push notifications 
  * No crapware

I wonder if a project could charge a small monthly fee if they focused on these user benefits that everyone cares about, and partially use that money to support OSM and partially use the money to support themselves?"</p>

I have taken these kinds of cases pro bono in the past for small companies (including through the EFF attorney referral list, https://www.eff.org/pages/legal-assistance), and I know that others have as well.There are definitely low-cost and pro bono (free) options out there for very small businesses. The EFF attorney referral list is a good place to start.I&#39;m also happy to talk it through with you if you&#39;d like more specific information - my contact information is here: https://shawkeller.com/attorneys/andrew-e-russell/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been through similar situations.  The &#34;find a lawyer&#34; comments are less than helpful, since you probably don&#39;t know where to begin and most lawyers will happily take your money without necessarily having an expedient path to resolution for a small one-person company.  So here&#39;s what you do:Write to each of your competitors, explain the situation and ask for a referral to their lawyers.  You&#39;d be surprised how many are more than willing to make a referral against a troll Also search around for any other attorneys who have filed against this troll and contact them as well.  They should all be willing to do an initial call for free.You are trying to find an attorney who has a successful blueprint for dealing with this particular troll, ideally this particular claim.  If the attorney is able to leverage their prior work or knowledge, your costs are greatly reduced.  Also, if the troll has unsuccessful experience with a particular attorney they may just give up.  Good luck!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You have to talk to a lawyer.  No one other than a IP attorney experienced in dealing with patent trolls will be able to give you accurate advice on this.Also you should add &#34;[ask HN]&#34; to the beginning of your post.edit: A good way to find a lawyer is to talk to good lawyers you have worked with in the past.  They will not be able to help you themself if they practice in a different area, but will likely have referrals for someone who does."</p>

I&#39;ve messed up repos a few times, and it&#39;s never good.
It&#39;s always -- &#34;what&#39;s the magic want I have to wave now&#34;?The truth is, while we use git every day, most people really don&#39;t understand how it works.There I said it. And I&#39;m not ashamed.I don&#39;t really know how Git works. And I think I&#39;m not the only one.What does &#34;git reflog&#34; or &#34;git reset --hard ....&#34; do? What are the implications?We don&#39;t really know.I feel stupid. But hey, at least I&#39;m honest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m sorry, but how many bits of git&#39;s UI do we have to force users to manually replace before we realize that the entire problem is git&#39;s UI?Between the tone deaf responses here about &#34;using a GUI client is the problem,&#34; to the tone deaf responses of &#34;you just have to learn it&#39;s internal architecture,&#34; it should be obvious what the problem is. The problem is not just being able to undo a mistake (though that&#39;s certainly one of the problems). Git is an incredibly user-hostile experience, and someone needs to fix or replace it. Can we just say it out loud and stop pretending that the problem is the literally thousands of users who have problems using it?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Quick tips for people that find git confusing:- Use a recent version of git. The error messages have improved a lot, have been localized (unless you do `LANG=C git …` to be able to search it on internet), the UI has improved, `git status` is more helpfull, …- Create an alias for `git log --graph --decorate --oneline --all` or something fancier with `--format`. `--graph` should help you a lot to visualise stuff.
 - Don&#39;t use `git reflog` but `git log --graph --reflog`, it&#39;s much easier to visualize.- Never use `git checkout`, but `git switch` and &#34;git restore` that were introduced in git 2.15 IIRC. They are much less confusing and error prone.- `--patches` (`-p` for short) can be used with `add`, `restore`, `reset`, `log`. It helps a lot with commit hygiene.- Most complex rebase are easier to do with `--interactive` (`-i`).- Activate `rerere` in your git config (it will reduce conflict merges during rebases)."</p>

I have a friend up in Seattle who is suffering, to the point of being hospitalized for mental health issues, but refuses to leave.So HR and leadership believe that their system “works” but it’s really that their employees are willing to put up with straight up torture. They are deluded into thinking that their metrics and PIP plan work well because their best employees are staying but it’s really just the stock price.If the stock price starts to drop for whatever reason. All the best employees will leave in droves. That’s what I saw at Uber post IPO."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had joined Amazon as my first job out of school. I was super excited and would not mind working the long hours as the project was interesting. I enjoyed working with my team and manager. Just near the end of the year, my manager quit. The new manager ran my performance review and assessed that my performance didn’t meet expectations. I was not put on PIP. Instead, there would be a development plan that I had to complete. I was shocked and tried hard to not cry during my review. I had never been told earlier that there were any issues with my performance.This review crushed me. It destroyed my confidence in my programming abilities. To be fair, I had made some mistakes during my first year at Amazon - had fewer commits and SLOC compared to my teammates. Being on a work visa meant I could not quit immediately. I had to endure working there for almost a year before I got a new job.I took me quite some time to gain back my confidence. To this day, my time at Amazon makes me dread performance reviews."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a current Amazon employee I can confirm this is no longer the case or only applies to such a select few pieces of software that it doesn&#39;t actually mean what you think it does. The amount of day to day stuff that is relied upon that runs on greasemonkey scripts and web scraping is insane. API&#39;s for a ton of things don&#39;t exist or are have heavy gatekeeping. (eg. contact x to get onboarded to our API and they just ghost you). Of course you can get a high level leader to tell you to use a proper API in a mailing list email thread where you are trying to get help to solve a problem but they will not actually help you get working API access, all talk no action. A perfect example is there is this basic CRUD app that I rely upon and I see the current maintainer is working on all these feature requests, the problem for me is that the site has a ton of AJAX and takes like 20 mouse clicks to get retrieve basic information. So I  open a ticket / feature request just to get a basic REST API for the reads and they politely tell me I am an idiot and close the request. So much pointless work is created at Amazon from lack of API access."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How far does this principle scale? I&#39;ve heard of this strategy and thought &#34;that&#39;s kinda cool.&#34; Amazon is obviously successful in its domain, so it would be easy to assume some causality.And yet, there&#39;s another big tech company, fruit symbol I think, that has played the long game of continually fine tuning the interaction points to make the integration of their parts more than the whole. They get credit for attention to detail, leveraging their integration and their ability to move in ways they do because of their thorough integration across their whole hardware/software stack. They&#39;ve recently been in the press because of just how much they were able to tune their integration to the problem with their first desktop computing chip. Again, we credit their success with some causality due to this strategy, which (to me) is very different than the Amazon strategy.Is it because Amazon is a cloud company and Apple is a hardware company that they have these different approaches to product development and each enjoy success? Or at the end of the day, are these &#34;do it this way&#34; less responsible than we&#39;d like to believe?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at a company that read the Amazon memo virtually straight after it was published and decided to copy it. The CIO at the time predicated every system&#39;s teams&#39; bonus on it.No API, no bonus.What followed was 18mths of people building enterprise messaging systems and &#34;buses&#34; of various types. Hundreds of pages of documentation on APIs was prepared and released.I think 2 API&#39;s with maybe 40 methods actually went live.There were no bonusesMany people leftThe people who stayed were unhappyIt never happened, everyone quietly forgot about it after 18 mnths.The CIO stayed for another 3 or 4 years - he only left when a new CEO came in due to internal promotion. The new CEO used to run one of the P&amp;L&#39;s/business units and hated the CIO with a passion.So... it&#39;s not the API mandate that made the difference at Amazon."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think the biggest problem with Twitter is that we can’t determine a denominator. Twitter knows, but we don’t know.100 people tweeting about how this guy is bad might be indicative of a general consensus or might just be 100 people out of a billion Twitter users. People then interpret it as general consensus and pile on.We know the numerator but since we don’t know the denominator of people who didn’t comment, or disagree, or never saw, or don’t care. So we can’t figure out a ratio and many people assume the denominator is the numerator and the ratio is 1.“The world won’t do business with this guy, I better fire him” doesn’t make sense if it’s just a very small ratio as who cares if 100 people are upset and 1,000,000 customers don’t care.I wish Twitter had some ratio of who viewed vs who acted. Or had downvotes or something. Currently, people assuming that a few commenters is everyone is doing bad things.This coupled with there’s always someone or a small group who holds an opinion so putting too much weight into a few commenters is not smart. Yet frequently done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve fortunately never been cancelled (I don&#39;t think I even have enough of a footprint or visibility for that to happen).From everything I&#39;ve observed, the absolute worst thing you can do is apologize to the people attempting to cancel you. It&#39;s just pouring gasoline on the fire.These people will never say &#34;oh, you learned from your mistakes, I guess I&#39;ll back off&#34;. Most of them don&#39;t really care about the truth, they care about signaling. So an apology only vindicates them.As far as I can tell, the thing to always keep in mind is if you wait a few days these things always pass pretty quickly. The internet has a very short attention span. As long as you never give those people a confirmation that you did something you regret, you&#39;re much better off in the future.Of course you should privately apologize and make amends for things you&#39;ve done wrong; but those things are always more effective privately and personally done anyway."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Former AWS engineer here.I worked on a pretty critical product in AWS (big AWS service with lots of traffic) and I can safely say that it&#39;s totally up to your manager and pre-existing conditions which make up the job. My manager was great as a person but would always lack in my career-oriented goals (bigger projects, promotions, etc)But what really sucked for me was the pre-existing conditions. Our on-call was pretty bad (40-60 tickets a week) and there was very little investment being put in to improve it. We had a lot of little scripts here and there which would solve extremely specific situations but no focus was ever put on in building a general framework or trying to reduce the ticket count. This often led to engineers taking the day off after their on-call due to the load and honestly it made people quite grumpy. And upper management was always much more interested in feature delivery since the focus was always on promotions and the more you delivered the better it looked for your manager. So now you have engineers with such a terrible on-call load along with pressure to deliver new features and projects within the atrocious tight deadlines that would be set. It was, to be blunt, a shit show.Code quality was atrocious. We had one enormous Java method (&gt;1000 lines) which would take care of nearly every single request coming into our service... With only about 7-8 unit tests. It was so difficult to get even basic things done to the point where any ticket that needed to be done would take a minimum of 4-5 days regardless of complexity. And of course managers and senior engineers would estimate small tickets to take around 1-2 days and then be shocked when 2 days later it&#39;s not even close to being finished. I will give Amazon credit that they do grill design reviews pretty harshly so those are done well in general. But code reviewers didn&#39;t care about quality or best practice. If it works then ship it.I&#39;m just not 100% sure about the whole PIP scene. Our service was extremely critical and we were extremely understaffed. So I don&#39;t think it applied to anyone in our org but I know of other teams who would have no issues in taking in a fresh college grad, making them do work for 6-12 months and then just randomly putting them on PIP. Sad but I&#39;ve seen it happen a few times in my time there.I&#39;m glad I got the Amazon stamp on my resume and left. When I left, more than half my team and my manager quit around the same time too. It was definitely a wild experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I interviewed with Amazon and Facebook in the Spring/Summer of 2020. The difference was night and day. Amazon felt like I was part of a huge cattle herd. The recruiter contacted me and told me they needed to hire a bunch of people in my area. I was immediately given a course of study, link to common LeetCode questions and told I had a couple of weeks. That fine. I enjoy solving puzzles. Facebook felt VERY different. The recruiter had a conversation about career goals, told me how wonderful it is to work at FB, and then quizzed me on some basic CS concepts. The ensuing rounds for each got even more divergent. The Facebook interviewers constantly made me feel like my success was a &#34;win&#34; for them. It felt like a team! Amazon felt like they were waiting for me to screw up so they could disqualify me. In the end, I dropped out of Amazon because it felt disgusting. And I could tell, if this is how they bring me in, I can&#39;t see any reason why it&#39;ll magically get any better once I was &#34;in&#34;.My feeling on those who use LeetCode as some sort of indicator. Great. You&#39;ve found the people that do the brain-teaser puzzles at Cracker-Barrel. I&#39;m one of those people. Some of the best people I&#39;ve worked with, would fail those tests immediately... yet, they&#39;ve built scalable, performant enterprise software. I now see those tests as nothing more than a way to reduce the number of applicants."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at a company that hired several people out of Amazon. Amazon is a big company, so there is significant variation from team to team.However, several of the ex-Amazon employees were clearly scarred from their time working at Amazon. Whenever something went wrong (delays, outages, missed deadlines) one of them went so far as to spend hours or days preparing documents showing how it was actually someone else&#39;s fault, not his, because he thought it was necessary to avoid being fired. He said his experience at Amazon was basically one large game of &#34;not it&#34; whenever it came time to assign blame for the latest issue, and everyone had to become very good at blaming someone else. The worst was when he was actual at fault for something, because he would panic and scramble to distract from the issue he caused by raising concerns about everyone else around him. Easily the most toxic person I&#39;ve worked with in the past few years.On the other hand, I&#39;ve known other ex-Amazon people who said their work was nothing like this, so YMMV"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This really deserves more love.Who remembers Ken Thompson&#39;s &#34;Reflections on Trusting Trust&#34;?The norm today is auto-updating, pre-built software.This places a ton of trust in the publisher. Even for open-source, well-vetted software, we all collectively cross our fingers and hope that whoever is building these binaries and running the servers that disseminate them, is honest and good at security.So far this has mostly worked out due to altruism (for open source maintainers) and self interest (companies do not want to attack their own users). But the failure modes are very serious.I predict that everyone&#39;s imagination on this topic will expand once there&#39;s a big enough incident in the news. Say some package manager gets compromised, nobody finds out, and 6mo later every computer on earth running `postgres:latest` from docker hub gets ransomwared.There are only two ways around this:- Build from source. This will always be a deeply niche thing to do. It&#39;s slow, inconvenient, and inaccessible except to nerds.- Reproducible builds.Reproducible builds are way more important than is currently widely appreciated.I&#39;m grateful to the nixos team for being beating a trail thru the jungle here. Retrofitting reproducibility onto a big software project that grew without it, is hard work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a big deal. Congratulations to all involved.In Software, complexity naturally increases over time and dependencies and interactions between components become impossible to reason about. Eventually this complexity causes the Software to collapse under its own weight.Truly reproducible builds (such as NixOS and Nixpkgs) provides us with islands of &#34;determinism&#34; which can be taken as true invariants. This enables us to build more Systems and Software on top of deterministic foundations that can be reproduced by others.This reproducibility also enables powerful things like decentralized / distributed trust. Different third-parties can build the same software and compare the results. If they differ, it could indicate one of the sources has been compromised. See Trustix https://github.com/tweag/trustix"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t see a single comment doubting the value of reproducibility, so I&#39;ll be the resident skeptic :)I think build reproducibility is a cargo cult. The website says reproducibility can reduce the risk of developers being threatened or bribed to backdoor their software, but that is just ridiculous. Developers have a perfect method for making their own software malicious: bugdoors. A bugdoor (bug + backdoor) is a deliberately introduced &#34;vulnerability&#34; that the vendor can &#34;exploit&#34; when they want backdoor access. If the bug is ever discovered you simply issue a patch and say it was a mistake, it&#39;s perfectly deniable. It&#39;s not unusual for major vendors to patch critical vulnerabilities every month, there is zero penalty for doing this.The existence of bugdoors means you have to trust the vendor who provided the source code, there is no way around this.You have to trust the developer, but in theory, reproducible builds could be used to convince yourself their build server hasn&#39;t been hacked. This isn&#39;t really necessary or useful, you can already produce a trustworthy binary by just building the source code yourself. You still have to trust the vendor to keep hackers off everything else though!Okay, but building software is tedious, and for some reason you are particularly concerned about build servers being hacked. Perhaps you will nominate a dozen different organization that will all build the code, and make this a consensus system. If they all agree, then you can be sure enough the binaries were built with a trustworthy toolchain. A modest improvement in theory, but that introduces a whole bunch of new crazy problems.You can&#39;t just pick one or two consensus servers, because then an attacker can stop you getting updates by compromising any one of them. You will have to do something like choose a lot of servers, and only require 51% to agree.Now, imagine a contentious update like a adopting a cryptocurrency fork, or switching to systemd (haha). If the server operators rebel, they can effectively veto a change the vendor wants to make. Perhaps vendors will implement a killswitch that allows them to have the final say, or perhaps they operate all the consensus build servers themselves.The problem is now you&#39;ve either just replaced build servers with killswitches, or just replicated the same potentially-compromised buildserver.I wrote a blog post about this a while ago, although I should update it at some point.https://blog.cmpxchg8b.com/2020/07/you-dont-need-reproducibl..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think a lot of the replies in the thread so far have focused on tech (understandably, this is HN after all) but that&#39;s missing something obvious - the 4 day week would apply to everyone.In tech it&#39;s very likely someone going from 5 days to 4 days could still achieve the same amount of actual work. As other commenters have said, many tech workers don&#39;t do productive work all the time they&#39;re present. Retail workers, factory workers, people who fill in the holes in roads, telephone support people, etc aren&#39;t contending with pointless meetings and busy work though. They can&#39;t do 40 hours of work in 32 hours by removing some of the hours they&#39;re not really working. What they do doesn&#39;t compress like that.Consequently looking at this from the context of tech workers is far less interesting. The Japanese government isn&#39;t saying &#34;Let&#39;s get rid of pointless meetings and busy work!&#34; In tech removing the pointless nonsense isn&#39;t actually reducing the amount of real work people do. Instead, Japan is saying &#34;Our country is wealthy enough and advanced enough that our people can actually do less work.&#34; That&#39;s fascinating.If you see this as &#34;removing the wasteful time spent on things that aren&#39;t useful like meetinga&#34; then you&#39;ve missed the point. It is that, but it&#39;s much, much more than that too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s an open secret at least in the tech world that absolutely no one is putting in a productive 40 hours of work a week. This was true well before the pandemic and is more pronounced than ever now. Everyone needs to be &#34;present&#34; for 8 hours a day 5 days a week, but spends their time in pointless meetings, preparing documents and powerpoints that no one will read,  faux social/teambuilding events, hour long lunches, goofing off on the internet, all to maintain the pretense of office culture.Companies that shuffle things up to prioritize productivity over simply showing up will be set to succeed over the next generation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The social contract in Japan was that you’d give your life to your employer in exchange for a fair wage and stable employment until you retired. Neither of those things are true now. Wages are low and companies either ignore their legal obligations or hire people as contractors, who have less rights  than full time “employees”.Now, many people, especially women* and young people are finding that it’s possible to run a small business for 3-4 days a week and make more money than an entry or even mid-level full time office job.So, I think Japan finally enforcing rules against abusive behavior at the workplace and pushing for a 4-day week, if it really happens, is a reflection of where society is at right now.*Women have a low wage ceiling because they are expected to quit and have children at any time."</p>

With the passcode determined there&#39;s nothing stopping bad actors surreptitiously access your data.After all this a $2,180,000,000,000 market cap company offers a reward of $18,000.

They proved their ethics already by reporting it to them, and they know it already because they found it. There is literally no reason to try to keep the white hat hacker in the dark, not update them, etc. The white hat hacker could have exploited the vulnerability already!"</p>

I believe that part of this is that Coq uses different mathematical foundations than traditional mathematics, which mostly uses set theory (ZFC, although most people don&#39;t care about the specifics). So it can be hard or unnatural to express something like &#34;subgroup&#34;. I don&#39;t know if Lean fares better in that respect. Coq documentation is also IMHO almost impossible to understand unless you&#39;re already very deeply knowledgeable about the system.We will probably still need some more iterations, to get more user friendly assistants with better documentation and to get adequate teaching resources etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Things I have learned about SSDs:If you want to go fast &amp; save NAND lifetime, use append-only log structures.If you want to go even faster &amp; save even more NAND lifetime, batch your writes in software (i.e. some ring buffer with natural back-pressure mechanism) and then serialize them with a single writer into an append-only log structure. Many newer devices have something like this at the hardware level, but your block size is still a constraint when working in hardware. If you batch in software, you can hypothetically write multiple logical business transactions per block I/O. When you physical block size is 4k and your logical transactions are averaging 512b of data, you would be leaving a lot of throughput on the table.Going down 1 level of abstraction seems important if you want to extract the most performance from an SSD. Unsurprisingly, the above ideas also make ordinary magnetic disk drives more performant &amp; potentially last longer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This page tells me a lot about SSDs, but it doesn&#39;t tell me why I need to know these things.  It doesn&#39;t really give me any indication about how I should change my behavior if I know that I&#39;ll be running on SSD vs spinning disk.I&#39;ve always been told, &#34;just treat SSDs like slow, permanent memory&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My opinion is probably... not technically correct... until you have to deal with drive reliability and write guarantees, but I don&#39;t think programmers actually have to know anything about SSDs in the same way that developers had to know particular things about HDDs.This is out of pure speculation, but there had to be a period of time during the mass transition to SSDs that engineers said, OK, how do we get the hardware to be compatible with software that is, for the most part, expecting that hard disk drives are being used, and just behave like really fast HDDs.So, there&#39;s almost certainly some non-zero amount of code out there in the wild that is or was doing some very specific write optimized routine that one day was just performing 10 to 100 times faster, and maybe just because of the nature of software is still out there today doing that same routine.I don&#39;t know what that would look like, but my guess would be that it would have something to do with average sized write caches, and those caches look entirely different today or something.And today, there&#39;s probably some SSD specific code doing something out there now, too."</p>

There seemed to be an overwhelming amount of evidence over the last year that this repurposed drug is effective at treating Covid during a variety of stages (preventative, first positive test, ICU admittance, and even long haul). But since there hadn&#39;t been a randomized trial the drug had, not only been dismissed, but heavily censored over social media. I still cannot believe how much the discussion has been silenced in the same way people discuss &#34;covid vaxx causes magnetism&#34;. The fact the interview between Bret Weinstein and Pierre Kory was banned from youtube for non-WHO/CDC/NIH approved covid treatments is a tragedy. I truly hope in the coming years the censorship of this topic will be the catalyst for allowing free speech to prevail on social media."</p>

What are the rules?&gt; &#34;By enabling this service, you can be quickly notified if you’ve likely been exposed to the virus by another MassNotify user, allowing you to reduce risk to your loved ones, seek medical attention, and slow the spread in your community.&#34;In this case it seems that the same goal could have been better achieved by SMS that do not depend on the brand of your phone. The dependency on proprietary app stores and OSs seems a risk for the continuation of a free and reliable communications.The only thing that is impossible to achieve without an app is to allow the user to select contacts to whom send a notification. Corporations like Google, and Apple know the list of all your contacts. So, it seems that the intention of the app is to reduce friction and send notifications as easy and effortlessly as possible to avoid that procrastination causes people to delay the warning.But, instead of the silent install the government could have spend money in advertisement campaigns to assure a correct amount of installations. It costs money, but, people pay taxes so the government can engage on this type of initiative at a scale. This could have been a very good alternative, even if it means increasing the budged. Medical emergencies are worth the investing."</p>

The path of least resistance is to get one of these phones and run CalyxOS (if there is an app you need to use that needs Google services like Firebase Cloud Messaging...note that many that can use FCM will run fine without), otherwise run GrapheneOS.You can also buy a Librem 5 https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/

I am a FreeBSD committer and help maintain FreeBSD&#39;s GNOME packages and (very recently) the graphics drivers.The reason why Windows is full of UI inconsistencies is (largely) because of one thing: backwards compatibility.While backwards compatibility has it&#39;s perks, it also means having lots of old code in Windows that can&#39;t be touched very easily without breaking compatibility, And that means many old UI elements may stay, that&#39;s a side effect.While desktop Linux/BSD isn&#39;t exactly well known for it&#39;s UIs, I found GNOME 3/40 to be more consistent UI-wise than Windows 10, being a user of GNOME 3 on FreeBSD at home (which I am typing this comment from), and helping port GNOME 40, while (unsurprisingly) using Windows 10 at $DAYJOB.But then GNOME, KDE, Apple, et al. is more willing to break things than Windows is. They aren&#39;t as bound to legacy compatibility, so old UI elements can be shed easily."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the Run dialog and the folder properties menu and others that have been untouched since the early days. Their utility has been proven and so much muscle memory has been built up. I can not possibly imagine a revision that could be done to them that would have more benefits than simply leaving them be.All of the Fluent/Metro designs have made things markedly worse. For example, check out the Metro control panel widget for selecting a default program for a file extension. It&#39;s a list view with 5 file extensions visible at a time, with no search. That&#39;s what I think of when I hear about a Windows UI update, and I&#39;d love to be proven wrong."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This issue is way overblown here on HN.In day-to-day usage, I have rarely been annoyed by these &#34;inconsistencies&#34;.The best example to illustrate this article is: Installing a driver with the Windows XP layer. That&#39;s probably something that will only happen to people installing very old hardware with drivers from over 10 years ago. I consider that a backward compatibility win: It is great that it even works in Windows 10."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What a fascinating case. There are so many details in such a short articles that is each worth its own discussion!Let’s start with my personally theory that hopefully won’t color all of the conversation about the individual points. This guy pissed off some people and those people are using their petty power to make his life hell. It’s like the 10’s of thousands of people jaywalking without issue and then the homeless guy that gets arrested for jaw walking. We all know that’s not why he was arrested but the law is clear, he was breaking the law, and they enforced it. So the individual incident dots it’s I’s and crosses it’s t’s as long as you don’t bring up the dreaded ‘uneven enforcement’ issue which is at the heart of everything wrong with the law in America. I have no evidence for the theory but it makes sense with the multiple issues involving this guy mentioned in such a short article.Next interesting point. Is giving a speech about how to treat a broken bone considered ‘practicing medicine’? Who gets to decide the answer. Is a PHD candidate writing an exploration of the efficacy of the various methods for treating a migraine practicing medicine? What if he’s selling copies of his paper on the checkout counter at the drug store? I use medicine instead of engineering because I think it’s easier to discuss but the point should hold the same regardless of which licensed profession we are discussing.Shit I have to run but hope to return to this conversation to discuss the other fun questions raised."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Texas may do a lot of crazy things when it comes to state government, but one thing I think we definitely got right is the Texas Sunset Commission (https://www.sunset.texas.gov/). Basically, all boards set up by the state government are automatically abolished every 10 years I believe unless the state legislature passes a law to continue the board.  So every 10 years the Sunset Commission evaluates agencies/boards about to expire and gives recommendations on if they should be merged, eliminated, etc.The whole idea is to prevent these little long-running fiefdoms from continuing indefinitely, where board members just become more concerned about their own power than their stated purpose.People being people it&#39;s not perfect, but it does go a long way to cut down on this type of abuse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Useless bureaucracy hinders innovation and progress.I live in Spain where engineering is very regulated. This results in some engineers spending 6+ years in university to gain the same status as their international peers who studied for 3 or 4 years.There&#39;s no point in enforcing this other than collecting fees to pay the salaries of people who don&#39;t really do anything."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ve noticed that in the time since I was a kid, the focus of public school has shifted from about the 40th percentile student to the 5th percentile student. In my school, the entire focus of the operation was the decent student... the one who showed up, put in a decent effort, did at least three quarters of their homework. The school had tremendous resources for these kids to go to college, and the very best colleges for the very top students. There was honors, accelerated, standard, and remedial and the kids who were really trying would never be sent to remedial because that’s where the true losers were sent (in a different building) where they couldn’t disrupt anyone else’s learning. Nobody cared what happened to those kids including in many cases their own parents.Now in my kids school I see way too much focus on this segment, which is by its nature low ROI — the number of teacher years it takes to turn one of those kids into someone worthwhile is like 10x the amount it takes to turn an average bright kid into a future surgeon or researcher."</p>

It’s not just SF, look at what’s happening in Vancouver: https://nationalpost.com/opinion/rex-murphy-cutting-honours-...The problem is the administration: The board that sets the standards and the parents and politicians who sit on those boards.The solution is this: Ban anyone without a minimum teaching experience of x years from participating on boards, bring all teacher salaries up to comfortable middle-class in every district and give them back their authority in the classroom. Otherwise this downward slide into illiteracy will continue until North America is dominated by an idiot majority."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly, I think it&#39;s time to reconsider the wisdom of allowing arbitrary untrustable third party executable code to run instantly in the form of things like JavaScript on web pages, instead of just nerf everyone&#39;s computer into molasses to prop up an idea that&#39;s been bad for the web anyways.I&#39;ve been of this opinion for a while now, not just because of performance slowdowns and security issues, but also just because of the way JS on web sites has been reducing usability in the form of popups, bitcoin miners, playing videos, sudden redirects to phishing sites and whatever crazy things are out there now.I&#39;m not saying get rid of JS, but treat it like it is - running code you can&#39;t trust. Web sites should start as largely static HTML documents that you read, and then if they need to use JS then they should be required to ask permission to do so, the same way any other executable code is managed in any other computing environment. That seems wild, but I think it&#39;s far less crazy than taking away a decade of performance improvements to the entire computing ecosystem by default so a broken security model can continue unquestioned."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I know this is so different, but I can&#39;t help but think of the 1950&#39;s DoD Heavy Press Program[0]. I think about these special industrial monsters a lot when I read about semi fabs.In WW2 after examining the components from aircraft kills, german wing spars would often survive. It was discovered that Germany used unique forged alloy wing spars to achieve their excellent aircraft performance, perplexing allied engineers. These wing spars&#39; strength and weight is critical to the structural properties of modern air frames. Without them, jet air craft like the f-15 would have been impossible.Machining these advanced alloy parts proved difficult, expensive, error prone, and impossible to manufacture but a die forged alloy wing spar was stronger, lighter, cheaper and beyond the industrial capability of every allied nation. We did not have the metallurgical technology to create such a large forged alloy wing spar in 1945.After the war, the US and Soviets recovered designs for the extremely large press assemblies required for advanced air frames. In the 1950s, a huge national program was geared up to create absolutely massive Heavy Press machines. The Soviets had a massive 30,000lb press for these parts, and we created a couple of monstrous 50,000lb machines[1] that are still in operation today. These things are older than we are and still out there cranking out air frame parts today for modern air frames in 2021.Without this kind of national investment in this kind of unique manufacturing, we would be unable to fly without importing 747 parts from wherever they could be created.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_Press_Program

China is going through a whole of society effort to expand its semiconductor sector in order to not be dependent on anything the US can cut off via sanctions. China will expand its semiconductor sector, regardless whether it is economical feasible, because it is a matter of national security.The countries that are going to be hurt by these US semiconductor subsidies are going be Taiwan, South Korea, Japan ... not China."</p>

Same thing, picked up in the middle of the night, and sent to a wilderness program that turned into 18 months of boarding school.The school was burnt down by the students a few years after I left and I got a couple thousand dollars in a class action lawsuit when it came out that they were hiring unlicensed therapists and admitting students who should have been in intensive  psychiatric care and were an immediate danger to others around them.I look back on it as one of the most valuable experiences in my life, not because there was any validity to the program but because it just confronted me with a lot of intense challenges at a young age that really developed my critical thinking and mindset at a young age."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My first thought: wow, the US is crazy, I’m glad they don’t have this in the UK! Then I remembered that I was at a famous boarding school for five years, the most miserable years of my life. Thirty years later I’m still coping with the aftereffects. I think of that place as a form of institutionalised child abuse, and frankly if someone pipebombed it, I would not shed a tear.One simple thing: it wasn’t authoritarian adults or teachers. If anything, they were AWOL. It was the students that really made each other’s life hell. Of course, we were teenagers. Much later, I stopped blaming the individuals and started blaming the institution.Here’s a tiny anecdote. One guy, who I think was genuinely evil, took psychology as a minor subject. As an experiment, he decided to drive another, younger, vulnerable pupil mad. Gaslighting him, messing with his head, that kind of stuff. And he succeeded!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was sent to an “emotional growth boarding school” in the ‘90s. I wasn’t kidnapped but many of my schoolmates were. A few years later the department of education (can’t remember if it was state or federal) shut the school down after stories got out about the horrific things that were going on there. Kids forced to sit in corners for days at a time, ambulances not being called for kids who had very seriously self-harmed, strip searches (administered by other kids), physical restraints... I could go on. The place had a cult-like atmosphere that was centered on the headmaster and his weird homegrown therapeutic method.I had nightmares for years afterwards and still haven’t fully come to grips with what happened there."</p>

I kick-started the bot on a server remotely and only then discovered it&#39;s an endless loop. It required server admin rights to stop it, which I did not have.I couldn&#39;t immediately reach server admins so had to physically drive there. An hour or so later somebody helped me kill the process.The emails already sent could not be cleared out server-side, which meant that recipients had freezing email clients for over a week, unable to handle the volume, a typical 300K new emails per recipient. They had to Ctrl+A and Delete 100 emails, do this for the next 100, and so on, whilst not deleting real and useful emails.I pretty much destroyed email for those people.I don&#39;t just destroy things at scale though, also at home. Around the time we had our first home broadband internet connection, I set up a web server and just kept my PC running. Unknown to me, the web server software included an email server with open relay enabled by default.About 3 days later, my dad complained about the internet connection not working. The IPS detected the issue (millions of emails sent out via my home server) and gave us a red card, fully shutting us down, permanently."</p>

I believe it provides lots of benefits. It drives towards better docs that can be understood quickly by non-experts. When there are just a few minutes to review the doc, we don&#39;t have time to go digging for information on our own - the critical information must be provided in the material given. There will also be SMEs in the room who can clarify any shortcomings here. Because the audience of the docs is non-SMEs, it drives towards inclusion of other teams. From this, you get more diverse viewpoints, considerations, and experience. It also contributes towards cross-team awareness and education. It makes it much easier to participate as a contributor to the meeting while simultaneously less impactful when you don&#39;t.

The document writing culture is probably one of our not so secret, “secret weapons”.At many companies I worked at, we had a PowerPoint or presentation driven culture. And the purpose of those meetings is to listen to the presenter, at the presenters pace. The meeting becomes about the presenter and what they think is important, as opposed to being about the reader. In presentation driven meetings, the presenter talks and questions actually distract from the presentation - often times presenters will bluntly ask for questions to be saved to the end.My own team has a strong culture of getting engineers to write, and help them write well. It’s not about perfect English, but it is about touching on the key points and letting readers comment and ask questions.Meetings without documents often go completely off the rails - especially because if the kinds of problems we’re solving. Without focus, meetings delve into tangents and branches off of those tangents. To be fair - this still happens if the document hasn’t been adequately prepared, but often because you find the document owner hasn’t fully thought through the problem or fully did their homework."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having witnessed this through a flood of incoming ex-Amazon folks I agree that it brings so much more content and focus on a meeting. It is amazing. The silence, the reading, the staying on topic (apart from tangents that sometimes need to be brought up, but are vulnerable to being just dismissed with the power of The Document) all helps to get the attention and feedback you need.The thing is though, that while the article mentions briefly challenges with the writing, it does not shine light on the hours and hours or reviews, rewrites and re-reviews when preparing the document. The endless and often times pointless arguments and bad blood between people on how to write a sentence so that it would be &#34;correct&#34; and every word and number counts. Arguments if a given word should be &#34;benefit&#34; or &#34;impact&#34;. If the word should be &#34;system&#34; or &#34;solution&#34;. It does not feel productive and I am not sure if counting the hours spent would actually add up classical &#34;hours wasted&#34; in a typical 10 person &#34;pointless meeting&#34;. And also when usually a piece of writing has some soul of the writer, in these documents they end up being soulless, blank format robotic texts only aiming to convincing the reader to fund your project or sell your idea over others. And that leads to quite an Amazonian culture that is a subject of many different articles.I just felt there was something omitted by OP. So while it has benefits, it does have a cost associated."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Two interesting takeaways:&gt; This is the beautiful thing about having a company that isn&#39;t on the stock market. Imagine you have a company that goes slower and slower every quarter, and then you confront the shareholders with the statement, that the way to solve it, is to do absolutely no new features for a quarter or two, refactor the code, learn new methodologies etc. I doubt that the shareholders would allow that. Luckily, we don&#39;t have any shareholders, and we understand the vital importance of this investment in the long run. Not only in the project, but also in our skill and knowledge, so we do better next time.This is reassuring the notion of what I think actually matters, what the real essence is of developing a product, may that be a piece of art and entertainment (like here) or a productivity tool etc.There are creators and there are consumers. We split them up by developers, designers, domain experts and so on, but what matters is that all the other participants, especially those who can exert power traditionally are not part of the essence and if not being careful and responsible, can easily add complexity and limitations that are entirely accidental and can even be harmful.This reminds me of the agile manifesto, modern UX approaches and other processes that are driven by creators, but are often and very unfortunately being bent over backwards to fit into hierarchical power structures.&gt; TDD actually is the constant fast swithing between extending the tests and making them pass continously. So as you write tests, you write code to satisfy them basically at the same time. This allows you to instantly test what you write, and mainly use tests as specifiation of what the code should acctually do, which guides the thought process to make you think about where you are headed to, and to write code that is more structured and testable from the very beginning.The important notion here is that TDD is not about tests and correctness, but about development. It continuously checks assumptions and explores the surrounding code, state and data until a sufficient solution is found.If we squint a little we can see how closely related TDD with REPL Driven Development is. In essence it is the same thing and even has similar results, where the tests or REPL code can be left as an artifact for further, likely historical understanding.We know now that neither is sufficient for a high degree of correctness, but they are certainly useful for understanding and development."</p>

But I don&#39;t know many good programmers that truly stick to the dogma after the honeymoon period.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I personally have problems with doors, and stuff that should be locked. I can never be sure I locked properly.Totally did backtrack unreasonable distances just to check if I had closed the door.It&#39;s all fine when it&#39;s my door. Worst case scenario, I get robbed.However it&#39;s more of a problem when it&#39;s someone else&#39;s door. Worst case scenario, they get robbed, and that&#39;s a different story. Or pets get out...Obviously I can&#39;t take the door on my front seat... So my solution is to take a picture of me trying to open the door, a kind of proof that it&#39;s closed.And, would you know it, it works!

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember a panel on a news program years ago where the one guest was a psychologist who was treating &#34;untreatable&#34; drug addicts by getting them &#34;hooked&#34; on running or weightlifting or martial arts.  They would stop drugs but would instead be doing martial arts for hours a day or running 20 miles every morning.  Then he would start treating the addiction personality and causes, but in many cases the patients would just stop coming and live three or more hours of every day in the gym.The other guests were various degrees of horrified.His patients went from literally living on the street as heroin addicts to doing 3 hour gym sessions and holding down a job; and his peers thought he shouldn&#39;t be allowed to practice.Recently I was reading a book on ADHD and the author was quite adamant that you could only be diagnosed with ADHD if your life was worse than  &#34;the norm&#34;.  In this view, if you have symptoms of ADHD but can, for instance, hold down a good job then by definition you don&#39;t have ADHD.  I deleted the book from my Audible account."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve read most of Scott&#39;s blog posts and he rarely mentions OCD and when he does it tends to be &#34;this is what I think people with OCD experience&#34; and not &#34;this is what my patients have told me&#34; which leads me to believe that he is not an expert in OCD.I have OCD and it&#39;s ruined my life in ways that are hard to articulate. Which is why I can point out two good reasons why what&#39;s being described might not be a good idea. First, giving into compulsions just legitimizes them and reinforces the patterns that are central to OCD and can ultimately make things worse. Secondly, OCD has a habit of changing how it manifests. Sure, maybe the woman is no longer bothered by the hairdryer, but what happens when it becomes changes to worrying if the oven is on? She&#39;ll be right back where she started.I doubt that the anecdote actually happened as described. It&#39;s way too contrived, simplistic and borders on &#34;Psychiatrists hate her! Cure your OCD with this one simple trick!&#34;. Realistically, OCD is incredibly insidious and if it were that simple to cure then nobody would have OCD. What&#39;s described is, at best, a short-term fix and half the psychiatrists likely knew that such things rarely stick.I&#39;ve had the same thing happen to me more times than I can count. I think I found the silver bullet, a way to permanently defeat my obsessive thoughts. If I&#39;m lucky then it&#39;ll last a week before my OCD comes back in full force. But the truth is that you cannot directly fight OCD, it&#39;s like squeezing dough. When you clamp down in one spot, it just squirts out somewhere else. There&#39;s a quote that I think describes it perfectly &#34;To hate me is to give me breath, to fight me is to give me strength&#34;. Fighting OCD or giving into its demands is just falling into its traps. You only truly win when you reach a point where you don&#39;t respond to it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I appeciate how Schmidhuber puts focus on non-US-centric history of Deep Learning and modern AI.He sometimes overdoes these. Even when something is not related to Deep Learning and modern AI. He tries to push very narrow and one-sided views without much room for nuance.For example- &#34;Turing used his (quite inefficient) model only to rephrase the results of Gödel and Church on the limits of computability.&#34;He is trying to say that Turing did nothing new, his work is a mere extension of Godel&#39;s (!), and he only accounted for practical computational reality. That is not true.He goes on further by saying, &#34;Later, however, the simplicity of these machines made them a convenient tool for theoretical studies of complexity.&#34; Like, Turing and Church&#39;s work was only good for that. I digress. I believe that Turing&#39;s work is more seminal and paved the way for modern general computers.Another bit here says &#34;The formal models of Gödel (1931-34), Church (1935), Turing (1936), and Post (1936) were theoretical pen &amp; paper constructs that cannot directly serve as a foundation for practical computers.&#34;It is putting the works of Turing, Post, Church, and Godel all together. Like they are the same. I see the logic as they are all impractical, but they are different levels of impractical. Putting them all under one bracket like that makes no sense.I respect Schmidhuber a lot, but some of his behaviour is borderline childish which are more pronounced in his claims about AI history. You should be skeptical about what he says (and what anyone says).Despite all this, I did not know many things written in this article. I learned a lot and had fun reading it.I first read about Zuse in Isaacson&#39;s Innovators book. Did not know that he used a high-level language for a chess program. Fascinating. He is very underrated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How can you leave out von Neumann from such a list?Also, I feel like Schmidhuber tends to be German-speaking-centric.And overall, acknowledging that this is his signature shtick and it&#39;s good to have a voice like this too, he does a lot of anachronistic reinterpretations of early discoveries in light of later results. It streamlines the story as if it was always headed towards the today, culling aspects that didn&#39;t pan out or magnifying aspects that were at the time more minor and not considered the central issue or angle."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I would caution against just jumping into this and trying to be a real ISP if your experience is in software development, sysadmin stuff, or something kind of tech industry adjacent but you&#39;ve never worked for an ISP in a NOC environment, as a junior network engineer or similar for somebody else&#39;s medium to large sized ISP. There&#39;s a lot of missteps that can be made without experience.In general I would recommend thinking of starting a small ISP as a depth and breadth of knowledge base you need to develop, similar to how an apprentice electrician is expected to work under some more senior/experienced persons in their field for a number of years before being able to operate independently.I do not want to discourage anyone but I&#39;ve seen a myriad of &#39;oh my god why did they do that&#39; small WISPs with anywhere from 50 to 1500 customers. Going down the wrong network architecture/topology/business plan path can be very costly later on if you&#39;re 100% learning as you go.Overall I think a site like this is a great idea, but the sheer scope of things that would need to be written down in a wiki-like format for everything to start your own ISP, and what systems/subsystems/technologies you will want to be familiar with, could fill thousands of pages if printed in book form.

I wrote the &#34;Internet Installation&#34; floppy disks that people used to install networking on Windows 3.1, and configured dialup icons on their desktop. I was the ONLY technical support they had.I learned that people don&#39;t use the same words we technical folks do, so if you get a support call and ask &#34;Have you installed anything?&#34; the answer they give is no, but, if you ask &#34;do you have any new programs or stuff&#34;, the answer will be yes.Why? - My theory is that they either didn&#39;t know what &#34;installing&#34; was (nobody opened up the computer to put something in), or they themselves didn&#39;t do it.You have to have a very strong ability to route around the person on the other end of the phones preconceptions of the world and get the right answers anyway.If you&#39;re going to be an ISP, you&#39;re going to be on call 24/7/365, and you&#39;re going to see weird shit.

If we think in terms of code points (Rust&#39;s native char type actually provides here a slightly different thing, a Unicode Scalar Value, which certain types of code point are not, but close enough) clearly a code point isn&#39;t made out of several code points, so we needed a different word.I like squiggle, if you&#39;re a text rendering engine you might want to use &#34;glyph&#34; although you might already need that word for something else.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I see a lot of people in the comments describe triplebyte as a “market leader” and discuss how good they are. I can’t believe how gullible everyone is especially on a startup forum. Let me spell it out to y’all, nobody pivots and changes their entire business model if they are crushing it. So the implication is that triplebyte are not crushing it. So, this probably has gone the same way as lots of other tech startups. They’ve raised a bunch of money spent it all on ads , distorted the market for a while (usually just the advertising market) and now are on the way out. No matter what fluff or spin they put on it, that’s what’s happening."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"By far the most exciting thing about this announcement is this feature: &#34;Detailed information on what a recruiter did with your application.&#34;I&#39;ve been wishing for something like this for years. Especially for early-career engineers or people from non-traditional backgrounds, this is insanely valuable because it helps you to know avoid wasting time on applications that will never go anywhere; avoid typing in your resume, line by line, into another form after already submitting your pdf. Avoid writing a cover letter to a job that&#39;s already been filled. Avoid applying to a posting that&#39;s really just out there for a company to &#34;gauge&#34; interest, not for filling a real role.If an application is rejected, fine. But getting a follow-up request 7 months after submitting a resume into a black hole is ridiculous, and I think any system that decreases the information asymmetry between the applicant and the employer that allows people to intelligently approach their career search is going to be tapping into something truly valuable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A benefit of Triplebyte to big enterprises not mentioned in Triplebyte’s discussion here: acting as engineering assessment proxy for engineering hiring managers stuck with pathologically risk averse enterprise HR departments.Often enterprise HR is paranoid of honestly evaluating anyone for anything, to the point that many HR teams tell one another and engineering hiring managers that it’s “illegal” to assess candidate abilities on the way in the door, at all.If you think about joining a dev team where no one checked if any candidate could FizzBuzz, you can imagine the workplace environment that can end up with.Triplebyte is able to provide engineering managers with a stack of pre-vetted resumes so an enterprise can interview by its lowest common denominator HR policies, while still having a prayer a team will at least be made of candidates who can code.The value of this to an enterprise stuck in this position is hard to overstate.Hopefully along with expanding the talent pool per this post, Triplebyte can figure out a way to get well paid for this ability to help land actual coders on actual dev teams despite enterprise HR.The need for this is huge.// I see a comment below from a Triplebyte PM about score matching: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27542621 … That would be slick: land candidates that genuinely raise the bar, but aren’t so far ahead as to be speaking a foreign language to the team.  Of course, this would require also assessing the target team, and oops, we’re right back up against that HR policy…"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a former felon, I&#39;ve learned first-hand the fallout from being named in crime stories. The AP has it right in that a lot of it isn&#39;t realized by readers or society.Upon being charged with crimes, I had to make my way through the court system. As a consequence of my actions, the courts punished me. Once I had showed that I was not a serial offender but instead someone who had moments of weakness, lost identity, and subsequently poor judgement, the courts let me go.Once I paid my debts to the court — figuratively and literally — I was free to live my life without the government watching over my shoulder or further being a burden to my future. My dealings with them had a fixed amount of time attached to it. Once that time limit expired, I was free.Society was far less kind, and hardly as forgiving.No, I&#39;m not talking about employment — I am and always have been very gainfully employed. No, I&#39;m not talking about renting an apartment, or getting a loan, or opening a bank account.I&#39;m talking about new acquaintances.As we have seen over the past 5 years, in the minds of many a website is a single source of truth. To a large number of people, simply having a website is enough to give confidence to the reader that what&#39;s written is an absolute and authoritative source. It is only correct, completely unbiased, and contains 100% factual sourcing.When there&#39;s a webpage with dirty laundry on it, it rarely gets updated to say &#34;later, Judge Judy found suspect to be of good character, and they&#39;ve since paid their debts to the court.&#34;No, it just has absolute worst moment on repeat, leaving out all the context and any depth that goes into a legal proceeding. It&#39;s entirely the worst part of a nightmare.I&#39;ve personally had a number of articles written in addition to a 15-second segment on the local evening news. Getting a call from a partner who is sobbing, &#34;my parents Googled you.&#34; is absolutely stomach-turning. Knowing my little sister had to go to school the day after the clip played next day was something I am more ashamed about than I can put into words. Thankfully she was too young for a cell phone and social media was still in its infancy.My partner very privy to my dirty laundry. When they first learned of it they were actually surprised. It didn&#39;t bother them though as they knew who I was as a person and that my days of making mistakes were behind me.Their parents were less understanding. They didn&#39;t know me like my partner did. They just saw a series of mugshots and some local news articles from mistakes I made as a young adult.It wasn&#39;t the first and it wasn&#39;t the last time it happened, either.I have always been transparent and forthcoming with mistakes I&#39;ve made. I&#39;m just as candid with friends as I am here on HN. Hell, my profile even says I&#39;m a former felon!One point does not make a pattern. Many minor crime stories are just a point. That point, on the internet, is a scar, and those who come across them out of curiosity, suspicion, or nosiness re-open the wound.Since my bad decisions, I&#39;ve had success in contacting the authors of the articles highlighting my worst-moment-kept-in-a-non-governmental-database asking if they&#39;d consider removing their article. I mentioned I had completed probation and was doing something with my life, and that the article was hurting me and my relationships with people. They obliged.Edit: This isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve mentioned I&#39;m a felon in a comment. I&#39;ve received a surprising number of emails over the years from other felons (or felons-to-be) asking &#34;how did you reintegrate into society?&#34; or &#34;do you have any advice?&#34;. If you&#39;re one of them and reading this, you&#39;re more than welcome drop me an email."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an interesting (and confounding) topic.On a corollary note, Austin recently experienced a mass shooting in a popular Downton area. 14 people were shot. One died. Another is paralyzed. The local paper of record explicitly declined to publish the description of the suspects as released by the police so as to not &#34;perpetuate stereotypes&#34;. The question I have is, what is the obligation to report the facts of a story, regardless of consequence? My belief is that reporting should report all the facts and let the chips fall where they may. But I also understand that reasonable people can disagree. (In this case, it seemed unreasonable to me as one shooter was still at large.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My interpretation of their intent is they will no longer name suspects in &#34;florida man&#34; style stories. Like, really, nobody needs to know that it was specifically 30 year old resident Pimble McGringleberry who lives on 1234 S Main St, nowheresville, arkansas was the lady who was throwing office chairs off the top of the target parking structure.The person is presumably dealing with the aftermath of whatever caused them to be in the news in the first place. There is no reason to give internet users a rope, or 6 lines by the hand of the person to hang them with.I think this is a positive move and hope to see more of it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had really bad nausea and pain, went to my doctor, who said I likely had a kidney stone, and the next step was to get an MRI. I was between jobs with no insurance and few funds, so I asked what it cost. The doctor had someone in his office call the hospital and got a quote for $1,500. I got the MRI knowing only that.A month later I got a bill for $3,500. I drove out to the hospital (2 hours) to ask wtf. They didn&#39;t help at all, wouldn&#39;t budge.So I went home and wrote them a check for $1,500, marked as paid in full, with a cover letter explaining my side of it. It worked. They cashed the check and I never heard another word. I&#39;ve done further business there with no problem. It&#39;s well worth pushing back."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I did some research into this for my current employer and the challenges are pretty well laid out here: the penalties are minimal ($300 / day or $~110,000 per year), the data is kept in the invoice or billing systems, which are complex, and the hospitals do not want to share the truly groundbreaking data, which is the per-provider costs.In addition, when you Google for competitors you don&#39;t find a lot of them, but once you start looking at hospital websites you find that quite a few of them (about 50% of the ones I looked at) have at least a partial solution, often provided by their analytics company as an add-on or footnote.It does not appear there is a great market opportunity here unless the penalties increase (which the CMS has talked about vaguely, but hospitals are already asking for relief until after the pandemic)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My wife is trying to work on price transparency at her practice by offering bundled rates for the surgery she does. She has worked with all the various providers - anasthesia, pathology, the hospital etc to come up with a cash rate that she publishes on her website for the surgery. Most of the parties are very open to it but also extremely worried about outliers. Patients that end up costing 10x what was expected due to complications.
For her this is a minuscule risk, but in her negotiations it has been their main worry."</p>

    Tor as an OS-level feature may not spark the best reaction. It&#39;s been given a bad name (&#34;deep web,&#34; silk road, etc) in mass media and many people don&#39;t understand it enough to think of it as anything other than bad.
    I think that it&#39;d be cool to have, but I don&#39;t think that Apple would ever implement it.

        jameshart on Oct 8, 2015 [–]

        Agree, it&#39;s phenomenally unlikely, but then again there is a part of me which could actually imagine Apple doing something like it. They wouldn&#39;t use Tor, of course, they&#39;d build a proprietary equivalent, and then come out on a black stage to &#39;introduce Apple Undercover, a revolutionary enhancement to personal network privacy and security&#39;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Props to Apple for the design of this service. It doesn&#39;t hit all the privacy targets that long-time personal VPN users might be looking for, and it doesn&#39;t get into the game of trying to circumvent region locked content*, but otherwise it&#39;s likely to be a solid privacy improvement for almost all users in a careful and deliberate way.I use a VPN for other reasons (downloading Ubuntu ISOs mostly) but I&#39;ll probably turn this on and leave it running on all my devices because of how transparent it appears to be. I trust Apple&#39;s onion-routing design more than I trust my VPN provider not to log things.* I&#39;m actually glad they don&#39;t try to get around region locks. I consume a lot of BBC content and live in the UK. I&#39;m constantly struggling with my VPNs (with UK endpoints) being blocked because others outside the UK could be using them. It would be nice if the BBC didn&#39;t block like this, but UK residents do typically pay for the content whereas those outside the UK are unable to."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been trying to point this out to people but YouTube personalities have a louder voice than anyone else so you end up with bad information.Props to Apple for offering an (albeit low entropy) onion router on their own infrastructure.  I can&#39;t imagine this is going to win them any friends in government circles but it&#39;s definitely a step in the right direction.I&#39;d also really like to see Apple come clean about the iCloud backup encryption debacle.  A lot of people are trusting it to be something it&#39;s not and it should really be clarified on-device what it is and is not before opting in."</p>

The idea was that answers would continue to improve over time.For the most part, they don&#39;t.  I&#39;m not quite sure if it&#39;s an issue of incentives or culture.  Probably some of both.

As a result, other people don&#39;t feel enabled to come along and tweak the answer to improve it.Then, once an answer is listed at the top, it is given more opportunity for upvotes, so other improved answers don&#39;t seem to bubble up.  This is a larger issue with most websites that sort by ratings.  Generally they sort items based on the total number of votes, including hacker news itself.  Instead, to measure the quality of an item, we should look at the number of votes, divided by the number of views.  It may be tough to measure the number of views of an item, but we should be able to get a rough estimate based on the position on a page, for example.If the top comment on a HN discussion is getting 100 views in a minute and 10 upvotes, but the 10th comment down gets 20 views and 5 upvotes, the 10th comment is likely a better quality comment.  It should be sorted above the top ranked comment!  There would still need to be some smoothing and promotion of new comments to get them enough views to measure their quality as well.Such a policy on StackOverflow would also help newer, but better answers sort to the top."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; return String.format(&#34;%.1f %sB&#34;, bytes / Math.pow(unit, exp), pre);As a human, the first thing that I hate about this interpretation of &#34;human readable&#34; format is inconsistency in the number of significant digits. One digit after decimal separator is simply wrong, as when you jump from 999.9 MB to 1.0 GB you go from 4 significant digits to 2, instead it should be 1.000 GB, 10.00 GB and so on. This annoys me enormously when I upload things to Google Drive from Android phone and look at the number of data transferred as as soon it becomes bigger than 1 GB digits stop changing and I become anxious that it stopped the transfer and my Windows Phone nostalgia jumps over the roof (as WP was never infected with this problem by virtue of not using Java, and OneDrive on WP explicitly showed current connection speed, and frozen connection never caused any strange problems with uploaded files like it does on Google Drive on Android).As a human not from US, the second thing I hate here is lack of locale parameter to pass to formatter as decimal separator is different in different cultures, and in the world of cloud computing the locale of the machine where the code is run is often different from the one where the message is displayed.As a human from a culture using non latin alphabet, the third thing I hate here should be obvious for a reader."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Excerpt from the abstract:&#34;This paper presents the first publicly available cryptanalytic attacks on the GEA-1 and GEA-2 algorithms.&#34;[..]&#34;This unusual pattern indicates that the weakness is intentionally hidden to limit the security level to 40 bit by design.&#34;So in other words: GPRS was intentionally backdoored."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At the time when digital cellular was first designed, the main objective was to design sufficiently strong authentication to stem the rampant theft of service then occurring on the analog cellular systems. In the US this was estimated at roughly $2 billion/annum.Encrypting traffic for privacy purposes was less important. Prior analog cellular telephony systems were unencrypted, as were analog and digital wireline services. Thus, the privacy cryptography was intended to be strong enough to make it a little more inconvenient/expensive to eavesdrop on digital cellular than it was on analog cellular or wireline services without significantly impeding law enforcement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"All of the GSM algorithms were weak, and deliberately so. It is well known that the French wanted it that way, while the German side wanted a bit more safety on account of the ongoing Cold War. So compromises like the infamous A5 algorithm were created whose security was mainly based on the algorithm itself being kept a secret - the cardinal sin of cryptography."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a European, living in Europe, developing software. Lack of imagination is not our problem. It&#39;s so good that we supply our best talent to the US where it does extremely well revolutionizing AI, designing hardware for Apple, developing games, stream online music, etc. E.g. Amazon&#39;s CTO is Dutch. Basically the person that has been running AWS. The people and the education system are fine.Europe does have a few issues that make it unnecessarily hard to build successful startups here. People do start companies here but more often than not success is followed by US investment and before you know it the company is headquartered in the US. There are many reasons for that but a big one has to be that raising similar amounts of money in Europe is super hard. Investors drag their heels, founders have to take on more risk, etc.A second reason is simply that the US as a big homogeneous market is a nice one to tackle for European companies as well. And often that means having a (big) presence in the US. The EU is basically many markets unified by really complex rules, bureaucracy, etc. There is free traffic of people but companies have a harder time dealing with local variations in legislation, hurdles for billing and taxation (e.g. VAT), banking, bureaucracy, etc.That&#39;s much less of a thing in the US (though it is a bit of a thing there too between states). And that&#39;s before you consider language and cultural differences. Simply put, the same company in the EU will have a very hard time growing compared to doing that in the US. Being successful in the US market, means having the deep pockets to go international. Doing the same from a small country means you barely have enough to expand to another small country. Going international is hard work. Not something you do with your MVP. It&#39;s not very scalable either: you need to worry about cultural differences, bureaucracy, localization, understanding the local market, ramping up sales, marketing, etc. Especially with SAAS companies this is super expensive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I take offense at such massive overgeneralizations as &#34;Europe lacks imagination.&#34;What it lacks is freely flowing funding such that risky enterprises can be funded even if 1 out of ten or 1 out of hundred actually are successful. This kills business models which cannot show any profit whatsoever, and a large portion of the remainder are killed by data regulations forbidding &#34;alternate paths of monetization&#34; (to put it charitably.)Rather, a problem is that once a European project becomes successful enough, it soon becomes an American project, either by acquisition or by moving to where the investment money is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This problem will never get fixed. The author forgot to mention in depth the main reason why EU isn&#39;t even in the game: culture.In order to be innovative and compete, we need very flexible working laws, people with a big growth mindset, a less relaxing lifestyle and AMBITIOUS people.A lot of third world countries are years ahead of the whole EU continent in that aspect. I say this because I live in Europe for the quality of life, come from a third world country, and I see how kids and adults are spoiled here. Much of what they have was just given to them. At least for the strong countries in west EU, lifestyle is very relaxed and any ambitious is frowned upon, it is extremely demotivating, not to mention bureaucracy. Corporations and regulations will just drive your small company out of the market no matter what.I find for me more likely to save some money, move to my country and create my own business and sell in Europe. People here are too lazy to compete in the fast world we live in, there in my country there is so many skilled people, so little capital, here is the reverse. Good amount of capital and foreigners working in tech. For instance, I live in Berlin and almost all the &#34;working people&#34; from tech companies here are foreigners. Germans are generally the executives and/or management. It is quite rare to find a german software developer on Startups.I personally think(my opinion, not the ultimate truth)... that Europe is definitely a very interesting market for companies to come here and sell their stuff, but not to make it.Instead I think Europe should focus on its strengths, which is healthy market regulations, creating a good playing field for companies from above, rather on its weaknesses. It should also figure out a way to keep part of the profits inside the continent to benefits its inhabitants.More important than competing is to know where and when to compete."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My first job out of college was at a magazine. The two editors there were in their 70s and notorious for being bullies (although for what it&#39;s worth, one of them mellowed out after their editorial assistant committed suicide). There wasn&#39;t a day when I wasn&#39;t yelled at repeatedly, and the taint seeped down, with everybody lower down the rung yelling at anybody below them.  It was easily the most toxic environment that I&#39;ve ever experienced, and I&#39;ve worked in academia! People were breaking down in tears all the time. Ex editorial assistants would send in letters written in crayon from insane asylums. The funny thing was that instead of resenting their tormenters, most people adopted a very protective stance towards these editors, as if they were children. Sadly, the impression that I got was that a lot of other publications had similar problems--smart but extremely neurotic bosses who regularly demeaned their employees. This was in 2000, around the time when &#34;The Devil Wears Prada&#34; came out. The one upside was that it permanently scared me out of publishing, which turned out to be an excellent career choice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m very sorry to hear that Matthew Butterick had some bad experiences.  He&#39;s been a brilliant and energetic contributor to the Racket community.  Clearly, something went wrong.For what it&#39;s worth (looking at some of the comments from people not very familiar), my own experiences with Matthias Felleisen have been positive.  (I started contributing to what was then called PLT Scheme around 2000, have had lunch with him twice, and a few times over the years have had some mutually-candid conversations with him, about concerns affecting the project/community.)While I might describe Matthias as a freethinker and straight-talker, everything I&#39;m aware of that he&#39;s said or done in the two decades I&#39;ve been around seems to come from altruistic intentions.I know Matthias cares about the community.  (He was very welcoming when I started, and we&#39;ve discussed it over the years.)  I think he&#39;ll want to personally investigate and consider what happened that resulted in alienating Matthew B., and try to correct any problems that he can.This isn&#39;t just about Matthew B., but also about constantly seeing how we can be the best community for everyone.  That&#39;s not a solved problem, and I suggest it&#39;s best approached as an ongoing process of humility, honesty, and support -- everyone feeling safe to raise concerns/problems, and everyone feeling safe to examine how we can improve."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve followed Racket and the OP&#39;s work from a distance for some time.  This post rang bells for me, based on similar interactions with a few bad apples over about twenty years in the field of physics.I applaud the poster for the clear and measured language of his post,  for his bravery in calling out this kind of behavior, and for taking steps needed to remove himself from the situation. I hope the Racket community takes steps to eliminate the problem at the root."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really like the idea of this. Some thoughts:1. It&#39;s difficult for me to tell which spaces are open for play and which aren&#39;t -- the border is hard to parse. (Is that this cell&#39;s border, or the adjacent cell?) This isn&#39;t really an issue during placement, but it is an issue for signalling that a cell has been &#34;captured,&#34; which is hard for me to tell.2. Hexagon grid is absolutely the right call. :)3. The influence mechanic is very opaque: it&#39;s very hard for me to predict what will happen next, which makes me feel like I&#39;m playing a little &#34;intuitively,&#34; instead of planning out my moves with intention. Some way to see &#34;this is the current state and this will be the next state&#34; would help with that, but I think as long as influence is a continuous quantity it&#39;s going to be difficult to visualize and predict.4. Making the board itself hexagonal (ala Hexxagon) will give you an odd number of cells, preventing ties. Might also be nice to smooth out cell-strength discontinuities around the top and bottom edges.5. Balancing the first-player advantage by making the first move a &#34;weak stone&#34; was very confusing to me, because an adjacent move by player two will &#34;capture&#34; my initial stone with a single stone of theirs. I didn&#39;t understand this until I saw your comment about it here. I think the pie rule would work well in this game, but it&#39;s hard for me to reason about since edge moves are offensively weaker but defensively stronger... I&#39;m not sure how well it would shake out, if you haven&#39;t tried it already.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_rule"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi, a couple of comments.First, I understand you were trying to make an approachable presentation, but the rules as you presented them are incomplete (how does influence work? what is a &#34;threshold&#34;?), and I think for a board game that&#39;s a big mistake. What makes games like those cool is that rules work deterministically, even for games that involve randomness. Having to guess the rules is something I actively dislike.Second, have you considered a square board instead of an hexagonal one? Using Go terminology, it feels like the groups have too many liberties.Other than that, the game is pretty good. I feel it captures the attack/defense territory-based gameplay of Go perfectly.Have you tried to measure the first move advantage?edit: Wow this thing is a drug. Hard AI is deceptively good, I managed to tie a game 25-25 after several attempts, but you definitely can&#39;t afford to be sloppy if you want to stay afloat!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At the end of every turn, each tile influences its neighbors and imparts some of its color. Tiles with a dark border can no longer be selected.The rules are simple but it takes awhile to master. What is your best score against the Hard AI? I got 27 (me on green) – 23 (AI).Would you want to see some sort of match-making to play against others online?See demo gameplay or view the source code at https://github.com/jawslouis/Influence-Game"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s great to allow your kids to take risks, and we do this with our own as much as we can (they&#39;re 1 and 3, so &#34;within reason&#34; is still doing some heavy lifting. I pick ticks off of them now and then and patch up their share of bruises).But fundamentally, what I want most is to be somewhere my kids can ride bikes or walk alone to school, to friends, to the shop, etc. from the age of 7 or so. As best I can tell that pretty much means the Netherlands, parts of Denmark, or perhaps Japan (more for transit than cycling).Children can&#39;t drive, which means unless you&#39;re lucky enough to live very close to your friends, and ideally on the same side of the street, your home is effectively your prison in the US and Canada.And yes, I suppose you _can_ let your kid ride a bike to school alone in the US at 7, but you would be risking arrest, and death. It&#39;s often forgotten that drivers are, by far, the leading killers of children. Far more than people with guns. I was an avid cyclist in the US for the first 30 years of my life and I still have a bruised rib and too many memories of very, very close calls with death.NotJustBikes, who moved from Canadian suburbia to the Netherlands, explores this in more depth at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul_xzyCDT98"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the problem &#34;de-risking&#34; childhood is only an instance of the bigger problem of what Roger Scruton calls &#34;Risk De-aggregation&#34;. Risk Deaggregation is taking a single point of risk (and its associated metric), and optimizing to reduce that risk as if it exists in isolation from other risks. I.e. Risk occurs in aggregate, not as individual threats. Risk deaggregation happens everywhere from Climate Change policy, to Covid, to children.I think this type of risk deaggregation arises from the fact that in a sufficiently complicated space (climate, economy, children, etc) there are really only two heuristics:1) Ignore all but a manageable number of variables and optimize for them2) Recognize a larger number of necessary variable, acknowledge there is no optimal solution, and balance the trade offs between those variables. [0]Heuristic 1 is the easiest, requires no nuance, and seems the type of thing our political and media class love to latch onto. Heuristic 2 actually requires admitting you don&#39;t get everything you want, or at least the things you want will cost you something you dont.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve got five kids. The more I loosen up and let the kids take risks and learn for mistakes the better. The challenge is when the adults inject a ridiculous level of risk to something that should be a learning experience. For example, allowing police to arrest and charge a child for bad behavior at school (i.e. won&#39;t obey the teacher, outbursts - not for actually criminally violent behavior). Another is lifetime academic and other records. When risk is too high, learning stops and risk avoidance takes over."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"During my time as a research assistant / grad student there was a remarkable shift in the atmosphere. It started with massive layoffs of research staff, linked to the more general savings of our government.More esoteric professors were replaced with more efficient manuscript machines submitting manuscripts to more prestigious journals. Soon after the layoffs, the university&#39;s innovation and commercialization services became extremely active. Recurring events at lecture rooms where we were blasted on how our work is IP of the university, how the university takes only 50% cut if something works, how cool is it to be a researcher who commercializes ideas in comparison to being one those dusty farts in the science cave studying one protein or butterfly for their entire life.Being a believer and practitioner of open source, I once asked how does this all this apply to computational science. Basically all algorithms and tools should be passed through them to see if they have commercial potential - if no, we can go ahead. Found it appalling and interfering with my intellectual freedom, one of the many events that made me pursue life outside the academia."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wouldn&#39;t be the first time universities have acted like patent trolls. For example, you know the filament-style LED lightbulbs that are really popular these days? The University of California has been going after a bunch of retailers with patent lawsuits for selling them, complete with PR push about how it was their invention that had been stolen from them. I looked at what they&#39;d actually invented and patented at the time, and it was nothing like those filament LED lightbulbs - it was a old-fashioned resin-dome LED that replaced the metal anvil the die is usually mounted on with a TIR reflector, supposedly to improve efficiency. This was completely impractical, pointless and had no market value - the metal anvil is really useful both as mechanical support and a heatsink, you&#39;d almost certainly lose any possible efficiency gain that resulted from capturing more of the rear light output due to higher temperatures. However, they&#39;d worded their patent claims in such a broad way that they could cover nearly anything, and the university used this to file for patents that were actually similar to the LED filaments after they&#39;d already been invented by someone else and put on the market but backdated in validity to their original patent.This isn&#39;t just a software-related problem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Starting conditions (where one was born, levels of wealth and opportunity there, one&#39;s parents&#39; education and jobs) are shockingly predictive about an individual&#39;s future. Hard work leading to social mobility has always been the exception, not the rule. Most will not beat the odds since if they did, those wouldn&#39;t BE the odds. A lot of us are just so deluded by survivorship bias borne of listening only to success stories, but it seems more and more people are seeing through the illusion. In my opinion, that&#39;s a good thing, as recognizing the true state of things is the first step to improving them, and this combination of consciousness and lived experience can prove to be potent immunization against bad faith actors who want to maintain the illusion of widespread social mobility."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Working hard but doing so for someone else can often not lead to significant gains.  Many services like Uber or InstaCart or even McDonalds or Amazon Warehouse or Walmart or Retail Sales or call center, you can work hard but there is no where to progress to.  Your rewards are capped.You need to find a way to work hard such that your rewards are not capped artificially.  Startups were you get equity.  Large companies where you can progress to high salaries if you are able to rise.  Starting your own business and being competent at it.  Working on commissions in an area where the commissions can be large -- true sales, or real estate.  Being a professional, e.g. doctor, accountant, lawyer, has traditionally had high wages and you often run your own business.You need to work hard in a way that has unlimited rewards, or at least high rewards possible, and that aligns with your aptitudes.You need to not work hard at a minimum wage job if you can get something better.And if you are stuck in a minimum wage job, maybe you can organize with your fellow employees to demand better wages and benefits?  This is also another way of working hard in order to get more for yourself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As trite as it sounds, &#34;Success = Hard Work + Opportunity&#34; is still the default equation that makes the most sense to me.And while people from all strata of life work very hard, opportunities are obviously and incredibly unequally distributed (and perhaps becoming more so?).If you were born middle-class in US/Canada 20 - 40 years ago, your access to opportunities to improve your station were/are immense. Layer on your ethnicity, if your parents were in a stable relationship, if you grew up in relative safety, if you had a decent education... hard not to think that your opportunities were 10x or 100x someone who had none of those things.But you also need to define &#34;success&#34;. To this crowd, is &#34;success&#34; merely &#34;leading a better life&#34;? I&#39;d argue most of us already have this as our default reality. I.e. the gradual reward for working hard via promotions and relative safety of career.I remember after my startup was acquired, a few people would say to me (well-meaning obviously) &#34;wow it&#39;s great your hard work paid off!&#34;. And I just said something like &#34;thanks, ya, lots of people work a lot harder than me but didn&#39;t get the same outcome - so there was a lot of luck involved too!&#34; etc. Even thinking of my own immigrant grandparents - what THEY did was HARD.I think about those exchanges often. Tech -- at this particular moment in history -- disproportionately rewards &#34;hard work&#34; (which many of us find fun anyways). Or perhaps better to say that Tech provides access to the right kind of opportunities that allow for a DEFAULT &#34;life gets better&#34;, with the possibilities of &#34;life suddenly gets 100x better&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m always super intrigued by the reMarkable 2, but I think it&#39;s because it paints an image of the type of person I think it&#39;d be cool to be, someone who can just write down notes and draw stuff with a really cool, slim device. Someone who carries around moleskines and uses them, instead of just buying so many of them in different shapes and leaving them in a drawer packed to the brim with notebooks.The problem keeps coming back to the fact that I&#39;m absolutely not the type of person who wants to carry that thing around everywhere and who likes or is good at hand writing or drawing. I realize I won&#39;t base all my life and processes around this one device that is also supposedly hard to get info off of easily into things like OneNote. If I was somewhere without a computer, then I wouldn&#39;t be carrying this big tablet on me. I&#39;ve bought enough tablets and laptops with writable screens and MS surfaces over the years to know that I still never drew or took notes with the pen, but I still keep buying them hoping I will.The thing is still so cool and I want it, but maybe I&#39;ll wait for version 3 or 4 and extra disposable income that will go to waste on it!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bought a Remarkable 2 a month or two ago because I wanted a cool hackable e-ink Linux computer. But instead I immediately started using it as an e-book and document reader and note-taking pad, and nothing else. And, so far at least, that&#39;s perfect.The screen is beautiful (a bit gray, but the black is really black so the contrast is still good), the device is thin and reasonably light, I only have to charge it once a week or so, and there are absolutely no distractions. I have even rediscovered the visceral pleasantness of writing by hand.I especially like that it&#39;s *not* running Android (which I dislike more with each release). The biggest drawbacks, to me, are the fragile pen nibs and the inability to just SCP a PDF or EPUB to the device and have it work (their sync software works but isn&#39;t great)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bought the Onyx Boox Note Air some months ago, and I must say that I&#39;m really happy with it. Screen refresh is good, there&#39;s almost no ghosting in default mode, and refresh rates are acceptable.There are only two downsides about it: The vendor does not respect FOSS and does not publish the sources for their modified Linux kernel, and the device constantly phones home to China. However, the device can be rooted easily [1], and you can install a firewall to stop the preloaded apps from phoning home (verified it with Wireshark).[1]: https://blog.tho.ms/hacks/2021/03/27/hacking-onyx-boox-note-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great example of why Google FLoC is not incentive-compatible with consumers nor business owners.  Amazon (like Facebook) has a monopoly on ad targeting on their target properties—- properties they own.  Google FLoC is Google’s attempt to (further) monopolize their target properties—- the web at large, which Google does NOT own.  Google does NOT pay to service the traffic they generate.  Google does NOT pay to fulfill consumer orders.  Google wants you to think they’re acting in your best interests with FLoC.  Maybe if Google offered more free GCloud credits and subsidized conversions they generate, that would be a different story. (Maybe Google could start by paying Wikipedia for some of the traffic they generate).  But Sundar wants you to think FLoC is about privacy, because Sundar has said time and time again that Google has lost people’s trust."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, the bias in this article is unbelievably blatant:&#34;[Amazon is] preventing Google’s tracking system FLoC — or Federated Learning of Cohorts — from gathering valuable data reflecting the products people research in Amazon’s vast e-commerce universe&#34;Compare with, e.g.:&#34;Amazon is taking steps to protect its user&#39;s privacy by blocking Google&#39;s heavy-handed overreach in leveraging its Chrome browser to spy on user&#39;s personal shopping habits and sell that information to other retailers&#34;.(Note: I&#39;m not saying my rewrite is unbiased.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To me this editor gets it right in the sense that we don’t need to get rid of code as the “nocode” movement is trying. Instead we need to make coding more enjoyable and figure out ways to make it more interactive.One specific thing Utopia addresses to me is the need for the code and the actual thing to be treated more as one single interactable component and not two separate things.Instead we&#39;re treating the thing as a one-way compile step. There&#39;s no way to sync the DevTools in-memory changes we make to the DOM with the actual code.The fact that Utopia allows the two things to be treated as one is a huge step towards making webdev more enjoyable.And they’re following good steps… SwiftUI’s editor is very similar in this regard. Using the code as the main thing but having all kinds of interactable components around it that make writing code simpler with cool visual autocomplete widgets &amp; visual aids.Before with direct DOM changes building something like this was impossible but now with the React paradigm is seems natural to have this sync between code and visuals.Kudos to the team for pulling this off."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Product designer here. I just spent the past few hours fine-tuning some visual details in our Figma component library. Now I need to file tickets for each change and work with our frontend developers to make sure the updated Figma details get properly mapped over to React.I&#39;ve grown numb to the friction, but I think this Utopia demo just reset my pain tolerance. Going back to manually mapping designs from Figma mocks to React components feels so dated. Almost like those PSD2HTML websites of the early 2000s.The market absolutely needs a product like this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After five minutes of playing with it and failing to find it... where is the panel of components to drag and drop into the tree? Seems like the most basic functionality in an editor like this. Something that VB had in 1993. This should be something that is obvious and visible on a first glance.Another issue I have with the UI is that a lot of elements are greyed out even though they remain interactive. The convention is that UI elements that are greyed out are not interactive due to the current state of the application (wrong mode, unmatched requisites etc). This application seems to violate that and I&#39;m still baffled as to what greying out of UI elements means in in this app. If they aren&#39;t disabled why are they greyed out?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can’t help but see some kind of special interest or agenda whenever I hear a news story now. You have to ask why they chose to report this, why they slant things one way or another with their choice of wording and emphasis. What is the aspect of this story that is too politically incorrect or unfashionable to be included?I have never researched a topic deeply and found that the media had been covering that topic accurately, ever. The harsh truth is that generally speaking the news is almost completely useless. You might as well just never watch it.I think the very final nail in the coffin was the leaked recordings of the CNN technical director basically admitting what everyone pretty much already knew. That they spread misinformation deliberately, only give interviews to subject experts who they know will say what CNN prefers them to say and ultimately design everything they put on the screen to get hooks inside your limbic system and keep your eyes glued. The main tool they use to do this is the emotion of fear, and it was for this reason and no other that they created a COVID death counter. And every single one of those points is explicitly, literally and plainly stated on video by a very senior employee of CNN for all to see. so I’m afraid that I can’t be brushed aside as a Russian bot. It’s right there on YouTube.And what about all the other media companies? This CNN leak, which is maybe the very embodiment of a scoop, was not on the front page of any major newspaper or news website. It was not elaborated on. It was basically not reported."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anyone else burnt out from the outrage cycle in recent times?I don’t know if it’s selfish but I just don’t have the energy anymore to care about what bad thing person X or company Y did this week.My current philosophy is to treat news/Reddit/social media like email in the old days.That is: log on to a desktop computer once a week and read the highlights. It is not accessible except through the desktop computer.The funny thing is this approach is completely opposite the “stories” trend in social media. It makes you really aware of the FOMO-by-design pattern these days."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like this post has a lot of hindsight bias in it. People are going to get things wrong sometimes. I think there&#39;s a lot of things to legit criticize mainstream media for, but not having 100% accurate crystal ball isn&#39;t one of them.If the thesis of this piece is that newswriters sometimes get things wrong, or sometimes write sensationalized things, all i can say is, no duh."</p>

Every time I turn on location, then open Google Maps, Maps prompts me to turn on the &#34;enhanced experience&#34;.

The approach take was: instruct pupils to draw a house on paper, using only straight lines; teach them briefly what a coordinate system is (assigning numeric addresses - pairs of numbers - to points), which they haven&#39;t had in their maths curriculum at that stage, but which they easily picked up; translate the paper-based house into a sequence of PyTurtle Python commands."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Considering that Stripe was originally known for letting websites accept credit card payments without seeing your credit card number, one might assume that Stripe Identity only allows websites to see the verification result, and not your selfies and scans of your identity documents.That would be an incorrect assumption.  Per https://support.stripe.com/questions/managing-your-id-verifi... customers of Stripe Identity have API access to &#34;captured images of the ID document, selfies, extracted data from the ID document, keyed-in information, and the verification result&#34;.Thus, when you use Stripe Identity to verify your identity, you have to trust that:1. The website doesn&#39;t download, retain, and later leak your selfie and identity information.2. The website&#39;s Stripe API token isn&#39;t compromised and exploited by identity thieves to access your selfie and identity information.Stripe appears to be leaning heavily on their claim that they don&#39;t disclose &#34;biometric identifiers&#34; to websites and that these &#34;biometric identifiers&#34; are deleted from their systems within 48 hours. This is extremely deceptive considering that biometric identifiers can be reconstructed from the selfie."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The landing page contains logos for clubhouse, discord, and shippo, which are presumably companies use the service. Does anyone find those usages to be unnecessarily intrusive? Maybe it&#39;s just me, but a chat app or shipping site asking me for a drivers license scan + selfie would make me never want to use the service again. It&#39;s appalling how this sort of stuff is getting normalized, eg. google asking for id scans for age verification."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Smart. Banks haven&#39;t been allowed to monetize their KYC data, but this new non-bank class of payments companies have this opportunity. Interac has been trying to do this for many years.Some years ago I worked on a system let banks do identity assertions with proofs via SAML attributes instead of sharing customer PII. It is now a federation of banks in wide use for govt services in Canada. The use cases were really limited because the federation partners were too conservative to extend the identity services to relying party consumer applications real people actually wanted to use, and institutional sales cycles meant product feedback was glacial, so it has existed for over a decade in this relative backwater of gov-tech. I think identity companies have mostly failed to get traction because of a terminal lack of consumer sexiness, whereas Stripe has the jelly.Other companies in the identity space have been working on protocols and platforms, but none of them had a user base to extend an identity federation services into, which means they have never been able to make a real or viable product, just interesting techs. An internet payment provider with young consumer traction getting into identity is a Very Big Deal.It&#39;s going to position Stripe to knock out a lot of retail banks who can&#39;t offer similar services. Imo, this could make them bigger than Apple."</p>

I mean it was never cold, but right now seems to be insane.If the work-from-home thing has given you thoughts about what you like, now is the time to go. I see very few firms insisting on onsite work though, having interviewed with quite a few over the last few weeks. Even guys that I know would rather have people in the office and would pay them very well are feeling forced to let people work from home at least a couple of days.Salary wise it seems like it&#39;s breaking upwards too, though of course all I have is my own offers and the word of some recruiters. There&#39;s also just a lot of firms out there who are happy to create roles for people they like, or discuss new ventures with new people.Also, don&#39;t forget if you&#39;re going to look, absolutely everyone is interviewing remotely. You can sit at home at interviews all day until you find the job for you, something you might not be able to once more firms go back in the office."</p>

That implementation is a little more janky, but it also mostly works."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Shoutout to BurntsushiHe knows how to keep a good changelog https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/CHANGELOG.... it’s good to read through and see the progress.He also cares about ergonomics as well as performance which I like. I find it much more easier to use than existing Grep tools.Interestingly, I believe Ripgrep started off as a test harness to benchmark the Rust Regex crate (he was the author of that). It was originally not intended to be a consumer cli. I guess he dogfooded it that well it became a successful tool"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Also consider installing ripgrep-all [1], an extension making it possible to search through PDFs, eBooks, ZIPs and other documents.
The integration with fzf is also fantastic![1] https://github.com/phiresky/ripgrep-all"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"ripgrep is absolutely fantastic software. If you&#39;re not using it yet I guarantee it&#39;s worth taking the time to install and learn basic usage.On macOS: &#34;brew install ripgrep&#34; - then use &#34;rg searchterm&#34; to search all nested files in the current directory that contain searchterm.You may be using it without realizing already: the code search feature in VS Code uses ripgrep under the hood."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This appears to actually go significantly beyond enforced password disclosure.  From the text ( http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Gen_Scheme_of_AGS_(Powers)_Bil... ), on Head 16 (p 28):- An officer can use these requirements on anyone who &#34;appears to him or her to have access&#34;.  They don&#39;t appear to need any evidence beyond that.  The person does not need to be a suspect or, it appears, the subject of a warrant, just a person present at the location subject to the search warrant.- It applies not just to access to information on the device, but information &#34;which can be accessed by the use of that computer&#34;, and thus presumably includes information that is on other machine, or potentially not even in Ireland or the EU.- It allows officers to freely operate computers on site during a search (this seems like horrible forensic practice?), and use passwords found on the site to try to access any information accessible from the computer.- It does not just include disclosing passwords.  It includes &#34;any password or encryption key&#34;, and anything &#34;to otherwise enable [the officer] to examine the information accessible by the computer&#34;.- It even appears that it allows officers to compel people not just to disclose passwords but to actually operate the device for them so as to enable information access, and &#34;to produce the information in a form in which it can be removed&#34;.- It is not clear to me that there is any restriction on the scope of information, so long as it is in some way accessible.- Head 17 appears to allow even legally (or otherwise) privileged information to be seized, so long as &#34;the confidentiality of the material can be maintained pending the determination by the court of the issue as to whether the material is privileged material&#34;.Combining these powers would seem to be able to result in ridiculous situations, for example, forcing a person to take data from a US server using an SSH key on their laptop, potentially violating US law by doing so, and for the person to do all the work necessary to do this themselves."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interestingly, such a law does nothing against proper criminals. People that know they have incriminating evidence will either not carry it on their phones or uses some form of steganography to hide it perfectly. In the worst case, they will have some form of wipe-me passphrase that cleans the device before unlocking.Normal people, on the other hand, do not have these kind of (mental, time) resources. They will be forced to unlock their phones and something incriminating (for instance regarding &#34;hate speech&#34; or &#34;intellectual property rights&#34; or just &#34;traffic violations&#34;) will be found. I consider this approach one step more in the direction of keeping every citizen an on-demand criminal. There are so many, sometimes incomprehensible, laws nowadays that pretty much everyone is not compliant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s a fun fact! If you appear to the police officer to have access or passwords, and don&#39;t give it to them, they can charge you with obstruction and jail you for up to 5 years!So if you can&#39;t prove that you don&#39;t have the password, you&#39;re in a bit of trouble!-------------------------------------16 (1).(e).(v) to require any person at that place who appears to him or her to have access to or to have under his power or control the information held in any such computer or which can be accessed by the use of that computer—(I) to give  to  him  or  her  any  password  or  encryption  key  necessary  to operate it,(II) to otherwise enable him or her to examine the information accessible by the computer in a form in which the information is visible and legible,(III) to produce the information in a form in which it can be removed and in which it is, or can be made, visible and legible67 (2).(d) A person who fails to comply with a requirement under Head 9 (1), (2) or (3), or Head 16 (1). is guilty of an offence and is liable—(i)  on  summary  conviction,  to  a  class  A  fine  or  imprisonment  for  a  term  not exceeding 12 months or both, or(ii) on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding €30,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Features I want to see in things like this:1. Images/videos showing the exercises2. Program generators. I have {equipment} and n days per week. Which programs work for me? Or, I have {goal} and n days per week, what should I do? The programs would be populated with exercises from the DB, programs could be exported, etc.3. As much ELI5 info as possible - the barrier to exercise for a lot of people (myself included despite my experience) can be not knowing wtf something is, or why to do it, and generally what the benefits are.4. Treat warmups like any exercise - a critical part of the routine. Include lots of warm up exercises, whether it&#39;s something you make quantifiable progress with or not. Everything from skipping rope and light jogging to dead bugs. Include these as part of program generation.Maybe something does this, but my favourite tracker (Strong) doesn&#39;t cover all of it and I&#39;d switch in an instant if something did. I like the idea of switching programs every year or so, experimenting with warm ups, having convenient access to understanding programs and lifts better, etc. As it is, working out requires a crazy amount of research. Or a coach."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was wondering if https://musclewiki.com/ was going to pop up. My wife had just sent it to me earlier this week.It lets you pick gender, muscle group, exercise type (stretch, bodyweight, barbell, dumbbells, kettlebells) and has detailed instructions and videos. (It does not have sets/reps like the shared site.) Perhaps they would be good to use in tandem.Personally, I think for sets/reps, it follows most exercise advice. Choose what you&#39;ll actually do. If that&#39;s 3 sets of 5 reps, fine. Do that. If you can get yourself to consistently do more than that over time, you&#39;ll benefit from the increase in volume. (When I&#39;m active, I follow Starting Strength style - increase warm-up weight while decreasing reps; then a bunch of working weight sets.)"</p>

What dopamine rush can i hope to get by contributing to your database :( ?Or at least comments."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Social and Economic Effects of the [Bubonic] PlagueSince it was so difficult (and dangerous) to procure goods through trade and to produce them, the prices of both goods produced locally and those imported from afar skyrocketed. Because of illness and death workers became exceedingly scarce, so even peasants felt the effects of the new rise in wages. The demand for people to work the land was so high that it threatened the manorial holdings. Serfs were no longer tied to one master; if one left the land, another lord would instantly hire them.https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Italian_Studies/dweb/plagu..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"By “quitting” they mostly mean getting new jobs or career changes. Not necessarily refusing to work in an office. The headline is misleading.It’s also still a relatively small number in absolute terms:&gt; In April, the share of U.S. workers leaving jobs was 2.7%, according to the Labor Department, a jump from 1.6% a year earlier to the highest level since at least 2000.The higher turnover is expected in a booming economy like the one we’re in.These articles with hyperbolic headlines and underwhelming actual data are very common right now. It feels like the journalists want us to believe some sort of revolution is happening, be it WFH or remote work or people quitting in droves. I’m beginning to think the reality is mostly a boring return to pre-pandemic normalcy, though, given how hard these articles are teaching for something noteworthy to share."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think folks might be interested to consider some of the other myths and tests in the series, such as:* Titanium is ligther than steel* Fenders slow you down* Stiffer frames are faster* Disc brakes work better than rim brakes* Higher tire pressure is faster* Bigger wheels roll fasterhttps://www.renehersecycles.com/category/myths-in-cycling/For more nuanced tire testing and results, check out these two more recent articles* https://www.renehersecycles.com/how-we-test-tires/* https://www.renehersecycles.com/bq-tire-test-results/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Narrower tires, necessarily inflated to a high pressure, are actually inefficient on a bumpy surface.A tire&#39;s job is to absorb surface defects in the road, and that is not only for comfort, but rolling efficiency.The extreme example of this occurs off-road. Off-road vehicles benefit from wider tires that are inflated to a lower pressure. If you have an off-road vehicle, it behooves you to take some of the air out of the tires when you go off-road.25mm road bike tires basically require a polished velodrome; real roads consist of pitted, eroded and cracked asphalt.If your bike is vibrating from the crappy road, you&#39;re probably not going as fast as you could be. Letting some of the air out for a more efficient, smoother ride is risky, if the tires a narrow; you risk snakebite flats and damage to the rim.For commuting in run-down city with aging infrastructure, you want at at least 38 mm tires. 40 mm is a nice round number. You can vary the pressure for the kinds of roads you&#39;re riding on with a lot of margin, and can take it quite low for dirt roads.I&#39;ve commuted around town with pressures as low as 45 psi in the back, 35 in the front, in 45 mm tires.I have story in relation to that. One time I was riding along NW Marine Drive in Vancouver, from UBC down to Spanish Banks. I came down from the hill and then along the flats there were some Spandex-clad road cyclists ahead of me. I pulled up to them and we were neck and neck. There was road work going on up ahead and the pavement had been scraped, leaving it horribly bumpy. I stood on the pedals and just cranked right through it, hardly slowing down. I saw in the mirror mounted on my eyeglasses that road bike guys dropped off as if a sniper had taken them out.What is the use of narrow tires? It&#39;s just fashion, like stiletto heels."</p>
