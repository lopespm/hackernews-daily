								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m pretty skeptical of most of the Pro-Assange reporting that happens because so often it seems very unreliable - cherry picking things, misrepresenting things etc. For example, I don&#39;t know enough about the Assange charges to say what is relevant or not relevant to the extradition, but just from a basic premise - what most people know Assange for is nothing to do with hacking Iceland MPs so it seems pretty unlikely that this would be a material part of the extradition. It would be kind of weird if that were a core part of the extradition, yet this article seems to be making out this is the star witness. I just doubt it frankly.It doesn&#39;t help the author that they repeat tired old accusations about the judge being biased."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t think the problem is with the &#34;lie&#34; that the innocent need not fear surveillance. Most people will agree that mass-surveillance will negatively affect some people that are indispensable to healthily functioning liberal society: journalists, activists, academics, public figures...The problem is that even if most people don&#39;t subscribe to the &#34;nothing to hide&#34; argument in general, they do not care about themselves being the target of surveillance.Having unsuccessfully tried to make family and acquaintances more aware of privacy issue, I can confidently say that the &#34;nothing to hide&#34; argument is nothing next to the &#34;I don&#39;t care&#34; attitude. It&#39;s not just being the target of a wrongful accusation, arguments about unintended public shaming, identity theft, negative economic consequences (higher insurance premium or mortgage rates if your bank has more information about you), none of it will work.I think there is some sort of a Tverskyan study to be done here about expected value and perceived risk. Overall for most people the equation is always: (probability of data being mishandled) * damage &lt; time and effort required to maintain my privacy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a fight we are only ever gonna lose.I.e. in Germany, I have seen wave after wave of surveillance passed. People try to fight back each time. Often the supreme court cancels the unconstitutional laws.But they always try again. And it only takes a football euro cup or Worldcup, or Olympic games or a natural catastrophy to provide the distraction for the public to pass another law.Our governments want to surveil us, and they will do it whether we like it or not.People only stand up and fight if the damage if the fight is smaller than the damage of what they are fighting against. We live comfortable, so we will take a lot of this type of immoral behaviour of our leaders. The figth will only start after enough innocent surveillance victims are harmed in the real world (i.e. their data is leaked or worse) and enough people have felt negative consequences of this surveillance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hopefully some will ask themselves why the &#34;beacon of democracy&#34; in the region is so ready and open to sell tools used almost solely to prevent the spread of true democracy to their neighbours? And then maybe we should all have a long hard think about how this translates to our own disgusting arms industries as a whole."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If I understand the story correctly, they had the suspect in custody and yet failed to positively ID him, relying on an ID he had stolen from an innocent man named Ousmane Bah.  The ID had no photo and was labeled &#34;not to be used for identification&#34;.  SIS filed a police report which said they had video evidence showing the perpetrator.They then put out a &#34;BOLO&#34; with the innocent man&#39;s name, had him arrested, figured out they have the wrong guy, do nothing about it and had him arrested again.When Bah appeared in court to answer charges and Apple was asked to present the video that would have cleared Bah, Apple claimed that the video had been deleted.  The video was later found by Bah&#39;s attorney during discovery.  This happened more than once.  A warrant was issued for Bah’s arrest and contained the photo of the imposter.  Bah was arrested even though the he doesn&#39;t resemble the imposter, other than being Black.  Prosecution against Bah continued in multiple states through June 2019.Hmmm, seems like a lot of people involved in this case should be fired, including the Apple Employees, SIS Employees and Police officers, reguardless of whatever other outcomes there are."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Apple then told the Suffolk County prosecutor &#34;that the video evidence of the impostor, which would have completely exculpated Ousmane Bah, had been routinely deleted.&#34;Why would anyone routinely delete evidence of crime instead of making a copy of it before it was deleted? What&#39;s the point of having surveillance equipment and footage if it&#39;s just routinely deleted even if there was a theft?&gt;The video from an October 2018 theft misattributed to Bah in Rockaway, New Jersey, was also deleted.Oh wow, again?&gt;And as it turned out, the video of the Boston incident turned up eventually – Bah&#39;s attorneys found it during the discovery process. It showed the impostor, not Bah.They should open a criminal investigation into what happened with the video. Intentionally accusing someone they know to be innocent, taking their time and freedom is completely inexcusable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;identified the individual as Ousmane Bah based on the examination of the temporary learner&#39;s permit he is said to have had on himSo essentially a kid stole another kids ID. Because the (thieving) kid had gotten in trouble with the same ID before it was also a match in the database.It does seem like a true failure but the headline makes it sound like this was an AI falsely accusing someone based on pure randomness. Even without the tech, the police would have had the name of the wrongly accused person because the security guard only had the fake/wrong ID and the person&#39;s ability to match faces was not great."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recently had the privilege of trying to do the right thing when I identified fraudulent research carried out by an institution in Austria. The initial response of the institution was positive but when I pressed for further details on how such things could happen suddenly nobody anymore would take my call. The research was paid for by a private company to pimp a nonsense product. The research was never published in a research journal but it didn&#39;t stop the company using the name of the university alonside exerpts from the paper in marketing material alongside gushing claims of &#34;proved by science&#34;.The company threatened to sue me and the university threatened me as well. Neither has followed through on threats. The company wants to keep selling their rubbish magnetic health ding ding and I assume the university wants nobody to look into how positive results for the product came out of their institution. Allround an education on how the real world works."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When you want to do a proper work, your grants and papers get rejected because they are not innovatove enough or don&#39;t go far enough. So it is not a surprise that people that lied in their applications about what they can realistically do also lie when it comes to reporting results. Unfortunately there is no way out. I stopped counting how many reviewers of my grants disagreed on what was proposed, one saying that it was not innovative, the other saying that is was too risky to use this approach. We have a big problem in science, peer-review is broken and everything relies on it. And many reviewers are way out of touch about what happens in their field, I see reviews that clearly show the reviewer was sleeping for the last 10 years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had the &#34;privilege&#34; of reviewing a certain piece of software written to model a certain pandemic outbreak...Numerical modelling in biology/virology feels rife with serious problems that are simply sidestepped because of ego and status. I raised alarms and as merely a senior expert in distributed computation and numerical modelling I was shutdown quite strongly. After the group in question were forced to accept our published work refuting their results to be FUBAR due to severe numerical instabilities which hadn&#39;t even been checked for we were shut out for a group who patted them on the back for being &#34;oh so clever&#34;...(our published work numerically demonstrated results they were presenting as fact were compatible with statistical noise and that it is known they didn&#39;t have the required extra 100xcompute or 100xtime to produce results as precise as what they were after)Had a similar experience a few years ago with a geological modelling group and a group hoping to do biochemistry on a huge cluster of 20k cpu cores.
For all of the &#34;numerical sciences&#34; achievements only really physics and chemistry (and maths) seem to have championed the ideas of reproducibility and falsifiability in numerical analysis and simulation."</p>

It has a lot of problems, sure, but it&#39;s a creative use of the Web and would surely work for some use cases. It&#39;s certainly no worse than using Flash ever was.It reminds me a bit of a &#34;newsletter&#34; I&#39;m subscribed to called, ironically, &#34;Not a Newsletter&#34; (http://notanewsletter.com/). You get an email from the author each month and it just points to a Google Doc where he puts the actual content. Why&#39;s this good?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Curious to see comments quipping that some of the math problems geared towards young kids are too hard. I&#39;d recommend taking a look at Singapore Math[0] to get an idea of what kids in those age ranges are actually capable of doing, provided that adults shed preconceptions that children ought to be &#34;sheltered from hard scary stuff&#34;, and instead encourage them.There are also great math-oriented games these days (I had some good success w/ prodigygame.com[1]).My youngest daughter is 6 and can solve simple multiplication and division problems. Sometimes she even surprises me. Some time ago, we were introducing ourselves to a new neighbor and the convo went somewhat along these lines:- my son: how old is your dog?- neighbor: she&#39;s 8- son: she&#39;s so small, is she a puppy?- neighbor: oh no, she&#39;s grown up. 1 dog year is about 7 human years, so-- daughter [interrupting]: oh wow, so then she is 56!The other day, she came to me beaming to explain how she had just solved 38/2 (by doing 40/2, 2/2 and subtracting the results). Gotta say it&#39;s a joy to see a kid that enjoys math.[0] https://www.singaporemath.com/[1] https://www.prodigygame.com/main-en/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On a related subject, here is a recent experience and I dont know how to deal with it.I have been helping my kids with their homework during the pandemic, I thought it would be easy since I got very good grade 25+ years ago. And then when I sat down doing it. I couldn&#39;t remember a thing. Not a single thing. All of a sudden, apart from basic algebra, all of the maths were gone. Zip, Zero. I couldn&#39;t remember how sin cos tan works any more. It was like a few years of memory in my brain went missing. For some people it may be funny and have a laugh about it. For me it was shocking, quite horrifying and depressing.I am thinking if I should relearn all those maths again. If so how do you go about it? Most of my friends aren&#39;t any good at maths so they thought not remembering any thing was not a problem.But for some strange reason all the basic for Physics, Chemistry and Biology were still there. At least half of it. It was just maths. I dont know if anyone else have similar experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These problems are very simple and surprisingly fun to work with. Their purpose is to develop &#34;thinking culture&#34; (Arnold says this in the intro). He also writes that &#34;the worst at solving these simple problems are Nobel and Fields prize winners&#34; :) Now, I think that&#39;s Russian hyperbole or poetic licence, if you will, but it does illustrate an issue I run into nearly daily teaching maths to 13 - 15 year olds: Some of the kids think in ways I have a hard time understanding and often solve problems in ways which are difficult for me to grok because they are not using mathematical language to explain what they&#39;re doing. This happens especially with kids who generally perform poorly in maths. They solve problems similar to these in ways I have a lot of trouble understanding because it&#39;s like we are speaking two different languages. These problems are trivially easy if you translate them into simple equations (the ones I&#39;ve done, anyway). The problem is I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what Arnold means when he says &#34;Thinking culture&#34;, so I suspect I might be cheating ;)Edit: Nr. 13 is wonderful :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My shield updated to this the other day. I&#39;m pretty furious about it, it&#39;s not a cheap device, and it&#39;s certainly not Google&#39;s. To be adding these &#34;features&#34; without asking, irrespective of whatever agreement between me, Nvidia or Google exists, is ridiculous.I know it&#39;s in whatever terms I, uh, &#34;accepted&#34;, but there&#39;s just no escaping it in this day and age.Fortunately, I know how to use ADB and just installed another launcher, but most other people just have to bend over and take it. No doubt ADB tricks won&#39;t be sufficient in future updates and I&#39;ll be playing more silly games with a device I own.Apple is seems almost as bad too. There&#39;s recommendations that I don&#39;t want. It&#39;s certainly worse in that I would have even less control and be unable to remove them.It&#39;s certainly a good thing that I don&#39;t live anywhere near a Google office, otherwise I&#39;d be launching this POS through one of their windows if I did."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve had the Shield for years and set them up for a few family members. I still believe it&#39;s the best device of its kind on the market and I&#39;ve recommended it every chance so I have a lot of friends with them as well.In the most recent update, the until-now ad-free homepage was defaced with an ad banner that takes up half the screen and can&#39;t be removed. This wasn&#39;t a change made by Nvidia but by Google to the Android TV Launcher. To add to this, some of the ads have been deemed inappropriate or offensive to certain users adding to the frustration of ads being introduced to this long-standing ad-free experience.I, like many Shield owners, am considering installing a third party launcher. This can be done pretty easily by watching an instruction video on Youtube and most users will go this route without consideration of security - potentially opening large numbers of the devices up to vulnerabilities."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Test your backups&#34; is so easy to say, but quite difficult for many to do. There are a lot of shops that probably don&#39;t know how to recreate a machine from scratch. How many systems are developed as balls of clay. Little bits added and smeared in over time until the ball just gets bigger, but each piece lost in the process. How many folks can go through their local config files and explain all of entries, how many can even tell which ones they have changed, or why? Especially when they were changed by Frank, but he left 2 years ago.You&#39;d like to think you can just restore the system from backup and it&#39;ll just light back up. But how do you test this without cratering your existing system? Like a boat in a basement, many system are built in-situ and can be very rigid.Modern environments like cloud computing and creation scripts can mitigate this a bit organically, but how many of these systems are just a tower running Windows w/SQL Server and who knows what else? Plus whatever client software is on the client machines.How do you test that in isolation?At least read the media to see if it can be read (who doesn&#39;t love watching a backup tape fail halfway through the restore).Simply, it takes a lot of engineering to make a system that can be reliably restored, much less on a frequent basis. And this is all engineering that doesn&#39;t impact the actual project -- getting features to users and empowering the business. Which can make the task even more difficult."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I&#39;ve always wondered: How do you prevent ransomware from ruining your backups, too?Lots of ransomware tends to be &#34;delayed&#34; – it can&#39;t encrypt everything instantly, so it encrypts a little bit each minute. During those minutes, isn&#39;t it conceivable that the now-encrypted files replace your old backups?I suppose this isn&#39;t really a &#34;backup&#34; but rather a &#34;mirroring strategy.&#34; But for certain kinds of data -- photos, video, large media -- can you really afford to do any other kind of strategy?The other question I have is related to that first point: since ransomware can&#39;t encrypt everything all at once, how is it possible for your system to continue to function? As you can tell, I&#39;m a ransomware noob, but it&#39;s quite interesting to me from an engineering standpoint. Does the system get into a &#34;half encrypted&#34; state where, if you rebooted it, it would fail to boot at all? Or does ransomware targeted at businesses tend to be more of a surgical strike, where it targets and wipes out specific datastores before anyone notices?(It&#39;s the &#34;before anyone notices&#34; part that I&#39;m especially curious about. Isn&#39;t there some kind of alarm that could be raised more or less instantly, because something detects unexpected binary blobs being created on your disk?)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This really hits home, decades ago - I was working at this place that did daily tape backups.  I remember thinking, this is unreal - there&#39;s literally a room filled with tapes.One day, I asked if they ever had performed a recovery off of the tapes, as I questioned if the tapes were even being written to.  (NOTE:  Backups was not my job at all. )Why had I brought this up?  I would be in the server room and never saw the blinky lights on the tape...well.. blink. Everyone literally laughed at me, thought was a grade A moron.A year later, servers died... Pop&#39;ed in the tape... Blank.  No worries, they had thousands more of these tapes.  Sadly, they were all MT.  They had to ship hard drives to a recovery shop, and it was rather expensive.I left shortly after this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Congrats!I tried Julia for the first time last week and it was great.I&#39;ve been playing with the idea of defining a hash function for lists that can be composed with other hashes to find the hash of the concatenation of the lists. I tried to do this with matrix multiplication of the hash of each list item, but with integer mod 256 elements random matrices are very likely to be singular and after enough multiplications degenerates to the zero matrix. However, with finite field (aka Galois fields) elements, such a matrix is much more likely to be invertible and therefore not degenerate. But I don&#39;t really know anything about finite fields, so how should I approach it? Here&#39;s where Julia comes in: with some help I was able to combine two libraries, LinearAlgebraX.jl which has functions for matrices with exact elements, with GaloisFields.jl which implements many types of GF, and wrote up a working demo implementation of this &#34;list hash&#34; idea in a Pluto.jl  [2] notebook and published it [0] (and a question on SO [1]) after a few days without having any Julia experience at all. Julia seems pretty approachable, has great libraries, and is very powerful (I was even able to do a simple multithreaded implementation in 5 lines).[0]: https://blog.infogulch.com/2021/07/15/Merklist-GF.html[1]: https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/92139/using-rando...[2]: https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I played with Julia a bit in grad school. Although I didn&#39;t end up using it much after that I thought it was a lovely language. Forget python, I hope Julia manages to kill off Matlab and its weird stranglehold on various pockets of academia. Congrats to the team here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Congrats to the Julia team.I am a python developer who has dabbled with Julia but it never stuck for me.I think Julia was built by academics for other academics running innovative high performance computing tasks. It excels at the intersection of 1) big data, so speed is important, and 2) innovative code, so you can&#39;t just use someone else&#39;s C package. Indeed, Julia&#39;s biggest successful applications outside academica closely resemble an academic HPC project (eg Pumas). I think it will continue to have success in that niche. And that&#39;s not a small niche! Maybe it&#39;s enough to support a billion dollar company.But most of us in industry are not in that niche. Most companies are not dealing with truly big data, on our scale, it is cheaper to expand the cluster than it is to rewrite everything in Julia. Most who ARE dealing with truly big data, do not need innovative code; basic summary statistics and logistic regression will be good enough, or maybe some cloud provider&#39;s prepackaged turn key neural nets scale out training system if they want to do something fancy.I think for Julia to have an impact outside of academia (and academia-like things in industry) it will need to develop killer app packages. The next PyTorch needs to be written in Julia. Will that happen? Maybe! I hope so! The world would be better off with more cool data science packages.But I think the sales pitch of &#34;it&#39;s like Pandas and scikit but faster!&#34; is not going to win many converts. So is Jax, Numba, Dask, Ray, Pachyderm, and the many other attempts within the Python community of scaling and speeding Python, that require much less work and expense on my part for the same outcome.Again, congrats to the team, I will continue to follow Julia closely, and I&#39;m excited to see what innovative capabilities come out of the Julia ecosystem for data scientists like me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m an engineering software contractor and every client has a whole bucket load of outdated IDEs and random USB interface drivers they want me to install on my machine. Often this stuff has weird specific version dependencies, kernel level drivers that cause weird things to happen (like the computer to BSOD if you boot it up with other USB devices attached), random system level crashes, and when you go to the driver download page there are always an unsettling list of simple security vulns noted.The #1 thing that I&#39;ve ever wanted is a Linux that lives between the bootloader and Windows that lets me achieve native performance on the Windows VM, but gives me an environment where I can easily do all the things that you can usually do in HyperV like create snapshots, clone installs, share Sharepoint drives between images, etc. But I do need something that is perfectly stable and just works. This is the right technology (thank you so much for working on it), but just not yet at a maturity that makes me feel comfortable about putting livelihood on the line.Edit: actually, please, if anyone knows something that suits this use-case, even if it costs decent money, please leave a comment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If anyone is interested, the main developer, who goes by &#39;gnif&#39; spends a decent amount of time on the dedicated Looking Glass sub-forum on the Level1Techs forum, here:https://forum.level1techs.com/c/software/lookingglass/142Level1Techs also has a ton of information and help both on the forum, and their YouTube channel, about setting up Looking Glass and VFIO. The main host of the YouTube channel, Wendell, has forgotten more about nitty-gritty system administration than I will likely ever know in my lifetime. He also just seems like a genuinely good human being."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I run a VFIO setup with a single GPU - the linux host is headless, and Windows runs on top with the GPU. Its pretty awesome. Windows runs at native performance - no problem gaming or running other heavy workloads. The linux host acts as a devbox and runs a few other homeserver style services.It&#39;s difficult to set up right but it taught me a lot about VMs and hardware. Once you get it setup well enough, its relatively painless. Like I haven&#39;t messed with my VM settings in over a year, everything just continues to work smoothly. Including windows updates, driver upgrades, most online games with anti-cheat etc. If i upgrade my hardware, it might take a day or two of tinkering to get it back up. Based on my benchmarking it runs within ~5% of native perf.This is still the best guide IMO if you want to set it up - https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF. Single GPU is basically the same as dual GPU, except you have to ensure the linux host does not take over the GPU or load any drivers for it during boot."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Pre M1, I&#39;ve always preferred a PC.When I&#39;m using a laptop, especially doing real work, they heat up, the fans go crazy, the laptop is hot to the touch and everything slows down.It almost makes you anxious. You&#39;re wondering if it&#39;s about to crash or go on fire.I&#39;ve always kept a Desktop PC on the go for this reason, a well cooled desktop just doesn&#39;t have these issues. With a laptop, I always feel like I&#39;m compromising a bit.I got an M1 Macbook Pro recently and it just doesn&#39;t have these issues, I fire up my whole dev environment and get busy, and it&#39;s still quiet and (mostly) cool, and I can&#39;t notice anything slowing down.I don&#39;t care so much about the architecture differences, x64 vs ARM etc, but the fact that I can finally use a laptop like a desktop is massive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is funny.  For the last ten years I&#39;ve used Mac laptops as my primary machine.  Of course the fan noise was a great auditory clue to tell me to check out Activity Monitor/top for rogue processes and help me optimize which tasks took too many resources.I didn&#39;t realize how much I relied on that cue until I temporarily switched to a Mac desktop machine during the pandemic when I didn&#39;t need to travel.  The desktop fans pretty much stay at 1200rpm all the time.  I think I&#39;ve seen them spike once.  I&#39;d forgotten how much better desktops can be for some things.Now I&#39;m looking for a better remote access solution so I can consider sticking with a desktop at home and then maybe just an iPad for travel with good remote access and file sync."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Funny. I spent a summer in 2009 in Vietnam, working on one of those old unbeatable Powerbook silver models, in an apartment without air conditioning. The fan would run at full power constantly, and finally gave up the ghost. There was no way to repair it where I was. So what I used to do was keep a bunch of Wired Magazines in the freezer, and put them under the laptop, changing them out every 20 minutes or so. The machine still works... but yeah, that fan noise is really a great subconscious reminder that you&#39;re using it too hard. Also a good way to know if your code just entered an infinite loop, long before any other warning comes up... and occasionally that clue gives you enough time to cancel a process before the input freezes.[edit] Just had a cool idea, since this discussion is heading towards how subtly useful auditory cues have been in our workflow. What if different processes played fans at different pitches, so the total volume still added up? That could actually be really useful out-of-band state information."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Big tech censorship will not solved without addressing the other half of a problem with two sides.Without systems that promote quality, non-ideological, nuanced, original, tolerant dialogue we will keep running into the false dilemma of unmoderated cess pools or heavy handed moderation.If we are to avoid this dilemma we need systems that organically promote constructive, tolerant and inclusive communication, and original, nuanced, intelligent, non-ideological ideas, instead of the opposite.This cannot be done by organizations whose profit incentive is aligned with user attention instead of user satisfaction.Those organizations benefit from degraded communication until strong moderation is both continually demanded and decried.---On a side note, I am so disappointed in the constant framing of ideas as right or left. It dumbs society down incredibly to view so much through the filter of two (often arbitrarily correlated, historically shifting) clusters of supposedly disjoint options.In the real world, communes work well sometimes, markets often work better at scale but not for everything, markets require &#34;social solutions&#34; like non-commercial criminal and civil justice systems, education and health could be explicitly tested and then managed as investments with a pay off of lower taxes (including for the rich) instead of as charities forced on the rich, etc.The Right/Left and associated ideologies are all self-defeating when believed in isolation and the nuances of their ragged edges, their limitations, and constructive combinations ignored."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This all sounds very nice, but there&#39;s a bit of sleight of hand here since the article goes out of its way to avoid details. That way everyone reads into exactly what they want, and it&#39;s totally non-obvious whether this is actually a workable proposal or not.But what&#39;s the concrete proposal here? How would things actually work? Will the services be forced to accept whatever unmoderated feed of filth the linked to service sends their way? If not, how is this supposed to fix the moderation problem?How are you supposed to link together applications with totally different data, interaction, and identity models? Obviously you couldn&#39;t link e.g. say Discord to Instagram and have the interactions between the systems make any sense. Are we just going to have a predefined ontology of possible social networkign apps, populated with the currently existing models, and define an API for all of then? When and how does that ontology get redefined? Or define a single lowest common denominator covering everything? What happens with features that don&#39;t fit into the models? They&#39;re entirely forbidden? They need to go through a multi-year public review bureacracy?Who exactly will be forced to interoperate, and who gets a free pass?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;First of all, the internet’s “marketplace of ideas” is severely lopsided at the platform levelThe marketplace of ideas itself has been show to be a bust in recent years, IMHO.Better ideas, better models of truth and reality don&#39;t win out. People have not shown themselves interested in intellectual debate or argument. We do not see the &#39;best&#39; ideas rise to the top. And before anyone asks who I am to judge the best ideas, I&#39;ll answer - nobody, but I can see that factually incorrect, scientifically illiterate, conspiratorial, harmful crank ideas gain legs in the online world we&#39;ve created. Often at the root of these is a profit motive.Is censorship the best way to deal with it? Probably not. But we do need to recognise this as a problem as well as getting het up about giant internet platforms deplatforming people."</p>

Every time. Why are we even surprised."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For politicians in democracies citizens are potential voters, foreigners don&#39;t matter.It&#39;s still arguably better than dictatorships, where your citizens don&#39;t matter either, as long as you have a good police system.We act surprised when we notice such things but we shouldn&#39;t be, it is a mistake to apply the same standards that we, as the lucky citizens of &#34;free countries&#34; enjoy, to any other system of power.From a less cynical point of view, as an Israeli, I am not happy at all to see this kind of export products from my country. It is in great part because of the conflict. Te SIGINT units are huge and among the people who graduate from the army with this kind of knowledge you will certainly find many who will turn a blind eye to ethics for a huge paycheck. Not to mention that the research itself that the defense apparatus needs attracts capitals from other countries that will buy some of it and use it for unorthodox means.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey all, author here. I didn&#39;t expect this to reach front page of HN. I came here to submit and it was here already! I am looking for more ideas to experiment. Here&#39;s one idea which someone from another forum gave me: exploring recursive queries and using SQLite random methods to do the insertions.Another crazy idea is to learn about SQLite file format and just write the pages to disk."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Database optimization posts are always interesting, but it&#39;s really hard to do any apples to apples comparison. Your performance is going to depend mostly on your hardware, internal database settings and tunings, and OS level tunings. I&#39;m glad this one included some insight into the SQLite settings disabled, but there&#39;s always going to be too many factors to easily compare this to your own setup.For most SQL systems, the fastest way to do inserts is always just going to batched inserts. There&#39;s maybe some extra tricks to reduce network costs/optimize batches [0], but at it&#39;s core you are still essentially inserting into the table through the normal insert path. You can basically then only try and reduce the amount of work done on the DB side per insert, or optimize your OS for your workload.Some other DB systems (more common in NoSQL) let you actually do real bulk loads [1] where you are writing direct(ish) database files and actually bypassing much of the normal write path.[0] https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/insert-optimization....
[1] https://blog.cloudera.com/how-to-use-hbase-bulk-loading-and-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can go even faster if you can organize your problem such that you simply start from a copy of a template SQLite database each time (it is just a file/byte sequence).We do SQL evaluation for a lot of business logic throughout our product, and we have found that starting from a template database (i.e. one with the schema predefined and canonical values populated) can save a lot of time when working in tight loops."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Do Signal, Wire, or Matrix do this transcript consistency thing, or is there some other way by which they prevent message reordering? From what I know, encrypted messengers almost never implement that. At least in Wire I noticed reordering at some point and it uses an implementation of what is now called the Signal protocol.And that&#39;s the most severe vulnerability from the article. The second one is &#34;mostly of theoretical interest&#34; according to the researchers themselves, the third requires &#34;an attacker [to] send many carefully crafted messages to a target, on the order of millions of messages&#34;, and the fourth &#34;requires sending billions of messages to a Telegram server within minutes&#34;. So while this is not bad research, not at all (it&#39;s really great that people take this close a look!), the title sounds rather more severe and people will obviously jump to the conclusion that &#34;See, MTproto is bad like we said all along!&#34; without reading anything. Good research, bad article?«Obligatory notice in Telegram comment threads: the real issue in Telegram is that end-to-end encryption is optional and made extremely inconvenient to use: no implementation at all in TDesktop, can&#39;t use it across multiple devices, doesn&#39;t work for group chats at all... That is the main reason Telegram isn&#39;t secure: they can read all your chats except when you use this stupid inconvenient mode.»"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Given how bashing on MTProto is a favourite cryptographers&#39; activity from the day-0, I&#39;m actually kinda encouraged by the fact that&#39;s all they found. It&#39;s especially nice, that htey could fix all of them without breaking back-compatibility, which isn&#39;t really a given for crypto protocols. Would appreciate more technical and less dumbed down responses from the Telegram team, though. I have no idea what the fuck &#34;counting grains in the bags of sound&#34; is supposed to mean.(Also, it&#39;s funny, but being accustomed to SMS and such I always somehow assumed Telegram messages can be reordered by chance too, if I send them fast. I never really thought about it, obviously, but simply didn&#39;t expect it to be otherwise.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While bashing on Telegram is basically HNs favorite past time, there aren&#39;t many other alternatives that work just as well in the area that I care the most about: being a great chat app. Telegram is fast, has native clients instead of a garbage web ui (or electron based app), has better stickers than the alternatives, is easy to write bots for and has a larger user base where I&#39;m at than any of the alternatives other than WhatsApp."</p>

Everyone there is working hard all year long, charging for tourist services very cheaply. Yet there are many examples of places with year long tourism, but you can still find mass closures during siesta.Everyone, through culture, decided not to overwork and there&#39;s no one &#34;hard-working&#34; enough to have their business open during siesta.

Much recommendedFrom Rosten’s Wikipedia page [2]:—In his book, The Joys of Yiddish, he defines the word chutzpah as &#34;that quality enshrined in a man who, having killed his mother and father, throws himself on the mercy of the court because he is an orphan.&#34;—-[0] https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nos_amis_les_Français(Funnily, the booklet’s title was translated to “Our friends the French”)[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joys_of_Yiddish[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Rosten"</p>

It sends everything you look at, everything you add to cart, while you are logged out of everything it will also persistently track your viewed items with a unique identifier. I understand that the below may be in PP/ToS but come on, a normal user will not.It does a lot of things completely opaque to the normal end user that are well above a &#34;please tell me if item X&#39;s reviews are good or bad&#34; - it practically sends Fakespot almost every single page interaction or click that you do on an Amazon property.It does the same on every other site it supports - whether or not you want your item inspected, it will notify Fakespot about what products you viewed, what browser, what you clicked on, Add to Cart or Buy Now clicks, Sort clicks, every product visible on page (by ID and seller).They also use the same unique session identifier across sites, so items you look at on eBay/Walmart/etc can be tied to the same person as items viewed on Amazon. If you choose to try to opt out of automatic item detection, that choice is also sent back to their servers (where it then returns a 4xx and tells you to sign up or sign in to fakespot with an account to save settings).The extension itself is many megabytes of heavily packed and obfuscated JS. If you have it installed, I would recommend not doing so."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why is everyone here just blaming Amazon? Of course they&#39;re going to ask Apple to do this. It&#39;s in their own self-interest.The more interesting questions is, why is Apple complying? Are they afraid that Amazon will retaliate by pulling their apps out of the App Store? If so, are they really just going to keep prioritizing big tech connections in favor of it&#39;s own customers?The rule cited is so vague that even a basic paid browser app would break it. All the app does is augment data available from any web browser with other data.&gt; 5.2.2 Third-Party Sites/Services: If your app uses, accesses, monetizes access to, or displays content from a third-party service, ensure that you are specifically permitted to do so under the service’s terms of use.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"EIP 1559 is a substantial change to the handling of gas fees on the network. In addition to making gas fees be 2 parts (base and &#34;priority&#34; fees), this includes a provision for &#34;burning&#34; the base fee, reducing the overall ETH supply. From the code itself:  # miner only receives the priority fee; note that the base fee is not given to anyone (it is burned)

Models i have seen suggest this will not make ETH deflationary, as the expected burn rates are outpaced by expected mining rates, but the proposal does specifically make note of this[1].1: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559#eth-burn-precludes-f..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If readers are curious how to get up-and-running with a (non-mining) full node (ETH1) at home, it&#39;s quite simple.This is how I did/do it on my Intel NUC running Ubuntu Server 20.04:1. Download a prebuilt binary from https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/.2. Unpack it. Optionally make it (or a symlink) available in your PATH.3. Create a service definition, enable it, and start it:   [Unit]
   Description=Go Ethereum
   
   [Service]
   Type=simple
   WorkingDirectory=/home/user
   ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/bash -c &#34;/usr/bin/systemctl set-environment GETH_EXT_IP=$$(/home/user/.local/bin/ext-ip.sh)&#34;
   ExecStart=/home/user/.local/bin/geth \

   PermissionsStartOnly=true
   User=user
   Group=user
   Restart=always
   RestartSec=5

   dig TXT +short o-o.myaddr.l.google.com @ns1.google.com | awk -F&#39;&#34;&#39; &#39;{print $2}&#39;


And that&#39;s it. geth will start syncing mainnet and will likely finish in under 12 hours (depending on your Internet connection, of course).Note: the initial sync is intensive in both network and disk IO, you&#39;ll need an SSD. Also, running a full node long-term (without pruning) currently eats quite a bit of disk space:   $ du -sh ~/.ethereum/geth

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My favorite book for learning SQL is “The Art of PostgreSQL”. https://theartofpostgresql.com/I found the combination of real-world problems, general SQL advice, and the broad range of topics to be a really good book. It took my SQL from “the database is not much more than a place to persist application data” to “the application is not much more than a way to match commands to the database”. It’s amazing how much bespoke code is doing a job the database can do for you in a couple of lines."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SQL is both slightly ugly (which I attribute to the historical decision to use natural language words instead of the mathematical symbols of the relational algebra notation - the symbols make the expressions more readable once you learn them) and very beautiful. I&#39;m sad most of the people have forgotten it and prefer to use ORMs today. Most often (except when coding a stupid low-feature phonebook/todolist tutorial) it seems to me writing SQL queries manually is a way more efficient (not only in terms of execution speed but also for  developing) solution than using an ORM, except you have to have some fluency in SQL which the most of the today coders seem to lack. Designing a normalized entity-relation model as well as writing the queries for it also feels great, very satisfying."</p>

And, according to his “school of thought”, my understanding of the world and economics incorrect. We had many interesting discussions about what we thought we knew.Now I’m in my 30s and my thought has changed drastically. I believe that reductionist (materialistic) approaches to analyze human endeavor are misguided. There is a bit of hubris in thinking that a computer simulation can predict the entirety of human action. I am definitely not suscribed to the Austrian school of thought, however."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting. My stack ranking of unethical tech companies would have Twitter at the very top. None of the others have caused as much societal harm as Twitter. I saw research recently that as much as half of all trending topics in Turkey were manufactured by malicious actors to spread propaganda. Also, it&#39;s just an endless pit of addictive negativity. I once had a girlfriend who would browser Twitter for hours on end and was perpetually angry. Not a good way to live.Google, on the other hand, has a bunch of products like Maps, Drive, Docs, and Meet that are legitimately helpful and useful. I would have no ethical qualms about helping to make Docs better. This is not to say Google is an ethical company in the aggregate, but there are certainly a lot of roles you could take there that would not require you to question your morality every time you start a new task."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;Maybe we were just a bit naive,&#34; Cornet said.They likely were, and think of me what you like but I&#39;ve noticed the same with most Americans I&#39;ve known. Not sure why that is but apparently there&#39;s some good amount of propaganda going on in the USA and people apparently believe it. Meanwhile people have to pay $5000 after an ambulance picks them up. Or $90000 for semi-trivial medical procedures.I believe asking yourself &#34;is my country really like I believe it is?&#34; is a good food for thought even it&#39;s a bit sideways to this here topic at hand.--On topic:I can sympathize with the author. I know what it is to have been a long time in a company; it becomes much more than a workplace. You have friends, you even have people you invite to your Sunday barbecues. It&#39;s also very likely that a number of internal processes are going smoother for you because you know whom to ping and what exactly to write in a form so your stuff gets done quicker. You have job stability and unless you are rocking the boat too much your seat is likely 99% safe.All of those become true stoppers when you start pondering leaving. They pull you back and make you doubt yourself and your idea of switching company.But unlike a number of commenters here I find nothing hypocritical about the decision to go to Twitter. We don&#39;t know how Twitter operates internally; maybe it&#39;s still better than Google. Or maybe they are still after FAANG level of wages so are ready to make some ethical compromises for them?In any case, immediately discounting somebody&#39;s opinion on a corporation because they joined another corporation misses a lot of context, is flamey and non-constructive and almost smells like a paid troll, and is something I don&#39;t expect HN to condone. But sadly, here we go, it&#39;s the top comment here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems to me the author&#39;s divergence of views may be due to his increasing focus on politics, with a particular orientation that explicitly shows through the comics. It may just be a reflection of what&#39;s happening at scale in Silicon Valley&#39;s tech world, a movement which Twitter, which the author joined most likely not coincidentally, is at the forefront of."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had trouble finding a good FI planning and simulation tool that could model things in enough detail to finally ditch my spreadsheets... so I decided to build one: ProjectiFihttps://projectifi.io/A while back I posted a very early version here (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26969173), and just released a major overhaul with loads of new features and enhancements, many inspired by the initial HN commentary:- Monte Carlo mode with customizable simulations, variables, probability distributions- Backtesting on historical data- Multiple data persistence options for subscribers: cloud synchronization, localStorage only, or manual import/export- Stock/bond allocation curve over time- Improved support for international use cases (currency + locale selector, custom options and contribution limits for financial goals)- Ability to quickly switch between deterministic and probabilistic modes- Many new event types to model a broader range of scenarios- Better support for married filing jointly / couples planning (perhaps still not perfect, but definitely better)- Redesigned landing page, additional UI improvements- And more!If you feel like checking it out, I would love to hear what you think. Most of the functionality is free, but for anyone interested in upgrading to Premium, you can use coupon code &#34;HN-15&#34; for 15% off all plans :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually have a draft open in gmail that i was meaning to send to you, so ill post it here instead :)I saw your initial release of this many months ago, tried it out, was like, ok thats kinda cool, put it down.But then recently i needed to do some serious life financial planning, remembered your tool, searched for the HN post and gave it a real go.... and WOW.  Im so impressed. It does exactly what i need; give me a semi-realistic long term plan of finances, retirement, how much house i can afford, effect of jobs, stocks, etc. Being able to play around with scenarios like &#34;what if one of us didnt work for a few years?&#34; really easily. I probably could do all this stuff on a spreadsheet, but the fiddly details of things like inflation, raises, tax, etc are incredibly tedious to model. theres a lot of near term budgeting type apps etc out there, but there was no other product i found that works so well for long term macro stuff. So its well worth the premium subscription fee to me, on a time saved basis alone.The UI/X is mostly great(ill email you some minor suggestions :) ), and your development velocity is really impressive.Perhaps the total market for a tool like this is niche, but hopefully it turns into a profitable enough endeavor for you so you can keep working on it forever :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find that area geologically fascinating.  It&#39;s one of the few above-water rift zones in the world.  According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salton_Trough the sediment fills it in as quickly as it sinks, so you have sediment in some areas going down 20,000 feet.The earthquakes seem to come in swarms out there, which I think is a result of the pulling apart.  In a thrust fault or strike-slip fault, you have a release of energy and while the stress is transferred somewhere else, that seems to be the end of the movement.  When you pull two plates apart, you create a gap and the stuff above it sort of settles down into the gap, probably causing the successive earthquakes as it all settles into the new position.I really wish we had a canal to the Salton Sea.  Having a new inland port and a source of fresher water would dramatically change the area."</p>

Managers don’t want to hear it so that they can’t be accused of lying, vice presidents don’t wanna know, SVP’s just want green squares on the cross-BU PowerPoint.This is internal discussion of revenue impacting incidents. Do you know what executives do care about? Revenue. Lost deals. If the people who care about money, including the account teams, don’t care about security and severe quality issues enough to be honest enough to get to improvement, how could an external board accomplish anything for those very few incidents that actually become publicly visible?This isn’t like the NTSB; I spent my life reading NTSB accident reports.

The system is super buggy and also doesn&#39;t have meaningful reports.  So there is a secondary system for officers to export to Excel documents.  In one of the trainings they&#39;ve been instructed to look for anomalies -- not real analisys, not even a pivot table.  One thing they find is &#34;negative quantities&#34; -- but how can that be? (hint: it&#39;s bugs in the tracking software).  Then enforcement shows up at the cannabis business to audit these negative numbers (or demand the business try to correct the data (which they cannot due to bugs)).So, crappy software gets law enforcement officers to basically review data &#34;anomalies&#34; created by bugs by visiting a business. The second most expensive method for data sanatization I can imagine.  It&#39;s a poor use of their time and disruptive to the business.The system in WA is so buggy that the agency has opted to freeze the software rather than try to fix the issues.  The future of government software is bleak -- so long as they keep using closed source packages from low-cost bidders."</p>

E.g. keep all the pirated movies you want on your Drive, and even give private access to friends, but the moment you make them publicly viewable Google scans them and limits access accordingly. So no, this isn&#39;t applying to your private diary or privately shared documents.And second, to those who claim absolute free speech with no limits -- notice that the two main categories here are related to democracy and health. All our legal protections ultimately depend on a democratic foundation -- undo that with misinformation and you don&#39;t have anything anymore. Similarly, your rights don&#39;t matter much if you&#39;re dead. Companies aren&#39;t allowed to advertise rat poison as medicine and neither are you."</p>

This is real world hacking at its finest. Not to mention it sounds great."</p>

Adrian has this incredible spatial memory and fine motor control that I still find it hard to believe how he did it.He loaded the piano in his trailer and basically backed his BMW all the way up with half meter at most on each side, slowly through that elbow bend and parked the trailer&#39;s door right on where we planned to unload the piano. Maybe 2cm away from where he intended to land it."</p>

Time and time again humans have displayed that the impossible may in fact be nothing more than a lack of imagination."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are two kinds of non-competes, and both have problems.First, there&#39;s the really nasty ones saying &#34;If you ever work here, you can&#39;t work for any competitor for X years&#34;, and they&#39;re clearly abusing of employees, labor, etc. I hope there is a straight up ban on that.The second kind is &#34;You can&#39;t compete with us while you work here&#34;. And that is a much more complex beast. Obviously, if I work as a developer making a stock trading app, I shouldn&#39;t be making a competing stock trading app after hours.But my employer does everything. There is no field that my employer is not involved in, somehow. You can guess who they are, probably, or just read my profile. And they say &#34;You cannot do anything that competes with anything we do&#34;. Which is everything. Want to make a Sudoku app? That&#39;s a game, we do games. Want to do some open source ML library work? We do ML, you can&#39;t do ML outside of work (I asked legal that one). And that&#39;s ignoring the who-knows-how-many secret un-released projects that might relate.They don&#39;t even tell us &#34;no&#34; anymore. They just say &#34;read the non-compete agreement and do what it says&#34;. Basically &#34;do what you like, but if we ever feel like it wasn&#39;t right, you&#39;re fired and maybe sued&#34;.And when I apply to other companies, they ask &#34;do you have a github account?&#34;. No, I&#39;ve been highly motivated not to.Edit: eesh, this was a bit of a rant, wasn&#39;t it? Apologies for that. But maybe folks have ideas on what to do about it, apart from the obvious."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I lived in Alabama for 4 years or so and at least at the time (I have no idea if it&#39;s changed since I left), their non-compete situation was garbage.They were valid and enforceable even if you got laid off or fired. One of my friends&#39; mother got laid off in the 2008 financial crisis from Bellsouth (or AT&amp;T, I don&#39;t recall if the (re)merger was finished yet). She was told she couldn&#39;t work for any other telecom in the state for at least 18 months. She ended up going to stay with family in another state for that time so she could find another job, even though her husband and her son were in AL. It was a hard period for them.I&#39;ve had a hatred of non-competes since for the most part. If you (a company) are afraid of losing key talent, maybe you should actively try to retain it rather than turning your company into a prison."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My state has severely limited non-compete agreements to the point that they’re only narrowly enforceable, if at all.That didn’t stop  one of my previous employers from using non-compete scare tactics against employees. Many of us left in a large exodus when benefits and bonuses were cut and management made a number of other bad decisions.The company responded by sending remaining employees an e-mail with a list of competitors that they said would be covered by our non-compete agreement. The e-mail implied that if we wanted to leave for one of those companies we needed to get approval from the legal team before we moved, otherwise we might be at risk of being sued.My lawyer rolled his eyes when I showed it to him and explained that they wouldn’t win due to my state’s laws, but they could try to make my life difficult with legal proceedings if they wanted.The tactic worked enough to scare some of my old coworkers away from taking job offers at competitors, though. Some others also went into hiding and lied on their LinkedIn profiles to prevent their old employer from finding out they went to competitors.Having some clear, national guidelines that make non-competes a non-issue would do wonders for situations like this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t believe the blurred images at the end have anything to do with eye focus, as the author suggests.After all, chromatic aberration is blurring of only a very, very small amount.The demonstrated seemingly negligible perceptual effect of blurring blue to a huge degree in a multicolor image doesn&#39;t seem to have anything to do with that, but rather the fact that we perceive primary blue as a much darker color than primary red or green, and we perceive differences in lighter colors much more easily.If the author were correct that we have big problems focusing on blue, then we&#39;d see that blue text against a black background would be massively blurry -- but it&#39;s simply not. It&#39;s comparatively low-contrast (because blue is a dark color), but it&#39;s nearly indistinguishably as sharp as red and green."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of my favourite series in art is Yves Klein&#39;s blue work. For anyone unfamiliar, he found a blue that he considered the bluest possible blue [1], and went on a journey painting everything in that blue. I loved that he did this, and then eventually managed to get to an exhibition of his work at the Tate Modern and was absolutely blown away by it - it really needs to be seen in the flesh to appreciate it. There&#39;s something about his blue, that when painted on to a sculpture, almost makes the 3D disappear and the sculpture looks 2 dimensional. Extremely beautiful.As a side note, some (many?) cultures around the world have no word for blue, blue is just other shades of green.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Klein_Blue"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; After hours of interrogation, police told one of the teenagers, Terrill Swift, that if he just confessed to being at the scene he could go home — so he did.What&#39;s the advantage to society of allowing interviewers to lie (to anyone, let alone kids)?

The lawyer made a follow up video clarifying that in routine traffic stops police do have autonomy. So as long as you are reasonable and just showing the policeman you aren&#39;t a public menace is seems ok.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I honestly think police shouldn&#39;t be allowed to interview children at all (at least those under 13), it should be left to forensic psychologists. Not just interrogations, interviews of witnesses or potential victims too. Children are simply so easy to lead in questions, there&#39;s an entire field of study in psychology devoted to figuring out how to ask questions of children without leading them. Here&#39;s some examples: if you ask a child a yes-no question that they don&#39;t understand, they default to saying yes. If you ask them a multi-choice question (&#34;Would you rather X, Y, or Z?&#34;) they default to whichever option was given last."</p>

You&#39;re also getting spoonfed content that tries to make you as vulnerable as possible to this manipulation. Up to a point that this is downright threatening democracy and our way of life.I guess you could call this a form of censorship.

Yet it seems we are actively against any such options: We block ads guilt-free, we rally against any attempt at collecting valuable personal information even anonymously, we consider crypto mining in the background (which is basically paying via your electricity bill) borderline malware.I am part of this &#34;we&#34;, and yet I ask myself, what am I willing to give as indirect payment?

I totally did not expect them to copy the Switch use-case with it.I&#39;m anxious to see how this turns out. Valve&#39;s history with hardware is not so great, so it could go nowhere like Steam Machines, Steam Link, and the Steam Controller did. On the other hand, it could end up all but killing off PC gaming if it is super successful. If it lands somewhere in the middle it will at least be yet another boon for Linux gaming brought to you by Valve as more developers will port or ensure compatibility with Proton."</p>

If it becomes popular, maybe the company would put real resources to it. And if it doesn&#39;t, why care so much?The answer is clear with the HN response.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was a deliberate decision back in the 1980s and 1990s related to how to structure personnel. You&#39;ll likely recognize it as how software teams are siloed and the concept of &#34;full stack&#34; is kind of a misnomer.The theory was basically that complex systems needed specialization for building and maintenance and that the US military could not afford or recruit the kind of people that could simultaneously run operations, do management AND troubleshoot.In other words, military personnel are not seen as technical experts that focus on one thing for a decade, moreso that they are like project managers who have depth in one area from their first 5-6 years and then &#34;broaden&#34; out to fill in the management layer of the force beyond that.There are exceptions to this of course, warrant officers and the like. However it&#39;s a tiny slice and given how massive the system is and how many sub-systems are involved - the management layer grows in the form of uniformed ranks while the technician layer grows in the contractor ranks because of how the force is structured.The incentive for that contract force however is to keep the contract (and follow on) and the knowledge related to it, so they end up building in these kind of &#34;nobody can touch this but us&#34; requirements. Functionally you can see how this is a self fulfilling prophecy - we aren&#39;t recruting or structuting our force to have the capability to maintain systems because we have a contract force that does it.To fix this a deliberate decision has to be made to change the force structure to build more technicians and unfortunately people like that don&#39;t want to take the pay and lifestyle cut so we just can&#39;t fill out the ranks.I could go on all day, including how the defense industrial base as well as citizens balking at growing the size of the uniformed forces reinforce this system, but it&#39;s a pervasive problem across multiple vectors."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seems like an old issue. I used to know a WWII British navy officer who complained how the Americans were so wasteful because they would get equipment replaced instead of repairing it themselves. I had assumed it was because their manufacturing capability was greater/cheaper but maybe it was this kind of war profiteering (is that the correct term?)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s a bit surprising (if not ironic) but I think it may make sense in a way. It&#39;s been pretty clear that Mudabala (an Abu Dhabi fund that bought AMD fabs in 2008 which then became GlobalFoundries) wanted to unload that investment after they stopped shoving money into failed process developments (GloFo licensed their 14nm from Samsung as a reminder after their own 14 failed, and their 7nm failed too), so no surprise on their end.From Intel&#39;s perspective, there are also some US assets from IBM, which GloFo &#34;acquired&#34; in 2014 (for -1.5 billion at the time), which includes some oldish US fabs, but also a patent portfolio. It certainly goes into the current US political narrative that Gelsinger has been pushing.But perhaps more importantly, I think that what Intel is buying is what was sorely lacking them : people and a methodology of working with external customers.
From all I&#39;ve heard over the years, Intel&#39;s process and design teams are so insular and out of touch with the rest of the industry&#39;s practices that they had a terrible time just working with customers. It wasn&#39;t pretty when they tried the two previous time to open up their process. Loads of announcements, few products if any coming out, and when it worked, they ended up buying their customers anyway, see Altera.If Intel truly wants to go in the foundry direction, they&#39;ll get some interesting outside experience, and while it may not make sense from a pure process point of view, considering how much of a sore point their inability to make it work has been on their previous attempts, the idea may have a lot of merit.Perhaps a very smart move from Gelsinger, time will tell, in the meantime I&#39;ll have a laugh at Intel buying AMD&#39;s old fabs :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Intel wants to get into the foundry business.  99% of what Intel does is for their own chips.  They don&#39;t have the support infrastructure of being able to deal with external customers.  Global Foundries has that.You don&#39;t just decide to make a chip.  There are hundreds of foundry specific libraries, design rules, and more.  There are always problems with the EDA CAD tools for new processes and you need lots of support people to answer questions and help debug problems that your customers are having.Intel has tried being a foundry before multiple times over the last 20 years.  They always fail and give up after a couple of years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great article. Since it looks like a lot of folks are interested in this article, some extra background.First, what is forcing? The article actually has a great description of ultrapowers (a key part of the construction) but it goes by a little fast, so you might like Tim Chow&#39;s &#34;A beginner&#39;s guide to forcing&#34; [1] which does a good job not only laying out the mathematical details at a high level, but also really clearly explaining the philosophy of how you prove something independent of the axioms. I found it very illuminating.Second, the article has some interesting notes on how mathematicians go about what axioms to select and which not to. Penelope Maddy&#39;s &#34;Believing the Axioms&#34; [2] is the classic on this topic (it has two parts). It is focused on set theory, so it has a nice description of Martin&#39;s axiom and the arguments for and against. It was nice to read because it is a deeply technical argument (set theory is hard!) but at the same time there is no &#34;right answer&#34;—all of these axioms, after all, are independent of ZFC, and it&#39;s &#34;ok&#34; to add any of them. The arguments are sometimes aesthetic (&#34;rules&#34; versus &#34;surprises&#34;), sometimes pragmatic (what they can and cannot prove), and sometimes involve deep values of what the universe should be like (should higher cardinalities be like lower ones? weirder? simpler?).It might all seem abstract, but if your day job is programming, imagine an argument over how to architect a large and complex system. Perhaps both architectures are possible, but which one is &#34;right&#34;? What arguments would you deploy? Set theorists are also building a large and complex system (the universe of sets) and are having arguments over how it should be built, which things it should make easy and which hard, which technologies should be supported natively (forcing?) and which should not.[1] http://timothychow.net/forcing.pdf

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Man there&#39;s a lot of juicy stuff in this article (Woodin&#39;s Ultimate L program gets briefly alluded to at the end of the article).I just want to point out, because the HN crowd seems to generally not be mathematical Platonists, that this entire article is implicitly assuming a Platonist philosophical foundation. This may cause confusion for lay readers who are not mathematical Platonists.In other words the article assumes that mathematical objects have an objective existence: they either exist or they do not. Hence every single logical axiom has a truth value. You do not get to arbitrarily choose what logical axioms you want. If you do, you can end up choosing the &#34;wrong one.&#34; Therefore it is an important question to understand whether the Continuum Hypothesis is true or not, even if it&#39;s independent of ZFC (and hence requires ultimately philosophical rather than mathematical arguments).If you aren&#39;t a Platonist and instead view logical axioms as having no inherent truth value, but rather foundations that you can pick and choose from as necessary (where in one case you may choose to use an axiom and in another you may choose its negation), then all that might sound very strange to you. In that case, you should mentally substitute every instance of &#34;true&#34; or &#34;false&#34; in the article with &#34;agrees or disagrees with the meta model used to examine the semantics of a logical theory.&#34; In particular, whenever we talk about a formal treatment of the semantics (i.e. model) of a theory, whether that be something like ZFC or a programming language, we must always make those statements relative to a meta-model.For example if we talk about the formal semantics of a language like C, we must first posit a meta-model which already contains notions of things like &#34;integer&#34; and &#34;natural number&#34; which can be used to give meaning to statements such as &#34;performed an operation n times.&#34; If you&#39;re not a Platonist then you probably believe that there are multiple possible meta-models you could use."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I should finish reading the linked article. But I have a quick initial question.Proofs in ZFC can be enumerated by a machine. In theory, we could devise a machine that (1) will certainly eventually halt iff ZFC is inconsistent (proves two contradictory statements), or (2) will never halt iff ZFC is consistent.(Caveats: naturally, if ZFC is consistent, we&#39;ll never learn whether we should just keep waiting for the machine to find a contradiction. And our machine will require unbounded storage space.)Can we build a corresponding device that would have different behaviors depending on whether the continuum hypothesis is &#34;true&#34; (whatever that means)? I suppose the computational model would be Turing machine as above."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember a long time ago in the UK, around 2003 or so, there was a similar problem with Fruit Machines (Slot machines found in UK bars and pubs).Through dumping the ROMs and emulating the machines, it was found that the machines were effectively forcing losses at certain points in gameplay; from the same memory state, you bet high and the machine goes low, or you bet low and the machine goes high, giving you zero chance of winning.There was a campaign called Fairplay that I believe resulted in a fairly small print label being placed on the machines stating that they would at times give no chance of winning; not a great win, but at least it was being said somewhere - http://worldofstuart.excellentcontent.com/fairplay/fruit/bre...The FairPlay site by Stuart Campbell is actually still up, although I remember first reading about it back in PC Zone personally.

I pretty much could guess that something like the article discusses was at work, and was simply more a game of luck.Obviously I stopped after that, as a pure luck game is not as fun. If I had known that the default was 700 losses before payout as a default, I would have had a nice drink or 3 and counted the many people that tried it throughout the dayAs a side note, saw one winner at the machine get a wrapped stack of 500, 1 dollar bills"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; It&#39;s been frustrating me for a long time that most companies when hiring are looking for people who do lots of side projects and open source work,This is a myth.The number of candidates I interview who have side projects worth looking at or open source contributions is maybe 1-in-10 at most. Any company that requires candidates to have significant open source contributions is going to have a hard time hiring, because it’s not very common.Really, the only time side projects are valuable is when someone needs to fill gaps in their resume. For example, if all of your prior experience was writing PHP backend code but you wanted to apply to a React front-end role, it could be helpful to have something like a React TODO app in your GitHub profile to show that you have some minimal experience with React and front-end work. You don’t need a massive open-source contribution that takes months and months of free time, just something small to show that you have some amount of experience that isn’t reflected in your resume.The side project myth is getting out of control. Most recruiters and hiring managers will never even open your GitHub profile."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Recruiters want people who do side projects [...] having side projects and doing open source is valued in hiringI think your premise is wrong and you&#39;re vastly overestimating the value of work done outside of your job.- Having side projects: I was never asked past internship interviews. Even interviewing for my first job after graduation, I talked about what I did during my internship, not about side or school projects.- Meaningful yet small contributions to open source: I don&#39;t remember anyone noticing nor asking.- Major contributions to a big open source project: I assume these people get hired easily.Recruiters are not dumb. They know that most good candidates are either not allowed or not willing to work on meaningful projects on the side, outside of a few very specific cases. Don&#39;t waste your time with companies that have delusional hiring standards."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Admittedly it&#39;s been a long time since this has been something I&#39;ve had to worry about - but back when I just asked for it to be cut out the contract. Generally everyone was fine with it, especially when you explain &#34;it&#39;s how I learn to do stuff that benefits me in the office&#34;. I think the general worry was twofold - that a) working on my own stuff would mean I didn&#39;t get my actual job done, and b) that working on my own stuff would mean I leave sooner and it&#39;s costly to pay for recruiters and refill roles.It probably helps explaining what sort of side projects you do, how much time they take, your &#39;real&#39; job pays for you to live and this is the nerdy equivalent to playing 5-a-side football or watching movies.Anecdotally a (very skilled) dev friend recently got a job with a (UK) challenger bank and was required to sign a similar thing, they were happy to carve add exceptions for a couple of things he was working on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you haven&#39;t read or listened to this book yet, I highly recommend it: Daily Rituals: How Artists Work[1]It&#39;s a collection of daily routines of many famous and prolific artists. The surprising thing about so many of the artists is that they only work 2 or 3 hours per day, then spend the rest of the day walking around, socializing, etc. But they consistently show up and put in the work and it adds up to some amazing things over time.This reminds me of another great book about beating procrastination: The Now Habit: A Strategic Program for Overcoming Procrastination and Enjoying Guilt-Free Play[2]In that book, the author talks about his extensive work helping graduate students complete their dissertations. I can&#39;t cover all the great points here, but when working with these students he has them create an &#34;unschedule&#34; where they have to schedule guilt-free play activities as the top priority. Then he actually limits the amount of work they are allowed to do on their dissertation to only a couple of hours per day. The effect is quite amazing at turning students around from dreading and avoiding their dissertation to really trying to maximize the limited time they have to work on it. And having guilt-free play lets them really disconnect from the work and have true recovery so that they have the motivation and energy to hit the project again and again every day. Seems counter-intuitive at first, but as I&#39;ve applied this to different projects, it&#39;s amazing how much more I&#39;m able to accomplish.[1] https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15799151-daily-rituals[2] https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/95708.The_Now_Habit"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the more interesting sayings I have come across lately is: People overestimate how much they can get done in the short term but they underestimate how much they can get done in the long term.I see this all the time with friends who pick up the guitar as a hobby. Often someone practices intensely for one week or one month and then gets frustrated at their progress. That frustration often causes people to give up. Now I see it as a mismatch between short-term estimation/expectations. The frustration is caused by overestimating how much progress they think they should make in the short-term. The quitting is caused by underestimating the progress they could make in the long term."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was exactly how we built OwnLocal before we quit our day jobs.  In a sense, it was very easy because when you don&#39;t know how big the problem is, everything feels like progress.Now I see 40 barreling towards me and it&#39;s hard to just do a little bit every day.  Because I have experience, I can form a much bigger picture of an idea in my head and it&#39;s hard to peel off a tiny bit and make that feel like a success.This curses me in my startup attempts but it also curses me in my work.  It&#39;s hard to think like a founder anymore.  I always overspec projects because I can easily guess what demons lie on the horizon.I miss my early startup days when I could just write some code every day and feel successful.  I want that back."</p>

This project uses just canvas, but iirc passing frames to be rendered by webgl is faster. Perhaps I&#39;m wrong in this context.I also don&#39;t see threading in here. Makes sense for a demo, but if this were to be used performantly you&#39;d have to throw it all in a webworker so it doesn&#39;t block the main thread. This is one point of contention with wasm because it&#39;s not straightforward to render to a canvas/webgl on the main thread from a worker thread.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The German court held that YouTube failed to make its enforcement authority clear in its contract with the account operator who posted the video.Does YouTube&#39;s TOS really not contain statements giving them the ability to stop hosting any video, at any time, for any reason?Edit: I guess not: the only content removal clause I see is this one, which is definitely not &#34;we can remove your video for any reason, as long as we feel like it.&#34;  I&#39;m a little surprised they don&#39;t seem to have included anything like that.&gt; If we reasonably believe that any Content is in breach of this Agreement or may cause harm to YouTube, our users, or third parties, we may remove or take down that Content in our discretion. (from https://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A good move.
Everything so big as YouTube should follow national laws.
Otherwise private terms of policies become more part of society than national ones. Then the hundreds of years of fighting becomes nothing and we are back in a modern kingdom based society."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve tried to find the actual court decision, best match seems to be 4 W 118/21 (enter on https://www.justiz.sachsen.de/esamosplus/pages/index.aspx under &#34;Aktenzeichen&#34; &amp; click &#34;suchen&#34;, can&#39;t see any obvious way to link the PDF...)However, that document does not actually order a fine.  It warns about imposing one (&#34;up to 250&#39;000€&#34;) if Youtube doesn&#39;t remedy the problem.  Considering it&#39;s now exactly 3 months later (decision dates April 13th), that lines up.From what I understand (not a lawyer, yadda yadda) this is a purely civil matter and doesn&#39;t really go as far as some statement on free speech.  The issue discussed mostly seems to revolve around which terms of service are valid and how they can be changed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was around twenty my Mom used to call me every other day or so just to have a chat. One day, after she asked me how my day was, I shot back something along the lines of: &#34;I don&#39;t have anything to tell you, really. You&#39;re calling so often that nothing new manages to happen in between the calls.&#34; So, she stopped calling. I would go home every other week as usual and everything seemed fine. It was only much later that I found out that she basically cried for three days straight after that call.Some time later there was a period when I would contact my parents every few months or so. Not really on purpose. Simply because other things simply took more of my time and attention, and calling my parents wasn&#39;t really high on my list of priorities.Only when my son was born I started to realize what someone goes through as an individual and as a couple once a child comes into their lives. How it changes things. That not being thrown out of the window at 2 a.m. as an infant is already a blessing. I&#39;m sure that thought has crossed the mind of many a young parent with a screeching infant on their hands in the middle of night. So, I felt ashamed of myself, and grateful to my parents for being there in the first place, and being decent at being parents as well.Now I&#39;ve made a point to myself to call them up at least once a week. As in, I have set up a reminder for that. I now know how much they value this. But it&#39;s not only for them. I realize very well that one day I will wake up and wish to call my parents to have a chat about something. But there simply won&#39;t be anyone to call anymore.I&#39;m not passing any judgement at all on people who have abusive parents. I have no idea how that feels like. I&#39;m just happy that I didn&#39;t end up accidentally getting estranged to the decent parents that I have. At some point it really was going that way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We&#39;re all living that Asian family joke.Parents spend their whole lives waiting for their kids to thank you.  Kids spend their whole lives waiting for their parent to say &#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34;That said I&#39;ve never felt that way about my Mom and Dad.  I&#39;ve faults and problems a plenty but I wouldn&#39;t ascribe any of that on them; indeed the best things about me seem to clearly come from them and the worst are just as clearly things they suggested I not do.  What are you going to do though, even if all that wasn&#39;t true they&#39;d still love me and I&#39;d still love them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wonder how much of this is driven by social media and the internet today. The word &#39;Toxic&#39; is just thrown around now and everything is &#39;Toxic&#39;. Its a word that has ceased to have any real meaning but virtually every behavior that used to just be normal every day activity is Toxic. Everyone has flaws and no one has all the answers. Parents are just people doing the best they can and for the most part making what they think are the best decisions in the moment while struggling with everything that everyone else struggles with. Children want to put their parents on a pedestal and assume that all decisions; and any harm caused was intentional. There are of course bad parents and bad people and I don&#39;t mean to discount the effect that those people have on their kids. Social media is quick these days to tell you that your parents are narcissists when in reality they are just distracted trying to figure out what happened to their lives and trying to get by. At the end of every day I look back and see choices I made that were probably not great or see where I ignored my kid as I was trying to get something done for work. These things pile up and then are focused through the lens of the internet and suddenly you are a bad parent."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s easy to mock the pettiness of all parties described here, and it&#39;s common for people on this forum to take absolutist stances with regards to privacy/advertising, but it&#39;s also important to recognize that these arguments will actually define the future of the internet for the average user.There are trillion dollar companies on both sides of the argument, and their eventual compromise will establish the defaults for billions of users.There are also two fundamental components of the Big Tech debate at odds with each other here - privacy and competition. Increasing privacy decreases competition by strengthening the Big Tech companies that engage with users at the platform/browser/OS/hardware level. See: Google&#39;s removal of third-party cookies from Chrome in the name of privacy was just blocked by EU competition regulators, because it would cripple competing advertising companies[1].[1] https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/06/eu-antitrust-reg..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Funny how there is no (meaningful) user representation at W3C.  Perhaps Wendy Seltzer is the closest to a user representative.  A lawyer who is a Perl programmer, according to her Wikipedia profile.The arguments against Big Tech the smaller ad tech folks are raising sound legit, but obviously they are not being made in good faith.  Big Tech has no more respect for user privacy than companies like Rosewell&#39;s.  They are all a threat to user privacy.  Companies that make browsers should not also be taking in online ad services revenue.  It is a clear conflict of interest.51degrees provides the public with a CSV list of user-agents, e.g., for use in browser fingerprinting (or perhaps user defence against browser fingerprinting).  What does Google provide.  We know they are fingerpringing on a mass scale.  There is zero transparency.https://raw.githubusercontent.com/51Degrees/Device-Detection...Just for fun, I periodically compile w3c-libwww.  It still compiles and it still works today. I use it through a TLS-enabled proxy.  It reminds me of all the potential for experimetation the www once had.  Today the web just looks like a Big Tech-led surveillance dystopia slowly coming together.  Unless someone stops it.  Lina Khan, godspeed.The disputes described in the article with lawyers from W3C and IAPP looking on reminds me a little of the formation of ICANN back in the 1990&#39;s and the disputes over domain names versus trademarks."</p>

I don&#39;t think that there are real reasons to worry. One of the tasks of the NSA is defending against cyber attacks. Having more people with good tools helps the defense. Also, you can be pretty certain that some security people have been closely looking at the sources to see if it contains any suspicious features. Besides, if the NSA really wants to install some software on your computer, they can probably do it themselves without your involvement."</p>

Between this and Chef from gchq, someone with devops skills can probably skill up to an entry level threat analyst level in a few weeks or months. The tooling available today is really good.If people are worried about running systems backdoored by NSA, they probably shouldn&#39;t use things like electricity either.

I suppose this problem is inherent to Twitter, where Tweets are already low effort enough that they didn&#39;t need another feature for rapid-fire, low-effort content. Contrast with Instagram where people&#39;s posts are generally well thought out, but their stories are made for rapid-fire content.Twitter didn&#39;t have the same divergence, so Fleets and Tweets became the same content in different formats. And of course, the Twitter self-promoters took full advantage of a feature that let them bubble their content to the literal top of people&#39;s feeds."</p>

It has very few issues these days, and only a couple minor points of frustration in the UI.  For my purposes, it&#39;s the best thing out there.A couple of workflow tips for using Monodraw:* Open a few docs in Monodraw at a time and leave them open for your different needs: text boxes, figlets, diagrams.  Each with a few elements already waiting to be filled, cut &amp; pasted, etc.* For larger docs (e.g. newsletters) finish the writing in your text editor and bring it into Monodraw.  Think Publisher or InDesign.  Yeah, you can edit in here, but it&#39;s weird.  Best for layout.* Browse the sample file that opens by default when you load Monodraw.  Good fodder in there.* Snippets!* Yes, it is just text but there is FILL to give order (front to back) of elements.  This is really handy for making slides that expose a list one item at a time.* Cut and Paste chunks in and out of your Monodraw file with your main document or take a clipped screen capture for dropping into a graphic or fancy format document (e.g. Illustrator).  No need to export and paste."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think Firefox news is what I comment most on here. I don&#39;t know why. Well I guess I do. Web browsers, javascript etc is front and center here - which somewhat means the digital world. All my friends use Chrome, and think I&#39;m weird. I think _they_ are. They care about human rights, at least I think they do. But, having Google, an ad company, dictate how our window to the digital world looks like, is now _way worse_ than what Microsoft with IE6 ever did. They had their share, but nothing compared to this. At least Microsoft was just a software company.If a class of people on a forum such as this with so many brilliant minds cannot even be bothered with the values of open source and how this pertains to democracy and human values I really don&#39;t see how any other part of our species could. &#34;Chromium scrolls 5% better on my machine so who cares about Firefox&#34;. I see these comments all the time here. Even in this thread.Firefox. Linux. Postgresql. Wikipedia. Xmms! The WORLD WIDE WEB! Imaging if Google invented hypertext and not CERN (funny how Google made their initial fortunes). AMP would be the least of your worries. Imagine if Amazon &#34;invented&#34; Wikipedia. All of these open source projects are just mindblowingly awesome. They help people. Me. You.But who cares right? Certainly not the lot with money in the 80/90s that didn&#39;t understand how or why this would be important. Which is why all these amazing things happened. Now they do of course. So none of this anymore.Which is why I think humanity is doomed to succumb to our newfound overlords. The Big Four. Five? Six? Seven? Who cares really. A handful.I wish people, especially like what this place definitely represents, would stand up more (including me!). Teach people, politicians, your parents, your siblings, your kids. We understand tech and it&#39;s implications. We understand how big tech is now stifling everything. Good luck training a neural network that competes with 50 billion uploaded photos. Facebook, Amazon. Google. Microsoft.But noone will - &#34;it doesn&#39;t matter&#34;. But make no mistake. It does matter. And humanity is just sitting here. It&#39;s like we&#39;re heading for this High Class Great Filter.Good thing I&#39;ll be dead before all this comes to full fruition.(Sorry for the rant - hope it was still relevant and on point, and I really encourage discussion here!)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I noticed in the comments below how somebody mentioning Firefox&#39;s limited market share was heavily downvoted.I&#39;m a Firefox user since forever, and will keep using it. I also want Mozilla to win, and strongly empathize with their engineers whom are trying to make the best of it.That said, I think the reality check should not be avoided. There is no good in do-good software without reach.Based on statcounter, Firefox&#39;s market share went from a 2009 peak (32%) to a mere 3.29% as we speak. Just in the last year alone, it bleeds market share from 4.25% to 3.29%.So it keeps bleeding market share, 12 years in a row. The reason it&#39;s still losing market share likely is due to the mobile market still growing in size, whilst Firefox has no presence there: 0.48%.I have access to a handful of web properties, one of which very large and global (billions of page views). In our dashboards, Firefox does not even exist. It&#39;s not in the top 10. Above it are Chromium clones most have never heard of.So to the &#34;ordinary&#34; world, those without a particular stake in open source, it&#39;s a dead browser. It&#39;s even smaller than weird regional browsers that most businesses wouldn&#39;t explicitly support.(note that &#34;support&#34; is overstated as most web tech works just fine out of the box in Firefox)Besides the ordinary world, the grip on the developer community is also lost. Increasingly, I&#39;m seeing developers coding up demos and experiments that break in Firefox, it&#39;s not even considered at all, where just a few years ago it was a developer-default browser.It&#39;s an extremely harsh reality check. Effectively Apple, an enemy of the open web, is our only savior against a full Chromium monopoly. Apple actively sabotaging and blocking the progress of the web, is our &#34;hope&#34;. How bad can it get?Anyway, I&#39;m sorry to bring this up, in particular in a release announcement. I bring it up because I believe impact is central to the discussion and trumps any feature and any engineering. If the crash is not reversed somehow, it is inevitable that very hard questions have to be answered.It&#39;s not what I would want. I hope an independent implementation will keep existing forever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Background updates! Hooray! That may sound like a basic table stakes feature but honestly it&#39;s a huge improvement. And a lot of other apps do a terrible job of it, particularly on Windows. It&#39;s remarkable how many apps require 8, 10 mouse clicks and a restart to install a minor update. Firefox didn&#39;t require any clicks but the nag / need to restart was a nuisance.Actually now that I type that I wonder what has changed. I guess the upgrade appears to happen faster because it was done before the restart? I assume Firefox itself still has to be restarted for the update to be effective.(No problem on a Windows system; the OS reboots itself so often Firefox is guaranteed to before too long :-P)"</p>

The best customers would have infrastructure to do this themselves off of /v1/events, though this was unfortunately rare.The biggest challenges with webhooks:- Delivery: some customer timing out connections for 30s causing the queues to get backed up (Stripe was much smaller back then).- Versioning: synchronous API requests can use a version specified in the request, but webhooks, by virtue of rendering the object and showing its changed values (there was a `previous_attributes` hash), need to be rendered to a specific version. This made upgrading API versions hard for customers.There was constant discussion about building some non-webhook pathway for events, but they all have challenges and webhooks + /v1/events were both simple enough for smaller customers and workable for larger customers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a hill I find myself frequently fighting (and losing on): webhooks are terrible to maintain, because they start from the premise &#34;this never breaks&#34; and thats about where development in an organization stops.The only event API I ever want is notifications there&#39;s new data, and then an interface by which I can query all new data which has arrived by some sort of index marker - because this is fundamentally reliable. It means whatever happens to my system, I can reliably recover missed events, skipped events, or rebuild from previous events.And this is in fact exactly how something like Kafka actually works! Complete with first-class support for compacting queues to produce valid &#34;summarized&#34; starting points.Any streaming system essentially should never start as a streaming system - it should start as a slow-path pull-based system, and have a fast-path push system added on top of it if needed - because then you&#39;ve built your recovery path already, rather then what happens way too often which is just &#34;oh yeah, we&#39;ll develop that when it breaks&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My company has recently switched to Microsoft Teams, where unsupported integrations happen via webhooks. For example, if we wanted to be able to trigger builds in Jenkins or Gitlab, or acknowledge alerts via AlertManager, we&#39;d have to set them up as webhooks to the appropriate service.The problem is that all of those services are internal to our network, and aren&#39;t accessible from the outside world. We cannot set up a webhook to Jenkins because Jenkins does not have a publicly accessible URL. We cannot set up a webhook to Gitlab, or to Prometheus, or to Sentry, or anything else, because those are all internal services.The only option there would be to create a new, public-facing server, set it up with a domain name and SSL certificate, expose it to the world, and then give it access to those services - which defeats the point of having those services internal and secure if we just create a non-internal system and give it access to them.Alternately, we have that new, public-facing server buffer those requests and have other services poll them, somehow, so that it cannot connect in, but now we&#39;re getting into the same situation as described in the article.If there were an API, I could easily create a small daemon that would watch for events and dispatch them accordingly, and then respond to them as needed; instead, my only option is to build some kind of Frankenstein - or to give up entirely, which is the more reasonable solution.Then again, this is Microsoft Teams, where creating an application requires an Azure account and jumping through a ton of hoops, so they&#39;re no stranger to stupid ideas that no one wants to deal with."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was 2nd employee at a unicorn startup and have been on a work-hiatus for almost a year.  Now, I live amongst Amish people in the country.My biggest insight has been a mindset change.  Previously my underlying approach to life looked like: &#34;I will do X which will enable me to do Y so that I can finally do Z.&#34; I now approach my days with &#34;What will make me happy?&#34;  This is an experiment I&#39;m performing.  A structured life feels safe and orderly - but what if living life and letting things unfold more &#39;organically&#39; is better?It is a weird/uncomfortable shift because I can&#39;t predict what is coming.  As an example, turns out I really enjoy building dams.  A couple months ago I would not have been able to tell you that I&#39;d be building a dam.I have no idea what it is that drives my own interests or affinities, but now instead of attempting to manipulate them for whatever X, Y, or Z goal... I just roll with wherever they take me.  And they always seem ready to take me somewhere.My point is: In a life without work (in my experience) stuff will come up.  Follow what arises, see where it goes.  It certainly feels better."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is one of the biggest missing pieces in internet FIRE discussions. So much of the FIRE discourse is about not working that many don’t realize that they’re going to be extremely bored with 16 hours to fill every day. Worse, their friends are all busy with their lives.It’s actually a common failure point of FIRE post-mittens that didn’t work out. Especially with couples, where it’s more likely that at least one person will realize that maybe jobs, and the sense of purpose and social life that comes with them, aren’t so bad.The other big issue is that people underestimate their spending in a post-work FIRE lifestyle. It’s tempting to subtract out costs like commuting and work clothes and assume your costs will go down. In practice, if you plan on traveling and spending more time on hobbies your costs are likely to go up."</p>

The video says 10 gigatons/yr by 2050. Our 2019 emissions were ~36 gigatons. I.e. even if capture is successful, it needs to be accompanied by aggressive emissions reductions for us to even get to neutral, let alone reversing damage.I&#39;m guessing Musk had some thought process around the expected marginal impact of funding this vs more on energy storage vs energy production. And perhaps capture/sequestration is under-explored.But I wonder what could be achieved with $100M of funds directed at research to intentionally changing and shifting culture towards consuming stuff with smaller footprints? Tesla made some people want an electric car really badly. For some, very small houses are becoming attractive. But so far this stuff mostly arises from ad-hoc marketing efforts around particular brands, products, influencers. What if we need systematic memetic engineering, to make lower energy consumption actually feel desirable?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I switched my primary dev environment to NixOS in a graphical VM on macOS towards the end of 2020 and I love it: https://twitter.com/mitchellh/status/1346136404682625024?s=2...Previously, I used Nix on Mac (as this blog post suggests) but I had enough “gotchas” with Nix on Mac that I decided to go full NixOS.For those who ask why a VM or why I keep Mac around at all: I like macOS for everything else besides dev work. I use iMessages heavily, I like the Mac App ecosystem such as calendars, mail clients, etc. This gives me the best of both worlds.I usually run this on an iMac Pro but also have a MacBook Pro. It runs great on either. It’s also really nice with Nix to update one machine and the other is just one command away from being equivalent.I recognize this is a “weird” setup but wanted to point it out since it seems relevant to this post."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To others who might be interested in trying Nix instead of Homebrew:There is a `brew install` equivalent in vanilla Nix -- `nix-env` provides an imperative interface pretty similiar to `brew`.`nix-darwin` is a third-party thing that tries to give you a NixOS-like experience on macOS. It&#39;s not necessary if you&#39;re only interested in replacing Homebrew. You can have `shell.nix` files and ad-hoc environments without replacing your entire system configuration.Vanilla Nix is very well isolated, and you can try it side by side with Homebrew to see how you like it -- one of the nice side effects of Nix-installed software being independent from the rest of your system is that, well, you can install whatever you want without breaking the Homebrew equivalents. For example instead of putting binaries in `/usr/local/bin`, Nix creates a directory of symlinks to files in `/nix/store`, and you can add that directory to your `PATH` if you wish.I switched to Nix a few months ago and have found it... fun. It&#39;s not something I would recommend if you want things to just work, but if you&#39;re curious about Nix, you can learn quite a lot about it from the comfort of your MacBook.I wrote a little about this experience here, including how to map common `brew` commands into their `nix-env` equivalents: https://ianthehenry.com/posts/how-to-learn-nix/switching-fro...(Warning: it&#39;s more of a rambling diary entry than a blog post.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you read https://haystack-books.s3.amazonaws.com/Study+to+understand+..., you’ll seeQ1. To what extent, if any, do the following statements apply to you?I feel burnt out from work.On a four-point scale, that scores 21%, 35%, 28%, 17%.So, they took everyone except those who said they didn’t feel burnt out at all, and got 83%.I think asking for feelings of burnout exaggerates the issue of being burnt out by a huge factor.For me, burnout means not only being tired of your job, but also inability to ‘burn’ outside work. I don’t even see how you can be that moderately, but over a quarter of respondents reported that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder if software presents a unique situation as we generally make a pretty decent salary and to transition to a new career involves a pretty significant pay cut. So some developers become trapped in jobs they hate with golden handcuffs. I really don&#39;t enjoy software development at all, but at this stage, to even think about doing something else would result in a massive pay cut. I did it once when I was younger, quit software and started a new career with a 55% pay cut. Liked the new work and did it for 5 years. Then I had kids and needed more money so I returned to software, since then I just exist in a constant state of burnout."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How much of the workload is just the dev shortage/insufficient staffing?I am currently the only dev on my team because of departures (there should be 4). Now, it is not really all that in production yet so it hasn&#39;t required late nights or waking up at odd hours, but it does linger in my mind that this could be a big issue if it grew a lot and my team didn&#39;t. I would hate to support it alone.A friend of mine is missing two people on his team at another company. It means that they had to shove the interns into the support rotation to have full coverage of their app. They are hiring too, but as things stand, interns are staying up in the night deal with production errors and they are waking each other up as well, they are interns and don&#39;t know what they are doing.Software seems like something that needs a sufficiently sized team after a certain point and nearly every team I know of anywhere is short people at the moment, even at FAANGs."</p>

Fuck off, you are not the only app running.But that comes second to the microphone gain control, which Teams similarly exerts unilateral control over - only this time through an automated algorithm that for some microphone types just ends up muting them entirely.

No slider, clicking on it &#34;blips&#34; the speakers so you can hear how loud it is. You have to hover pointer on top of it which enlarges the green circle by about 10% to show &#34;Hey, you&#39;re hovering me, in case you missed it!&#34; and then scroll so the the tiny tiny dot gets slightly more enlarged (which clearly indicates new volume, duh). Then it shrinks to a smaller size back when stopping the hover.Oh, the arrow to the right? Does that open the customary volume slider? No that&#39;s the sound device picker. Speaker to the left is the mute. To make matters worse it&#39;s in the same &#34;group&#34; as the network symbol is (although there&#39;s no network settings when clicking), and sometimes clicking the thing doesn&#39;t work at all, depends on how much explorer.exe decides to hang at the moment.But surely I just got some broken alpha/beta version."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The entire thread is pure gold. If you scroll down, he writes:&gt; The Chair [of the Columbia Film program] reached out and said he was confident that we could work out an arrangement to get my degree. But he insisted that I fly out to NYC immediately for an in-person meeting. So I spent a fortune on a last-minute flight in order to hear his proposal.&gt; But instead of telling me what I need to do to satisfy the requirements to get my degree, the Chair began pitching me his idea for a TV pilot. In excruciating scene-by-scene detail. I nodded along, waiting to get back to the terms of me getting my degree.&gt; But to my horror... I slowly begin to realize this IS the deal. He made it pretty clear if I wanted my degree, I needed to help him sell his tv pilot. Yep, the Chair of Columbia’s prestigious graduate film program tried to shake me down in order to jump-start his own stalled out career."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Columbia has a pretty questionable record with other masters programs in creative fields. The school is exploiting the Ivy brand, the NYC location and talent, and legions of students desperate to stand out in highly competitive creative fields. For instance, a 10-month MS in Journalism is $116k (including living expenses) while a 12-month M.S. in data journalism is $160k (https://journalism.columbia.edu/cost-attendance).Yes, studying under true experts in NYC is a wonderful experience for people in film, theater, journalism, writing, the arts, etc. But there should be no expectation that a very expensive degree will lead to high-paying jobs in those fields. The fact that every year Columbia is setting up all of these new grads with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and little hope of repaying it in those professions is downright predatory.The WSJ article that prompted the original Twitter thread is worth reading. A few graduates have managed to find low-paying, entry-level jobs in the film industry that pay under $50k per year, and probably did not require a master&#39;s degree. One of the grads they talked with is working at the local TJ Maxx ... the same job he had as a teenager.Via one of the WSJ reporters who worked on the report:At least 43% of the people who recently took out loans for master’s degrees at elite private universities hadn’t paid down any of their original debt or were behind on payments roughly two years after graduation.It’s not just arts degrees. Other high debt, low-earning master’s programs: NYU publishing (debt: $116k, earnings: $42k), Northwestern speech-language pathology (debt: $148k, earnings: $60k), USC marriage and family counseling (debt: $124k, earnings: $50k).All this is made possible by Grad Plus, the no-limit federal student loan program. Created in 2005, it’s now the fastest growing program. Based on partial data from the 2021 school year, grad students were on track to borrow as much as undergrads for the first time.https://twitter.com/anfuller/status/1413160574205284352"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was one of these film MFA students, seduced by my own delusional idea that I could continue to develop my own work for several years (I was already a flailing filmmaker) and then re-launch my career. And then, if necessary, teach in a college film program with my MFA - and continue to develop my own work. It was all going to work out!I’ve made many mistakes, but high-tailing from that program after 9 months and finding something else to do in life was not one of them.Hindsight being 2020, I missed a fabulous opportunity to shoot a documentary about my MFA classmates, who were a very fine cross-section of the kind of students from around the world who would find and spend about a hundred thousand dollars in the year 2000 for the privilege of having a teaching assistant show you how to operate a video camera while simultaneously trying to read and understand the instruction manual. Probably for the first time.The most successful of my classmates who stuck with it makes commercials in the Midwest. The nicest one never made a film at all yet somehow is a tenured professor at a small college in California. I stumbled my way into technology and am making up for years that were fun but deeply unprofitable.I must say that the faculty at my program were the Woody Allen punch-line incarnate: because the stakes are so low."</p>

But that argument to me sounds as hollow as the &#34;but he didn&#39;t suffer&#34; argument from the movie.Him expressing his own sense of magnanimousness and ironic sense of victimhood at the end of it... it really is a scary glimpse into the mind of such people.It&#39;s sad because it&#39;s very easy to misconstrue this as a &#34;security researcher gets feds sent on him by apple&#34; story, and I think lots of people are basically trying to frame it that way, but it&#39;s not that at all. To me, it&#39;s clearly &#34;jackass doesn&#39;t understand consent, apple calls the feds, still a jackass, still doesn&#39;t understand&#34;.[Note: yes I know the character in the movie is revealed as a bluff shortly after, the scene sticks with me because of the character&#39;s apparent sincerity at the moment][Additional Note: yes I know many of these companies also don&#39;t respect consent. Them not respecting it is not an excuse for everyone to behave the same way.]"</p>

I spend most of my time making open source tools with other people.&#34;&#34;But how do you make money?&#34;&#34;I get commissions, grants, and live off artist fees from exhibiting work.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi HN! After months of private beta, Obsidian is now finally available for Android and iOS!Obsidian is a personal knowledge management app that works on top of a local folder of Markdown files [0]. Because &#34;local&#34; often means your computer, for the longest time, it has been a pain to access these notes on the go.Our original plan was to build fully native mobile apps. Instead, we decided to build hybrid web apps. Hybrid web apps gets a lot of hate, and for good reason. There&#39;s heavy performance penalty for running JavaScript. Animations are often janky. A lot of native capabilities are restricted.We know everyone&#39;s favorite argument for using the web stack. &#34;We&#39;re a small team, and it&#39;s just not possible to....&#34;. Sure, we&#39;re also just two developers, but that excuse gets old.We see it in a different way. We leverage hybrid web apps not as a shortcut, rather, we use it to put power in the hands of our users. This has always been a key principle driving Obsidian&#39;s development.Obsidian is one of the few apps out there that lets users customize every aspect of the app. Themes and CSS snippets let users completely change the interface. Plugins [1] let users augment the GUI [2], run macros [3], build databases [4], synchronize with other apps [5], and much more.It&#39;s unprecedented for users to have access to this kind of power on their mobile devices.Now, it&#39;s reality, thanks to the web stack.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Obsidian is the closest thing I&#39;ve found to the Pensive from Harry Potter. It&#39;s a data recording format good enough for me to extract thoughts from my mind, represent them with enough fidelity to reconstruct later, connect them to the concepts that they are related to in my head, and then forget the thought completely so I can move on and process it later.I was only willing to try it out because I had heard it mentioned [0] on CGP Grey&#39;s cohosted podcast, Cortex, in the episode they did on productivity software subcultures. Specifically I think CGP Grey was saying he didn&#39;t &#34;get&#34; Obsidian but had observed a fanatic fanbase around it of people who thought it was god&#39;s gift to note-taking because it represented the links between knowledge in a unique way. Apparently I&#39;m one of those people because I went from installing it for the first time to writing all my new thoughts down in it in the space of 3 days.I suspect the real reason I liked Obsidian right away is that long ago I used Microsoft Onenote as a freeform notetaking app to just spew unrelated thoughts into that I could organize later. Onenote&#39;s interface was good, but there was no way to port those notes in an exportable format to a new computer when the one with a Onenote license died.[0]https://www.reddit.com/r/CGPGrey/comments/ihkqjp/cortex_105_..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a note-taking power nerd who has used all the buzzy apps on Macs. Obsidian is by far the best — it&#39;s become my personal journal, my knowledge base, a quick and dirty blog, a place to keep loose notes.The development velocity of the (TWO PERSON!) team behind this app is ridiculous. They&#39;re constantly pushing updates, and seem to handle all facets of app development with aplomb.No affiliation, just a happy user!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Last year I bought I used TI for my daughter who needed it for school. I got her the oldest version, the one which takes AAA batteries and communicates with the outside world through a serial link. A project like this brings to mind the possibility of stuffing a Raspberry Pi Zero in the battery compartment, hooking it up to the school WiFi, using a terminal app on the calculator to communicate with the Pi and in that way voiding the whole reason of using these ancient beasts in the first place. I won&#39;t do this of course - she&#39;s there to learn other things besides refining the art of cheating [1] - but it would be a tempting hack. An even more elaborate hack would be to replace the guts of the thing with a Zero running a TI emulator as well as some more useful stuff like ssh. The possibilities are endless... so endless in fact that I&#39;m fairly certain this has been done already, somewhere.[1] which in my days at school consisted of writing the translated works of Homer on a 10x10cm piece of paper, a good way to a) learn to write incredibly small and b) get those words to stick inside your head long enough so you don&#39;t actually need to consult the cheat &#34;sheet&#34; during the test."</p>

After 15+ minutes and being transferred to two people, they can&#39;t answer a basic question about a rule they fined me for breaking that they can&#39;t even explain. They never emailed or called me back, which has been the behavior I have come to expect over the past nine years.I am serious, if you work for the city and have any way of applying my 13 month old payment to this license renewal, you have the gratitude of myself &amp; 14 of my employees who will get to continue paying their rents, mortgages, &amp; food bill for their kids.In spite of what people think, I am not a millionaire. If I&#39;m forced to close - I can&#39;t afford to pay these people.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve met Louis in person, he&#39;s truly a standup guy with a heart of gold.  That said, he needs to pony up and get a lawyer.  Making petty arguments on YouTube isn&#39;t going to help you with bureaucracy it&#39;s only going to make things worse.  If government employees (state or otherwise) hate one thing, it&#39;s being called out point blank for how they either a) don&#39;t do their job or b) are effectively worthless.To be frank, I don&#39;t see why Louis hasn&#39;t left new york / the east coast yet.  I was unfortunate enough to move to NYC just in time for covid.  I still enjoyed my time in New York but I really understand a lot of what Louis has been saying about the city itself.  Subsequently I left.  He clearly hates the business climate, makes weekly videos about how much NYC sucks.  Maybe for his own health it&#39;s time to move to another state?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tell anyone who will listen: stay as far away from NYC and NYS as you can when you&#39;re operating a business. The bureaucracy is insanely complex and both governments harbor a very strong anti-business sentiment.NYS charged my previous, 2-person, zero employee agency a $14K fee for not having a Workers Comp policy, even though having one isn&#39;t necessary for member-managed businesses. We sent in paperwork demonstrating our case and they didn&#39;t care. They kept asking for more proof that we didn&#39;t have employees—even though they had no evidence that we did have them. A bit hard to prove a negative!After several years of back and forth, we finally just said forget it, closed that entity, and started ignoring the monthly shakedown notices. Now I&#39;m wary of even having clients in NYS.[Edit: I&#39;ve heard CA is similar, but don&#39;t have personal experience there.]"</p>

East of the continental divide, it gets about 10&#34; of rain per year, which is about a quarter of the US average.And with climate change, it is more precarious.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think the biggest problem copilot will have in practice gaining traction is that verifying correctness isn’t any faster than writing the code yourself in many cases. The Easter(y) function is a classic example - it would be way faster to write that than to try and verify that there’s no subtle bugs.Copilot is by design trying to give you something that _looks_ correct without caring whether it actually is - so it optimises for real-looking but subtly buggy code, which is the worst kind of broken code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m surprised that so much of the discussion around Copilot has centered around licensing rather than this.You&#39;re basically asking a robot that stayed up all night reading a billion lines of questionable source code to go on a massive LSD trip and then use the resulting fever dream to fill in your for loops.Coming from a hardware background where you often spend 2-8x of your time and money on verification vs. on the actual design, it seems obvious to me that Copilot as implemented today will either not provide any value (best case), will be a net negative (middling case), or will be a net negative, but you won&#39;t realize that you&#39;ve surrounded yourself with a minefield for a few years (worst case).Having an &#34;autocomplete&#34; that can suggest more lines of code isn&#39;t better, it&#39;s worse. You still have to read the result, figure out what it&#39;s doing, and figure out why it will or will not work. Figuring out that it won&#39;t work could be relatively straightforward, as it is today with normal &#34;here&#39;s a list of methods&#34; autocomplete. Or it could be spectacularly difficult, as it would be when Copilot decides to regurgitate &#34;fast inverse square root&#34; but with different constants. Do you really think you&#39;re going to be able to decipher and debug code like that repeatedly when you&#39;re tired? When it&#39;s a subtly broken block of code rather than a famous example?That Easter example looks horrific, but I can absolutely see a tired developer saying &#34;fuck it&#34; and committing it at the end of the day, fully intending to check it later, and then either forgetting or hoping that it won&#39;t be a problem rather than ruining the next morning by attempting to look at it again.I can&#39;t imagine ever using it, but I worry about new grads and junior developers thinking that they need to use crap like this because some thought leader praises it as the newest best practice. We already have too much modern development methodology bullshit that takes endless effort to stomp out, but this has the potential to be exceptionally disastrous.I can&#39;t help but think that the product itself must be a PSYOP-like attempt to gaslight the entire industry. It seems so obvious to me that people are going to commit more broken code via Copilot than ever before."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would hire copilot to write tests for me, that’s about it. Writing tests can be a drag. It’s really a low-risk proposition to have generated code attempt it. If it’s a usable test, maybe it will catch a bug. If not, then kill it and let it generate a few more.The expectation is entirely different than producing code. Code needs to be correct, secure, performant, and readable. Failure on any of those fronts can be expensive to disastrous. Nobody can reasonably expect a test suite to catch every bug, even if created by the smartest humans. If a copilot-created test does prevent a bug from shipping it provides immediate value. I could see it coming up with some whacky-but-useful test cases that a sane person might not consider. From a training perspective I would think that assertion descriptions contain more consistent lexical value than the average function signature.It seems like the ambitious data scientists, product marketers, and managers fell in love with a revolutionary idea about AI writing code, and neglected to consult the engineers they are trying to ‘augment’."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There was an IMF video clip with BIS director Carstens commenting on CBDCs last year, https://meetings.imf.org/en/2020/Annual/Schedule/2020/10/19/...&gt; With cash, we don&#39;t know who is using the 100 dollar bill today ... a key difference with CBDC is that the central bank will have absolute control on the rules and regulations that determine the expression of that central bank liability .. also we will have the technology to enforce that ... if an advanced economy issues a CBDC, and someone in a 3rd country wants to use it, it will require the consent of the central bank of the residence of that person, therefore the degree of control will be far bigger.Video on the IMF site is not working, here&#39;s a YT copy (thanks @toomuchtodo): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVmKN4DSu3g&amp;t=1451sIn a March 2021 speech, Carstens made a similar point, https://www.bis.org/speeches/sp210331.pdf&gt; It is crucial to trace transactions, particularly large ones, to an individual or entity. For account-based CBDCs, issuing central banks would retain control over cross-border usage. Restricting non-residents’ access reduces the risk of volatile flows, and of currency substitution in recipient economies.Well-intentioned initiatives like Linux Foundation https://www.goodhealthpass.org/ or EU digital health certificate or Apple iOS 15 digital driver&#39;s license (https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/06/07/apples-ios-15-walle...) can all be drafted into the service of CBDC initiatives which require digital identity for digital currency wallets."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There’s another name for a central bank digital currency. It’s called “a bank account at the central bank”. Hardly Orwellian, but hardly innovative either.Traditional paper money is actually a zero interest bearer bond. Essentially a simple receipt for liabilities at the  central bank that can be passed around like an endorsed cheque.Since regulators have steadily been eliminating the abilities of cheques to act as promissory notes rather than bills of exchange for decades, it’s hardly surprising to see their next assault on the “bearer transfer process” of traditional paper money.The whole point is to change it from a promissory note to a bill of exchange at the very least."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As someone who grew up in Eastern Europe in the early 2000s, with a a taste for Western media, especially movies, and the Internet becoming a widespread thing, it was infuriating waiting for movies to come to theaters months behind the rest of the world. Not to mention the horrible country specific posters and advertising, limited availability and titles. Piracy was the only option.It felt like the Internet would solve all these problems, like you&#39;d be able to experience culture from any part of the world however you liked and at the same time as the rest of the world. Sadly that never happened. It&#39;s much better now but it still feels like the media is crippled by old local distributor deals. The fact that e.g. Netflix offers different movies for every country is something that honestly does not make any sense yet everyone accepts it.When I got my first Kindle 12 years ago my Amazon account was registered with my local European address so the books available in store were all complete trash romance pulp novels. Once I simply changed my home address to some random location in New York I suddenly had access to hundreds of thousands more titles. The Internet never delivered on its promise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was born and raised in an African country. My father had a salary of 500$ a month. I could never afford a 50$ book about resiliency engineering or about Java Concurrency when I was 17 years old, neither could my father.The reason I love computer science and tech and excel at some parts of it, is simply because I could access any book, pirated. I have a huge will to learn, and piracy was quite literally the only means to learn. Once I worked and got on my feet, I started buying a lot of the books that marked my learning (because nostalgia and also great resources), and if and when I can, I always buys the books.Let&#39;s not talk about movies. My town STILL has no cinema. Nearest one is 100Km away, and costs about 15$ for a ticket. So if it wasn&#39;t for piracy, I would&#39;ve probably never watched Iron Man, and never dreamed of having my own Jarvis, and hence never taking up speech recognition and deep learning. Again, now that I can, I had periods where I watched 3 to 5 movies a week in the cinema, because I have the means to.I believe people are more likely to buy books/movies when they can. But for those who can&#39;t, I believe it&#39;s almost always a net positive to society to give them access to those resources."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I grew up poor in Eastern Europe. Very poor, in fact. Without piracy I probably wouldn’t ever have been able to learn English, find my passion and make it in life. And not just for monetary reasons but due to access as well. Ironically enough the Internet never mattered too much because we were able to get what we wanted hand to hand. The 56k modem was completely useless when your friend had a zip drive with the games you drooled over. But it taught me to appreciate things. Even today I love physical copies of things, it is like a little trophy to the thing I love.My biggest problem nowadays is not that I can’t afford the things I love but that there is hardly anything I actually want. But when I do I often get multiple copies, whether it is on different platforms or to share the joy with friends.That being said the effects of piracy are both severe and negligible due to the quality. While it probably doesn’t affect big corporations at all, the small indie people sometimes suffer catastrophically from it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have been in the aquarium hobby in the past, so when I started looking into hydroponics, for me the natural outcome was to also look into aquaponics[1].What I like the most about aquaponics (and recirculating hydroponics) is the sustainability aspects, it is an almost completely closed-loop system, with relatively small external inputs compared to other farming methods, and extremely small water requirements (due to the fact that water is continuously recycled).Two bits of info about aquaponics that not many people know:1. it is possible to have aquaponics systems in a vegetarian context: in many cases the fish is not for human consumption as food (in large commercial systems this is usually koi that is sold as ornamental fish[2a], in smaller systems goldfish kept as pets[2b]).2. there are aquaponics systems that don&#39;t require access to electricity, in particular the iAVS system (a.k.a &#34;sandponics&#34;) was developed with subsistence farmers that had no electricity access in mind, it doesn&#39;t require water to be pumped continuously, rather you are only required to manually recirculate the water a few times a day which can be achieved with a bucket or other low tech solutions[3].[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaponics[2a] https://www.pvrkoicentre.com/pages/aquaponics[2b] https://farmingaquaponics.com/caring-for-goldfish-in-aquapon...[3] https://garydonaldson.net/home/iavs/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is obviously nothing less than astounding. I can’t start to describe how incredibly knowledgeable and skilled this person is.Because the topic of hydro and growing food and all that is on HN here, I wanted to leave the following comment on a higher level.Ten years ago I was super dedicated to problems surrounding water, which of course include food and all the issues we have with our food systems. At the pinnacle, I was working with a half acre aquaponics greenhouse in Watsonville, CA. We had 8000 striped bass and produced and incredible amount of fresh produce. It was pesticide free because of you put chemicals on the plants it would get into the water and hurt the fish.It was more “natural” than hydroponics. You weren’t using fertilizer imported from all over, everything in the system could be produced on-site. The more biologically diverse the system was, the more resilient and productive.Both hydro and aqua phonics - the latter of which has been practiced for thousands of years, definitely save a ton of water. But I think aquaponics has a massive chance of being mainstream, especially as automation and all the advanced tech and robots get better.It’s about ecological engineering on a local scale - you are maxing out the ecology to human and nature’s benefit, and there are so many relationships to learn and exploit.It’s strange how impactful this could be on a grand scale - see some Dan barber Ted talks [1]Just really need to get some investment on this on a big scale, like the hydro houses in Canada. No one has, from all that I know, really built aquaponic systems on a grand scale that are economically viable. But I see it coming and after I wrap up my current company, I’m jumping right back in to working on this.We are just going to be doing what nature did best before we murdered all of it…but maybe Mac it out super hard and super quick compared to what it could do.Lastly, with all the climate stuff: Don’t forget, you can’t put a price on the systems that produce the food, water and clean air we breath, cuz you know, we’d be dead. Well maybe we can, but we sure aren’t trying.[1] https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_barber_how_i_fell_in_love_with..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hydro doesn’t taste as good as organic, and it needs to be flushed or you ingest a lot of nitrates, which is likely carcinogenic. Flushing requires careful planning and a system designed for it. You can’t just treat it like a fridge full of food. With soil you can just leave stuff in the ground until you want to eat it.I’ve poured a lot of time and money into the hobby, and have settled on organic soil with some simple drip for indoor growing.The water use is about the same. As long as you’re indoor the water has nowhere to runoff/evaporate to.IMO the benefits of hydro/Aquaponics are nonexistent. Also, the whole system is a pile of plastics. The tote and drain pipe in the linked article are not food grade plastic, which would scare me away from this system.The automation is way way way overkill. Hydro is very easy to tweak. The nutrient profile is a tiny percentage of the labor, and a $3 battery operated temp/humidity display is plenty for keeping things nice for the plants. They show the high and low since last reset, which is all you need.If I had any outdoor space with good sun I would set up a greenhouse, but since I don’t have that I run leds directly off of solar panels on my roof (dc-dc step ups and downs as needed).Kind of cool to see them rise and set with the sun."</p>

Even though that can be frustrating, I am glad the tech is improving at a good clip.While we wait for sorely needed battery cost reductions, it’s good to look at areas where we can ‘make hay while the sun is shining’.  For example, train ML models during sunny days.  Other industries might be aluminum, desalination, ice making (i.e. cooling), and other production (ideas welcome)."</p>

AC is going to become essential as temperatures rise, the grid can&#39;t support the load, and we can&#39;t afford to power all those ACs with fossil fuel. Solar powered AC seems like the most reliable way to survive a severe heatwave like the one described in the opening chapter of The Ministry of the Future: https://www.orbitbooks.net/orbit-excerpts/the-ministry-for-t...You can&#39;t rely on the underprovisioned grid in a scenario like that, especially since the heatwave will likely drive the power plants themselves out of their operating range. Solar seems like the only way. Its intermittency is a problem on general, but clouds that would disrupt the power would also stop the heat."</p>

I think the product is great, but batteries are consumable products. In fact, I would hope that one day it would be mandatory to offer battery replacements for all products you sell. (Do correct me if I&#39;m wrong, I don&#39;t think Apple currently does this for pods?)"</p>

Solder to new battery. Cram it all back together.That&#39;s how I&#39;d do it.Bonus points for choice of colors. I&#39;d love clear or forest green or deep purple.Watching a few air pod tear down videos, I find it weird the battery itself isn&#39;t part of the case. Like just use white instead of black. Have the barrel twist lock into place. Makes the battery replaceable. And that extra millimeter of diameter would probably be 50% more mAh.I know replaceable batteries is un-Apple. But that&#39;s what I&#39;d do."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A company which only hires junior developers is not a company that values quality development practices and it cannot expect to get stuff done on time, let alone with high quality and industry&#39;s best practices... not that junior developers cannot be good (with proper guidance they can be awesome), but without experienced people around to guide them, and without them having experience of their own, they are bound to make every possible mistake in the book no matter how smart.The people running the company were playing with fire and they must either be too junior themselves to understand that, or they were just knowingly doing so and hoping to get whatever product MVP they had planned as quickly as possible with the minimum amount of expenses possible.Don&#39;t feel bad for being fired from such a company. It might have been the best thing to happen to you because now you get the opportunity of getting a proper job where you might actually have experienced people to mentor you and  help you become a great developer and professional.With that said: next time a CTO asks you to create something in a month for a demo, just go ahead and implement a mock (no DB, no error handling, just happy path code) that&#39;s just about enough for the demo, nothing else. Make it clear to the person who is going to run the demo that this is not the real deal, and arrange for only the happy path to be followed in the demo (add a few safeguards just in case so if the person does something unexpected you just ignore it, never crash!). You could have probably pulled that off in a couple of days :D but yeah, you probably thought you needed to have the real final product ready otherwise it wouldn&#39;t be demo-able... Trust me, that&#39;s almost certainly not the case."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a similar story but since it wasn&#39;t an internship and I had about 5 years experience in far better companies, I reacted with relief that I got out. I only stayed in the company for 2 weeks in which the CEO and his wife, who was the COO, yelled at me multiple times. I was yelled at for not understanding the code base and delivering a feature within 3 days of joining, trying to relax in my chair when they were talking, using their stash of tissue paper cause they didn&#39;t bother keeping some in the bathroom for wiping your hands etc. In retrospect I wonder how I even got through those 2 weeks without quitting on the second day. I just stopped showing up and the CEO came to my house, banged on my door to try and get me to delete their crappy code written by a mountain of interns from my personal laptop. I pretended I wasn&#39;t home and we later had a call where I deleted it all. I also wasn&#39;t paid for the time I worked there. Everyone who wasn&#39;t me was pretty much an intern writing awful code because they really didn&#39;t know any betterUnlike here I have no qualms about naming and shaming praktice.ai"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It doesn&#39;t sound like the writer was fired for doing her job. It sounds like she did a really good job, given the circumstances, and that her bosses used two pretty quintessential management techniques - deadlines and negging - to motivate her and her colleagues to outperform.But this demo - her bosses ran out of money, and even if the text field did work, but they didn&#39;t get the money from this investor, they were going to be fired.That aside, as other commenters have noted, junior developers need instruction. That&#39;s easy to say if you&#39;re Facebook, and every 22 year old you hire is &#34;junior&#34; but also went to Harvard. They&#39;re not really the same kind of &#34;junior&#34; as the 50th percentile 22 year old college graduate. In my experience Facebook hires these &#34;junior&#34; developers because they thrive despite receiving little to no meaningful instruction - as if &#34;code reviews&#34; or a month of onboarding on Mercurial really teach anyone anything. The small startup is gambling that maybe they can find these 22 year olds that Facebook has missed, which is a reasonable gamble, there are a lot that were missed. But it was never about finding someone who needed instruction.Also, it&#39;s never been my experience that paying bad developers more money made them better. Paying good developers more money does. It&#39;s tough."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have been programming since 1977/78, and sometimes for work, but most of the time for fun. As someone who does technical work at heights with rope access, and many years of technical diving on hydraulics, pneumatic, and electrical equipment, I can say it all depends on your ability to shut out interruptions and get to a good stopping point. I get frustrated when I am programming and I am interrupted, but my most frustrating experience was troubleshooting a technical issue at heights, underwater, or on the deck during a show with almost 2000 patrons getting impatient, while a COO/CFO wants an estimate on when you will solve the as-yet-unidentified issue. They call the show off if you can&#39;t get an estimate to repair or resume after 15 min. and they expect you to hold to your time-to-repair or resume estimate. Oh, and half a million to one million USD are at stake! You might be standing in front of a controls cabinet with hundreds of wires and devices and some indications of where to look, or 10m underwater trying to find a source of the fault. I think interruptions suck for any person who is focused on doing a good job - bus drivers, pilots (yes, I know - autopilot!), soldiers in combat, air traffic controllers, chefs, almost any job. This is why I never took a job coding full time. It is always secondary to my actual job even if it is important. And, I like J and APL for the very reason that you are looking at a few lines of code vs. a few pages of for loops ;)I code in C and other languages as well, so no offense to those who work mainly with scalars ;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The example I like to use is sudoku. Often, after a day of programming, it takes me a while to &#34;come out of it&#34; and I explain that to my SO as if she&#39;d been doing hours of sudoku and then had to jump into a social situation.Similarly, if you are interrupted in the middle of a &#34;solve&#34; it may be difficult to jump back in - especially if the puzzle hasn&#39;t been created correctly and you are trying to &#34;debug&#34; which numbers conflict. Some puzzles are harder than others. At times you don&#39;t have a pen and paper so you have to keep a mental model of the whole puzzle in your head which makes an interruption that much more jarring.Not a perfect analogy, but close enough to get me a 15 minute buffer at the end of the day and fewer knocks on the office door :D"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interruptions are very challenging with any deep work that takes hours. This is true.What I am facing however, is a related issue. Perhaps because I have not been doing much programming lately, I find it increasingly difficult to actually get and be in the zone. When I go in, I go all in, and enter a kind of fugue state where the hours slip away. While for some this may sound advantageous, in the past, it has been associated with some bad physical and psychological health outcomes. Now, I actually have anxiety about going into such a state, and try to piece meal my problems, and focus on the non-programming work and thinking.Situations change, and I am about to be in one where I do really need to perform a lot of coding myself. I suppose I am answering my own question, but I need to split up my work and take notes to reduce the numbers of abstracted layers upon which I am working. Take more breaks with confidence I can return.I suspect this technique can help ease the burdens of interruptions as well, but it does come at a cost in time. For me, the severe crunch time requirements and gained insane last minute skills should still be less necessary for some time. This is likely called being in a startup and getting older and, well, recognizing long-term limitations."</p>

YouTube has no serious competitors because it has significantly more viewers and creators. If I use Streambus, how will I get others to see my content? If I want to find new stuff on Streambus, where do I see others&#39; streams?IMO any serious contender for YouTube would need:- People using it
- Decent recommendation algorithm - for all the hate YouTube gets, I&#39;ve seen worse
- Decent moderation. YouTube is too severe, yes, but you really don&#39;t want hate speech and shady stuff on your site, and especially recommended. It will scare everyone away. And copyrighted stuff will get you into legal trouble"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not sure how well known it is, but YouTube itself has an RSS feed for each channel (well, Atom feed, most feed readers treat them interchangeably).https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=XXWhere XX is the channel ID (the last component in the URL when you go to a channel).It&#39;s actually how I consume YouTube these days.  It&#39;s a slightly orthogonal problem to the solution posted here, since it doesn&#39;t follow the RSS &#34;enclosure&#34; spec.

Unfortunately, it hasn&#39;t been updated since 2016 and isn&#39;t suitable for applications outside Terminal.app. But apparently someone else took up the mantle and rebuilt it to solve those issues and published it as creep2:https://github.com/raymond-w-ko/creep2&gt; I love romeovs&#39;s creep font, but I think you could only use it well in Apple&#39;s Terminal.app because it has negative line and character width spacing, which the font requires to be spaced correctly. The root cause of this appears to be because some glyphs are bigger than the 5px by 11px bounding box, causing most terminals to think a much bigger box is necessary for the general ASCII glyphs.&gt; In order to fix this issue, I manually hand painted all the glyphs from the &#39;creep&#39; font in fontforge.Awesome! I just wish creep2 added some of those sweet demo photos that are in the creep README."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi everyone, quite unexpected to see this on the frontpage of Hacker News!I made this so many years ago but I&#39;m not using it myself anymore and I haven&#39;t been maintaining it.I was (and am) also very inexperienced making fonts so the result was &#34;good enough for my own limited use case&#34; but too broken for general use, so it&#39;s good to see other people taking it and running with it, fixing my oversights and improving things.Questions or suggestions are more than welcome."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is fun. As I’m working on my little hobby project that is custom air quality meters I am using 128x64 screens that are about an inch on the diagonal. I ended up having to create a custom pixel font that would work for both 6pt and 8pt height plus some icons in each. It’s been a really fun experience and rewarding too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I read on many different sites that AMD’s current CPUs beat Intel’s CPUs in terms of performance per watt. We can better achieve goals 2 and 3 (low noise and low power usage) by using fewer watts, so we’ll pick an AMD CPU and mainboard for this build.Unfortunately many reviews are very misleading here. Zen 2/3 CPUs have good performance per Watt, that&#39;s true. But for a machine like this, which will be mostly idle, this is not the interesting metric and Zen 2/3 systems show that you can combine good perf/W with poor idle power consumption (which is not true for their monolithic APU brethren, which are used in laptops).One of the biggest idle power hogs for these is the IO die, so make sure that XMP is disabled and the memory uses one of the slow JEDEC timings. This should be fine for a router. Check that the SoC/NB voltage is set to 1 V or less. Some boards set this higher. In the AMD CBS section of the board firmware there should be an item &#34;SoC OC Mode&#34; somewhere. Disable it. Some boards allow you to set a new PPT (package power target), but it&#39;s worth pointing out that values which are too low will make the CPU very slow because it essentially forces all cores to very low power states in order to meet the PPT since the CPU can&#39;t influence the baseline power (due to fabric and I/O die). The upside of using a reasonable PPT of e.g. 50-60 W is that you reduce power consumption if some errant task hogs the CPU.These settings make a big difference, but only if the CPU is really idle. Even fairly light loads (e.g. on a desktop, moving the mouse on the background) has everything rev up. In deep idle (nothing running at all, no user interaction on a desktop) you might get a Zen 2/3 CPU down to around 20 Watts, but as soon as anything is happening at all we&#39;re straight back to the 40-70 W region.Using an Intel system for this would have likely saved 10-20 W."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Our network cards need PCIe 3.0, so that disqualifies 5 chipsets right away: only the A520, B550 and X570 chipsets remain.No, the linked Wikipedia page only shows the PCIe lanes connected through the chipset and doesn&#39;t account for PCIe lanes provided directly from supported CPUs. X470 supports CPUs which have PCIe 3.0 and a board with x8/x8 mode like the ROG Strix X470-F https://www.asus.com/microsite/motherboard/AMD-X470/ should work just fine (and has no fan)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think the problem of this essay is that it&#39;s overly technical: only those versed well enough in SQL will really care to read the whole thing, and if they are already at that level, either they accepted that &#34;SQL will get the job done in the end&#34;, or they learned to live along it and now even kinda embrace it, and are happy to write about how the examples are very poor and dismiss the critique based on that, when the essay kinda explains it main point pretty well:&gt;&gt; The core message [...] is that there is potentially a huge amount of value to be unlocked by replacing SQLTo me, a lot of people defends SQL saying that &#34;perfect is the enemy of good&#34; and that SQL simply works. Not the favourite of anyone, but everyone kinda accepts it.And yeah, it&#39;s true. People use SQL because it&#39;s good enough, and trying to reinvent the wheel would take more work (individually speaking) than just dealing with SQL as it is right now. For large organizations where the effort could be justified, all your engineers already know SQL anyway, so it&#39;s not so great either.But for something so relevant as relational databases, perfect is not the enemy of good. We do deserve better. We generally agree that SQL has many pitfalls, it&#39;s not great for any kind of user (for non-technical users, a visual programming language would work well here, more like what Airtable does, closing the bridge between spreadsheet and hardcore database, and for technical users, it does feel unwieldy and quirky). We should be more open to at least consider critiques and proposals for better. We might find out that people, from time to time, are making some good points."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder how much of the limitation are necessary in order for the query optimizer to have any chance at finding a good execution plan. As you add more and more abstractions and more and more general computations in the middle of your queries, it will probably become harder and harder for the query optimizer to understand what you are actually trying to do and figure out how to do it efficiently. Are you not running the risk that the database will have to blindly scan through entire tables calling your user defined functions as black boxes on each row?I would also guess that we could have a better SQL but I do not think it could and should look anything like a general purpose programming language because otherwise you might get in the way of efficient query execution. Maybe some kind of declarative data flow description with sufficient facilities to name and reuse bits and pieces.And maybe you actually want two languages which SQL with its procedural parts already kind of has. One limited but well optimizable language to actually access the data, one more general language to perform additional processing without having to leave the server. Maybe the real problem of SQL lies mostly in its procedural part and how it interfaces and interacts with the query part."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like most frustrations with SQL boil down to fighting against a shitty schema.When you are sitting in a properly normalized database, it is a lot easier to write joins and views such that you can compose higher order queries on top.If you are doing any sort of self-joins or other recursive/case madness, the SQL itself is typically not the problem. Whoever sat down with the business experts on day 1 in that conference room probably got the relational model wrong and they are ultimately to blame for your suffering.If you have an opportunity to start over on a schema, don&#39;t try to do it in the database the first few times. Build it in excel and kick it around with the stakeholders for a few weeks. Once 100% of the participants are comfortable and understand why things are structured (related) the way they are, you can then proceed with the prototype implementation.Achieving 3NF or better is usually a fundamental requirement for ensuring any meaningfully-complex schema doesn&#39;t go off the rails over time.Only after you get it correct (facts/types/relations) should you even think about what performance issues might arise from what you just modeled. Premature optimization is how you end up screwing yourself really badly 99% of the time. Model it correctly, then consider an optimization pass if performance cannot be reconciled with basic indexing or application-level batching/caching."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Maybe it&#39;s just me, but I dislike the whole concept of advertising in places that aren&#39;t related to shopping. I go to Instagram to look at my friends&#39; pictures, not to be sold something I don&#39;t actually need. If I were to shop, I&#39;d go to a mall, thank you very much.Anyway, at some point Instagram ads (especially the autoplaying video kind, with sound) drove me crazy enough that out came jadx and apktool and I found a beautiful way to inject my own code into Instagram&#39;s networking. The code I injected rewrites the API responses before the rest of the app sees them. I can now scroll through my feed without annoying salesmen begging for my attention. I&#39;ve also enabled a &#34;secret&#34; debugging menu while at it, where there are manual overrides for server-side settings, and there are at least several hundred of them — it&#39;s a bit creepy what they&#39;re A/B testing, like slightly different wording or different button colors.The only problem that still remains is that the feed is still algorithmic, and there&#39;s nothing that could be done with that with client patches."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t use Instagram much, but I am on Facebook too often. The limitations of the advertising algorithms are very interesting to me. For example: I participate in ex-evangelical groups because of my childhood experiences. Also follow pages which discuss American Christianity from a secular or journalistic perspective, and in Christian groups which interpret their beliefs from a left-ish ideology. &#34;Liking&#34; any post from those groups will trigger an onslaught of ads almost exclusively for conservative churches and conservative organizations.The algorithms can&#39;t differentiate between &#34;pro&#34;, &#34;anti&#34;, and &#34;observer&#34; on a particular topic. Nor does it seem to have any awareness of ideology. It&#39;s very rare when I see progressive churches advertise.I understand that the algorithms are going to have difficulty with subtleties. But I&#39;d think they&#39;d still have some rough awareness about &#34;anti&#34; vs. &#34;pro&#34;. And thus not flood people who dislike a thing with ads promoting the thing.At any rate, I suppose it&#39;s oddly reassuring Facebook is so inaccurate. Judging by the high number of critical comments on the religious ads, there are many uninterested people being targeted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I get great ads on Instagram. Generally, they’re niche products related to my interests from small companies I’ve never heard of before.Yes, there’s a few misses, but it’s way better than the absolute scum-sucking garbage I see elsewhere on the internet from other ad networks. “Doctor shares one weird trick for emptying your bowels every morning”, “Alan Greenspan tells you what to buy instead of Litecoin”, and similar.However, I don’t really use Instagram to connect with people I know. I follow a bunch of accounts related to my hobbies and interests. That probably primes the ad-targeting pump a lot better than if I was just following my friends and family on there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sadly the most interesting CSS percentage mechanic is missing there:    background-position

Unlike all other cases, here `background-position-x: [25]%` means:&gt; &#34;Place image so its inner left [quarter] boundary matches inner left [quarter] boundary of its container.&#34;So 0% = align left edges, 100% = align right edges, 50% = align centers (= center) etc.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wait there are sooo many more edge cases of percentages! When this article finished I think it should be half way through or even one third of 100% weirdness.Examples: with flexbox and/or tables, 100% behaves differently. What about 100% vs 100vh/vw? This would be very nice to show here as well. As others note, background-position or background-size. Collapsing margins might be interesting, but probably not the best fit for this example. How other types of `display` interact with the 100% (e.g. `inline` just ignores it). As it&#39;s just very briefly touched, but how box-sizing affects the height/width. SVGs viewBox, canvas, hiding navbars on mobile, body&#39;s default width/height, the trick of `width: 100%; max-width: 1200px; margin: 0 auto;`, etc. there&#39;s such a vast amount of topics relating/breaking the concept of 100% in CSS that it&#39;s mind-numbing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked on this problem for just over a decade before moving onto other things. It’s a tough problem to solve.The biggest problem I ran into is that the largest segment of user growth were too fickle. They wanted all kinds of magic in new optional features for their personal preferences that took incredible effort. I lacked the analytics to see who used which exotic features. Most of these people just wanted a beautifier more that a diff tool and would drop you in a heartbeat for more popular tools that wouldn’t do what they wanted but were popular.The tool I wrote did have a strong following mostly around markup language parsing that was not at all exotic but solved problems other tools refused to approach.My guidance is don’t become a code beautifier. In the languages I was supporting during the time frame I was supporting this code beautifiers were all the rage. Nobody seemed to want a diff tool with extra capabilities. Stick to being a diff tool. The people that are intentionally looking for intelligent diff tools tend to be more engineering focused and make for a loyal audience. People looking for code vanity are just the same as window shoppers walking down a street."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Surely far from being as elaborate as the linked tool, but I use the following git command a few dozen times daily:  git diff --word-diff=color --word-diff-regex=&#39;\w+&#39;

I added two aliases to my .gitconfig, one for diff and one for show:  [alias]
    word-show = show --word-diff=color --word-diff-regex=&#39;\\w+&#39;
    word-diff = diff --word-diff=color --word-diff-regex=&#39;\\w+&#39;

Those small things improved development and reviewing a lot for me!If stuff moved around or got it&#39;s indentation changed I either add `--color-moved` and/or `-w` (ignore whitespace changes) flags to filter out extra noise.Sometimes I need to use another regex though, e.g. a simple dot `.` for match all with no greedy +"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Been hoping for more of this for years. We stare at diffs all day yet we have to accommodate the computer by understanding that the parenthesis it claims was changed wasn’t actually changed, there was just another set of parentheses added. There’s of course limits to how much a diff tool can extract meaning from two pieces of content, but structure and perhaps even heuristics like “new function was added here, maybe the curly brace belongs with that and not the old function” would certainly help."</p>
