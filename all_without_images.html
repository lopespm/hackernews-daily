								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Don&#39;t put Cloudflare in front of a Cloud egress bill. i.e. don&#39;t do this: Azure|Amazon &gt; CloudflareAlways use your own proxy where the egress is well within your free tier, i.e. do this: Azure|Amazon &gt; Hetzner|Linode &gt; CloudflareWhy?Because Cloudflare cache is a massively multi-tenant LRU cache and whilst hot files will be cached well (and with Cloudflare Tiered Cache even better - but this itself is a cost) anything else is still going to expose you to some degree of egress cost.When I exposed AWS to the web I paid $3k per month to AWS. With Cloudflare in front of AWS I paid $300 per month to AWS. With Linode in front of AWS and behind Cloudflare I paid $20 per month to Linode and about $12 per month to AWS.A Linode, Hetzner instance... or any other dumb cheap web server that comes with a healthy free tier of bandwidth is all you need to set up a simple nginx reverse proxy and have it cache things to disk https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/content-cache/conte..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ah the old cloud provider switcheroo. Yip this is the way they make money. They make it easy to setup some gigantic hugely scalable website then hit you with a gigantic scaled up bill. AWS would do this as well.Team I&#39;m in at the moment is in the early stages of cloud adoption but the company in total has fell hook line and sinker for AWS. When I mentioned the cost there is always an excuse.The main one being that you don&#39;t have to hire sysadmins anymore as that&#39;s taken care now by AWS. Ah yes but they have actually been replaced with a &#34;DevOps&#34; team plus just our department now spend &gt; £1 million per year to AWS in hosting costs. A 20% reduction in those fees could pay for a few sysadmin(s).The next one is that no other vendor would be able to supply the kit. You know StackOverflow is able to run on a single webserver (https://nickcraver.com/blog/2016/02/17/stack-overflow-the-ar...). Plus many of the other providers have loads of instances available.I mean I&#39;m not against cloud it&#39;s just not the cheapest option if you choose one of the big 3 providers. I use a company called scaleway (https://www.scaleway.com/en/) they have all the essential cloud services you need and everything else you can run yourself in docker or k8s."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ouch. If Troy Hunt of all people can make this mistake, it can happen to anybody. HIBP is an awesome service funded totally by donations, so it&#39;s too bad this happened. Of course Microsoft is happy to hide behind their confusing pricing model and let customers overpay for Azure without alerting them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I experienced something similar building an internal tool on GSuite. I had a large file with sequences of 9 digit numbers specific to our use-case, all tied to names of people (employees). Whelp, at one point the tool I was working on stopped working, and it was flagged as apparently containing social security numbers (which I suppose matched the character length).Whelp, on the admin panel, you can get a report of those files, and then mark it as a false positive. Which I did. But then nothing happened, and nothing changed. It was no use.The hilarious bit: It did, of course, allow me to make a copy of the file in question, and then just point the resource I was building to the new file, which was exactly the same. Weeks later... so far, so good."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; How do you deal with Microsoft&#39;s crap on a daily basis? Any similar stories?My advice is that, unless you are developing for Windows is don&#39;t. If you need the Adobe tools, you can get them for Macs and, since M1, Macs offer a lot of bang for the buck while being a perfectly usable Unix machine, they are an excellent choice.If you don&#39;t need tools that aren&#39;t available on Linux, then Linux is a really good option. Hardware support may be an issue, so I always recommend the most boring machines possible - Intel, with integrated graphics - and only get components you know will work well with Linux."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been using Nix and NixOS for a while and I&#39;ve seen four core advantages:1. Nix store: what the article covers: multiple versions of the same package, &#34;virtualenv for everything&#34;... etc2. Reproducibility: because package definitions are self-contained, I can pin and reliably reproduce everything for my packages. And I do mean everything.3. Flexibility: Nix works for system packages on NixOS as well as user packages on any Linux or macOS. I&#39;ve been sharing like 70% of my system config between Linux and macOS, and I don&#39;t know of any other tool that can do that.4. Programmability: package definitions and config are extensible and composable. Yes, learning an ad hoc language to do this is a pain, but once I learned it I got a higher-level and better-abstracted way to define and combine packages than any other tool I&#39;ve used. It&#39;s like going from C to OCaml. At this point I&#39;ve started hating Dockerfiles because they can&#39;t easily be composed and don&#39;t provide any real facilities for abstraction.Ultimately, Nix took system management from feeling like an operational activity—maintaining and changing a bunch of mutable state to run the system—to declarative programming. Learning curve aside, making system management a reproducible programming activity with no system state to worry about has been a massive improvement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried using NixOS on a laptop for a month and switched back to Arch a couple of months ago. It was an interesting experience - I never used functional programming language before, but nix was pretty ok as a configuration language. It looks like funny version of JSON with functions.Debugging it was a real pain though - I was trying to write (or copy from someone else config) a function to recursively import all modules from a folder and the error messages were hard to understand with stacktraces ending somewhere deep in standard library.The other problem was with nixpkgs, i.e. I haven&#39;t found a clear list of packages that were going to be updated. Jetbrains IDEA was updating very slowly and when I wanted to pin a version of it simply overriding version variable in the overlay was not enough - there were also some other linked variables. Emacs package from custom overlay constantly tried to compile itself, requiring me to check build status on hydra build system.In the end I decided that it&#39;s not really worth it. I don&#39;t have many systems and services to manage and for a raspberry pi and a vps multiple docker-compose.yaml files in git repo is enough. 
I think Henrik Lissner (author of Doom Emacs) wrote a really good piece about why someone should choose to use NixOS - https://github.com/hlissner/dotfiles#frequently-asked-questi..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;&#34;&#34;The first is relatively simple: they developed their own programming language to do configuration, which is not very good and is extremely difficult to learn. The vast majority of people using NixOS do not understand the language, and simply copy/paste example configurations, which mostly works until you need to do something complicated, at which point you&#39;re completely high and dry.&#34;&#34;&#34;Maybe this is nitpicking, but: the Nix language is about as straightforward as &#34;JSON plus functions&#34;. Maybe that is difficult for people who haven&#39;t had an experience with pure/functional programming?Though, yes, the way Nix is used can be quite complicated/sophisticated. -- Even if all of Nixpkgs were translated to JavaScript, I think it&#39;d still be complicated to understand. (Though I suspect using a more general purpose language would allow for more footguns).+1 to the sentiment that most of the time you can get by just fine, but when you can&#39;t, NixOS is more difficult to make progress with compared to other Linux distributions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like the flow direction compared to standard SQL.  SQL is supposed to read like a sentence I suppose but I have many times looked at it and really wanted things to be in a more logical order.My main suggestion would be to be a bit less terse and introduce a bit more firm formatting.  I&#39;m not a huge fan of the term &#34;split&#34; and feel like jazzing that up to &#34;split over&#34; or even just reviving &#34;group by&#34; would improve readability.  Additionally the aliasing could use work, I&#39;d suggest reversing the assignment to be something closer to `use salary + payroll_tax as gross salary`.  In terms of firm formatting, unless I&#39;m missing something there isn&#39;t any reason to allow a filter statement before any aliases - so you can force two fixed positions for filter clauses which would make it always legal to reference aliases in filters.On the brief topic of form vs. flexibility.  SQL is a thing that, when complex, is written by many people over the course of its lifetime - removing the ability to make bad decisions is better than enabling the ability to write simple things even simpler - those silly do nothing queries like &#34;SELECT * FROM customer WHERE deleted=&#39;f&#39;` are written once[1] in a moments time and never inspected again.  The complex queries are what you want to optimize for.1. If they even are - with ORMs available a lot of those dead simple queries just end up being done through an ORM."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like it, it&#39;s readable, unlike some SQL alternatives I&#39;ve seen it doesn&#39;t make me feel like I&#39;m dumb and don&#39;t understand what a query even is.I can&#39;t decide if it would be better or worse if it stuck more closely to SQL keywords. You use &#34;from&#34; and &#34;select&#34;, but not &#34;where&#34;, &#34;order by&#34;, &#34;group by&#34;. There&#39;s some danger of it being in an uncanny valley of SQLish, but I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;d prefer just using those terms verbatim (including the space in &#34;order by&#34;... that style is less common in modern languages but it&#39;s not really that much harder to parse).I&#39;d like to see more examples of joins and composing SQL. Does this language make it easier to make more general SQL queries? Can I take two queries and squash them together in a reliable way? I feel like I end up with a lot of theme and variation in my queries, often involving optional filters.I might even like a notion of encapsulation that could help this query language when it&#39;s embedded in other languages. Like if I could say, in the language itself, that a query has certain unbound variables (and not just ? or other placeholders). This language seems like it would be better for generating than SQL, and sometimes generation is just necessary (like in any application that supports data exploration), but for most common cases I&#39;d hope to avoid that. Defining inputs and then making whole filter sections or other statements conditional on those inputs would help here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Now this is actually nice, unlike the other suggestion posted today[1].Maybe I&#39;m just too used to non-standard extensions of our database but the SQL example could, at least for our db, be rewritten as    SELECT TOP 20
        title,
        country,
        AVG(salary) AS average_salary,
        SUM(salary) AS sum_salary,
        AVG(gross_salary) AS average_gross_salary,
        SUM(gross_salary) AS sum_gross_salary,
        AVG(gross_cost) AS average_gross_cost,
        SUM(gross_cost) AS sum_gross_cost,
        COUNT(*) as count
    FROM (
        SELECT
            title,
            country,
            salary,
            (salary + payroll_tax) AS gross_salary,
            (salary + payroll_tax + healthcare_cost) AS gross_cost
        FROM employees
        WHERE country = &#39;USA&#39;
    ) emp
    WHERE gross_cost &gt; 0
    GROUP BY title, country
    ORDER BY sum_gross_cost
    HAVING count &gt; 200

This cuts down the repetition a lot, and can also help the optimizer in certain cases. Could do another nesting to get rid of the HAVING if needed.Still, think the PRQL looks very nice, especially with a &#34;let&#34; keyword as mentioned in another thread here.[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30053860"</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30066969">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To be honest, this feels like a PR stunt since we all know if you add &#34;YC is bad&#34; and share it on HN, people will look and react. I haven&#39;t heard of Bolt, I&#39;m not familiar with the space at all. I use Stripe because the product just works and I can trust my business with it. Seeing a CEO who publicly complains turns me away from even wanting to try the product.On a related note - I helped review a little over 100+ YC applications since getting in myself in S20 as a way to give back. There were a lot of bad applications or just ideas that seemed over saturated (a social media for some niche as an example). Literally tens of thousands of people apply for YC every batch. I personally recommended around 20 with around 15 getting interviews and around 10 getting in. I only recommend companies that I personally would want to invest in if I had the capital. YC has funded a handful of competitors in my space (PaaS) and I actually had calls with them to exchange notes and see where we could help each other."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think if you get over the drama here and implied &#34;dirtiness&#34;, the main result is still a bit interesting.Even if you exclude the implied carteling and take everything he said with a grain of salt, the outcomes of this incentive structure are clear: once SV (i.e. the YC centered VC machine) gets into a space and has a main horse, SV can no longer incubate new innovation/competition in the space. It can also very likely become predatory to the potential innovators that SV is supposed to support.At a more macro scale, this means that YC will fade in the same way as everything else does because it won&#39;t be able to entertain a wave of innovators, and they will, as he did, seek and build the next SV."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Public fights can occasionally be net positive for one of the participants, but your arguments will be publicly scrutinized and they better be watertight. If the logic you presented is your best work, then I can easily see why you&#39;ve experienced some trouble in getting people to support you.Let&#39;s start with the very first argument you presented: getting rejected by YC is a clear proof of collusion.Getting rejected by YC happens to tens of thousands of applicants each batch. Your chances of getting accepted increase disproportionally if you can show progress since the rejection. To react the way you did is a contrarian move. And it kind of fits the pattern - to publicly insult every VC on Stripe&#39;s cap table is also a contrarian move. Not to mention that you also made it clear to all your future potential talent that there&#39;s this thing about you not being liked by the VC community in Silicon Valley.I will skip all the little jumps to conclusions that you also presented throughout your thread, and will instead focus on the big picture here. The whole time I was reading your thread, I was waiting for the triumphant finish (eg: today we&#39;re announcing that we stole Stripe&#39;s biggest customer). Instead, all I heard was that Stripe is unbeatable, which sounded quite depressing from your company&#39;s point of view. I wonder how this will make future fundraising or deal closing any easier. Another contrarian move.I am not in a position to criticize you because clearly you&#39;ve gotten very far and something that you&#39;re doing must be working. But whatever it is, it&#39;s super contrarian. So rather than presenting the Stripe-Bolt competition in the light of a mobster movie, I think a Rambo analogy would be more appropriate - a traumatized but highly skilled fighter declaring war on everyone and their grandmother."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Funny enough, I decided to play with FreeBSD for personal projects in 2020. I gave up and I am reverting all my servers to Linux in 2022, for the opposite of the reasons mentioned in this article.* Lack of systemd. Managing services through shell scripts is outdated to me. It feels very hacky, there is no way to specify dependencies, and auto-restarts in case of crashes. Many FreeBSD devs praise launchd, well... systemd is a clone of launchd.* FreeBSD jail are sub-optimal compared to systemd-nspawn. There are tons of tools to create freebsd jails (manually, ezjail, bastillebsd, etc…) half of them are deprecated. At the end all of your jails end up on the same loopback interface, making it hard to firewall. I couldn&#39;t find a way to have one network interface per jail. With Linux, debootstrap + machinectl and you&#39;re good to go.* Lack of security modules (such as SELinux) -- Edit: I should have written &#34;Lack of good security module&#34;* nftables is way easier to grasp than pf, and as fast as pf, and has atomic reloads."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The reasons are, for a large part, not on the technical side. I was surprised, because this this a lot of work for little visible gain. Here are the reasons, slightly abbreviated:&gt; The whole system is managed by the same teamMostly philosophical.&gt; FreeBSD development is less driven by commercial interests.Mostly philosophical.&gt; Linux has Docker but FreeBSD has jails!IMO, this comparison is a mistake. In the Linux world, systemd&#39;s nspawn is very similar to Jails. It&#39;s a glorified chroot, with security and resource management. All the systemd tools work seemlessly with nspawn machines (e.g. `systemctl status`). Containers à la Docker are a different thing.BTW, I thought the last sentence about security issues with Docker images was strange. If you care about unmaintained images, build them yourself. On the other side, the FreeBSD official documentation about Jails has a big warning that starts with &#34;Important: the official Jails are a powerful tool, but they are not a security panacea.&#34;&gt; Linux has no official support for zfs and suchFair point, though I&#39;ve heard about production systems with zfs on Linux.&gt; The FreeBSD boot procedure is better than grub.YMMV&gt; FreeBSD&#39;s network is more performant.Is there some conclusive recent benchmark about this. The post uses a 2014 post about ipv6 at Facebook, which I think is far from definitive today. Especially more since it &#34;forgot&#34; to mention that Facebook intended to enhance the &#34;Linux kernel network stack to rival or exceed that of FreeBSD.&#34; Did they succeed over these 8 years ?&gt; Straightforward system performance analysisThe point is not about the quality of the tools, but the way each distribution packages them. Seems very very low impact to me.&gt; FreeBSD&#39;s Bhyve against Linux&#39;s KVMThe author reluctantly admits that KVM is more mature."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The characterisation of systemd in this post really bothers me, particularly this:&gt; 70 binaries just for initialising and loggingIt’s just not true. Those 70 binaries provide much more functionality than an init system, they can cover a significant portion of system management, including a local DNS resolver, network configuration or system time management. You can dislike the fact everything is so tightly integrated (which feels ironic given that the post goes on to praise a user space from one team), but let’s at least be correct about this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"GitHub Actions with act to test stuff locally is actually pretty usable. We use on-prem k8s-hosted runners to get access to servers/clusters with limited internet access, works great.But as always with “”gitops”” themed tools I think it’s pretty awkward to handle rollbacks. Either you take the stance that master is the source of truth and let the CI/CD tooling revert commits if deployment fails, or you store that state elsewhere and allow e.g manifests to diverge from git.I would be curious to hear how other people do it"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While dealing with an unfamiliar project recently, being able to run actions locally with act[1] was a great time saver for me:[1] https://github.com/nektos/act"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Word of advice, if you are thinking of running self hosted runners and use Actions for your organisation, do yourself a favour and check them out in a year or two and use something like Argo Workflows or Tekton instead.GHA isn’t a product thought for GH private organisations, you will find that every much needed feature for this use is very low in GH roadmap."</p>

See https://metacpan.org/pod/JSON::XS#JSON-and-YAML , for instance.(I am an absolutist on this matter.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Are people not even reading about what they are using?Always read documentation or you will get burned by something completely innocuous. For example, that’s how you get Norway missing in your config file with YAML:  NI: Nicaragua
  NL: Netherlands
  NO: Norway

Oops, “NO” evaluates to false like 10 other reserve words."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a love-hate relationship with YAML.Hate:- human-wise ambiguity of its syntax (If I understand correctly, you &#34;can&#34; indent array items, but you don&#39;t have to. And than one guys says &#34;OK, I&#39;m gonna indent&#34;, and another guy says &#34;Nah. I&#39;m not gonna indent&#34;)- still no support for datetime as a first class citizen- strings usually don&#39;t need quotes, until they do (I prefer to always quote)Note that two of the above points are about allowing inconsistent styles, which is a thing I hate.Love:- it supports comments whereas JSON does not. If the IETF ever officially updated JSON to support C-style inline (and maybe block) comments, I would absolutely ditch YAML."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Once upon a time I worked at Google.I returned to Austin to visit old friends and took the opportunity to visit the Google office there. The Googlers sitting around me were primarily corporate sales.They weren&#39;t getting any corporate sales calls at all as far as I could tell, but there was one extremely irate user who was locked out of their GMail account and was repeatedly calling them because they were the only human beings at Google the user was able to get in touch with, via something like &#34;Press 3 for Corporate Sales.&#34; Of course these poor Google corporate sales people had absolutely no way to help this user even if they wanted to. Google literally did not have any GMail account phone support (at least at the time).I could hear the poor guy screaming through their headsets about how he paid Google something for some service and was entitled to phone support and he demanded someone help him, but they just kept saying, &#34;This is corporate sales. We do not offer consumer account support. If you want support, please visit the Google Support Forums at www dot...&#34;After they hung up on him 3 or 4 times, eventually a manager got on the phone and told him (between his screams), &#34;Look, you&#39;re not getting any phone support because it doesn&#39;t exist. There&#39;s nowhere for us to transfer you. There&#39;s nobody who can call you back about this. Your only option is to search the forums for an answer to your problem. I am going to terminate this call now. Sir, I&#39;m going to terminate this call. No, we can&#39;t help you. Nobody at Google can help you. I am terminating this call now. We asked you to stop calling this number. Do not call us again. &lt;click&gt;&#34;I&#39;d frequently tell my co-workers, &#34;If you&#39;re not paying for it, you&#39;re the product.&#34; That experience underscored that notion for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They also do this thing now where they block [1] smaller browsers (even ones using the latest version of chromium) under the guise of security. According to their docs they&#39;re fighting MITMs by generally disallowing any browser they can&#39;t identify (so the big few).If you&#39;re not on a whitelisted browser by Google, you can&#39;t log in (effectively, use) any of their properties.This feels very anti-competitive to me. Notably all the whitelisted browsers are either theirs (Chrome) or sell them their search traffic. I&#39;m building a browser for research [2]  and have to frequently find workarounds. I&#39;m not quite sure who I&#39;d contact to get on said whitelist either...[1] https://imgur.com/a/DASVkhl (here is the issue in the Vim browser and Min browser)[2] https://synth.app"</p>

Using the very same IP address as I used to always access it, no less.Then, I gave up, moved all my services to another email account, and after 2 or 3 months tried logging in, and it suddenly allowed me to log in.Needless to say, I will never again use gmail for critically important things."</p>

They also have usable solutions for auth and storage, which like, if you&#39;re thinking of writing something like this are the first things you&#39;d start reaching for.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"TUIs over ssh/telnet can be a lot of fun. Especially in cases where multiple people can interact with each other on the server. It simplifies the programming model as you only have one state on the backend that you render to multiple connections. Syncing up everyone becomes trivial. You can also use some React concepts, like rendering a virtual TUI and sending just the right set of minimal escape sequences back to the user to bring their display up to date.A few months ago I implemented a telnet chat server[0] for fun and it was surprisingly easy to do so. Even by using a wasm vm that I was still working on at the same time.[0]: https://github.com/lunatic-solutions/chat"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked for a large e-commerce company.  I wanted to investigate putting all our support data into Watson and see what sort of recommendations it could provide, maybe a sort of auto-suggestion to help our customers.  Three really funny points stand out from the experience:1) To apply for Watson access you needed to show C-level approval, so our CEO put his name and phone number on the application (trying Watson was somewhat his idea).  A few months later, an IBM marketing team called HIS CELL and asked for ME.  Imagine how it felt to have the CEO walk up to me, deadpan hand me his personal iphone and say &#34;It&#39;s for you.&#34;..2) They told me they&#39;d help me with the support data idea, and every meeting we set up they tried to pitch &#34;what if we put Watson on all of your customer&#39;s storefronts, we could add a &#39;powered by watson&#39; banner on every page, and you give us a cut of GMV?&#34;.  I pivoted them to our plugin framework and told them to build it themselves.3) To demo the technology, the first step was to buy a $250k server from IBM.  To demo it.Big LOLs all around, never trust big blue."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at IBM Watson as one of the early engineers when they first started commercializing the product. It was a fucking joke - Ginni Rometty would go up on stage and said that Watson can help diagnose cancer from CT scans and we would just look at each other and be like &#34;Dude, Watson is just a glorified Lucene index, wtf is she talking about.&#34; They started selling Watson as the end-all for everything from cancer diagnosis to customer service chat - they even had a stupid Watson Chef thing at SXSW one year - but none of that used the original Watson codebase - it was all built from the ground up and lots of it was just simple logistic regression"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone doing a CS degree now, I seem to be the only one who doesn&#39;t want to have anything on my resume to do with &#34;AI&#34;, blockchain, ML, NFT, chatbots, etc... all I see is overhyped product after product, one-size-fits all solutions that frustrate customers and create problems for humans to clean up, hugely valued companies that have very little real improvement over conventional technology, etc.An &#34;AI chatbot&#34; is far inferior to a real user interface. A real user interface allows discoverability (looking through menus to notice functions that may be useful later), experimentation, and puts the user in control of the program.For example, my bank apparently only supports viewing the reason for card declines through the chatbot--something I never knew, because I took the time to go through the menus when I first got the app and learn what functions existed."</p>

Very admirable.Look at what he did:&gt; Photolithography machines are expensive—up to $150 million—and so Zeloof made his own by bolting a modified conference room projector bought on Amazon onto a microscope. It projects his designs at tiny scale onto silicon wafers that Zeloof coats in material sensitive to ultraviolet light.&gt; One of Zeloof’s best finds was a broken electron microscope that cost $250,000 in the early ’90s; he bought it for $1,000 and repaired it. He uses it to inspect his chips for flaws, as well as the nanostructures on butterfly wings.Damn this guy is good."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since most people don&#39;t seem to be aware: you can use Wordpress as a mostly-static website generator.Use WP Super Cache, and most of your pages are static anyway. A small PHP stub will be hit still, but if you don&#39;t even want that, you can just serve the generated static pages without it.It&#39;s well documented, you just edit your httpd.conf/.htaccess or your nginx config to serve the static files generated by the plugins.Only logged-in users (in most personal Wordpress installations: &#34;just me&#34;) or recent commenters, depending on configuration, hit any PHP code at all.Oh, and commenting works, unless with SSGs out of the box.Keep the number of plugins small, use a static plugin and security is mostly a non-issue for a personal weblog (it&#39;s different for a &#34;real&#34; media operation with all kinds of complicated workflows, of course)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it&#39;s clear that the fewer plugins one installs (ideally none) the better, though it&#39;s difficult to follow this rule in practice. I recently had to set up a WP website from scratch, and plugins are a very common way for people to solve their problems (especially non-technical users). Plugins are even used for basic ops work like rewrite rules, backups, log parsing, caching—and I get it, for most people if they didn&#39;t exist they wouldn&#39;t have done the ops stuff, or solve many of the other types of problems, so it&#39;s kind of a blessing and a curse given your attack surface increases with each plugin and WP feature. I&#39;ve learned that Wordpress really is what you make of it, directly proportional to the engineering effort you put in."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This idea really resonates with me. I started out life pretty poor, and am fortunate enough now to be able to purchase most anything I want. What I no longer have however, is time. I found myself purchasing things I want to have time for, but in all reality don&#39;t. Thinking about the second cost before hitting that buy button may be a good way for me to stop cluttering my life up with stuff I don&#39;t need, and the associated stress of knowing it&#39;s sitting there waiting to eat up time I don&#39;t have."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually tend to see anything I buy as a black hole that will suck more money into it.A good example is when you get a bicycle, you do the equation and realize that within two years you will have saved in on the cost of public transportation. But it&#39;s when you start using it you realize that suddenly you always end up sweaty arriving to work so you need to buy good ventilated outdoor clothes and then a little bit later the winter arrives and you realize you need the same type of winter clothes, and then your first tier brakes and you realize you don&#39;t have any tools, so not only do you need to buy a new tier but also the tools. And here the initial smart calculation has fallen apart long time ago.Don&#39;t get me wrong. There&#39;s a lot of benefits riding a bike to work so it may still be very much worth it. But once you have this realization you can apply the same logic to anything you buy or thinking of buying which may helps prioritizing because there&#39;s just so many black holes you can have in your life."</p>

You don&#39;t read a book to be finished with it, you read it because you like the reading process. The reward starts the first minute you start reading the book.Not only that, but you don&#39;t have to finish the book to get something out of reading it. If you enjoyed the time you spent reading, that is enough.This attitude seems very &#34;completionist&#34;, where you only get value after you finish something. That isn&#39;t how I view things.Also, why does he think mindless apps and games are the same as doing nothing? The idea is you enjoy the time spent playing the game. Sure, you don&#39;t end up with anything after, but you enjoyed the time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think the best definition of engineering is that it&#39;s a process of optimization within a solution space bounded by constraints. If you pile up some mud and let it dry, you have made a dwelling but you are not an engineer. If you calculate the load requirements for a series of I-beams given a certain budget and build a skyscraper, you are an engineer.As the author correctly notes, there aren&#39;t necessarily hard boundaries on what qualifies as engineering, but I think there clearly are axes on which something is &#34;more engineer-y&#34; vs &#34;less engineer-y&#34;, and as the constraints of the solution space go from physical (tension, voltage, pressure) to non-physical (interpersonal relations, public perception, aesthetic judgment), the activity goes from more engineer-y to less engineer-y.In software, we&#39;re always optimizing on cost / developer time, but that&#39;s closer to the non-physical side of the constraint physicality axis. As you optimize for things like memory usage, execution time, binary size, then you get closer to the physical end of the constraint-type axis, and are thus more engineer-y."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I come from an aerospace engineering background (did structural engineering on commercial aircraft that were in the design and approval stages) and am in software now (games). I&#39;ve had two different takes on this. Neither is perfect. Would appreciate comments on them.(a) If it&#39;s regularly expected that you ship bugs, you might be in a discipline that is distinct from engineering.[0](b) If you can usually reach for an abstraction to save you, you might be working in something that isn&#39;t engineering.[1][0] If software is engineering, then it&#39;s the only engineering discipline I&#39;m aware of in which the participants are regularly expected to produce deliverables they don&#39;t fully understand. What do I mean by that? Well, if we software peeps fully understood our deliverables, we wouldn&#39;t have bugs, or at least, we&#39;d always know what bugs are there. If as a structural engineer I had delivered a final draft of an analysis document which showed that I didn&#39;t fully understand the part and how it would perform, my boss would not have been pleased. Most software bugs are treated more casually than that, so we clearly have a tolerance for delivering work that we don&#39;t fully understand.You might take issue with the idea that I &#34;fully understood&#34; a structural part. Fair. When I calculated the strength of a beam in a thrust reverser I didn&#39;t understand the individual molecular interactions, I didn&#39;t need to know if the metal was of a body-centered cubic crystal structure, etc. But this is because I was able to apply well-understood and rigorously accepted simplifying assumptions that were conservative (from the point of view of a factor of safety), and fully encapsulated all the understanding I needed to produce a part fit for use.[1] This feels like the more flawed of the two proposals, because I expect EEs can do this. Control systems folks can definitely do this, and I would absolutely call them engineers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Actually, I am a real engineer, and designing gearboxes for airplanes is quite real. So are programmers engineers or not?Consider real engineering at Boeing. There are engineers and technicians (aka draftsmen) working side by side. They are often doing the same work. The difference, as far as Boeing is concerned, is the engineers have a degree in engineering and the technicians do not.But if they are often doing exactly the same thing, what&#39;s the real difference?Think of it another way. Think of an auto mechanic. He can fix your car. He can take your car apart and put it back together. He can customize it. But is he an auto engineer (who often does those tasks, too)?Nope.A programmer, technician, mechanic plugs numbers into formulas, follows instructions and procedures and practices laid out by an engineer.An engineer derives the formulas, writes the instructions, develops the procedures, and refines the practices.For example, a technician builds a band pass filter by using a circuit he&#39;s already used before and knows works. Maybe he&#39;ll tweak the RC values. An engineer will drive the RC values needed by understanding the calculation. The technician may use calculation (though they rarely do), but they don&#39;t understand where the formula comes from. An engineer does.In software, a programmer calls a sort function from the supplied library. An engineer writes the sort function, and can tell you its complexity and why the algorithm he chose (or invented) is the most appropriate one for the particular sorting task, and what the cases are where the sort will perform poorly, and why."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"American here&#34;perhaps better known as the online identity verification service that many states now use to help staunch the loss of billions of dollars in unemployment insurance and pandemic assistance stolen each year by identity thieves&#34;In the great State of California, billions in unemployment benefits were sent to the wrong people.. because their internal systems were designed to delay, deny and deprive, I say. Actual people with real jobs were repeatedly refused, while insiders who knew how to fill out paperwork, and apparently knew where the blind spots were, filed hundreds of claims in the early pandemic days. A newly appointed Director (young, tech savvy woman) soon stopped making public statements, and the situation nearly two years later, is not resolved.  This is at a time when California has record income to the State.Now, some people may jump on this and say &#34;well, you see how photo ID would have helped that&#34; and, with incomplete knowledge and personal opinion, I say no, it would not solve it. You see, people with real jobs, with every real paper filed, were denied benefits, while insiders were pulling checks with both hands, using certain kinds of identities that would slip through. How would ever more restriction, requirement and verification, have helped here?I am deeply against the collective government making ever more demands on citizens for &#34;papers, please&#34; enrollment to massive money social services (edit e.g. govt unemployment benefits). It is not going to have the desired effect, despite superficial evidence otherwise. Additionally this represents a slippery slope where the ability to interact as an individual will be eroded, and opportunity for insider graft will increase."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;A common question I get is about work/life balance. And I view it a little different too now. At Facebook I could get by barely working a few hours a day. But the job was so unsatisfying that it spilled the frustration in the “life” part&#34;This is the golden piece for me. I too recently left a big corp to a smaller place, expecting to sacrifice WLB and my free time - yet I ended up feeling happier and spending less time consuming short-form online contents, to the point that I even have more free time now! It never occurred to me that my self-indulging online addiction is actually a coping mechanism towards the unsatisfying and meaningless daily job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; At Facebook I could get by barely working a few hours a day.A note of caution that this is not the common Facebook experience. I joined being fully aware of their reputation for poor work life balance, but even then it was soul-crushing. The pressure to perform is near constant, consequences of not performing are real, and the bar for meeting expectations is very high to start with, such that externally hired senior engineers are frequently overwhelmed by the sheer amount of expectations.I was a manager there and got the distinct impression that the expectations bar was also rising over time. FB/Meta tends to hire the overperforming types, who put extra pressure on themselves to get those Exceeds and Greatly Exceeds ratings that come with real monetary rewards. The problem is you can&#39;t have everyone exceeding, not at the macro level anyways. So there&#39;s a real pressure on the managers with too many of those Exceeds ratings. The goal is to prevent a manager that misunderstands the expectations from giving everyone Exceeds, but the side effect is that over time there is a drift of expectations from Exceeds to Meets side. Having been with the company for so many years, the author likely did not notice this drift and was able to adjust over time naturally. Newer hires (which, given FB&#39;s rate of growth, is the large majority) aren&#39;t so lucky."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve noticed in the past 2-3 months that results from StackOverflow, Wikipedia, and official programming language documentation sites seem to have been abruptly downranked. They used to typically be in the top 3 results for me for appropriate queries, but now they frequently aren&#39;t even on the first page."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the utility of generic search engines is coming to an end. Services like Google, Bing and DDG are numbered in usefulness.Instead, I am guessing (maybe hoping) that we see a return of the moderated directories, like Yahoo or DMOZ of old. A 2.0 spin on these directories, with lessons learned from all the years.Imagine that you just go to StackOverflow and search there directly for your answer. Want a funny laugh, go to your favorite comedy website (like facebook.com) and search directly. Want some news, go to CNN or Fox (depending on your persuasion) and fill your echo chamber.Not kidding. I think search as we know it is dead.

There is a finite amount of people, of money to be made. Ever-increasing income is fundamentally impossible.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; 2FA tokens for all users worldwide were subsequently revoked to ensure the new infrastructure was in effect. We have mandatory 2FA policies on both the frontend and backend to protect users during this revocation phase, as outflows such as withdrawals have a requirement to setup and use 2FA in order to withdraw.How is this supposed to work? They revoked all of their 2FA for all accounts? Doesn&#39;t this just open them up to credential stuffing attacks? This is a really, really odd response to me. I can understand migrating to a new 2FA system, but they&#39;d have to re-establish the chain-of-trust somehow. Are they just hoping that users don&#39;t have compromised email/SMS accounts in order to enable the new 2FA system?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Boy this whole thing just reeks.&gt; No customers experienced a loss of funds. In the majority of cases we prevented the unauthorized withdrawal, and in all other cases customers were fully reimbursed.so which is it? no one lost funds or everyone that lost funds got paid back? where did that money come from?&gt; transactions were being approved without the 2FA authentication control being inputted by the user.the withdrawal system allows for non-2fa when its enabled, but informs the risk system when it happens? what kind of feature is that?&gt; While Crypto.com already performs internal and external penetration tests, Crypto.com has immediately engaged with third-party security firms to perform additional security checksah yes. the &#34;we already had 7 double checkers, better add an 8th&#34; solution. sounds like maybe the problem is not with the testing and auditing suite.&gt; releasing additional end-user security features as we move away from 2-Factor Authentication and to true Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)2fa isnt true MFA? did we evolve some new jargon im not aware of?&gt; WAPP is designed to protect user funds in cases where a third party gains unauthorized access to their account and withdraws funds without the user’s permission. WAPP restores fundswait i thought they said they already did this? are they gonna start charging for it now because they lost money?&gt; To qualify for the WAPP program, users must: Set up an anti-phishing code at least 21 days prior to the reported unauthorized transactionwtf is that? a PSK? a TOTP?&gt; File a police report and provide a copy of it to Crypto.com; andhello, local police department? i need to file a report - my cryptocurrency wallet just had an unauthorized funds withdrawal. no, i dont have a suspect, or evidence, or any action for you to take. just come down here and write down that i said this happened please."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Worldwide Account Protection Program seems to be a way for Crypto.com to limit their exposure, while marketing it as &#34;protection&#34; for the customers.Around $34million stolen, 483 users affected. If the funds were spread evenly, then each user would have lost about $71k. But the funds won&#39;t be evenly spread (average). It&#39;s likely some users will have lost much more, and some much less.From the announcement, it looks like Crypto.com is making the users whole again;&gt; No customers experienced a loss of funds.This means that (in some cases) Crypto.com was on the hook for much more than $71k / user. The WAPP appears to put a series of conditions on the user, and introduce an upper limit to the amount that Crypto.com will return in the future.&gt; WAPP restores funds up to USD$250,000 for qualified users; terms &amp; conditions apply.&gt;     Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on all transaction types where MFA is currently available,&gt;    Set up an anti-phishing code at least 21 days prior to the reported unauthorized transaction,&gt;    Not be using jailbroken devices,&gt;    File a police report and provide a copy of it to Crypto.com; and&gt;    Complete a questionnaire to support a forensic investigation.This looks more like a mechanism to limit Crypto.com&#39;s exposure to future events than it does a policy to protect users."</p>

I would never consider using them in the future.Also they are wrong factually. Google Analytics is not illegal in Austria. The court made this clear. Transmitting the IP without anonymizeIp is. Also transmitting PII data unencrypted to GA us (but GA does forbid that in their TOS as well).So not caring about the law when implementing GA and doing it just wrong is forbidden in Austria.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"WASM being the “new k8s” is only one small fragment of where it is going to go. I think there is a good chance it’s going to become the defacto deployment target for a lot of software, so in addition to browser and server:- Plugins for desktop/mobile apps, wasm provides a nicely sandboxed environment for them.- Gaming, the combination of WASM and WebGPU will be the perfect platform for cross platform game development. I could see Steam, for example, creating their own runtime.- Embedded electronics, simplifying the development and deployment of IoT devices.When it comes to wasm on the server, it’s often talked about as targeting the “edge”. I believe this the next area of massive growth, however the part that I don’t think is fully solved yet is on the database side. If your server app is making multiple database calls from the edge to a central db there is a good chance that it will slower than a traditional (single location) deployment.What’s needed is a edge first database, we need at least read replicas to be at the edge with your app. Fly.io have something like this with their Postgres’s product. The alternative is to use an eventually consistent db such as CouchBD, but that causes other problems. I’m interested to see if CloudFlare do anything in this area as it’s the part of their stack that’s missing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think he understands what K8s is. WASM is the new Docker, but you still need something to manage/orchestrate/schedule all those WASM instances. What if your WASM process goes down, who will restart it? What if you need 10 extra instances to handle a traffic burst? How do you isolate associated WASM instances from the rest of the environment, and manage their access to/from the outside world? How do you provide them with configuration or credentials?You still need something like K8s, even if you&#39;re not using docker underneath . Indeed you can already use other runtimes under K8s, so what he is proposing is nothing new anyway."</p>

Started with MSMQ support back in 2005, now it supports Azure Service Bus, RabbitMQ and ActiveMQ. It&#39;s old fashioned perpetual licensing, so revenue is a rollercoaster. Because of that, it&#39;s emotional rollercoaster as well. Good thing is you get paid for full license at the time of purchase instead of collecting it in 10-20 months. Bad thing is every month starts at zero.Although .Net went multiplatform years ago, my app relies on WinForms a lot so it&#39;s Win only, except through Wine. I would love to support Mac as well but the only realistic option looks to be Electron based, and it would be a significant step back for my Windows users. Maintaining two different GUIs looks like a problem for micro company.The best thing about desktop software is it can&#39;t break for all the users at once like server-based app can. That gives some piece of mind when you&#39;re micropreneur. Sure, there are bugs, but they affect only users who downloaded buggy version. You can&#39;t crash all installed instances just like that.The worst thing is, it&#39;s hard to ask for a subscription.

Output is a STL file to print a drill guide for the oral surgeon to perform a guided surgery.Our desktop scanners for dental labs and our intra-oral scanners for dentists generate 3D meshes of the patients oral situation.Those meshes are the input data for the CAD/CAM Software my team builds. It is a desktop app for the digital design of dental restorations. The GUI is in javaFX and 3D visualization is done with OpenGL 4.5.Once the restorative Design is done, that app can generate many different output formats.

My app revenue eclipsed my iOS/NodeJS consulting in 2021 and I hope to double revenue in 2022. Read more at https://label.live/features.The tech stack for this app is really interesting (to me at least, natch). Lots of native node modules that need finesse on both macOS and Windows. I don&#39;t yet support Linux because out of thousands of users, only 2 people have emailed about Linux support (probably both from HN!).I really love building Electron apps. It&#39;s a total joy bringing something (albeit &#34;inefficiently&#34; wrt memory and &#34;native&#34; qualities) like this to market for a niche that&#39;s otherwise a dumpster fire of old and clunky 1980s-era Windows-only software.As for licensing, Label LIVE is licensed per computer. I wrote a custom license implementation leveraging JWT. The JWT is signed by my license server and the app verifies the signature and that the contents match the &#34;fingerprint&#34; of the computer being licensed, expiration, etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This reminds me of the Subaru BRAT in the early &#39;80s. There was a 25% tarrif on imported pickups. So Subaru added two plastic jump seats in the back of the BRAT, even making them face backwards. No seat belts as I recall just handles. They weren&#39;t even really intended to be used. They were just cheap plastic. But they served the purpose of making the vehicle a four-seater car instead of a pickup, with only a 2.5% tarrif.Tarrif averted, thousands sold!https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru_BRAT"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I checked the keyboard debouncing logic [0] and it was fine. Some keyboards from other manufacturers, notably Lenovo Thinkpads, have absurd debouncing algorithms that scramble keys or add delays, so it&#39;s good to see Framework has a correct solution.[0]: https://github.com/FrameworkComputer/EmbeddedController/blob..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been so happy to see what Framework has been doing lately, and really want to support them, but I already have a desktop as my primary computer and two Thinkpads that are already set up nicely, but that I rarely use. I moved from 15&#34; laptops to 14&#34; when Lenovo added the numpad on the larger variant, and 14&#34; is about as small as I want to go.I kind of want to buy a framework though, just to support them? But I have no use for another laptop, let alone a small 12&#34; one! Should I get one anyway because, what the hell, why not? Should I wait and then jump on one if/when they release a larger model?Anybody else have similar feelings?Edit to add:I also have one of the last Thinkpad models that support S3 sleep (T480 -- within a model or two, I think?), which is currently super critical for Linux... I need to be able to close the lid and come back after a week.It&#39;s easy to blame the manufacturers for this, but the consistent answer seems to be &#34;Intel&#39;s Tiger Lake platform does not support S3 sleep,&#34; and all of the system builders base their work on what Intel&#39;s reference platform does. So short of going to extreme effort to hack it together themselves (something that is likely not their specialty), reasonable sleep behavior is not going to be an option unless Intel brings S3 back, or does work to improve the S0ix states.I absolutely do not want to support the no-more-S3 clusterfuck right now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m so glad Fly exists. Every other edge focused thing out there I&#39;m aware of are &#34;serverless&#34; which these days basically means they charge per request.That&#39;s fine for a lot of use cases, but the unit economics of the per request pricing model means it&#39;s really hard to operate a predictably sustainable (i.e. profitable) business without also charging our customers on a usage basis, or enforcing limits on usage, neither of which is ideal for maximizing engagement as incentives are no longer aligned.Fly just gives us compute at the edge for a predictable price per unit of actual compute resources as opposed to requests, and gives us freedom to serve as much traffic as we can min-max onto those resources, like we could with traditional cloud compute.This provides much better unit economics for many kinds of applications, at the cost of having to manage the scaling ourselves. But because the option exists, we can make this tradeoff on a case-by-case basis, which is so much better than if all we had was &#34;serverless&#34; stuff at the edge and had to choose between just low latency across the globe vs good unit economics."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fly is great.They’ve got Chris McCord there, who has already improved their Elixir deployment story. I tweeted a few weeks ago about improving the default Rails deployment experience to not require DB provisioning and configuration of env vars like SECRET_BASE_KEY and they said it would likely ship within the next 3 months.My hot take is they’re setting themselves up to ride the server-side rendered HTML renaissance we are experiencing with LiveView and Hotwire. It will become much more important to deploy applications geographically closer to customers to lower latency, which Fly makes sane for the rest of us."</p>

Ohio State University is in the city and is a huge school that is rapidly growing in academic standing. Road transit in the area is also very good allowing access to any part of the city from any other part in rapid fashion.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, cool! The model is specified as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem for which a solution is found using high-quality proprietary numerical solvers.[a] All partial differential equations specifying the model have a basis in economic theory or in heuristics and approximations shown to be consistent with reality. Parameters come directly from (what I assume is a large amount of) economic data collected by the Danish government.The authors working for the Danish government deserve an A+ for making their code and assumptions public, along with comprehensive high-quality documentation.[b] It was a delightful surprise to click on the link and find... a carefully curated repo.I have only one nitpicking: This looks like the kind of project that should have been -- and in fact probably should be -- implemented in Julia, instead of in a proprietary language. I suspect many heuristics and approximations could be more accurately modeled by ML components, interspersed between equations, as has long been proposed by Julia folks like Chris Rackauckas.--[a] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30028188[b] https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/DREAM-DK/MAKRO/mai..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Economics is not a science like physics. We can&#39;t do controlled experiments, we can&#39;t falsify hypothesis. This leads to very muddy waters and what you are left with are two kinds of economists: Those who tell people what they want to hear and those nobody listens to.Econometrics gives people everything they want to hear, and with a scientific veneer as a bonus. The HN crowd should however appreciate how susceptible this is to the tyranny of metrics. Claude-Frédéric Bastiat warned of this over a century ago with his parable of the broken window: Think not only of what you can see (the glazier who is employed to repair the window), but also of what you cannot see (the alternative purchase of a suit) had the window not been broken."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note that the model is implemented in GAMS[1], a proprietary language focused at constrained optimization problems (think Matlab, but more niche).

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve known many people in silicon valley who smoke cannabis regularly (several times a week if not daily). They all seemed to be cognitively normal. Some of them function on a level I only wish I could attain.I think regular cannabis use attracts a certain type of person. That type of person can vary in their ability and intelligence, just like any type of person. This is also true of say, hardcore fans of fantasy fiction. They all have certain things in common, but you couldn&#39;t paint all of them as &#34;creative&#34; or any other trait.I&#39;m hesitant when hearing about long term effects, even on developing brains. Both Barack Obama and Carl Sagan smoked a ton of cannabis when they were younger. And they and others really turned out fine.This paper seems to be a meta study that combines the results from other studies. Since there were multiple methodologies it&#39;s hard to get a sense of exactly what questions they were answering."</p>

I wonder who actually wants this stuff, and is not content to merely make it a default, but instead forces it to be the one and only way.Monitors are bigger than ever with huge resolutions, and yet UIs are being dumbed down to uselessness and alienating an increasing number of users.A recent related article https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29954266 seems to indicate that not even people inside Microsoft --- who are being forced to use Win11, because MS --- have any say in the matter. It&#39;s almost like some tiny extremist faction has gained control of Windows and is determined to show everyone else how much power they have by making these changes and gloating sadistically at seeing everyone object, but still end up using Windows.I wonder how much damage they will inflict before people start turning to WINE and a saner Linux distro, just to run their Windows applications."</p>

And the little dot provided to indicate an open app is worthless. I resorted to StartAllBack to fix it. Everything else has been generally fine for me. So disappointed.There are several highly voted feedback posts and comments about the taskbar but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen anyone at MS acknowledge any of it.(Main suggestion is currently at 11k votes. https://aka.ms/AAeyt69)And as if that wasn&#39;t enough, sometimes just clicking the taskbar item does nothing. It can sometimes take several clicks to get it to re-open an app.https://twitter.com/vyrotek/status/1461748895906553856"</p>

I felt completely disoriented at the time, uncovering the many delusions of money, tech and fame as the final life answers, alongside broken relationships and friendships and nowhere to turn. The monks and nuns took me in in a way that I will be forever grateful for and Thich Nhat Hanh&#39;s teaching was the beginning on a long journey of self-discovery, healing, relaxation and coming to terms with reality as it is, right now.Thich Nhat Hanh taught me something very ordinary: That it is important to pause often, to reflect, to sit still or walk in silence and to observe and acknowledge what is happening around you, inside and out. And to then act from that place of stillness and quiet with calm and kindness to the people around you. And to keep practicing this over and over again, without fail or getting tired from it.I feel tremendous gratitude to him and his teaching, as well as the monks and nuns that dedicate themselves to his many practices and insights.May he rest in peace and may his intentions and practices live on for a long time!"</p>

You left your phone in your car, and had 3-5 days (or more sometimes) of meditation, fresh cooked meals, and nature. It was really peaceful, and so different from what I had expected (something like a cult, being plied for donations etc. there was none of that). I stopped going when I left California, but it&#39;s hard to feel much more free than that these days. You&#39;re on a schedule for sleep, meals and events, basically making no decisions, and without internet pulling your attention, you feel like your mind is coming back to yourself."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Terrific story. Personal, authentic, and very relatable. Interest in and an aptitude for computers also saved me. (I even had a job in a computer store.)&gt; I made the cold calculation that as painful as my life was, it was probably better than rolling the dice with the child protection services.Yup. I too decided at age 11, choosing to live with the less bad parent.And shortly thereafter, those decisions were made for me, resulting in the state putting me into foster care. Somehow I avoided the worst; while the 1st family was pretty much what you&#39;d expect, I later lucked into a good family.--I wonder how many of us there are. I&#39;ve known so many runaways, beaten kids, sexually abused kids, kids with broken parents. And that&#39;s just in my wealthy, prosperous city. I can&#39;t imagine how much worse it is every where else.I also marvel that somehow some of us find a way out, while seemingly most others get sucked into the abyss. So much human potential lost due to poor circumstances and stupid luck. It fills me with deep sadness.And I wonder what the difference is. How are some able to escape their fate? If we can identify those success factors, maybe we can maximize chances for success. Could even be small measures, like how we now have suicide prevention hotlines, and resources for victims of human trafficking.--I had many, many people help me over the years. People who had no reason to help, but did nonetheless. I call them my angels. People like a little league coach (who&#39;d drive me to practice), a youth pastor (who mentored me), the foster family that raised me, etc, etc.As society becomes harsher, more coarse, more dog-eat-dog, I worry that other lost kids won&#39;t have their own angels."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The internet to me was a blessing and a curse. In economic terms, it has granted me lots of opportunities I might have not otherwise had; in social terms, it has taken a big toll, significantly isolating me from the world, which I didn&#39;t admit until very recently. I remember a smart classmate at university who, one day, just stopped attending and sold his computers, saying something like &#34;these little colored lights have turned me into something I don&#39;t like&#34;. Some days I wish I had done the same."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I often wonder how I would have made a living and a good life without the internet. I finished high school in 1994 with little career inspiration, landed in a generic business degree that held little interest for me, but it was at that uni campus I discovered the internet in early 95.I immediately found it exciting and grasped how transformative it would be, and quickly got to work learning web development and finding material and communities related to my interests (mostly obscure Australian rock bands). It&#39;s been the platform for my career ever since, and has also enabled me to go deep learning about some unusual health and emotional challenges that had afflicted me since early life, and enabled me to make profound changes to my health and wellbeing, leading to the place I&#39;m at now, with a solid career, great relationship and a wonderful young son.When I think about the person I was and the path I was on when I finished high school, it&#39;s hard to imagine how it would have turned out well had I come of age in a different era.Which is not to say life has been easy or simple; quite the opposite, and the internet has no doubt made life more complicated and challenging in many ways, My life has had several major ups and downs that probably wouldn&#39;t have been as pronounced without the internet. But I still have no doubt at all I&#39;m in a much better place than I&#39;d have been without it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This culture of radical openness must be quite refreshing for people inside the company.A lot of companies would never want this sort of thing to be out in the open. But really, why not? I imagine it helps to keep things sensible if you know that a thousand eyes could be trawling over your employee policies. You&#39;re certainly not going to be promoting astroturfing or other undesirable activities.At the same time, you aren&#39;t burdened with deciding what to share. Many (most?) companies tie themselves in knots trying to decide what to share, and end up sharing nothing.Sharing everything means less time spent deciding what to share and more time developing the stuff in the first place."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Never submit GitLab content to Hacker News. Submission gets more credibility if a non-GitLab Hacker News community member posts it, we should focus on making our posts interesting instead of on submitting it.I appreciate this policy, it makes it clear that HN is a place to engage with the community, rather than a free advertising channel. Looking at the CEO&#39;s profile, the last time he made a submission about Gitlab was in 2018, so I&#39;d say the policy appears to be followed."</p>

There is no comparison on the effects of alcohol on the body by dosage (and frequency), which is, again, what is required from the brief to make that claim.Again, while I don&#39;t necessarily disagree with what&#39;s in the report, and that it is already established that drinking too much is not good for the heart, considering many otherwise toxic substances have a hormetic zone, it is critical that a study like this rules out the its existence for ethanol."</p>

This makes it easy to learn and use, without any compromise on power or features."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I downloaded this and tried to follow the documentation [0]. `pijul add` doesn&#39;t accept wildcards, instead returning a pretty unhelpful error message:&gt; λ pijul add *.*&gt; Error: The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect. (o error 123)The documentation for add [1] gives no information on the format, however I put 2 and 2 together and managed to do `pijul add . -r`. The next step is `pijul record` [2] which returns another error:&gt; Error: No identity configured yet. Please use `pijul key` to create oneOk great. I ran `pijul key` [3] (which isn&#39;t documented) which returns 0, with no output. `pijul record` still says the above, so I tried `pijul key --help` which tells me I need to run a _different_ command (`pijul key generate &lt;LOGIN&gt;`) but doens&#39;t tell me what `login` is supposed to be. I ran `pijul key generate &lt;my_email&gt;` which appears to have worked, and then `pijul record`.I actually killed it after an hour and 15 minutes, rather than waiting to see how long it would take. For reference, git add * takes about 3 minutes on the same project. Between the documentation, error messages and performance I can&#39;t see myself taking another go at this for a while.[0] https://pijul.com/manual/getting_started.html[1] https://pijul.com/manual/reference/add.html[2] https://pijul.com/manual/reference/record.html[3] https://pijul.com/manual/reference/key.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People thinking this is an absurd amount of money are sleeping on how 1Password is quietly positioning itself to become the ground truth storage solution for corporate secret management, across devops and non-technical groups alike.Given Hashicorp&#39;s market cap of 11B, and 1Password&#39;s narrative on how to become even more central to corporate use cases by being the storage layer for Vault deployments, it&#39;s a very reasonable leap for them to make!https://1password.com/secrets/https://1password.com/secrets/integrations/https://1password.com/enterprise-password-manager/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really wish they weren&#39;t doing away with 1password classic and the native mac app. I like the fact I bought a license, that I can store the data on dropbox or icloud, and it works just fine.Yes, this is old news and sour grapes on my part. I just don&#39;t yet feel like migrating to bitwarden.I&#39;ve been using 1password for 12 years since I saw it on a tutorial on peepcode.com. I actually taught my mother how to use it, she&#39;s been using it for 9 years, and last weekend she was upgrading all her passwords to use 2fa with the QR code capturing facility.We had to go find the 1password classic browser extension (something stopped working, needed to reinstall it) and that took a bit of doing. 1password is not making it easy to find anymore, and when she contacted customer support (before talking to me), their response was to upgrade to a paid account and store your passwords on a server.Ugh.Honestly, now that they&#39;ve raised this much cash, would it really be that big of an inconvenience or lift for them to give mac users a native app instead of the electron one and keep allowing legacy users like me to use 1password with our existing licenses and dropbox?I think they&#39;d be able to hire some additional developers and product/project people to make it happen. Not continuing to work on the classic project just feels like a kick in the shins.Now, I&#39;m building out my kubernetes cluster at home, and bitwarden is something I&#39;m going to experiment with as a backup, but 1password 7 works fine and I just don&#39;t want to migrate to a paid account.C&#39;mon 1password, make your legacy customers happy!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This kind of announcement tends to ring all kinds of alarm bells for me.  What kinds of changes should we expect to make those huge investments worthwhile for the investors?My 1Password installation is grandfathered from a time when it was just a standalone app, without subscription.  Will it just stop working one day to bully me into subscribing?  Can you even start using 1Password these days without buying a subscription?  I&#39;ll have to start looking for alternatives today."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I once almost completely automated my job, and didn&#39;t hide it.  The job was to load data files into the backend system. The problem was there there were almost as many formats (~80) as there were partners sending data (~120), not just in structure but in content (deltas, full replace, etc.).  This job was burning people out every 6 months, and I was the hapless next victim who was just looking to break into a tech position.I started scripting and automating parts of it, which eventually got pieced together to be completely hands off unless a new partner came on board or there was some new error.  Since some of these steps used keyboard macros on VT100 terminals, I couldn&#39;t even use my computer while it was running, so I requested another, with the explicit intent that I could use it to surf the web while my main computer was doing it&#39;s thing.  Data load lag times went from weeks, to days, to hours.When it came time for performance review, I was told I had &#34;completely redefined the position&#34;.  I would therefore be assessed against the new definition, and was therefore deemed average, and got a 3% cost of living raise (pro-rated to 2% since I&#39;d only been there 8 months) with no merit increase.  A few weeks later, my manager was somehow surprised to the point of tears that I had a new job elsewhere.A few months later, I got a call from my ex-manager, asking if I had any backups of the programs I wrote (this was long before the days of offsite source control).  I said no, I had no need for them and that would probably be illegal.  My replacement had somehow lost everything, and was now trying to keep up the old burnout way and they were weeks behind."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Early in my career I was the only engineer in a company with a dedicated office building full of people selling my work to Fortune 500 companies as that of a large team. Slept under my desk a lot as the 80 hour weeks made me choose between commuting and sleeping.It got worse when they hired someone to manage me that demanded I use Basecamp to log every action I take in my day .I wrote a script to fill it out with technical sounding nonsense. After a few weeks the manager came to compliment me on hearing his demands out and being so detailed in my reporting without productivity going down as I suggested in my early reservations.I explained that I automated it. He was fascinated and asked how it knows what I am doing, smelling a startup opportunity. I explained that it just makes stuff up to appease non technical managers.&#34;Did you just do this as an elaborate way to give me the middle finger?&#34;&#34;Pretty much.&#34;He never tried to manage me again, realizing I had automated his job reporting to his managers too.Said script for fun: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lrvick/5ecabfc4bb5a2f5578..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This story is a pretty accurate fable for the pointlessness of the modern economy and its inability to provide real value to anyone. Man spends all day playing video games, because he automated his largely superfluous job at a law firm which itself likely only exists to deal with bureaucratic or unnecessary cases (assuming this is true, as they have a single absent IT person who handles their entire infrastructure.)On top of all that, this story itself is probably made up, created to get attention from other people in pointless jobs. It’s a meta-exercise in pointlessness."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m definitely getting screwed over by this. I&#39;ve hosted close friend&#39;s and family&#39;s email for a decade now on an old G Apps instance. We only ever used it for email on a custom domain. It was most useful because I could reset passwords for them if they forgot it. Now I&#39;m going to have to figure out what to do.Microsoft&#39;s Family offering is way better (not saying much considering Google doesn&#39;t have one). Right now I&#39;m really considering moving over to them. But I have no idea what the migration of a decade of email across 5 inboxes will look like; not to mention Calendar and contacts. I used this as my primary email on at least 7 android phones (the original Pixel up through the Pixel 6 I preordered). The loss of Youtube purchases; android play purchases, etc. is going to hurt. I&#39;m sad it isn&#39;t illegal to turn a free account into a paid one when it means losing purchased content like this.I&#39;m not 100% sure what to do, I don&#39;t have dozens of hours to walk everyone through a migration; and Google provides absolutely no migration tools to help with this. This is the last time I&#39;ll be burned by Google though. I used to be a huge fan; but at this point I&#39;m done. I&#39;m really looking forward to cutting them out completely. As an added bonus; I no longer have to worry about them deciding to ban my account one day and lose everything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a Google employee who just found out about this.
I&#39;m not annoyed that I have to pay, it&#39;s been ~13 years of free service and I don&#39;t think Google is obligated to continue providing this to me.The annoying part is that Google doesn&#39;t provide any migration tool, but there are migration tools for Google Edu accounts so that graduating students can migrate their data to personal Google accounts. The software is evidently mostly written and tested, but for whatever reason it hasn&#39;t been brought over the finish line for other workspace users.Obviously our use case isn&#39;t that common (it&#39;s been &#34;legacy&#34; for years) but still annoying to know that there&#39;s probably some script I could run to do this, but nobody has built the web UI for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;I am altering the deal. Pray I don&#39;t alter it any further&#34;.The problem here is there&#39;s no way out now. If 15 years ago you made the mistake of wanting gasp a domain for your email, you&#39;re basically roped into paying now.Almost everything a free G Suite user wants is identical to the free @gmail account, which is remaining free. Except the custom domain. Fine - but there&#39;s no way to just lose the custom domain at this point.Over the years, the Google account has grown in importance and things tied to it. It&#39;s fairly un-viable to migrate it to an @gmail account. Especially for your whole family.So, the options are nuke all your Google accounts and suffer the consequences, or pay up.Not like we didn&#39;t see this coming of course, but still sucks."</p>

Plus a ton of wonderful things.There are two minor points I am missing:- the ability to control someone&#39;s passwords. Typical usage: the 24/7/365 support for my parents, where I would like to be able to access their passwords (they also would like that, obviously). There would be a simple solution: the ability to force someone to file entries only in an organization. But it is not possible (and new entries will go to the personal vault by default).- the ability to discard the Android pop-up, sometimes it completely blocks the ability to manually fill in something.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Related talk by Dan Liebgold from Naughty Dog, at RacketCon 2013:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSmqbnhHp1c&amp;t=55sStarting at around 10m into the talk, Liebgold says their DC language for TLOU (to get what they most needed from a DSL even if using C++ instead of GOAL) was implemented in Racket.For anyone not familiar with TLOU, it was a critically-acclaimed game, and my personal all-time favorite game for storytelling that somehow grabbed me.  (I dislike all zombie franchises, but at a key point towards the end of the nonlinear narrative and playing in the game, I was surprised how much I really wanted to protect the kid.  Which I&#39;ll partly attribute to a Lispy DSL that helped them execute immersive storytelling in a zombie stealth shooter.)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us#Critical_respon...This is one of the Racket success stories.  They seem to happen because someone already knows they want a Lisp, they end up picking Racket without needing anyone else&#39;s permission, and the people using it are capable of designing and building whatever missing pieces they need."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"GOAL / games written in Lisp have been a lifelong obsession. I used to search for hours for any scrap of information about the language. I would have traded a lot for this repo when I was 19.Thank you to the authors for fulfilling a teenage dream. Please consider doing Last Of Us next —- I once downloaded it and tore it apart for any signs of lisp, but it was all compiled bytecode. That’s where I gave up, but it looks like you took it one millennium further by reverse engineering the bytecode from Jak and Dexter to make your own port that compiles to the same bytecode. If you have infinite time, you could theoretically do this for last of us too, and also last of us 2."</p>

Two rogue bones in my neck. Plaque on my beloved’s brain. Great love stories begin with such heady promise and end with such sadness and grief—but, at least in my case, also with memories of immense joy throughout a muscular marriage of two strong, supportive partners with challenges aplenty.So poignantly expressed. I am usually skeptical of &#39;true love&#39;, but these kind of stories remind me I could be so utterly wrong. It is rare to find people as committed to each other as Judy &amp; Steve."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a lovely story, but quite honestly, Alzheimer&#39;s/dementia is a shitshow. I wouldn&#39;t wish it on my worst enemy and there are many people I despise. There is nothing crueler than dementia.My mom is suffering through dementia right now. We did something similar. We made photo albums, and went through them every day, until my mom stopped responding to them. Within a couple of years, she forgot who we were, or she would mix up my sister for her sister.After 7 years from her diagnosis, she no longer talks and she no longer responds to me. My sister is taking full time care of her, and she is cleaning her several times a day because she&#39;s incontinent. My mom recently has stopped swallowing. She also seems to have contracted a mild case of COVID, and my sister has been self-flagellating herself because she felt guilty about it. I of course told my sister there&#39;s no reason to feel guilty, everyone is getting it and it&#39;s something everyone will deal with, especially my mom. I secretly wish it would take my mom&#39;s life to end her misery.The worst part in the first few years were her lucid moments. During one of those moments she wrote a letter to God, asking to die, because she knew something was wrong but she didn&#39;t know what. We found the letter hidden in her dresser. Every time I think about it, I burst out in tears, even now. It&#39;s disgustingly cruel for someone who spend her entire life sacrificing her life for her kids and family, and asking nothing else.So when articles like this come out, it is extremely difficult to contain my contempt at any stories that don&#39;t paint the picture exactly how it is: a complete and utter shitshow. It&#39;s unfair for the victim and it&#39;s unfair for the caretakers. And it&#39;s extremely expensive and almost impossible to keep your loved one living in a modicum of dignity."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve also built a simple and small (99sqm) PassivHaus in Romania, 5 years ago. Everybody, and I mean everybody from family to friends called me nuts, but I&#39;ve got my payback this winter when the energy prices went trough the roof and I&#39;m just slightly affected.The house is elevated from the ground on 12 concrete columns so that I can insulate under the foundation beams using glass foam, insulation on walls is 30 cm of EPS graphite, underfloor 45 cm EPS and on the roof, 50 cm and the orientation is full on south. For heating it consumes about 1500-2000 kWh per year (December, January, February and a maybe a small part of March)What is the big difference between houses built in North America and Europe is that the European houses are built using concrete and masonry which give them a lot of thermal mass which is crucial to this kind of builds.Have a look here [0], this is the first PassivHaus in my area and is nicely documented.
The cost of building a PassivHaus in my country typically goes about 20-25% more than a traditional one.[0]: http://www.sdac.ro/site/archives/category/passivehouse"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While this is at the extreme end of the spectrum, there is a much easier way to save lots of energy: just build modern well-insulated homes.I lived in California and I was appalled at the monstrous energy waste: houses are generally made pretty much from cardboard. You need to cool them in summertime and heat them in wintertime, and the energy expenditure is enormous.I now live in Poland and have recently built small homes that are similar in structure to the ones in CA: wooden frame, drywall inside. But the ones here have walls that are 25cm thick because of insulation (mineral wool) and use advanced modern membranes as well. Together, these things do wonders, and maintaining warmth in wintertime using a heat pump (AC) is easy and doesn&#39;t cost an arm and a leg.In other words, you can get 80% of the benefits with 20% of the effort — just design thicker walls with insulation and use modern materials."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People fail to appreciate how much leveraged financing affects the design of houses. If you pay 100% for a house and you decide to build something only you appreciate using 10% of your budget, you will lose 10% of your investment when selling the house. If you put down 20% and have the bank finance 80%, then the same decision will wipe out 50% of your investment. This means for financed houses, &#34;resale value&#34; becomes the preeminent decision affecting the design of a house.In Economics, this is known as a &#34;Keynesian Beauty Contest&#34; [1] where your job is to predict what everyone else predicts will be the most popular option and Keynesian Beauty Contests can get weird.eg: It&#39;s quite possible that you might personally hate granite countertops but still feel the need to put a granite countertop in your home because you believe it will help the resale value of your home. It&#39;s quite possible for everyone in a community to all hate granite countertops but for everyone to still put granite countertops in their home because they believe everyone else loves granite countertops. It&#39;s quite possible for everyone in a community to hate granite countertops and to know that everyone else hates granite countertops and still make the economically rational decision to put a granite countertop in their house to help with the resale value.A lot of &#34;economically irrational&#34; housing decisions are driven by this core transformation via Mortgage Backed Securities of a house from a consumption based purchase of a place to enjoy living into an investment asset that dominates most people&#39;s finances.It&#39;s only in houses built for the independently wealthy that don&#39;t really care about the future resale value of their houses that a lot of the good building science expertise still lies. That&#39;s why, paradoxically, in countries much poorer than the US/UK/Aus/NZ, you see much better building quality because their finance systems are also less developed.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_beauty_contest"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Naturally, large range uncertainty increases the ambiguity of position, but the relative position of the satellites also matters. If they aren’t well spread, the exactness of calculated location also suffers.(see the excellent example in OP)Fun tidbit, the resulting error is known for the system in closed form as Geometric Dilution of Precision, and is a 3x3 (edit: or 4+x4+ if you are estimating bias or quantities like time, thx brandmeyer) matrix that depends on all the locations of the visible sats, and your position relative to them.GDOP is a general relationship for any estimator based only on the equations used to derive something from sensor remote sensor measurements. It&#39;s possible to derive GDOP for any sensing system using the Fisher Information Matrix (which is the inverse of GDOP). Some minor caveats apply, but in general this is a useful trick.FIM is worth learning if you want to get into sensing &amp; estimation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_informationAnother fun thing: FIM can be derived a number of ways, and appears if you simply ask (mathematically) &#34;What is the most likely position of the gps sensor given sat locations&#34; as the hessian matrix of the system that you use while answering that question using e.g., convex minimization.All of sensing &amp; estimation is just mostly convex optimization."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is very nice. Very clear, and the 3D interactives are excellent at guiding the explanation.One thing that I thought was a little confusing was right at the beginning, when we were estimating the position of the figurine and there was an area of uncertainty shown by the yellow circle.It isn&#39;t clear how you&#39;re estimating position, and why we have an area of uncertainty. At first I figured it was going to explain it using triangulation (measurement of angles) but there&#39;s no reason triangulation wouldn&#39;t be exactly as accurate as the tape measure method on a 2D surface, so wouldn&#39;t explain the area of uncertainty.The description merely says:&gt; Just by using these three reference points we can relate the figurine’s position in the environment to an approximate placement on the map as show with the yellow shape on the right.I worry that having this ambiguity so early on might put some people off from reading the rest, because they figure they don&#39;t understand that and so won&#39;t understand the rest of it."</p>

Extremely dirty tactics.1. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29955893"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They&#39;re framing it as a choice between child safety and encryption. I think everyone on HN knows how utterly stupid that is, so I won&#39;t belabour the point.However, what offends me, and I don&#39;t see mentioned enough, is that the UK government is exploiting the real suffering of children to destroy something that protects us all, children and adults alike. They do not speak for those children or their families. They&#39;re exploiting them and their trauma for political gain.If I was in the U.K., this would be enough to forever turn me off the ruling Conservative party. It&#39;s disgusting. They have no morals. It&#39;s not just that they&#39;re lying -- every political side lies all the time, sometimes out of necessity. It&#39;s that they&#39;re re-victimizing the very kids they claim to be protecting. And they appear to be proud enough of that fact to promote it in this way.I will never vote for a politician or party that&#39;s OK with that, no matter what their other policies may be."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We should be a bit less naive about what this play really is. There is a talking point I&#39;ve observed in some of my more progressive circles that &#34;nerds aren&#39;t the good guys anymore,&#34; as managerialists see principled people who demand facts, evidence, logic, and reason as an obstacle to their maintaining control of &#34;The Narrative,&#34; which is whatever absurdity authorities and their toadies use to demonstrate their alignment.This campaign has nothing to do with protecting children - especially given the UK establishment&#39;s veritable tradition of both organizing and covering up industrial scale sexual abuse - and it is nothing more than hate speech designed to cast aspersions upon and isolate technologists as part of a broader political effort.The Rolling Stone article from earler this week said, &#34;The Home Office has hired the M&amp;C Saatchi advertising agency — a spin-off of Saatchi and Saatchi, which made the “Labour Isn’t Working” election posters, among the most famous in UK political history — to plan the campaign, using public funds.&#34;I would encourage HN readers to recognize this campaign is only nominally about encryption, and mainly it is about politically attacking the credibility and reputations of civilian technologists, and by conflating your expertise with abusers this M&amp;C Saatchi agency has produced literal hate propaganda against you. (just following orders, surely!) I&#39;d recommend people to not underestimate what this is."</p>

I could also swap out the ipad for a laptop, non-ipad tablet, or a collection of cute succulents should I desire it.snark aside, I&#39;m a bicycle guy and I really like that we have an ecosystem of bluetooth trainers and apps that all work pretty well with each other. Simulating hilly courses is actually really useful and has made me a better rider, so it&#39;s not like I&#39;m advocating being a total luddite. While I prefer to ride outdoors in the sun, my area in Iowa is extremely flat and the only difficulty comes from the wind, and I find the new toys are a lot more fun than a dumb trainer with a sufferfest DVD.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This would be more fun in a blog post. Twitter is a fucking horrible format for a complex analysis of special relativity.That aside, my favourite quirk from relativity is this:  &#34;The more you move in space, the less you move in time.&#34;

Like relativity in general, it sounds simple enough, but it&#39;s consequences are profoundly shocking. (That is, if you take the time to understand it, and don&#39;t leap to the conclusion that you know relativity better than Einstein or Penrose ;)Take the case of two people on Earth, one stationary and one travelling past in a car. They each have a different reference frame, and a different set events which make up their present. Now imagine that there is an alien government in Andromeda debating a possible invasion of Earth. In the reference frame of the person on Earth who is moving, the debate is still going on. But, in the reference frame of the stationary person, it is a day or so later in Andromeda, and the invasion fleet is already on it&#39;s way! In nature there is no absolute reference frame we can call base reality, and both observers reference frames are equally valid. Then the outcome of the invasion debate is a foregone conclusion. How can there be any room for free will in the deliberations of the alien government? This is the crux of the Andromeda Paradox and the Reitdijk-Putnam-Penrose argument.BTW:  &#34;Notice that neither observer can actually &#34;see&#34; what is happening in Andromeda, because light from Andromeda (and the hypothetical alien fleet) will take 2.5 million years to reach Earth. The argument is not about what can be &#34;seen&#34;; it is purely about what events different observers consider to occur in the present moment.&#34;

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneityEdit: If you know of any serious alternatives to the 4D spacetime/ block universe theory then I would love to read it. Rescuing free-will from the jaws of spacetime would be cool!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the topic of special relativity, I wholeheartedly recommend recently published &#34;Unusually Special Relativity| by Andrzej Dragan (https://www.amazon.com/Unusually-Special-Relativity-Andrzej-...). It starts from basic high-school mathematics but covers many paradoxes and puzzles. Some might challenge ordinary students, who know the formula but didn&#39;t stretch their minds on &#34;what if&#34; questions. It includes cases where velocity is higher than the speed of light - as there are a few caveats on &#34;nothing can travel faster than light&#34;.Also, this &#34;velocity addition for v&lt;&lt;c&#34; is covered in the first chapter.I read its draft almost 20 years ago (back then, it was a collection of notes in Polish) and didn&#39;t find anything remotely close to it in English. Later, I had the pleasure of attending his course.Also, Andrzej Dragan is a notorious individual, primarily known in photography (https://andrzejdragan.com/). To the point that there are posts on &#34;how to Draganize a picture&#34;."</p>

And for a while, it seemed like the direction of travel was towards a global system of thought based on a widely distributed factual, rational approach.But in the last ten years, something seems to have arrested this direction of travel and reinstated local bubbles of thought, insulated from outside challenge.Cryptoscams are the perfect (but not only) example of a self-sustaining shared consensual delusion. They don’t talk to the outside world. So much so that something like this happens. They are living inside a pre-rational info-bubble which has budded off from reality and floated away on its own wind.We are not just dealing with scams and fools here.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to work in ontologies, and what I learned is that people would rather get an 80% heuristic solution for dirty data rather than a 100% correct solution for data they have to clean.The big job sites have resume parsers that work well enough from a PDF or Word doc, and then they don&#39;t have to worry about you forgetting a close tag or a mandatory field. Sure, stuff gets lost, but they get 80% of a billion resumes rather than 100% of a million of them. They can&#39;t exchange data or even trust what they have, but it&#39;s good enough for them to make money. Meanwhile, a competitor demanding good data from its clients never gets off the ground.Anyway, every data format for human information ends up being either vague (to allow in everything) or impossible (see the myths that programmers believe about names, time, addresses, etc.) You end up giving a string for each field... Then give up, just accept any string, and hope for the best.Everybody wants Google or some machine learning solution because the formats never work for the information people want to convey. Better solutions could exist but the hacky ones are first to market, in a natural monopoly where there really only needs one good enough product.If you think a lack of a good resume format is bad, look at electronic health records. Those are far more important to be correct and exchangeable, and even there the cleanup effort is always enormous."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is!
https://jsonresume.org/But nobody really uses it for data interchange. I use it to render my resume in new layouts now and then.Although, it does let style dictate content sometimes (some templates force you to have dates down to the day for job start and end dates, etc.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A link to the actual research paper would be helpful.In this experiment, what amount was given to the treatment group that received basic income? How often? How does that amount compare to the cost of living in their city?&gt; ‘It’s sometimes said that people will sit around doing nothing if you give them free money.’I’m not an academic, so take this with a grain of salt.If my job requires menial labor or involves getting berated by customers (many retail jobs), personally I would absolutely not work.My spouse worked for the state government as part of a benefits/disbursement program. She took phone calls from benefits recipients. Some who are disabled, on unemployment, or generally within the states bar to qualify for tax payer aid.The pay was slightly above minimum wage. My spouse quit after about a year, during which my souse constantly suffered from verbal abuse and even callers who didn’t qualify threatening to murder my spouse unless they received cash from the state.My point is - there are plenty of jobs where you absolutely will quit and not work if the basic income can provide a sufficient substitute.I’m not making an argument against basic income. I suppose it’s sad that we as a society treat a significant number of people, even in developed countries, without a shred of dignity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;They simulated the reward structure of different forms of social security in an experiment. ‘We got people to do a task on a computer,’ says De Kwaadsteniet. ‘In multiple rounds, which represented the months they had to work, they did a boring task in which they had to put points on a bar. The more of these they did, the more money they earned.’&#34;short term experiments done in a lab&#34; seems to be psychology&#39;s equivalent of &#34;in vitro&#34; (aka. in a test tube). I&#39;m not really sure how you can draw any conclusions about someone&#39;s lifetime behavior, using a experiment that looks at the behavior of people sitting at a few hours at a computer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Multiple studies of where basic income was tried in the real world found it to reduce work.For example, &#34;Manitoba, Canada experimented with Mincome, a basic guaranteed income, in the 1970s. In the town of Dauphin, Manitoba, labor only decreased by 13%, much less than expected&#34; [1]. There are plenty of others.I expect a targeted need use of scarce resources (tax money) is a much better use for helping those who need it, instead of ham handedly giving it regardless of need, thereby shorting those who need it at the benefit of many who do not.And the current inflation (and previous events where govts gave out decent sums of cash to help short term other econ issues) shows what happens when people get money for free - prices rise to absorb it. The reason being if person X is willing to put in pain Y for product Z, this does not change if you rescale the meaning of money.Product Z simply rises to cause person to put in the same pain to obtain it.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income"</p>

He was nearish to seven foot, and in his opinion, didn&#39;t have a big enough stomach for the task.
As a young man he&#39;d been a skinny pole. During a university science lab he had discovered he has an extraordinary ability to taste tiny concentrations of chemicals, somehow this information got passed on to an ice cream factory, and he got a summer holiday job tasting the ice cream for traces of the &#39;wrong&#39; flavour e.g. could he still taste coffee after the line had been switched form ice coffee to strawberry. The story went that over three months of eating ice cream all day everyday, he blossomed into a ripped Adonis, and subsequently with his new athletic physique become a windsurfing champion. (yes there is such a thing as a windsurfing champion) But eating ice cream is not the universal delight you and I assume it is. It was a subjective ordeal, a long torturous slog, long days of spoon upon spoon. At the end of the summer, the now champion, couldn&#39;t face another bucket and began the lifelong search for something he could endure eating in quantities to satisfy his metabolism"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I knew a guy once with a milder version of what appears to be a similar syndrome. We worked together, and he would go out for lunch and wolf down a whole large pizza. Afterwards, he would get very hot and sweaty. He was not particularly tall and skinny as a rake. He wasn&#39;t an athlete, had a sedentary job, yet he was eating 2-3 times normal calorie intake, maybe 5-6K calories/day at least.  In all other respects he seemed a normal guy, who to my knowledge did not eat toddlers. There was clearly some medical reason for what was going on, but since he seemed normal in other respects as far as I know he never went to the doctor about it. I&#39;m not medical and have no idea what his syndrome was, but I wonder if it could have had something to do with his mitochondrial functions. See https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/shilling-for-big-mitoc... I&#39;m not suggesting Tarrare was taking a drug that hadn&#39;t been invented yet, but that possibly he naturally had a natural version of the mitochondrial permeability syndrome that DNP induces."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The `gvpr` tool in graphviz deserves more recognition.Graphviz, at its core, is a simple graph description language (DOT), which allows progressive enhancement, and a bunch of auto-layout tools where some double as renderers.The double-duty of the layout/renderers masks GraphViz&#39;s true power, which is that you can create a pipeline modifying your graph source (confusingly referred to as &#39;.dot&#39; files), progressively adding attributes.This is where gvpr comes in. While most are familiar with GV&#39;s all-in-one layout+rendering tools like `dot` or `neato`, gvpr is a generic Awk-like programming tool that iterates over nodes and edges. With it, you can implement any layout algorithm you like (or not!), to specify part or all of the attributes of your graph (like positioning and style), to then be rendered using `dot` to the format of your choice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve used GraphViz a number of times and highly recommend it as a standard tool on your belt. Having a stand-alone executable that can export to SVG is great.The most complex thing I&#39;ve done with it [1]: a tool (MIT-license) that builds diagrams of the data and addressing pipeline for a DSP processor, and lets one &#39;scrub through&#39; the assembler code frame by frame and see the values propagate through the blocks.Also PlantUML [2] uses it for most diagrams.Getting layout and positioning the way you want can be tricky but is usually achievable with patience and hidden objects.[1] https://github.com/paphillips/DFB

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had an unusual experience this weekend while I was sick. After laying around for 2 days with brain fog, I woke up early Sunday morning and watched TV, checked social media, etc, but was sick of consuming information and had the strangest feeling that I wanted to work on something productive but my body aches wouldn&#39;t let me concentrate. I also felt like.. playing video games? I haven&#39;t had the urge to play video games since my first semester of college in 1995 before I discovered partying and dating.I was bored.It finally hit me that I haven&#39;t been bored in over 25 years. I&#39;ve been hopeless, exhausted, overworked, financially destitute, depressed, burned out, lost in countless ways. But never bored.Now, I meditate often, I&#39;ve learned a great deal about the higher self on neurodivergent TikTok, and I&#39;m mindful of my contribution in service to others. But I can&#39;t really emphasize enough how much this shook me. I&#39;m still processing it.I wonder if getting life goals done could be as simple as carving out large blocks of time where you aren&#39;t allowed to work on them. I don&#39;t mean filling the time with something else like work or other obligations. But literal you-time, with a rule that you can&#39;t exert yourself in any way or you&#39;ll risk relapsing into nonprogress. This is more like transmuting one form of attentive energy (negative) into another (positive) by dwelling on the opposite thing than you&#39;re used to.For example, I perceive every stoplight as being red. Since I started commuting a half hour to work a few days per week, I&#39;ve been bringing coffee. Now I find that I never get a chance to drink it, because every light is green."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The goal is to have moments of clarity where you’re able to see “ah that’s what’s going on in my mind right now”.I think this is valuable advice, and it applies not only in this productivity context but in any day to day situation.I feel worked up, angry, disappointed with those around me in certain situations. Whereas 5 years ago, I might get worked up and complain about all of it to my manager, I’ve learned to recognize my own emotional state. I feel X because of Y reasons.In 30 minutes after I’ve had a snack or maybe just a glass of water, I’ll feel significantly better and will want to take back anything I say now. Not because I’m wrong or that what someone did or didn’t do is actually right, but because I need to control my emotion and how I respond. There’s a correct way to approach the problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As of lately I&#39;ve found a useful insight in the opposite direction: getting &#39;in the zone&#39; is never instantaneous. Just like many other activities (e.g. social, or sport), you can&#39;t go from 0 to 100 just like that.And that transition period sucks. Your brain was over-stimulated and now has to focus. It&#39;s crying like a child who&#39;s been deprived of his favorite toy.It sucks and there&#39;s no way around it. But: being aware of it is liberating! If you remain aware that starting work is painful, you won&#39;t be waiting for a later moment where it will magically become more enjoyable.Best of all, the hard first few minutes are just that, a few minutes. Maybe 10, which again are painful, because one is under-performing and mentally dispersed. If you are aware of the transient nature of this state, it will be less frustrating.Embrace the suck."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve read this book and taken this course twice, and it is easily one of the best learning experiences I&#39;ve ever had. Statistics is a fascinating subject and Richard helps bring it alive. I had studied lots of classical statistics texts, but didn&#39;t quite &#34;get&#34; Bayesian statistics until I took Richard&#39;s course.Even if you aren&#39;t a data scientist or a statistician (I&#39;m an infrastructure/software engineer, but I&#39;ve dabbled as the &#34;data person&#34; in different startups), learning basic statistics will open your eyes to how easy it is to misinterpret data. My favorite part of this course, besides helping me understand Bayesian statistics, is the few chapters on causal relationships. I use that knowledge quite often at work and in my day-to-day life when reading the news; instead of crying &#34;correlation is not causation!&#34;, you are armed with a more nuanced understanding of confounding variables, post-treatment bias, collider bias, etc.Lastly, don&#39;t be turned off by the use of R in this book. R is the programming language of statistics, and is quite easy to learn if you are already a software engineer and know a scripting language. It really is a powerful domain specific language for statistics, if not for the language then for all of the statisticians that have contributed to it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some caution with cloudflare:Because they give a lot away and post blog posts attacking AWS folks think they are cheap. But a lot of their free stuff may be in the marketing budget. The issue here is:1) Their paid offerings for their core product, CDN, does not have a public pricing guide. That&#39;s a BAD sign if they claim to be competing on price. So we can pretty safely assume their paid service bandwidth charges are NOT the 80X cheaper than amazon despite their claims here.2) They hype their bandwidth alliance. I tried following this up on Azure, it&#39;s basically all call a sales person / maybe you&#39;ll get a deal type stuff. Smoke and mirrors again.3) If you actually try to use their CDN to serve something high bandwidth (games / software updates / video streaming) that is going to violate some type of clause which says that the free CDN is not REALLY unlimited.4) Financially they spend a mind boggling amount on sales costs. Between sales costs and cost of sales I think they are negative relative to revenue.BTW - If you try any of the other &#34;free&#34; and &#34;unlimited&#34; providers (for $5/month etc) you will also find out once you try to move some real data volumes (video etc) - it&#39;s all a lie over and over.Same things with geo issues. Cloudflare claims to have &#34;one&#34; price globally. These are almost alwyas false claims. It&#39;s easy to test - setup a stream into a high cost area, stream a bunch of video there - you&#39;ll usually get a call over some tricky TOS issue they pull out.In short, if you want pay and forget, there is a reason the big cloud players have a business still."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I also spent quite a lot of time during the Windows 10 preview phase, and a while after release, diligently reporting bugs, and voting on well thought-out feature requests. But after noticing that none of these bugs ever got any attention, and how the Feedback Hub was mostly just noise, I started to wonder why I even did free work for a multi-billion dollar company, on my own time. Right around that period I switched to Linux and now only use Windows for some games that absolutely won&#39;t work on the former. This way I no longer care how bad the UX of the system is, and how many bugs there are, as long as my games launch."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Former MSFTy, don’t bother wasting your time giving feedback. Nobody cares, those that cared left. Microsoft has a weird culture, very top down, very passive aggressive between departments. For a brief while I would diligently prepare bugs for the dog food software. I would even walk over to visit people responsible for it and chat about it. Even for software where ‘zero bugs’ was important they’d just delete a whole bunch of bugs and see if any bounce (come back). Eventually people get sick of refilling so they get to zero bug bounce by exhausting the very people trying to help them.Enough social media pressure may end up risking a line item in a PMs yearly goals. So that might get looked at.Even the some of the most backward laggards (e.g. government departments) are sick to death of Microsoft and have long been introducing policies that all new software has to be web only.Those pointing to Azure as the future should known that they have very aggressive sales who often vastly oversell to customers. Customers aren’t renewing at the same level. Plus I don’t see them being able to compete with Amazon long term. You can only buy Skype for the bundled government customer so many times."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I once even spotted a Microsoft employee who took the time to raise their concerns on the public tracker:That is just incredibly exasperating to see. When even MS employees are being forced to &#34;bend over and take it&#34;, you&#39;d think there would be some sort of &#34;find the people responsible for this shitshow in the Windows team inside MS, and keep emailing them to fix it&#34; protest. That one employee he noticed seemed to have concluded his comment with a rather sarcastic thanks directed toward someone who might be one of the responsible?On the other hand, what I can find in the news about internal protests at MS are all seemingly SJW-ish topics, and absolutely none about the quality of the products themselves. I think that alone says a lot about who&#39;s working there and what they actually care about doing --- which is clearly not improving their products. The people who do care about that are being heavily outnumbered, and perhaps a lot of them have already deemed MS to be unsalvageable and left.I can&#39;t believe the incredible amount of reality distortion they must have in order to spew forth marketing BS like https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28753528 with a straight face."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is basically what Strong Towns harps on: the infrastructure for super low density development is extremely costly relative to how much &#39;stuff&#39; you&#39;re building the infrastructure for.Initially it&#39;s not so bad, because it takes decades before you need to do replacement-level repairs/maintenance, but eventually it catches up with you. Some cities escape it (at least for a while) by building even more or by simply having a fantastic economy, but the ones that don&#39;t...it&#39;s not pretty."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems like the root problem is that the way property taxes are assessed doesn’t actually line up with how much demand a given development puts on the city for services/infrastructure. Property taxes are based on, “how much would someone else pay for this”, which isn’t the relevant metric from the city’s perspective, it should be, “approximately how expensive is this property to service year by year, including eventual replacement of infrastructure?”If you did it that way, low density developments would pay their true costs, and would become more expensive to the ‘end user’ and thus less popular. And if they didn’t, well, they&#39;re paying their true costs anyway, so problem solved."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I saw a few articles like that on Strongtown. They make for a good story but frankly economically they do not make sense for me. In my surburban town with pretty big lots, school taxes are 2/3 of property tax and things that are more expensive in surburban setting than in the city (roads, sewer, electric, gas hookups) are something like 10% of taxes.Even in this story, city currently spends 3.2M/year maintaining the roads. City has 15k housing units so city currently spends roughly $200/house on roads. It&#39;s $16/month. Author thinks city actually need to spend 4.2M - this is $280/year per house which is only $23/month. That&#39;s really not much even if cost need to be doubled. Hardly unaffordable. This is per dwelling - not even per person and does not count that commercial buildings pay more so residential rate is even lower.Electric/water/sewers generally pay for themselves thru user fee - I think average is $20-60/month/house for sewer/water in US and electric is thru usage fee. School busing in rural setting is probably a bit more expensive but is still rounding error in overall school budget.Everything else - school, governance, police, fire are probably about the same in rural areas and in the dense city. SF is a shit city with 15k/year spending per person and most rural/suburban areas are much nicer on a fraction of that spending.Overall rural lifestyle does not cost much more than the city in infrastructure costs - and I did similar calculations for previous strongtown articles. On a feeling level it make sense that dense city should be cheaper but reality is frankly it&#39;s not.US cities has a lot of problems but frankly cost of maintaining roads is not the  thing that will bankrupt them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"All I want in life is a Linux distro with a package repo full of meticulously reworked &amp; reconfigured packages that make all the keyboard shortcuts across the entire system and every application be like and be as consistent as my old Macs.I&#39;ve been full-time Linux (Kubuntu) for a few years now, and I&#39;ve hobbled together something that only irritates me to death about 30% of the time rather than the 100% of the time it used to before spending days and days fiddling with a bunch of different flavors of remapping at nearly every layer of the system.If I&#39;m ever fabulously wealthy, I already know I&#39;m just going to finance an open source fastidious spiritual successor to MacOS 10.6I&#39;m going to give Pop_Os a try, but I suspect I&#39;m going to run into the same problems I always do. The trouble with Linux as a desktop for me isn&#39;t weather it&#39;s beautiful or not. The problem is how disintegrated everything is and the thousand papercuts ways in which it works.That said, I absolutely consider it basically an incredible miracle that the experience is as good as it is, frankly. So, I keep at it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t say much about the MacOS side of things (I do use a Mac at my day-job, but only because the choice is Mac or Windows, no Linux option). But as far as PopOS goes... I&#39;ve been using it full-time on my personal laptop for several months now, and I&#39;m very happy. Surprisingly so, you might say.Why &#34;surprising?&#34; Well TBH, I always looked at PopOS as kind of a niche / oddball thing, along with any other distro that exists only because a device manufacturer is pushing it. I had assumed that when I got my System76 box I&#39;d immediately install Fedora or something. But when it got here I felt too lazy to do that on &#34;day zero&#34; so I figured &#34;Aaah, heck, I&#39;ll keep this PopOS thing around until I get some spare time, then I&#39;ll do a reinstall.&#34;  Fast forward 6+ months now and I&#39;m still running PopOS and am pretty happy with it. It mostly &#34;just works&#34; and I have access to basically all of the same packages as Ubuntu so everything I&#39;ve needed to install (modulo a very small number) has been right at my fingertips, a quick &#34;apt install&#34; away.Net-net, if anybody out there is thinking of trying PopOS, I&#39;d encourage you to give it a whirl. Note: I am not associated with PopOS or System76 in any way, aside from being a System76 customer. I have no financial stake in this discussion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently installed Pop_OS on a new Workstation and wanted it to look and feel like MacOS as much as possible. It&#39;s surprisingly easy.

(The NRC says the same)There was a large amount of hand-wringing about the risk of avalanches and other natural disasters that were extremely low probability.They were skimpy on interesting details about the reactor such as &#34;What do you do if the sodium coolant catches on fire?&#34;  (e.g. sodium burns in water,  sodium burns in air, sodium burns in carbon dioxide)  There are good answers to that in the U.S. and Russian experience.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The classic Rickover quote, from the 1950s:An academic reactor or reactor plant almost always has the following basic
characteristics: (1) It is simple. (2) It is small. (3) It is cheap. (4) it is light. (5) It can be built very quickly. (6) It is very flexible in purpose. (7) Very little development will be required. It will use off-the-shelf components. (8) The reactor is in the study phase. It is not being built now.On the other hand a practical reactor can be distinguished by the following
characteristics: (1) It is being built now. (2) It is behind schedule. (3) It requires an
immense amount of development on apparently trivial items. (4) It is very expensive. (5)
It takes a long time to build because of its engineering development problems. (6) It is
large. (7) It is heavy. (8) It is complicated.The tools of the academic designer are a piece of paper and a pencil with an eraser. If a
mistake is made, it can always be erased and changed. If the practical-reactor designer
errs, he wears the mistake around his neck; it cannot be erased. Everyone sees it. The
academic-reactor designer is a dilettante.&#34;Little that’s happened in the 60 years since suggests Rickover was wrong.&#34; -- Kennedy Maize, 12/30/2014, Power Magazine contributing editor."</p>

Micro-reactors like Oklo (1.5 megawatt electrical output per unit, compared to 1000+ megawatts for Generation III reactors currently being built) would be hard pressed to produce electricity suitable for an industry that seeks globally-cheapest prices. Announcing a &#34;20-year commercial partnership&#34; to supply 100 units to a mining firm, before they&#39;ve built a single unit, is optimistic to the point of recklessness.The Oklo founders [1], Caroline Cochran and Jacob DeWitte, have no industrial experience, according to their LinkedIn profiles. They met at MIT while TA&#39;ing and went straight from graduate school to founding Oklo.I just don&#39;t think that Oklo knows what they are doing.[1] https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/28/oklo-planning-nuclear-micro-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something I&#39;ve been thinking about lately is how browsers have essentially become a dependency for any sort of auth on the internet. Pretty much everything uses OAuth2, which requires you to be able to render HTML and CSS, and in many implementations JavaScript.That&#39;s ~20M (Firefox) to ~30M (Chromium) lines of code as a dependency for your application, just for auth. This applies even if you have a slick CLI app like rclone. If you want to connect it to Google drive you still need a browser to do the OAuth2 flow. All of this just so we have a safe, known location to stash auth cookies.It would be sweet if there was a lightweight protocol where you could lay out a basic consent UI (maybe with a simple JSON format) that can be rendered outside the browser. Then you need a way to connect to a central trusted cookie store. You could still redirect to a separate app, but it wouldn&#39;t need to be nearly as complicated as a browser."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the idea of this. There&#39;s so much information on the web, but we still need a way to bring that information to other applications, without being tied to a particular source. That was really the dream of the semantic web, after all.This kind of idea would be really nicely paired with good Microformats[1] support, which continues to be a very good idea. That way we can find, say, a recipe or an address on a web page in a reusable way and without needing magical heuristics.(Of course, &#34;reusable&#34; in theory, with the caveat that everybody forgot about microformats around when Google decided they could machine learn their way out of everything).[1] http://microformats.org"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow! I actually love the idea of being able to interact with websites via a standard API rather being forced to use web-based UI they provide. It opens up a whole lot of possibles for things like alternate clients, standard UIs for interacting across multiple sites, etc. Also eliminates the possibility of sites engaging in annoying or abusive behavior by putting users in full control of the client rather than the site operator. Obviously it can&#39;t work for every site, but it&#39;s quite the interesting concept."</p>

I cannot imagine Honda or Toyota shipping a car without a brake pad.  I can&#39;t imagine Ford or GM doing it either.  I&#39;d be down into the &#34;Uh... I think I&#39;ve heard of you once...&#34; non-western car manufacturers before it wouldn&#39;t surprise me.Then, the absolutely horrid service center experience of &#34;Oh, no, you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about, that&#39;s normal, and we can&#39;t fix it any time soon anyway&#34; is just absurd.I know Tesla likes to rag on the horrors of the dealership model, but, seriously, I can&#39;t imagine getting this treatment with a legacy automaker.  Not that I worry about them forgetting to put pieces in, either."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I picked up my model 3 long range in december also and it was also missing parts. Mine was missing USB ports in the center console and the wireless charging pad for the phone. When i questioned them about they tried to lie about it and said that my phone was the problem. I demanded to speak to the manager who admitted right away that the car was indeed missing a part and that they would fix it later. My front bumper was also scratched and missing paint. They fixed that by replacing the entire bumper. Buying from them is a nightmare."</p>

It&#39;s incomprehensible how could anyone who has some experience with cars say that such sound, while breaking, is normal. If I was Elon, I would seriously question whoever at Tesla had said so.

The latency of applications on the blockchain is atrocious. But more recently after learning from and interacting with people building in the space my assessment changed. There is an interesting intersection between tech, communities, and economics.  There exists a transparency in the open-source code of smart contracts that will disrupt the current gatekeepers like the internet did.Certainly, there are problems, but some things will live beyond the crash that is coming and change things in ways no one can be sure of. The internet started in the 1960s and was opened up commercially in 1989.[3] It feels like we are somewhere between 1995 and 2000. The energy feels similar with people trying to shove old paradigms into a new world, vaporware companies, and insane investments. I don’t think we’ve seen the top and it will likely make the crash of 2001 look small by comparison.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; All that to say, a lot has changed in the technology world in the past six to twelve yearsIt sure has. But not really that fundamentally, since 2009.A lot has changed in the blockchain space too. Just because you don&#39;t know about it doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t true. A lot of those changes are on par with some of the tech advancements mentioned before my quote in the article. In 2009, you had bitcoin, so basically a distributed consensus workaround that enables artificial scarcity of fungible digital items. Today, you have sharded blockchains, triple entry bookkeeping, proof of stake, blockchains that handle incentivized file storage, alternate name lookup systems, purchasing compute power on an automated order book, liquidity pools (a major, major fintech advancement if you&#39;re not familiar with then), arbitrary code execution with a canonical record of it.It is absolutely still early days.Because these are decentralized consensus networks, there&#39;s inertia. Bitcoin is never going to be cutting edge. Because there&#39;s a lot of money to be made, there will be scams. Most of the &#34;cutting edge&#34; isn&#39;t cutting edge at all. But there are some real developments happening, allowing novel use cases, enabling very interesting things to be done.I&#39;m not a fan of the whole web3 concept. I think 99% of the selling points that the charlatans hype every market cycle are nonsense. But a little digging beyond an animated JS bloat landing page (a red flag all it&#39;s own) and you can quickly figure out what projects potentially have something and what&#39;s bullshit. Or you can do what I do and assume a project is a scam until proven otherwise."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So first off: Very cool. Amazingly polished, and self-hosting! Especially since it looks to be an actually-independent project with POSIX as an optional compat layer.I feel like the features that are unique are mostly in 3 groups:1. Features that shouldn&#39;t be unique to this system. Tabbed windows have occasionally happened on other systems, and probably should become more common, and there&#39;s no reason it shouldn&#39;t work on other systems. I hope this inspires other people to copy;)2. Features that only work if you have really tight integration or different primitives than most OSs are using. Programs updating file name when you rename from the file manager, or the file manager showing when files are open... might be possible to graft on to other systems, but it&#39;d be a right pain. Even systems like MacOS are going to struggle - the whole OS is under one company that could do cross-functional stuff like that, but any time it touches applications you need external developers to support it and that may or may not work out.3. Features that are possible, but nobody else does it because it&#39;s impractical - possibly only impractical from their starting points, though.  Showing total size of subdirectories is expensive on ex. Linux because you have to walk every file recursively. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re just eating the cost because they haven&#39;t hit a case where it matters, or if their system actually makes it cheap (I could easily imagine a filesystem that moved the calculation cost up front)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"So many interesting/fascinating concepts and ideas that will remain relegated to niche communities because of basically one problem: lack of drivers. This is the problem that must be solved if we ever want to move away from the dominance of a few OSes &#34;too big to fail&#34; and their million compromises to a thriving field where competent programmers can create new OSes as easily as now they can create new apps."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Love it, feels like browsing the web about 20 years ago. (Or a few bad websites now…)So this is an example of Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)[0]. It is a metric (coined and named by Google) which indicates how much “movement” there is during the initial render of a page, caused by reflowing the layout. Ideally you have very little or none of it for better UX. I believe it can have an impact on organic search ranking and potentially ad rank.The most common cause is images included without width and height attributes, therefore the page has to reflow after the image has been downloaded.Other things that can cause it are multiple css files overriding each other and loading slowly, or JavaScript effecting the layout after it has loaded.You can use Google Lighthouse [1] to measure this (and other things) on a site.0: https://web.dev/cls/1: https://web.dev/measure/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"An extremely useful hidden gem in Rich is its `inspect` function [1].When called on an object, it pretty prints a list of its public attributes (though you can also request private and dunder attributes) [2]. It can also be called on a class or function; it&#39;ll then pretty print the docstrings, parameters with types, methods, etc. It&#39;s great for debugging and for starting to code with libraries you&#39;re not familiar with, don&#39;t have comprehensive documentation, or have some dynamic aspect.In a similar vein, `objexplore` [3] is another library that lets you dive into an object&#39;s nested attributes to understand how it&#39;s laid out.In interactive debugging sessions I often find these to be more useful than the IDE&#39;s features which provide similar functionality.[1] https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/init.html#ri...[2] https://i2.paste.pics/798cff2903f6b3351289a24c839d4f44.png[3] https://github.com/kylepollina/objexplore"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks really cool, but after I first learned about Automatic Content Recognition and all the ridiculous anti-privacy things these smart TVs do, I adopted a policy: A TV is a big dumb monitor, that&#39;s it, and it never ever gets internet access. So, for better or for worse, all of my TV needs go through an Apple TV, and I block Apple&#39;s 17.0.0.0/8 for that client just in case it wants to get a little too chatty about my habits with Apple.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To anyone considering switching to an induction hob and hearing anecdotal stories of how some people don’t think they are “as hot” or “slower” than gas. I guarantee these are all related to the pans being used. It is of upmost importance that you get a really good set of pans “designed” for induction.We have found “tri-ply” stainless steel pans work really well, better than on gas. Cast iron is also brilliant, I inherited loads of them. We have aluminium none stick frying pans with solid stainless steel bases, they work well.Aluminium pans without a solid steel base are absolutely crap on induction - even the ones that say they work. Avoid them.If you have any pans with a slightly curved base they won’t work. And you will have to get a Wok with a flat bottom designed specifically for induction.Make sure you read reviews before you purchase any new pans, and if you are changing your hob to an induction one be prepared for replacing your pans - budget to spend more on them than the hob even.We are absolutely converted to induction, love it and will never go back. Planning to one day get rid of the gas boiler too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My wife and I decided to switch to induction after the NYT article on this topic a few months ago.Not only did we have a gas stove that was probably spiking NO2 levels when we actually used it; we also seemed to have a gas leak. It was not a big one, just a faint smell, but it was hard to pin down. A plumber concluded the connection between the range and the pipe wasn&#39;t the problem. No specific part of the range smelled stronger than the rest of it. For all we knew, it might be a hole in a pipe. So we wanted to make gas stop flowing through our unit (a condo within a three-family home, very normal here in Cambridge, Massachusetts) altogether.We contacted an appliance company about switching to induction. To prepare, they told us, we would first need to upgrade the range power outlet to 40 amps, and cap off the gas pipe behind the range.The electrical work cost $1800. It could have been much more; we were lucky our circuit breaker was positioned such that they only needed to make two openings in our walls. (They suggested we put little hatch doors in those spots to make future work easier.)We asked our plumber to not only cap off the gas pipe behind the range, but also put in a valve in the basement, such that gas flow could be shut off to our unit, but also easily turned back on if a future owner wants to reverse what we did. We did this rather than turn off our gas altogether, because we have a gas water heater and still needed gas available there. The plumbing work cost about $300 I think.To make cooking stay as close as possible to being how great and fast it is with gas, we chose a range with an induction stove: The LG LSE4616ST, which cost $3000.We were lucky to be able to afford this change for our health. Of course, it would have cost a lot less if we hadn&#39;t cared about induction, but still multiple thousands of dollars.We should be subsidizing conversions like this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Gas in general may cause incidental gas pollution —but I see a problem by the author.  The author mentions high pollution results when cooking —which for the author does using a gas range. However the author doesn’t discuss results from alternate ranges.  I have an induction stove and every time I cook the indoor air pollution also spikes (lots of frying).  It’s likely less than that caused by gas stoves but never the less creates pollutants in the air.I have no doubt that gas causes more pollution but they are remiss for not mentioning the cooking process itself causes pollution."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Simple.css is a well done classless &#39;framework&#39;. I stumbled on it a while back and started using it and thought this can be my go-to styles for tit-bits of websites that I do for landing pages, family websites etc. However, this is pretty opinionated (including some animations) and I had to abandon it. But I remained inspired by its simplicity and forked my own[1] broke it down. I broke it down to the most basic, but then can be built on top of it -- progressively get a website &#34;designed&#34; far enough but not further.If you are into these simple classes, check out Drop-in Minimal CSS[2] and choose the one that fits your need.Simple.css is from an interesting guy, Kev Quirk[3], whose 512kb[4] website was on Hackernews a while back (don&#39;t recollect if it was a story or a comment). Hi Kev, if you are around.If you are spinning up a simple website with classless styles, perhaps it is a good idea to add a print styles and I like Gutenberg[5] for that.1. https://oinam.github.io/oinam-jekyll/2. https://dohliam.github.io/dropin-minimal-css/3. https://kevq.uk/about/4. https://512kb.club5. https://github.com/BafS/Gutenberg"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Creator of Simple.css here.Thanks for all the feedback and comments here, folks. It really is appreciated.I’m not a professional web designer - this just started off as a personal project that I ended up publishing as people I shared it with seemed to like it.I’m taking on board the various feedback from people much more knowledgeable than I here, again I really appreciate it.If you do have feedback/changes I’d urge you to log an Issue or a PR on Github[1].Also great to see so many other minimal CSS projects that I wasn&#39;t aware of. I’ll have to add an alternatives page to the site, I think.[1] https://github.com/kevquirk/simple.css"</p>

 * It&#39;s hard to turn a notebook into an assertive test.
 * Converting a notebook function into a python module basically involves cutting and pasting from the notebook into a .py file.These must be common issues for anyone working in this area. Are there any guides on best practices for bridging from notebooks to applications?Ideally I&#39;d want to build a python application that&#39;s managed via git, but some modules / functions are lifted exactly from notebooks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Excited about this and have been a big fan of iPython since when I started coding in Python well over a decade ago. Might be a little while for switching to v8 due to the minimum 3.8+ version requirement for Python (which I totally understand from an ease of maintenance and forward looking mindset for the iPython projet). I use it all the time as my go-to REPL in Pycharm. Thanks to the team for all the work on it!As an aside, I really wish the VSCode team did more to integrate iPython REPL more seamlessly into VSCode as that is one of the big blockers for me to using VSCode for anything Python related."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Jupyter notebooks are a favorite among our data scientists. However, we have gone back to plain python scripts for our bigger projects due to a simple reason - one must keep alive the notebook page while running lengthy experiments on a remote server. Due to some rogue windows updates we had a couple of destroyed experiments, which (as these things go), happened at a very inopportune moment.OTOH for quick experiments notebooks are great, although I feel like the more modern the GUI the farther back we go in terms of experience. The latest updates to visual studio code&#39;s Jupyter extension for example have turned this into a thoroughly frustrating experience for the visually impaired - gray-on-gray-on-gray text and even more gray and transparent thin lines that are supposed to clearly mark where a cell ends and where the output begins. Unfortunately no amount of fiddling with the color scheme could fix these &#39;design&#39; choices..."</p>

He had a character called &#34;Harvey Richard, Lawyer for Children&#34;. I linked a couple of examples [1], [2], [3], [4] but the satire, IMO, is incredible. It lampoons humanities proclivity to layer pseudo-rationality onto the irrational things that we do.It also reminds me of the TV show &#34;The Wire&#34; when Stringer Bell, a senior member of a street drug distribution ring of urban thugs, forces them to conduct their meetings using Rules of Order. [5] If you watch to the end, you see that in those circumstances order means nothing, it is just a facade.I guess you could say that I&#39;m cynical about the prospects of such a court and I tend to see the underlying truth in the satires that point it out.1. https://www.gocomics.com/tomthedancingbug/2015/02/262. https://www.gocomics.com/tomthedancingbug/2014/12/253. https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/545850417313484171/4. https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/178807047675716661/5. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO1zxPRRf4g"</p>
