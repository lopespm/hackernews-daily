								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As an owner of a Video Production studio, this kind of tech is blowing my mind and makes me equally excited and scared. I can see how we could incorporate such tools in our workflows, and at the same time I&#39;m worried it&#39;ll be used to spam the internet with thousands and thousands of souless generated videos, making it even harder to look through the noise.A fun related experiment, I thought it was fun to see what kind of movies AI would generate, so I created a &#34;This Movie Does Not Exist&#34; website[1] that auto generates fake movies (movie posters + synopsis). It basically uses GPT-3 to generate some story plots, and then uses that as a prompt (with in-between steps) for Stable Diffusion. Results may vary, but it definitely surprises sometimes with movies that look and sound amazing![1] This Movie Does Not Exist: https://thismoviedoesnotexist.org/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I want to see is a model that can generate 3D models for use in applications such as Blender. It would provide a good starting point for someone with talent to make beautiful. Or just save people like me time for making games."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s mind blowing is that you can extrapolate where this is going to go. Eventually, you will be able to generate full movie scenes from descriptions.What&#39;s interesting to me is how this is so similar to human imagination. Give me a description and I will fabricate the visuals in my mind. Some aspects will be detailed, others will be vague, or unimportant. Crazy to see how fast AI is progressing. Machines are approaching the ability to interpret and visualize text in the same way humans can.This also fascinates me as a form of compression. You can transmit concepts and descriptions without transmitting pixel data, and the visuals can be generated onsite. Wonder if there is some practical application for this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It’s cool to see this on HN.I originally wrote this article for a “microcourse” I ran at the University of St Andrews—aimed at a non-tech background—on building a personal webpage. Especially in mathematics, having a personal site (that you control) to host research and other information is pretty invaluable!Older personal math sites tend to have a very particular “historic” feel. While I personally have a lot of nostalgia for the look, I also think it’s good to take advantage of some of the newer tools that are available today!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really nice, focused write up.  Very useful and to the point.HTML is really very accessible to someone with basic computer skills. It&#39;s a shame that a standard business website is now a facebook page.There is a local gym near me with a static HTML webpage, hosted on local ISP web hosting.  It&#39;s quick to load, responsive and always up to date. Checking the opening times, address and special events is much easier than on some aggregator site or google maps (which is often out of date).  It&#39;s also very easy to read on many devices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My personal approach might be too simplistic for some, but this is what I did for my webpage, though I already had some HTML &amp; CSS experience:&gt;No website generators, no frameworks, no nothing (not even JavaScript)&gt;Just design the site on the go through some trial and error using vim, CSS and HTML documentation always at hand&gt;A single .css file to style the entire website--I even threw in some cool animations, which took a while to get right, admittedly&gt;Publish it through GitHub Pages in under five minutes&gt;If I want to upload a new blog post, for instance, I just make a copy of an existing one and manually edit the content, then push it through git after I&#39;ve edited the blog index accordinglyReading terms like &#34;static site generator&#34;, &#34;content management system&#34;, &#34;templates&#34;, &#34;analytics&#34; or &#34;deployment&#34; gives me an instant headache, especially since it&#39;s so easy to open your favorite text editor and design your own website by hand, so to speak. I&#39;ve self-hosted eepsites, gemini capsules and many other sites this way and the process wasn&#39;t remotely as contrived as some approaches I&#39;ve seen out there for publishing a personal blog"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bought an expensive LG Oled a few months back and was quite annoyed that every time my kids would turn it on, they were greeted with an ad depicting Peter Griffin in a thong lying on a beach. It was crass intending to be humorous; typical Seth McFarlane fare. The ads on the home screen are a very worrisome indication of where smart consumer products are headed. This root is cool, but I accomplished what I needed by blocking all the LG ad URLs in my router. You can find the list by some simple Googling."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Around June-July 2021 LG started rolling out updates which added some minor mitigations that broke our original exploit chain.It&#39;s a damn shame companies feel incentivised to do this.People hacking on their own TVs is quite literally a victimless crime (besides yourself, if you brick your one TV), because you knowingly void the warranty.Mazdas have a great third-party firmware called Mazda AIO Tweaks[0] that fixes a whole host of bugs and allows you to customize the infotainment system. The best part is you can use it to enable Android Auto on older Mazdas (this was before AA was even released for Mazda!)Mazda then proceeded to lock down the firmware so much you now need to take apart some consoles and attach a serial connection. Disgusting behaviour.(vis-a-vis plugging in an SD card with the scripts you want to run.)[0] https://mazdatweaks.com/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The most incredible thing here is that this demonstrates a level of 3D understanding that I didn&#39;t believe existed in 2D image models yet. All of the 3D information in the output was inferred from the training set, which is exclusively uncurated and unsorted 2D still images. No 3D models, no camera parameters, no depth maps. No information about picture content other than a text label (scraped from the web and often incorrect!).From a pile of random undifferentiated images the model has learned the detailed 3D structure and plausible poses and variants of thousands (millions?) of everyday objects. And all we needed to get that 3D information out of the model was the right sampling procedure."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"the servers inside Iranian data centers still have access to the outside world.Knowing that, the simplest and easiest solution that would avoid detection is to SSH tunnel into that datacenter and SSH-ProxyForward out of that datacenter into Amazon AWS via SSH and use that SSH proxy chain as a SOCKS proxy for browsers.  Make sure the browser is using the SOCKS proxy (SSH) for its DNS.  Many sites will make your friends solve captchas if they show up from Amazon so if you have a friend outside of Iran in the same AWS region that is willing to open SSH on their home router then one could add that private home router as their last hop in the SSH proxy forward.  Do not go directly from the datacenter to the home.  It is normal and expected for Datacenters to SSH to Amazon.SSH Client -&gt; Iranian Datacenter / Server -&gt; AWS VM -&gt; Home router in same region as AWS -&gt; Internet.If many people are using the same server and VM then make sure that MaxStartups and MaxSessions have been increased in sshd_config as well as any PAM limits on the servers for open files on every node in the path.  Clients should enable ControlPath / ControlMaster in their ssh_config or ~/.ssh/config.  To harden each hop configure PermitOpen to only allow the SSH hops and the final hop should also permit *:443Examples of all these steps can be found on SuperUser  / StackExchange / ServerFault and are all public knowledge.  All above-board, no hacking involved.[Edit] Removing the Squid MITM SSL-Bump proxy idea.  That would make follow on questions harder to explain.[Edit from Fatnino&#39;s input] If your Amazon VPC&#39;s are too outbound-restricted then pick another VPS provider that is commonly used for hosting 3rd party tools for datacenters, preferably one already used by that datacenter.[Edit] In theory hypothetically speaking every hop possible could have misconfigured but realistic looking syslog so that SSH connections are not logged on the server and in theory a log-less silent rule in the edge firewall to not log SSH connections.  Sometimes syslog disks also fill up by mistake.  SSH can also be performed in ephemeral diskless containers such as Docker, Podman and LXC."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish you the best of luck.When similar events unfolded in Syria, people created redundant social networks of fake Facebook accounts.  This seemed to work well.  When captured and tortured, people would hand over credentials for one account.  People would detect that network was &#34;burned&#34; and move to the next one.This gave the officials very little information, since the accounts did not reference real names, and locations were obfuscated.  High risk private messages were deleted, etc.The key to this working was that Facebook was not sympathetic to or cooperating with the Syrian government, and accessing Facebook was a common (not worth prosecuting) infraction.I&#39;d be worried that they will fingerprint / honeypot tor infrastructure, then round people up.  The existence of the tor client or connection logs basically proves guilt.Friending facebook accounts with cutsey names is much less incriminating.  Edit: Also, any honeypot proxy connection logs just show that you used https to access facebook."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Signal is setting up proxies so users in Iran using Signal could update their proxy settings in the app to bypass the block for that at least. Not sure to what extent things are being blocked, but if you can get connections to SOME outside services, this might help people to organize means of communication. The proxies are also setup by people outside of Iran and it doesn&#39;t really matter if someone in Iran leaks a proxy address, new ones can be setup in minutes. Look for the #IRanASignalProxy hashtag on twitter/other social media and ask people for the address. Signal also made a guide to help users set this up on Ios/Android - https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360056052052-Pr..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s sad to me how successful people have been sanitizing the internet.The whole point was to be decentralized, and now we have Visa, Mastercard, Apple, Google, Amazon and Cloudflare deciding what we are and are not allowed to see, read and buy.  And virtually in lockstep, they are becoming increasingly prudish.I&#39;m curious if this could be addressed with laws that force companies to either be utilities or publishers.  If you&#39;re a publisher, you take liability for your content and can edit it at will.  If you&#39;re a utility, you do not take liability for your services, but you cannot pick and choose which customers you service so long as it&#39;s legal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t tell one way or the other if people have forgotten that SESTA/FOSTA passed in 2018.All of this is consequence of that law working as intended (not as described; it&#39;s supposed to stop human trafficking, but those supporting it made no bones about their position that if it chilled all online pornographic content, they didn&#39;t care).All of these companies pivoted hard because hosting previously-legal content may now be a federal crime, and nobody wants to get dragged through the mud of that legal case. Until and unless that changes, this is the new status quo in the United States (and therefore, much of the Internet).Matt on Tumblr seems to have missed that even if a company does all the things on his list, their owners could still end up in prison if they are aware that any pornography on their sites was &#34;facilitating sex trafficking,&#34; which is an extremely broad category (is someone using racy pictures as advertisement for face-to-face meetups? Oops, go to jail; Section 230 protections were specifically stripped out for that case and if it violates state law in the state you&#39;re operating in, the state the poster is in, or the state the viewer is in, you&#39;re now liable as the site operator!)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This mentality change goes far beyond porn. A decade ago comment sections like Slashdot and Hacker News were almost unanimously in favor of keeping the internet as unregulated and open as possible.Now it seems like every headline about social media companies attracts a lot of comments demanding regulations, restrictions, and laws to crack down on... something. Even here on HN it&#39;s common for threads about Meta to devolve into a lot of angry calls for Facebook to be &#34;banned&#34; for kids or for lawmakers to step in and regulate.Meanwhile, journalists and politicians love to amplify stories about tech companies doing harm to kids. Allowing, or even encouraging, something like porn on your platform is an open invitation for these journalists to put you in their sights. No company wants to be the most lax company in the space, so it&#39;s a constant game of companies tightening their standards."</p>

It&#39;s kind of hard to attribute these things to ignorance, but there&#39;s been a notable shift in perception among developers.. It used to always be about &#34;tricking&#34; the result out of the computer by applying deep understanding of both system and problem to find the fewest, most performant steps required to yield the result.30 years ago, nobody in their right mind would have thought &#34;du&#39;h, I&#39;ll just recursively scan whatever directory THIS environment variable points at and then apply whatever this library does to each file in it to get some list and then extract the files I need from that list&#34;..Even IF you had to do such a terrible and expensive operation, you&#39;d at least have the good sense to save your result so that you can do it more efficiently the next time.."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Alternative hypothesis: (brace yourselves) people don&#39;t care enough. Any vendor will prioritize requirements, if performance is not in there, that CPU and memory is going to be used if in any way it helps the developers. Conversely, by looking at a system you can infer its requirements.For commercial airplanes it may be safety first, ticket price second (passenger capacity, fuel efficiency) and speed third. For most software, functionality, signing up for a subscription, platform availability etc are usually prioritized higher than response times and keyboard shortcuts.Game devs worry a lot about latency and frame rates and professional software care a lot about keyboard shortcuts. This proves (anecdotally) that performance isn&#39;t unacheivable at all, but rather deprioritized. Nobody wants slow apps but it&#39;s just that developer velocity, metrics, ads etc etc are higher priorities, and that comes with a cpu and memory cost that the vendor doesn&#39;t care about."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got obsessed with this paper recently, to the point where I have read most of the &#34;Unknown Air Force Document&#34; that Thompson references with giving him the idea of Trojan horse. The document was later identified and is declassified and publicly available [1].&gt; If one reads the original paper, one only finds a description of this attack as a thought experiment, leading one to conclude that any claim of a real-world attack by Thompson was an urban myth due to exaggeration.This is true although Thompson gives some tantalizing hints in the paper.In the introduction, he writes &#34; I would like to present to you the cutest program I ever wrote.&#34; So he definitely wrote it and at least played around with it.Later on in the &#34;Moral&#34; section, he writes &#34;The moral is obvious. You can&#39;t trust code that you did not totally create yourself. (Especially code from companies that employ people like me.)&#34;This appears to be an admission but not quite strong or direct enough to validate he implemented and used the Trojan horse so it is great to read this post.[1] https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/publications/conference-pap..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Amazing to reflect on how much goodwill Fastmail has cultivated with me just by being a reasonably priced, full-featured, competent-support-having service. I&#39;m unlikely to ever do anything with the Fastmail API, but I still upvoted mainly because I&#39;m enthusiastic about the company."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Started the transition from Gmail to FastMail at custom domain yesterday. Presence of an API was definitely important (though I probably should have tested it out during the free trial).Had some initial buyer&#39;s regret for no reason in particular (did the 3-year plan for the best price and assuming prices will go up over time), but already feeling really solid. The web client is very snappy, documentation is good, able to import my Gmail messages, contacts, calendars, and even filters in a snap (though imperfectly). Looking forward to seeing how the API compares with my Google API scripts. Definitely seems to be more knobs and buttons for power users (more powerful filters, regex, etc.).While not relevant to FastMail per se, also really glad to finally start the painful process of migrating decades of accounts to my custom domain email, where I hope it will stay forever. Growing concern about the (admittedly slim) possibility of losing access to my Gmail account was a big motivator, as was the recent move to force the Google Apps stuff to a paid plan.So far so good."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apart from Fastmail being amazing for email, they’ve been a great source of customer service to me in several ways. I like to point it out in case people are on the fence and considering a switch. My most appreciated instance was this:Many years ago I was broke and going through rough financial strains. My yearly contract with Fastmail was up and I asked for a grace period. They did it, no questions asked, for 2 months.It wasn’t a thing. When I renewed my contract we settled up and it was all good. It’s been quite a while now and I’m still glad to support them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The folks behind Penpot also make a kanban management tool, kind of like Trello, called Taiga: http://taiga.io/ It&#39;s also OSS (Django/Angular), self-hostable, and very pleasant to use.I&#39;m rooting for both of these, and now that they have some funding I hope they&#39;ll dedicate effort on polishing the rough edges (and do something about the gratuitous amount of white space that permeates all of their web presence, and maybe reconsider their color palette to be less muted and more saturated, heavier, and decisive). They seem to be actively working on Figma imports, auto layouts, multi-user edits and more at this moment so they&#39;re on the right track.For both of them, even if the VCs pull the rug from underneath to race for an exit, it being OSS is good insurance. A fork would mean that we don&#39;t have to spend time learning yet another tool. The good will fostered by it being OSS is what encourages some of us to look into their offerings, and in this way what we see is something that seems like a sustainable model for OSS projects."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Disclaimer - I work for Figma but had no part in the acquisition. My comments are my own and I don&#39;t represent Figma.Technically I&#39;m very curious to see how Penpot evolves with this investment, especially in regards to their choice to base everything on SVGs. IMO this will be their greatest superpower and also greatest weakness. Keeping things tied explicitly to code means exporting the final product is going to be near-perfect translation wise, but it will also mean they&#39;re tied explicitly to the browser&#39;s ability to render the combined html+svgs.Currently Penpot&#39;s performance starts dropping rapidly once you approach around 1000 layers. Most robust design systems I see run around 10-40k layers (with the record I&#39;ve seen being 250k). I&#39;m very curious if they&#39;ll be able to optimize their approach to support those sizes of libraries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Before September 15, Penpot’s CEO and co-founder Pablo Ruiz-Múzquiz said that sign-ups were growing at around 40% per month: after Adobe’s news, that figure ballooned to 5,600%, and has stayed consistent since then. On-premise deployments have also grown 400%.5600%! Good for them. I&#39;m sure a lot of it was folks exploring options but I wonder how many of those new users will stick around -- anyone try it out and decide to make the commitment to use Penpot as a full replacement? Anything it still needs / hesitations?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"First, thank you to the poster for posting this - I haven&#39;t laughed this hard in a while.Second - thank you to the person who actually made this.  This is incredibly hilarious (just based on the project I&#39;m gonna go ahead an assume they have an account here :) )Lastly - I know that this is a joke project, but one thing I&#39;m not understanding: how does the system read the current state of the chess board?  The, er, Bluetooth/WiFi &#39;output&#39; of the system is clear enough, but I&#39;m not clear on how the current chess board is input into the system so that Stockfish can actually compute the next move.(This is a semi-serious question - if you know I&#39;d be curious to find out, but I&#39;m not gonna lose sleep over this and I don&#39;t expect anyone else to waste time on it either :)  )"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Morse code for the classical chess notation is actually pretty inefficient (12ish bits of data). Often times the actual viable moves are vastly reduced. With your own custom entropy code and custom symbol table, you could massively reduce the transmission time.E.g.- 1-4 bits for the piece class to move.- 3 bits for the column of the destination- 1-3 bits left over for disambiguation. E.g. ColumnThat&#39;s perhaps a bit too much optimization for a troll project. But fun nonetheless."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The interesting thing I learned about this is that the big names in chess all agree that they don&#39;t need to be told what move to make. In a recent interview Magnus Carlsen said:&gt;    The people who get caught are those who cheat in a really obvious and stupid manner. The problem was that he [i.e., a player caught in 2016] was not good enough to see what would’ve made sense.&gt;    Had I started cheating in a clever manner, I am convinced no one would notice. I would’ve just needed to cheat one or two times during the match, and I would not even need to be given moves, just the answer on which move was way better. Or, here there is a possibility of winning, and here you need to be more careful. That is all I would need in order to be almost invincible, which does frighten me.So all you need is a buzz or maybe two - &#34;caution&#34; and &#34;opportunity,&#34; &#34;defense&#34; and &#34;offense&#34; or whatever.The difficult part is getting the game state to the device. In streamed games this can be done with a medium amount of trouble but in non-streamed OTB games you&#39;d need the player or a confederate to be silently inputting moves for the engine to respond to. Not impossible but... difficult. Nevertheless, when the prizes are in the hundreds of thousands, people may try to find a way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ll always celebrate stories like this, but I also don&#39;t take some kind of anti-AWS lesson from it.This company saved $800k/year. Perfect time to go in-house with this solution.But when they were 1/10th this size, they&#39;d only have saved $80k/year. Does that cover the cost of the engineering to build and maintain this system? Maybe not. And when they were 1/100th the size, it would have been laughable to go in-house.At the right time, you make the right transitions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They don&#39;t mention at all what services they were using (other than slight mention of S3) which makes it very hard to respond to this. If you are running everything on EC2 then you are going to have a bad time (especially if you aren&#39;t using reserved instances).AWS (IMHO) shines with the various services they provide (S3, Lambda, CloudFront, API Gateway, SQS&lt; SES, to name a few). AWS is a game of trying to reduce your bill and often that means using AWS-specific services. If you want to stay completely &#34;cloud agnostic&#34; you are going to paying more than buying into a &#34;cloud&#34;, in that scenario then you absolutely should be looking at dedicated servers. AWS is great because you can bring existing software and just run it in EC2 (or their container stuff if your software is containerized) but the AWS magic comes from using their managed services (also spinning up/down EC2 instances as needed, but if you are running them 24/7 then consider alternatives or at least pay for reserved)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dedicated hosting providers.I&#39;m so amazed that somehow people completely forget that for literally decades, web host provided dedicated hosting options at fantastic prices.Yes, loooong time ago - to get your dedicated server might have taken a few hours to provision and the instant server access that AWS brought should not be discredited.But large numbers of web host today allow you to programmatically spin up a dedicated web host instantaneously and at a fraction of the cost."</p>

F that web and F that creator. If I have to (webshop etc) I usualy just enable (2) which works most of the time. (3) is basically only for special webs like banking etc which is just PITA to debug as you have to be logging in constantly etc.Websites today are just full of unnecessary crap and are downright unusable when on slower connection like 3G. Most of the webs now require your browser to download 2M of JS to have &#34;slide out menus&#34; or some other stupid stuff. uBlock is a must, because without that you will run out of data plan almost instantly.And to make things worse, Chromium-based browsers will make adblocking much harder with Manifest v3.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The sentiment here on HN is to never connect the TV to the Internet and instead use a digital media player or external streaming device. I wholeheartedly agree. But then several people mentioned wanting to update the firmware. If you&#39;ll never connect it to the Internet, then you should never update the firmware either. It goes against conventional wisdom, but updating the firmware in this situation is more likely to cause problems than to bring you desired improvements.The firmware update might have stricter DRM controls; it could have a tricky new way to exfiltrate data out via your streaming box; maybe the firmware update itself contains some static ads; perhaps in the near future we&#39;ll have public wifi or free Google community wifi, and the new firmware will have the smarts to use that and bypass your wifi.And these days, once you update the firmware, you often cannot revert back to earlier firmware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just give me my Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime, HBO Max,...All of which are available on an AppleTV, and I assume other less-intrusive devices. TFA comes to that conclusion in the last paragraph, but just in case anyone didn&#39;t make it that far. And then, as everyone on this page is going to say, never let that TV anywhere near a network connection. Why anyone would go to the effort of dicking with a pi-hole cat-and-mouse game is beyond me. Plug in a box, remove network access to the TV, watch your shows....even if it duplicates all the streaming app functionality in the TV itself.I don&#39;t know, Samsung&#39;s fuckery aside, does anyone seriously think that using the duplicate app on the Samsung is going to be anywhere nearly as pleasant a UX as the AppleTV? IOW, use the AppleTV (or Roku, or whatever) regardless just for the better experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I own this exact model -- the QN90A, though in a smaller size -- and have had exactly the same experience.The most maddening advertisement is the one that is forcibly inserted in the menu between the apps and the settings. Using the remote, you must literally click past an ad to switch inputs.You ... must ... click ... past ... an ... ad ... to ... switch ... inputs. Every time.Unbelievable for a TV that costs this much. I almost returned it, but as the author notes, the alternatives have worse picture quality and often aren&#39;t any better in the ad department."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s really amazing how DALL-E missed the boat. When it was launched, it was a truly amazing service that had no equal. In the months since then, both Midjourney and Stable Diffusion emerged and got to the point where they produce images of equal or better quality than DALL-E. And you didn&#39;t have to wait in a long waitlist in order to gain access! They effectively gave these tools free exposure by not allowing people to use DALL-E.Furthermore, the pricing model is much worse for DALL-E than any of its competitors. DALL-E makes you think about how much money you&#39;re losing continuously - a truly awful choice for a creative tool! Imagine if you had to pay photoshop a cent every time you made a brushstroke. Midjourney has a much better scheme (and unlimited at only 30/month!), and, of course, Stable Diffusion is free.This is a step in the right direction, but I feel that it is too little, too late. Just compare the rate of development. Midjourney has cranked out a number of different models, including an extremely exciting new model (&#34;--testp&#34;), new upscaling features, improved facial features, and a bunch more. They&#39;re also super responsive to their communtiy. In the meantime, OpenAI did... what? Outpainting? (And for months, DALL-E had an issue where clicking on any image on the homepage would instantly consume a token. How could it take so long to fix such a serious error?) You have this incredible tool everyone is so excited to use that they&#39;re producing hundred-page documents on how to get better results out of it, and somehow none of that actually makes it into the product?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apparently sign ups are currently down because of a &#34;vendor outage&#34;. Perhaps because of the increased load?Once you&#39;re able to get access, I believe you&#39;ll receive 15 credits per month for free. Each credit allows one generation, and each generation produces 4 images.Rather than using up credits trying to learn how to formulate your prompts, I ran hundreds and uploaded them to https://generrated.com (I posted it a couple of weeks ago as a Show HN) — hopefully they might be useful as a starting point and save you some credits/money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The divide between SD and DALLE doesn&#39;t matter for anything meaningful. The tech is advancing at a breakneck speed. I really cannot emphasize that enough. If SD is behind today, I wouldn&#39;t even be the least bit surprised if it&#39;s ahead in one month from now. Or be where DALL-E is today and DALLE just be that much further.I suspect that even in 6 months from now people will be starting to see consistently good generation from &#34;worse&#34; prompting. The cat is out of the bag on this and running way faster than anticipated. Hold on, because the &#34;AI generating fake media&#34; thought experiment of the last decade has now officially gone live."</p>

It has clickable links and basic forms, that&#39;s all. It was made for documents, not apps. If you want better than that, you have to rewrite it all by yourself, or more likely, import a framework that does it for you. Traditional Windows apps all use system provided common controls, because they are good, and therefore they have a consistent look and feel, even through OS updates. It is even user customizable. Now it is not uncommon to see 10 different styles in a single screen, Windows since 8 is not even consistent with itself, and it is becoming worse every version.

I haven&#39;t noticed it much in practice, but I&#39;m persistent, use copious ad blocking, and my Google-fu is strong, so I usually find what I&#39;m looking for.Image search is another story. I&#39;ve been less and less satisfied with Google Image search results, and visual search has been totally neutered. It only returns low res results that rarely match the original as well as it used to. I used to be able to plug in a 400x400 image and find a dozen copies of it at a usable size. No more. Too many copyright complaints, I assume. I&#39;ve started using Bing for image and visual search now. It&#39;s not as good as old Google Images, but marginally better in some cases than the current iteration."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google Image Search is deteriorating in certain areas for years. Namely:* Reverse Image Search (sometimes no matches although image is for sure out there). I wonder if Reverse Image search sometimes broken because of copyright?* NSFW images (I&#39;m really old enough and I don&#39;t need to be protected by Google or anyone else, I think it&#39;s a kind of censorship)* And now also Creative Commons as pointed out by OpThe best alternative (tested them all) is in my opinionhttps://yandex.com/images/Chrome extension for reverse image search supporting Yandexhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fast-image-researc...Android app supporting Yandex for Reverse Image Searchhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thinkfree....P.S.: I know Yandex is based in Russia, I only use it for specific image searches and I&#39;m happy we have a good alternative based outside of USA...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The key point here is &#34;... and hardly anyone noticed.&#34;In theory, site reliability engineers and software engineers work together at Google to maintain existing functionality and check for regressions. In practice, regression checks can only cover what they&#39;ve been told to cover, and if breaking a feature doesn&#39;t cause a metric to crash, Site Reliability doesn&#39;t have the information to know something is wrong.The result is that generally speaking, Google prioritizes existing features by how popular they are (i.e. &#34;Maintenance by Popularity&#34;) modulo how much of a stink someone influential can make if they screw it up (i.e. &#34;Maintenance by Twitter.&#34;). If almost nobody uses the CC filter (and I bet, in the grand scheme of things, they don&#39;t), Google may not have enough signal to know they broke the filter unless someone had the foresight to add a metric to check search results on that query separate from the rest of the search result data (and at Google&#39;s scale, you can&#39;t just add a metric for free; in addition to eng-hours to build and tune it, the data has to be stored somewhere and teams have finite budgets for space that can only be grown by negotiation with the relevant teams managing the monitoring services or the project as a whole)."</p>

They&#39;re the same questions over and over with minor variation (sorry to top comment for &#34;impersonating&#34; your comment style). My days are deteriorating from a colorful sphere down to two points. In fact, down to two pointers, left and right, iterating over a list of heights to find how much rain water it can trap.I&#39;m about to repeat the experience for the 10th time and I&#39;m 100% on autopilot. But suddenly, a man reaches out to me on email and offers me up to $80/hr to be his senior engineer. This feels sketchy, my girlfriend tells me, &#34;you&#39;re good but let&#39;s be honest here...&#34;. Anyways, I proceed, it might just be the start of a beautiful thing. I&#39;m asked to interview as one of our developers because English is not their best language. I&#39;m a little bothered, but I was fine with it. But then I see the developer name: Connor Tumbleson. My laughter bursts and so does my suspicion: With a name like that, no way the guy doesn&#39;t speak good English. I look up Connor Tumbleson on linkedin, and my suspicions were proved correct. I detail everything to Connor, and now this is on the top of HN. I lost a opprotunity but gained a story of the lifetime."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This story is much more fun when you come at it from the interviewer&#39;s position. You&#39;ve been doing interviews every week. They&#39;re mostly rejections. They&#39;re the same questions over and over with minor variation. You&#39;re about to repeat the experience for the 18th time and you&#39;re 100% on autopilot. But suddenly you&#39;re in a spy thriller. This is the greatest thing that&#39;s ever happened.Is it a good legal/corporate decision to hide the person who claims to be the original and let him listen to the interview with the other candidate? Holy fuck, no. Is it going to be WAY more thrilling? Oh my god yes; how could you not?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In 1996, my employer got a contract to work with AT&amp;T to build a website that provided regular event updates from the Atlanta Olympics. In 1996, this was a very big deal, such a newish concept that the project was written up in AdAge or some similar industry magazine.A few months later a prospective junior engineer came in for an interview. My manager asked him the typical &#34;tell me about an interesting project you&#39;ve worked on lately.&#34; He then proceeded to describe in detail the very project we had just completed, even referencing the magazine article about it (he must have forgotten he was interviewing at the company mentioned in the article). At the end of his presentation, my manager said &#34;That&#39;s interesting, because here at X, we just completed that project.&#34;Awkward silence. Then the interviewee got up and said &#34;I guess I should go now.&#34; My manager said &#34;Yes, I guess you should.&#34;Impersonation of this sort can be simultaneously disturbing and somehow comical. It isn&#39;t a new phenomenon; I&#39;m not decided on whether I believe the information age makes it easier or more difficult."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I tried using it in Portuguese and it&#39;s cool but it seems very off, just a huge number of things that don&#39;t sound even remotely natural or idiomatic. But when I click the translate button, the English translation is a perfectly reasonable thing to say.SO... I&#39;m highly suspecting that, behind the scenes, the &#34;real&#34; conversation is happening in English, and it&#39;s translating in both directions. Which is always going to be fairly disastrous, particularly with short snippets of conversational text. (In contrast, machine translation does best with long sentences of highly technical writing.)So the concept is very intriguing, but the problem is that it needs to rely on native language models per-language. (Or if it already is, then those models need a vastly better or larger training corpus.)So A+ for proof of concept, but I&#39;d never recommend anybody practice with this in order to learn/practice a language, because with the quality where it is, it will make you a worse speaker -- not better. The things it says are just too weird."</p>

The AI occasionally gets itself into a loop of repeating my question or itself, but I think this has been a problem with a lot of chatbots.

It&#39;s a very popular temple, and you can see the whole area at once)Not only does it know about Kyoto, but it knows about a specific temple (picked it up via speech recognition too). Translations are rough and by me, not quazel.This could be a real game changer if the other languages are this good.Additionally, if you register an account then you get access to the &#34;Scene builder&#34; which lets you set up a situation to start the conversation in.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is great. They mentioned a few months ago their will to open-source it [1] and now it&#39;s finally a reality, so props to Kenton and the Workers team on achieving it!I&#39;ve dug a bit on the OSS repo [2], and here are some of the findings I got:    1. They are using a forked version of V8 with very small/clean set of changes (the diff with the changes is really minimal. Not sure if this makes sense, but it might be interesting to see if changes could be added upstream)
    2. It&#39;s coded mainly in C++, with Bazel for the builds and a mix between CapNProto and Protocol Buffers for schema
    3. They worked deeply the Developer Experience, so as developer you can start using `workerd` with pre-build binaries via NPM/NPX  (`npx workerd`). Still a few rough edges around but things are looking promising [3].
    4. I couldn&#39;t find the implementation anywhere of the KV store. Is it possible to use it? How it will work?

Open sourcing the engine, mixed with their recent announcement on a $1.25B investment fund for startups built on workers [4] I think will propel a lot the Wasm ecosystem... which I&#39;m quite excited about![1] https://twitter.com/KentonVarda/status/1523666343412654081[2] https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd[3] https://www.npmjs.com/package/workerd[4] https://blog.cloudflare.com/workers-launchpad/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Workers are so damn good and easy…I am originally from the PHP/Laravel world, recently had to quickly develop a very simple (5 endpoints) REST API and decided to give CF workers &amp; KV storage a try. In an hour the API was running in production…CF is really, really good at many things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great. The Cloudflare model for Workers really deserves to become a de facto standard that can be pulled off the shelf for open source serverless functions. Really excited they’re opening this up this way.

They were picked up by stations all over the country.It&#39;s clear from the registered seismic waves that the events are not earthquakes.- You can clearly see how the waves bounce from the bottom to the surface. There is no doubt that it was a blast or explosion. We even had a station in Kalix [quite far up north, some 1300 km away] that picked this up, says Björn Lund, who is a lecturer in seismology and director of the Swedish national seismic network, which measures Swedish earthquakes and explosions.Translated and summarized from: https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/svt-avslojar-tva-explosio...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I were a betting man, I&#39;d put my money on Poland.The Polish prime minister immediately called &#34;sabotage&#34; and fingered Russia, while everyone else is still saying &#34;it could be sabotage but we need to investigate first&#34;.Russia wants the taps capable of being turned ON at their discretion, not permanently broken. This hurts their bargaining position in a big way because they&#39;ve just lost their biggest source of leverage against Germany.Poland opened a new pipeline to Norway on the same day as the leaks appeared, so there was lots of Polish activity in the waters.Poland doesn&#39;t receive gas via Nordstream, so damaging it doesn&#39;t hurt them in any way.Poland is Ukraine&#39;s most ardent supporter in Europe, often leading the vanguard of actions to support Ukraine. They&#39;d have a strong motive to ensure that the rest of Europe doesn&#39;t waver in its commitment to keep the Russian taps off.It could be argued that since Europe has already decided to never turn on Nordstream again, the fallout from such an act of sabotage is minimal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t see a mention that today is the day Poland officially opens up its pipeline to Denmark and Norway. The pipeline Russia (and to a much lesser extent Germany) put a lot of resources trying to jeopardize.Some of the things those two countries did include: Financing of various &#34;grassroots ecology groups&#34; that managed to find an extremely important field mouse (no joke!) habitat on the planned route which caused many months of delays in Denmark. Constant media pressure and a smear campaign of lies against PL in Europe and elsewhere. And many more including those we don&#39;t know about. No one is surprised at all that they would blow up their own pipeline to gain various PR points in sympathetic media."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are significantly worst things happening in the industry by much much bigger consultancy names. We, an enterprise, hire complete teams from the consultancy that would pick some of the work in different projects with their own product owner and so on but under our contract.We seldom see all the people whom we interviewed for the teams, as devs, being present in the meetings that they are all expected to be present (of course it is most often the timezone difference that is the mentioned reason). Or people who join have their camera turned off, so no way to see them.Code quality that comes, is not on par with the skillset we evaluated during the interviews and I suspect the whole consultancy is doing something similar with presenting top engineers in the interview and then moving them between many teams. Leaving the less skilled engineer to do the work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been remote hiring for years. Remote positions are a magnet for fraud of all types.If you have the budget, I highly recommend moving your compensation points up and focusing on top engineers in remote locations. It&#39;s much easier to vet people who have an established online track record and you can tap references from well-known companies. Unfortunately this way you will miss out on some great candidates that haven&#39;t yet established themselves, so you still have to branch out.For remote work we require video interviews and cameras on during meetings. We&#39;d make an exception if someone really needed accommodations to keep their camera off for some reason, but otherwise it&#39;s cameras on. I know some people don&#39;t like this, but it improves communication and team cohesion in a noticeable way. It also immediately highlights fraud like this.Get your security team involved. You should be tracking where remote employees access your VPN and company services. Don&#39;t be afraid to ask about discrepancies and changes. If someone has logged in from one IP or region for the first 4 weeks and then suddenly you&#39;re seeing new logins from a different city or country, investigate. I don&#39;t care if people travel, but we need to firmly understand the security situation.Watch out for people with frequent excuses for missing meetings, having to turn their camera off, excuses like &#34;my camera isn&#39;t working today&#34;, and so on. Send everyone known-good webcams and company laptops.And as always, performance management is key. Managing remote is harder than managing in person, and I say that as someone who manages remote and loves remote teams. You need strong performance management practices in place and clear ways to measure it. People who aren&#39;t getting their work done should show up quickly in your system and warrant additional manager investigation.But if someone shows up in Zoom who isn&#39;t the person you hired, lock it down ASAP. Don&#39;t let being &#34;nice&#34; get in the way of handling an urgent security situation. Someone you didn&#39;t hire who hasn&#39;t agreed to your contracts is in your system, and that&#39;s a red alert emergency."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Late last year we had a candidate who seemed really promising: she had a CS degree from an Ivy League school and had a few years of work experience using relevant technologies.She absolutely killed the Byteboard technical assessment, and seemed like a good cultural fit during my initial screen. I advised the technical interviewer that he didn&#39;t need to go too deep; I was satisfied with her answers on the technical assessment. Then something odd happened - she completely bombed the interview. The interviewer told me that she couldn&#39;t even answer the most basic questions e.g. &#34;what tech stack does your employer use?&#34; I was thoroughly confused about that, but still passed her on to the VPE to help us get to the bottom of the discrepancy. Our VPE confirmed the previous technical interviewer&#39;s assessment.We came to the conclusion that she could not have completed the technical assessment on her own and obviously didn&#39;t move forward from there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really like the engineering principles in general that the Go team uses, however, I just don&#39;t like Go. That isn&#39;t meant as a slight or anything other than simply my opinion. That said, I really like the idea of a simple language based on the sort of principles demonstrated here. The runtime seems really nice, I just wish I liked the language better (IMO: not expressive enough, needs better error handling, needs much better enums, needs pattern matching, has error prone C-style &#39;for&#39;, almost everything is statements not expressions, special comments are error prone, has nil pointers, etc.). In the end I think if someone were to write a slightly simpler version of Rust with the Go runtime it might be pretty neat. That said, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d want to drop from Rust so maybe I&#39;m just fantasizing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Love go as a platform.. self contained binaries have been a miracle for ops..but have a few big hangups about using the language full time because of the sucky ergonomics.* No optional/named parameters. Writing a whole function per parameter for function chaining is excessive. This would not be difficult to add to the compiler (i&#39;ve done it and have seriously considered using the fork) but it seems like the team is just stubborn about adding stuff like this.* No default struct values. 0 isn&#39;t good enough in real world scenarios.. have fun writing BlahInit(...) for everything.* Would be nice to get the question mark syntax for error handling. Error handling shorthand for if err != nil would also be very welcome."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks like a recipe for cold solder joints and solder bridges and doesn&#39;t seem like it saves time.What you really want to do when you have dozens of jumper wires is to do an array-of-struct to struct-of-array transform on the steps. Instead of cutting, stripping, tinning, and soldering one wire at a time, cut all your wires, then strip them all, then tin them all, then solder them one by one.Here&#39;s a pro tip: when you tin the wires, lay the iron flat on your workbench with tip out into air and tin by laying the end of the wire on top and then adding the solder.Another pro tip: use a pair of needle nose pliers to bend the tinned leads by a little over 90 degrees to make a little hook. When you solder to the board you can apply a little tension and let the solder flow into the hole. Makes very string solder joints."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh boy, nice idea, but this looks complicated and time consuming. I recommend to get some good equipment first:  - solder fume extractor (see below)
  - extra thin high quality tin
  - a desoldering pump AND desoldering wire
  - high quality flux
  - a TS 100 soldering Iron with KU tip from ali express for 50 bucks
  - optional: USB-C Power Adapter for your existing power supply (so you don&#39;t have to buy one)
  - optional: a soldering mat (normaly blue colored)

and you have a near professional equipment for about $120. Now flash IronOS[1] on your soldering Iron, and it works even better.Instructions:  - turn on solder fume extractor
  - heat iron to 370° Celsius (but be careful depending on your workpiece)
  - Tin both ends beforhand
  - better slightly more flux to put on (but not for small works) 
  - if flux has been applied, cleaning up with e.g. toothbrush &amp; isopropyl alcohol after you&#39;re done maybe a good idea

However, the most important peace of hardware is a solder fume extractor... I&#39;m surprised that so many youtube &#34;professionals&#34; don&#39;t put a hint on this - never play with your health. This can even be done DIY (see youtube tutorials).High quality flux is also important because of your health. Chinese sellers often don&#39;t care about ingredients...High quality tin is much easier to work with and costs 5 bucks more than low quality tin. It is worth.[1]: https://github.com/Ralim/IronOS"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bad advice. Just use a good solder iron, thin solder (possibly leaded), and good no clean flux, then lots of practice. It&#39;s all about timing: too quick = cold solder joint; too slow = burned pad/track, or part. Learn also to understand about thermal mass and how to change the temperature and timings according to what you&#39;re soldering and its size.Also, that iron looks like a Hakko &#34;936&#34; cheap clone: they are barely above the garbage level; get a better one. Used Wellers aren&#39;t that expensive, and no, you won&#39;t need a microcontroller for digital temperature control and all those gimmicks they put in modern solder irons. I also have a PineCil from the same folks that made the PinePhone and was amazed by its quality. Yes, it has a mcu for digital temperature control, but I&#39;d lie if I wrote that I used any of its functions beyond setting the temperature."</p>

Pausing always fixes erratic mode.Given that the “erratic mode” only impacts the beginning of the run and disappears suddenly at known locations, this sounds like an issue of delayed GPS lock.And given that the problem didn’t exist in the past, it could be a software issue due to upgrades. Or it could be a hardware issue that developed over time, such as something impacting GPS receive sensitivity. Or it could even be a new source of RF interference in the GPS range near the author’s start point, which impacts GPS lock until they get far enough away from it.Interesting issue, but note that this issue appears to be specific to this one specific person, not a general issue with all Apple Watches as some in this thread are speculating. I certainly have not noticed this behavior on my Watch even with the latest updates."</p>

Also, it takes anywhere from 1min to couple of hours for data to appear in the Health app.OTOH my wife has ~3 year old Huawei Fit watch, which was about $120, and that thing records every 10-15min or longer nap. Without a mistake."</p>

The Garmin devices are generally much closer together.I wonder if the dual-band GPS on the Apple Watch Ultra is an attempt to fix these problems? I would guess that it’s software, with the author, if for no other reason than I’d be surprised if Garmin were all that much better at putting GPS in a tiny housing than Apple."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; But math never decreed that sine and cosine have to take radian arguments!That is not entirely true. It comes from the relationship between those functions and the complex numbers via the Euler formula.     ix
    e    = cos x   +   i sin x

There may be arithmetic/numerical inconveniences, but that&#39;s not all there is to &#34;math&#34;.Let&#39;s define ncos and nsin (&#34;nice cos, nice sin&#34;) as follows:   nsin x = sin 2πx
   ncos x = cos 2πx

So then what do we make of:   ncos x   +   i nsin x

This has to be   cos 2πx  +   i sin 2πx

which is then     2πix        (   2π) ix        ix 
   e           = ( e   )      =  f 

      
           2π
Where f = e    is a weird number like 535.4916. This f doesn&#39;t have nice properties. E.g.:      d     x           x
      -   f     /=    f 
      dx

Otherwise it works; for instance 90 degrees is 0.25 and surely enough     0.25i 
   f          = i

In situations not involving e in relation to angular representations via Euler, f cannot replace e.I&#39;m all for having parallel trig functions in libraries that work with turns, though.The annoying 2π factor shows up in lots of places though. Should way, say, in electronics, redefine a new version of capacitive reactance which doesn&#39;t have 2πf in the denominator, but only f?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author makes the point that turns allow for exact representation of many commonly used angles, but with binary floating point, many common angles (1/6 of a turn, for example) are inexact.This could be addressed by using a whole number other than 1 to represent a turn ... one that is a multiple of 3 (or 3x3) and 5, and while we&#39;re at it, 2 (or 2x2x2), so most commonly-used angles are whole numbers!  That gives us 360 as the value representing a whole turn."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Indeed, maths never &#34;decreed that sine and cosine have to take radian arguments&#34;. But thinking that makes any sort of point is a fundamental misunderstanding of maths.There are infinitely many sinusoidal functions out there. You can just adjust amplitude, frequency and phase to your heart&#39;s content.Trigonometry basically requires that sine and cosine have specific amplitudes and phases, but gives not one shit about how you map angles to frequency. Degrees are completely arbitrary, but both radians and turns have pretty natural definitions, with turns indeed being the easiest to work with. So far so good.Calculus does have an opinion on frequency, though. There is exactly one non-trivial pair of sinusoids s(x) and c(x) where c&#39;(x) = - s(x) and s&#39;(x) = c(x), among a bunch of other very useful properties.When you put calculus and geometry together, s and c are have the same amplitude and phase as sine and cosine from geometry, and the two pairs are exactly the same if you match the frequencies such that the argument is the angle measured in radians. It&#39;s just so damned useful to use angles in radians and make everything play together nicely."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can relate to the frustration of the author.
I wrote an open source library which gets downloaded 50K+ times per week.
At one point, I hadn&#39;t updated it in several months and people started asking if the project is dead...
In fact, it wasn&#39;t updated in a while because it had been working perfectly and was built in a forward-compatible way; that makes it more healthy and therefore more alive than probably 99% of libraries on the internet.The expectation that software libraries or frameworks should break every few months is disturbing. I think this may be due to the fact that many of the most popular frameworks do this.
I find that React-based apps tend to break every few months for a range of reasons; often because of reliance on obscure functionality or bundling of binaries which aren&#39;t forward-compatible with newer engine versions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; So I had to spend four hours on Saturday upgrading all my platform libraries simply so that I could compile the damn app.I sort of assume this is the actual point? Apple presumably wants to drop support for older versions of the SDKs, and that requires that app developers update to the newer versions. I think you can make a reasonable argument that dumping work on third-party developers to simplify things for themselves is bad, but the author&#39;s belief that it was simply pointless busywork is probably incorrect from Apple&#39;s perspective.I suspect the minimum download threshold to be exempt from this is _very_ high. Maintaining backwards compatibility for a small fixed set of apps doing things an old way is a categorically different problem from maintaining backwards compatibility for every app out there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think culling games/apps based on age is the right approach to improving discoverability.I don&#39;t see Nintendo removing old Switch games from the eShop.I don&#39;t see Apple Music removing the Beatles because they haven&#39;t updated recently.My recommendation, which Apple&#39;s (obnoxious) ad business would never accept, would be to1. Remove the obnoxious and generally useless ads which eat up the top half of the first page of app search on the iPhone.2. Improve app search with more options and a fast, responsive UI. Also they might consider allowing you to consider ratings from other sources such as critical reviews vs. user reviews (a la metacritic.)3. Better human curation with more categories. This is the same approach that Apple Music takes and it seems to work well. Games should have Artist/Studio/Developer pages as well as Essentials lists to facilitate discovery. Same with genre/category essentials, which have a rotating list that can be saved/bookmarked."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A key fact to understand in thinking about cheating in over the board chess: a strong player can defeat a much stronger opponent with just 1-3 hints per game indicating the strongest move.  For example, most chess experts agree that a ~2600 rated player with 2-3 hints at key moments per game would be expected to beat a ~2800 rated player.  Many people might assume that a cheater needs guidance every move, thereby requiring a potentially more obvious cheating mechanism. That is not the case.Also, clever cheating devices have been found in over the board chess competitions.  So, this is possible.  Moreover, one needn&#39;t carry a device on themselves.  A cheater may have accomplices providing hints, if they carry a device.It will be interesting to see how chess tournaments, as well as FIDE, chess.com, and other major chess institutions react to this situation.  The potential for cheating has now been brought to the absolute forefront of chess discussion.  And Carlsen&#39;s actions have been questioned by FIDE in recent interviews, with FIDE staff condemning &#34;vigilantism&#34; of a kind.Some set of resolutions seems necessary--perhaps standards for security in major chess tournaments, perhaps an alliance to share cheating or reliability data amongst major chess operations, perhaps a standard term in major chess tournament agreements that no previously identified cheaters (online or otherwise) will be allowed to play, and perhaps sanctions in some form against Carlsen (or Niemann, if concrete evidence against him emerges)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Imagine you know someone with a history of stealing cars and other valuable objects. He has been caught multiple times. Now you see him with a shiny new car that you’re pretty sure he can’t afford.Did he steal it? Not necessarily — it’s entirely possible that he got a higher-paying legit job and saved up for it, or inherited money from a relative, or got it legally in some other way. He shouldn’t be convicted of a new crime with no other evidence just because he committed similar crimes in the past.However, it would be entirely natural for a reasonable person to assume that theft is the most likely explanation of the facts, and to avoid trusting that person.This is basically what happened with Hans. He has been caught cheating multiple times, and then had an unusually fast rise in rating. Is that rise impossible? No. But it’s consistent with cheating, and given his history, cheating is the simplest explanation.So it would be totally normal for Magnus to refuse to trust such a person even though it can’t be conclusively proven that he’s still dirty. But even then, Magnus agreed to play against him, until further circumstantial evidence came to light and it just got to be too much.So, is it possible that Hans is clean? Sure. If that’s indeed the case, do I feel sorry for him? No. He made the choice to destroy his own reputation when he cheated multiple times. If he doesn’t get the benefit of the doubt now, it’s on him."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe people might be seriously underestimating just how good Magnus may be at detecting cheating.Dude probably trains with computers regularly. He has a better memory than 10 average Joe&#39;s combined. He&#39;s been the absolute #1 of the world for what, 10 years now?He wouldn&#39;t risk his whole reputation for nothing.I personally take his suspicions very seriously, though I agree that evidence has to be presented sooner or later."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; So let me put it plainly: the CTO/VPE/Engineering Director candidate should pass your coding interview. In fact, they should excel.People who work full-time as developers spend hundreds of hours practicing leetcode and hackerrank so that they can pass the interview, but a CTO who&#39;s 5 levels above and hasn&#39;t logged to Github for 3 years should excel at it? Come on.I agree with the premise of the article, CTO should be technical, but I don&#39;t think that &#34;technical&#34; and &#34;great at coding&#34; are the same. One of the best CTOs I&#39;ve had came from a product background. He was technical enough to understand the technical discussions and he was able to support his directors in hiring plans, technical decisions etc. but he wouldn&#39;t pass any coding test more complex than FizzBuzz. Still, he was great at his job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just became a CTO. So, let me bear my thoughts.Since July of this year I&#39;ve been CTO for a small games company, I&#39;ve worked in this industry before in a more specialised role but this is much broader scope.I&#39;ve gone from being responsible for 1 person to 10 which will likely become 50 by the end of next year.I&#39;m terrified.I&#39;m terrified because I feel like I will let my reports down.I&#39;m terrified because a lot of the work I&#39;m doing lacks transparency, how do I tell my compatriots about things that may not come to pass, especially deep political things -- and the amount of work necessary to onboard/offboard people, about &#34;strategic partnerships&#34; and why they&#39;re taken, or not taken or any of the hundreds of other things which are changing direction 3 times a day each.I am technical, deeply, passionately technical.I will not do service to people by being technical, my days are too fragmented, my worries too broad, it&#39;s impossible to dig into a small focused problem and give it the treatment it deserves - and even if I could then I&#39;d be dooming one of my colleagues to maintain it forever because I couldn&#39;t possibly..My being technical is good because I know the problems and I know what can make people feel valued; I can give people autonomy and direction and I can understand when help is needed and how to give it.However, almost nothing in my work is technical, it&#39;s all presentations, discussions, breakdowns, timelines, contracts and negotiation.The most code I write now is to do cost reporting.My most frequently accessed cloud console pages are the billing sections.This is not fun at all (and frankly, I didn&#39;t think it would be); but I fear what will replace me if I leave."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d say it&#39;s important for a CTO to be a CTO.  I&#39;ve been at too many places where the CTO only wanted to be a software developer/architect and would not focus on process, cost, employees, etc.  CTO is a leadership role, and leadership means you have to take care of all the responsibilities under your authority, not just the interesting ones.IMHO, too many people chase the CTO title but few really want the actual job."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is a difference between remembering something (like a fact) and a deep understanding of a concept.Let me give you an example in programming: I sometimes have to google for the names of functions I&#39;ve already used a hundred times. Sometimes extremely simple functions (just a while ago it was list.size() in Java), only because I can&#39;t remember the name of the function, but of course I understand the concept - the length of a list/array. I just can&#39;t remember if it&#39;s length(), or size() or count(), or whatever.This deep understanding feels quite different from simple memorization. It feels more like something in my body, similar to muscle memory or like playing a piano piece. It&#39;s something I feel I will never forget.I&#39;d love to learn more about this kind of understanding. For years I&#39;ve tried to find good reading about it, but much has been disappointing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who has been using Anki for the past 4 years to learn Japanese and now Chinese, I&#39;ve recently found that the initial &#34;learning&#34; step is not that hard. (i.e., given 辞書, I remember &#34;dictionary&#34;) What is hard is keeping the content I&#39;ve learned, _learned_, for more than a day.So now I&#39;m wondering, is my initial &#34;learning&#34; process wrong? Since definitions are fairly simple and I find them easy to remember at first but hard to hold onto. And my process in Anki for New cards is to rep them like reviewed cards until I pass the card; so really, I&#39;m just staring at the kanji + definition until I remember it.This brings me to my question: is there more Anki can do when it comes to learning new cards? Is there something we can do when learning new information that will help make it &#34;sticky&#34;? Especially in regards to &#34;simple&#34; facts, like basic kanji -&gt; definition mappings, where there are no mechanics to understand, just simple mappings.Edit (an addition):Also, I love SRS, but I don&#39;t understand how it can be advertised as completely different than rote memorization. When you learn a new physical flashcard, you&#39;re learning it the same way as you would be when learning a new Anki card. The only difference is that Anki will show it to you again at a more efficient time in the future, rather than at some regular interval."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Calling learning remembering, is like calling a computer a hard drive. Sorry, but, remembering is just one part, although important part of learning. There is loads of difference between remembering the words of a foreign language and fluently speaking it. The process of learning is complicated, eg. good teaching is not giving the final answers to learner, which should seem faster, but letting the learner arrive at their answers, even sometimes arriving at a wrong answer at first.
And the point about reducing forgetting, that&#39;s also a terrible way of learning. If you want to minimize forgetting, that means you have to learn in baby steps, repeat everything using some kind of spaced repetition algorithm, and endure the pain of doing all this for a considerate amount of time. Instead, learning the content rapidly (meanwhile forgetting a lot of the content), getting a whole picture, and gradually gain more understanding repeating the process using different textbooks/courses, is a much more faster way of learning. The brain is more used to BFS (breadth-first-search) than DFS (depth-first-search), and the whole process is much more stimulating. This is because new knowledge needs to be encoded with connections to pre-existing knowledge, and most knowledge is intertwined together, for example in calculus, limits, derivatives, integrals, infinite series, etc. Learning limits in isolation of the whole picture, optimizing for less percentage of forgetting, often leaves learners confused, why am I even learning this, and what use is this for. Even though the percentage of forgetting is much higher in the latter holistic BFS process, the overall content mastered in the same month or week duration is higher. So forgetting is actually normal and you shouldn&#39;t panic when you forget things- since you will gain more understanding each time you learn and re-learn the content.
For the last ten years, I&#39;ve been making products for learning, and every day now and then, I&#39;m still learning something new about learning."</p>

A powerful exception to the &#34;double-pumping&#34; found in most other AVX512 instructions.* AMD seemingly handles the AVX512 mask registers better than Intel.* Gather/Scatter slow on AMD&#39;s Zen4 implementation.* Intel&#39;s 512-bit native load/store unit has clear advantages over AMD&#39;s 256-bit load-store unit when reading/writing to L1 cache and beyond."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find the vpmullq part the most stunning.This instruction is used in some bignum code, for example if you are implementing RSA. Yet AMD implemented it three times faster than Intel.I&#39;m also fascinated by AMD now making AVX512 worthwhile on consumer devices (where they would until quite recently artificially slow down Intel CPUs that had it), which presumably will lead to widespread adoption where it matters. Intels strategy of turning off AVX512 in the recent consumer devices because their energy efficiency cores don&#39;t have it may turn out to be a monumental mistake."</p>

While initially being disappointed when hearing of their &#34;double pumping&#34; approach rather than going for a 512-bit data path, these benchmark results speak for themselves. For software that can effectively make use of AVX-512 (and compiled so), there is significant performance uplift to enjoy while no negative impact in terms of reduced CPU clock speeds / higher power consumption (with oneDNN being one of the only exceptions seen so far in terms of higher power draw).AVX-512 is looking good on the Ryzen 7000 series and I&#39;ll continue running more benchmarks over the weeks ahead. These AVX-512 results make me all the more excited for AMD EPYC &#34;Genoa&#34; where AVX-512 can be a lot more widely-used among HPC/server workloads. &#34;"</p>

The semantics around moving and copying and the many ways you can initialize a variable [1] and how you can mess that up so it&#39;s actually a copy instead of a move is just mind-bending.Can we also talk about how in 2022 we&#39;re still talking about and getting wrong const-correctness? I guess we&#39;re going ever further now because this presentation touches on constexpr correctness (as in const vs constexpr).Another thought: problems like comparisons between base and derived problems shouldn&#39;t even be problems (IMHO) because you&#39;ve already messed up by wanting that behaviour.The change about not doing arithmetic on enum values is a good one but pretty late.TIL this is a valid way to cast:    size_t{expanded_size}

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I didn&#39;t appreciate until recently that the calendar we live by today was personally designed by Julius Caesar.Like not by some forgotten technocrats incidentally during his time, but Julius Caesar himself as a subject matter expert, as a side-project.  With consultation, certainly, but by his initiative, from long-standing engagement with the problem in one of his early jobs from long before he was a main character of the Roman story.Digestable and entertaining (fragment of a) video on the topic:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD-R35DSSZY&amp;t=1312s"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find the implication that aliens are rational and have no subrational concepts due to tradition and habit interesting, as it sort of implies that these kinds of outgrowths are not necessary and can just be done away with.  The narrator starts from a position of not wanting to legitimize or historicize beyond reductive statements like &#34;some ancient civilization did XYZ&#34;.  I&#39;ll admit that I skimmed through the last part of the thread, so I might have missed something, but I don&#39;t see any mention of the decimal calendar https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_calendar, or why that failed.  I get that this is supposed to be funny, but the indirect message of getting rid of whatever doesn&#39;t make conscious sense is simplistic, and spoils the fun for me.  Humans are stupid, very funny."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This gets even more complicated when you introduce dealing with foreign countries that actually don&#39;t follow the western calendar system. Such as the standard Persian calendar months and years. Also, did you know that the arabic Islamic calendar dates and the persian calendar dates don&#39;t agree?  Because the traditional calendar dating back to the maximum geograhpical extent of the Persian empire is solar based, while the standard Islamic calendar is entirely lunar based.And the persian calendar is solar based and the year resets on Nowruz (new years day) around the spring equinox, but the practiced holidays are based on the lunar islamic months? But also some holidays like Nowruz are observed based on the solar date.This means you&#39;ve got Nowruz occuring on approximately the same time in the weather season every year, while relative to the western calendar, notable holidays like Eid al-fitr and Eid al-adha and the start of Ramadan etc move backwards in calendar date approxiamtely 10 or 11 days per year. Some years Ramadan might occur in the middle of winter and much later on it will be in the middle of summer.This series of tweets doesn&#39;t even begin to get into the possible opportunities for confusion when working between three different calendar systems...  And western countries where the standard work week is M-F but others where Friday is the day of rest and people work on a 6-day work week on a persian or arabic islamic calendar, but some companies give their employees a two day weekend so they&#39;re off on Friday and Saturday, but the local timezone equivalent of Sunday is definitely a normal workday...  I could go on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"McMaster-Carr is an incredible example of how an existing physical-product distributor with a vaunted historical operations department, when faced with moving into the e-commerce world, could choose one of two paths:- Build an online presence cheaply because you can rely on your historical offline operations to paper over any shortcomings in the online system.- Build an online presence with the same ethos, standards, creativity, and long-term continued investment with which you built your offline operations to be your competitive advantage in the first place.There aren&#39;t many legacy organizations that successfully digitized with that second path in mind, at least not at first - McMaster, B&amp;H Photo, and Sweetwater come to mind as notable exceptions. It&#39;s a useful thought experiment, I think, even for those working on startups and green-field projects."</p>

Hence, a lot of screen space is wasted and the user has to scroll more. Larger font sizes on mobile are usually not a good idea as the device tends to be closer to your eyes anyway.A snippet that could work better in my opinion is the following:    html {

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s funny how I&#39;ve witnessed a complete 180° change from how, in the 1990&#39;s, software was supposed to be entirely discoverable and it also came with a manual that documented literally everything, to now there&#39;s a ton that&#39;s hidden, often without any manual whatsoever... but you can Google everything you need to know.Probably the single most useful skill I&#39;ve had to learn in my life is, whenever you wonder something, just Google it. If you don&#39;t think your software does X... don&#39;t just assume it. Look it up.I&#39;ve been astonished at how often a feature was added 3 years ago to a program I&#39;ve used for 8 years, or there&#39;s a secret swipe that avoids a bunch of menus, or an unofficial command-line flag.And it really leaves me feeling deeply conflicted. Because on the one hand, I still believe in the virtue of learning your tools inside and out. I would read the manual and be proud I knew exactly what every program/language could and couldn&#39;t do. But on the other hand, is that really just a waste of time? Programs have so many features now, that instead of learning all the things via discoverability or a manual, we just learn them by... querying how to do things when we need them.I don&#39;t really like the idea of so fundamentally relying on Google and forums and tutorials and Reddit and YouTube videos as the main way of learning how to use software. But at the same time, software does so much now and adds new things so quickly that it appears to be the only reasonable way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Back Tap feature is my favorite &#34;hidden&#34; action on the iPhone. You can double (or triple) tap the back of the phone to trigger whatever action you want. For example, toggle the flashlight or lock rotation. Show Spotlight or run a Shortcut.https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/back-tap-iphaa57e7885...I think Apple does a decent job telling people about iOS features across the User Guide, Tips.app, and the Apple Support YouTube channel.The &#34;undiscoverable&#34; features in the article are all there.Delete the last digit: If you make a mistake when you enter a number, swipe left or right on the display at the top.https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/calculator-iph1ac0b5c...Turn the onscreen keyboard into a trackpad.1.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The actions listed in the article are fairly non-essential, but many fundamental iOS functions also have discoverability issues, as well as some head-scratching design choices.  For example:- seeing notifications requires swiping down specifically from the top left- turning on the flashlight requires swiping down specifically from the top right.  Swiping down from top left also gets you a flashlight button, but it is not actionable.  The flashlight button on the home screen is also not actionable.- universal search requires swiping to the left of the app pages.  Swiping past the right end of the app pages also gets you a search bar, but it will only show you apps- Seeing your open apps requires swiping up slowly from the bottom of the page.- turning the phone off requires holding two unrelated buttonsMobile UX generally is heavily-dependent on gestures, which inherently creates discoverability challenges, but it seems like Apple goes out of its way to hide every basic function behind a very specific swipe.  It makes me wonder if they intentionally design their products to be exclusively usable by tech-savvy people.Another possible explanation is that design requires users to develop muscle memory over time that will improve experience in the long run and makes competitors feel unnatural."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not a comment on the quality of this application, but rather a tangential topic: there should be some way of auditing the accuracy of emulators in general. If a genuine homebrew scene wants to exist (not just getting old games to work), new programmers who have little-to-no access to the original hardware need some practical way of knowing their software will work properly across different emulators. In the old days, most platforms had one good emulator that everyone used, and these emulators were supported by communities like AtariAge. In the Web 2.0 world, those communities are fractured or even gone completely, and often not easy to find in search engines. There are now much more platforms that emulators can be run on.Hardware emulation isn’t a solution. An FPGA emulator isn’t intrinsically more accurate than a software one, and documentation and schematics that are used to implement emulators can be incorrect and don’t specify ‘undefined behavior’ which was very much used reliably by software developers.The approach adopted by MAME has proven to be the only reliable: you have to measure some output on a real working system and compare it to the emulator behavior, but this can be impractical and becomes moreso over time as systems become more difficult to operate. (E.g. I can’t even operate most 8-bit computers without some kind of mod because I don’t have a CRT television anymore)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This urgently needs shareable URL&#39;s for each game...Otherwise when someone finds a cool game, they can&#39;t tell friends about it without that friend having to hunt through menus.Also, search engine indexing ought to be possible so that you can search a game name on Google/DDG and go direct to it."</p>

I would HIGHLY prefer this to a short press release blurb that allows pop-science clickbait aggregators (or even worse, the &#34;science&#34; sections of CBS/CNN and the like) to have first crack at it.This was produced by the university themselves, and provides a concise yet accurate and detailed overview of the biochemistry involved, as well as a nice short embedded youtube video demonstrating the movement in question and going over the main points of the research.Yes, improvements could be made, and yes, follow up studies will need to be performed. But this is head and shoulders above the &#34;ONE SMALL TRICK, DIETICIANS HATE HIM&#34; alternative we would have gotten otherwise."</p>

The equipment is an electromyography system with realtime display. It measures the muscle contraction and is displayed to the subject so they can learn to recognize the movement that properly activates the muscle. Contrary to the video, you do not need to be an academic to buy one, they&#39;re fairly common in high-end sports coaching/rehab and you can find a cheap arduino-compatible system on Amazon if you want to DIY.If you don&#39;t read much exercise science, it&#39;s worth noting the paper says &#34;It is important to note that volunteers in Experiment I (Table S1) were typically sedentary (verified with an objective tracking device), and none of them had a high aerobic cardiorespiratory fitness (determined by treadmill VO2max or the maximal oxygen consumption test).&#34; A common pitfall of exercise science is that almost anything works wonderfully on untrained sedentary subjects.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t necessarily agree with the step of putting the code in a separate function; that often works, but just as often makes it so that the code can&#39;t be read top-to-bottom anymore which hurts readability.In this case there&#39;s, I think, a better alternative; the equivalent-ish code in Ruby for the example code here would be something like this:   values = s
      .partition(&#39;?&#39;)[-1]
      .split(&#39;&amp;&#39;)
      .map { |key_value| key_value.partition(&#39;=&#39;)[-1] }

You can write these nice functional pipelines where you just read the code top-to-bottom and see step-by-step what is being done to the data on each line. You don&#39;t have to jump up-and-down around the code when reading it, and you don&#39;t have to keep too much context in your head when reading it.This is one of the reasons why I vastly prefer Ruby over Python for most data processing tasks. I wish more languages would support this style of programming."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Now I know where Rust got some of its syntax from...As an aside, when I see samples like this, it makes me itchy. I hope and assume that they&#39;re being used as made-up snippets just to illustrate a point, and aren&#39;t being lifted from an actual codebase.Because... ugh... isn&#39;t it obvious? Attacker-controlled input such as URLs should never be manipulated with naive string processing! Always use a proper parsing library. Not to mention that complexities of URL encoding, character escapes, etc...The problem is that the author is using abstractions at the wrong level, with or without his fixes. The correct solution would be something like:    var uri = new Uri( &#34;http://foo/demo?test=a&amp;blah=b%20c&#34; );
    var map = System.Web.HttpUtility.ParseQueryString( uri.Query );
    
    Console.Out.WriteLine( &#34;is blah equal to &#39;b c&#39;?\n{0}&#34;, map[&#34;blah&#34;] == &#34;b c&#34; );

The above example is C#, but similar code can be written in any language. It&#39;s simple, direct, and doesn&#39;t violate the &#34;rule of six&#34;. It can be read like English:1. Construct a URI from a given string.2. Parse the query part of the URI into a map.3. Test if the &#39;blah&#39; value in the query is &#34;b c&#34; as expected, with the escaped space decoded properly.The example of how to apply the &#34;MORF&#34; rule in the article still has low-level operations involved, which doesn&#39;t make the code more readable. It doesn&#39;t describe the intent, which is the key thing to writing code that doesn&#39;t need comments every second line."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What the author is missing is that easy to read/reason/understand about is within the context of making a change to the code to fix a bug, add a feature or make some non-functional improvement to it.This is what most of the &#34;easy to read&#34; articles forget.Show me why it is easier to fix a bug, add a feature or make a non-functional improvement to the code with their style than without.For example, if you&#39;ve extracted something into its own function, are you then sharing this function and using it in other places as well? If you then change the body of that function, are you now possibly breaking other parts of the code that relied on its old behavior?If you&#39;ve introduced a local mutable variable in between two lines, are you then mutating that variable prior/later? Is the query_params different at the end of the function then in the middle? Can you safely use it again?How easily can you now introduce new behavior before, in the middle, after, and anywhere in-between?When you modify the behavior to fix a bug, add a feature or make a non-functional improvement, is it an isolated change? How many tests break? Did it require major refactoring to make or very few things had to change? How easy was it to add a test for your new behavior? Was it easy to find the most appropriate place in the code to make the change? Etc.Sure sometimes maybe you just read code for the fun of understanding what it does, but almost always in practice when you&#39;re working on a code base, you only care to understand and reason about the code because you&#39;re looking to deliver that next sprint task that involves changing something about it.I wish more people focused on &#34;easy to change/modify&#34; then simply on &#34;easy to read/understand&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is not a new problem, back in the late 80s I worked for a Mac graphics card developer ... We made some of the first 24bit accelerated graphics cards.Our first was just an existing card with a small daughter card with pals an sram on it, it was so easy that we got our own logos put on many of the chips to put the competition off the scent, we designed that one in days and got it to market in weeks.We immediately started on 2 more designs. The next was all FPGA, it was as big a nubus card as one could build, it pulled too much power, and tilted under it&#39;s own weight out of the bus socket (Mac&#39;s didn&#39;t use screws to hold cards in place, that happened when you closed the chassis). We got it out the door about the point that the competition beat the first board&#39;s performance.The final card was built with custom silicon, designed backwards from &#34;how fast can we possibly make the vrams go if we use all the tricks?&#34;, In this case we essentially bet the company on whether a new ~200 pin plastic packaging technology was viable. This design really soaked the competition.In those days big monitors didn&#39;t work on just any card so if you owned the high end graphics card biz you owned the high end monitor biz too ... The 3 card play above was worth more than $120m"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m surprised this isn&#39;t mentioned here more clearly: Some high end cases like the be quiet silent base I&#39;m using have the option to mount the graphics card vertically, basically parallel to the mainboard, in a separate anchor slot. It needs an additional connector cable (~$20), but other than that is easy to setup, looks better with a look-in case (the illuminated fans face the glass side) and the weight pulls on a special anchor point just for that with no electronics involved. Plus the card itself is more sturdy in that orientation and there is no issues with bending through its own weight. It might even be beneficial ventilation-wise as the graphics card no longer causes a horizontal divide (basically creating separate ventilation-zones on the top and bottom of the card).Yes, the cable will add approximately ~0.3ns of additional latency due to the added 10cm of distance.This is how it looks like:https://www.hardware-journal.de/images/Bilder/2018/test/be-q...https://www.hardware-journal.de/images/Bilder/2018/test/be-q..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good to hear the reaffirmation from Mozilla that the blocking WebRequest API would be retained. A little over three years ago, Mozilla had promised that it wouldn’t just blindly follow Google on Manifest v3 to the letter. [1]Considering that uBlock Origin works best and can do the most in Firefox with this continuing support, I’m glad Mozilla is still walking the talk on this one.We need at least one browser that makes the web usable, and that might as well be Firefox with uBlock Origin.Edit: Oops.

As if we&#39;re starting from some default, correct state, and then blocking part of it. We&#39;ve always been able to choose what content we navigate to. These are content selectors/choosers, which just support our existing ability to choose what content we request and actions we take."</p>

I keep trying to think of how it could be kept afloat once Google stops funding it.IIRC they get $400 million annually. There are 200 million FF users. $2 each wouldn&#39;t be bad... But realistically only 1% of the users would donate and $200 is unpalatable.Maybe another organization picks it up and runs it more efficiently or at a loss for advertising?Or...?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m approaching 50.  Just a scant decade away from being old enough to tap my retirement accounts and have the OPTION to retire.  These next couple of years look like they might not be fun, but overall it looks like I&#39;m actually going to make it.For most of my career, I&#39;ve been told (and I believed) that I would probably get forced out of a hands-on individual contributor role as I aged.  During the late-2000&#39;s, I even had an early midlife crisis and earned a law degree, expecting that I would need to make a career change into IP or something.  That hasn&#39;t been the case.What I think people missed is the compounding effect.  The supply and demand for computer programmers seems to double every decade (maybe the interval is even shorter).  With each doubling, the older cohorts become a smaller and smaller share of the whole.  People look around and think, &#34;There aren&#39;t many older programmers here&#34;, and base predictions off that observation.  However, the more accurate observation would be, &#34;There have been A LOT of younger programmers added here!&#34;.  I don&#39;t believe that it&#39;s actually a zero-sum game, though.I don&#39;t know if this human resources cousin to Moore&#39;s Law will continue indefinitely, but it&#39;s certainly held up through my career.  Even when it inevitably slows down, I think that just means you&#39;ll see the age cohorts balance out more over time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At 64 years I am still going strong.  I consider myself blessed that I have landed a position that allows the to be the leader (I manage a small team) and still be hands on with everything: Architecture, desgin, coding, infrastructure, cloud engineering, DevOps engineer, DBA, the list goes on.  It is a Goldilocks job.  The technologies that we manage and master are miriad. We are a small company and my team owns the entire space.  All my years of knowledge and experience enable me to be coach, mentor, and teacher.  Over the course of my 44 year career I have played every instrument in the band.  I manage with a socratic method which my team enjoys.  Because I have been a life long learner, I have sought out and explored new technologies with eagerness and hunger.  This enables me to lead the team to adopt some of these technologies in usefull and vaulable (to the enterprise) ways.  The team absolutly enjoys learning and applying new and emerging technologies.  I could not have asked for more from what will probably be the last gig of my career. I don&#39;t intend to retire until 70 (assuming I am that lucky - you&#39;ll know what I mean when you get here).  I am having so much fun I wish had 30 more years ahead to enjoy what comes next.  I always like to say: It&#39;s good work if you can get it - not everybody can."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found I lost interest in vapid work. Programming is still fun, but it&#39;s a big challenge to find a job that is fulfilling.When I was younger, I&#39;d work on whatever. Then everything started sounding like yet another get rich quick company, and is that what I was giving up my life for? Just to move little green pieces of paper around?The most appealing thing I&#39;d seen recently was a company that wrote software to help maximize farm yields. At least there was some real, effective benefit for a great many people.It&#39;s like the goal of the company gradually became more important than the tech or money. And altruistic companies are very rare.But I always really wanted to teach, so that&#39;s what I do now. Pays about 40% of what I&#39;d make in industry, but I get to geek out all day and do work that benefits the world."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yeah, no. Maybe with old laptops, but newer laptops still have their fair share of issues. When I bought my thinkpad A485 kernels wouldn&#39;t boot without additional parameters, the graphics would freeze at times and cause a hardlock, sleep and hibernation have been fixed and broken again intermittently over several kernel versions, the wifi card&#39;s AP mode started causing segfaults in kernel 5.2 due to the driver&#39;s rewrite but has since been fixed, the fnlock key LED didn&#39;t update properly, which I spent a while debugging and submitted a kernel patch for, and while over the years the fingerprint scanner has been implemented, it&#39;s a pain to install and support for fingerprint scanning in linux is still in a very sorry state. Oh and bluetooth still can&#39;t connect more than one device at a time, so I had to buy a dongle to connect two joycon controllers.Granted, I&#39;ve always had these kinds of issues with new laptops, especially when it came to proprietary nvidia or AMD graphics (before AMDGPU) and I agree it&#39;s improved a lot, but I still need to tell people that there&#39;s caveats with some (especially newer) laptops."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have the reverse...Unless you have a thinkpad or some other popular hardware, you&#39;ll find Linux barely works at all out of the box, and even with hours of fiddling around, you&#39;ll still have to live without some features.For example, power saving features, sleep and hibernate, screen brightness controls, fingerprint readers, keyboard hotkeys and backlights, etc. rarely work.  Prepare for broken external hdmi ports or USB stuck at USB 2.0 speeds.  Have fun with the fan stuck on either max or zero, or the CPU stuck at the lowest clock speed.There are still lots of things you have to go hunting for the right old firmware version for.I think Linux is only great if you have whatever hardware distro developers have, because that will be all that works out of the box."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Every automotive code base I&#39;ve seen has been a dumpster fire. This (mostly) isn&#39;t the fault of the developers and Rust won&#39;t fix it. The business process creates this outcome. No one likes it but little is done to address it.The software development timeline is slaved to the rigid manufacturing timeline. There is no allowance for slippage, so making things work By Any Means Necessary is the rule of the day. Concurrency problems often are not debugged; locks and similar are just sprinkled around until they disappear in testing. It is TDD taken to an extreme -- passing the enumerated tests, technically, is the definition of done even if the code is obviously poor or broken.There are a vast number of software and hardware components sourced from myriad vendors that are swapped out every year to save a few dollars or deal with a supply chain issue. There is no stable baseline but all of these components need to work together. The code has to constantly adapt to the reality that someone sourced parts for a new model year that work differently or are in a different programming language.This code is usually required to be supported for 10+ years. The developers don&#39;t just have this year&#39;s tech stack and code base to deliver on a rigid schedule, they are required to maintain several older implementations concurrently, often built in different languages and architectures.Basically, the automotive industry has failed badly at the transition from being hardware manufacturing companies to being hardware + software manufacturing companies, and try to run their software processes the same way they ran their traditional hardware processes. Choice of programming language is the least of their concerns, that isn&#39;t the source of their code quality issues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of comments so far are complaining about the software quality in cars now. But what did you expect? This is what happens when you hire the same kinds of people to write the software for your car that you&#39;ve hired for 25 years to write the terrible internal applications inside the company that everyone hates, and in the same terrible way. The end result is going to be exactly the same.Over the years, I&#39;ve seen various discussions brush up against the issue of professional certification. Professional Engineer, in civil engineering, is a serious credential, which can hold people professionally liable for bridges that fail, or buildings that fall over. Making cars a network of computers that all talk to each other, operated entirely &#34;by wire,&#34; and giving up any consideration of mechanical backups (like with a plane) is going to very quickly drive the point home that the programming profession needs a similar credential. As a mechanical engineer who has made a living writing software for 30 years, I understand the difference, but the legal externalities are not going to care that software is VASTLY more complicated than, say, designing a plane wing with a factor of safety.Now, I have to go figure out why my Rails application can no longer restart the delayed_job process on deploy. Is the problem in Rails, Ruby, my gems, Capistrano, permissions, SSH, or some updated package on my Linux VM? Designing a bridge, frankly, is easier, because it&#39;s &#34;concrete&#34; and closed-form. Sure, I&#39;ll figure out my deployment problem, but next month some obscure thing in the 24 layers that make up a simple web app these days is going to get updated, and break something else. At least once a bridge is built, it&#39;s done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I own a 2021 Volvo and the blinkers doesn’t blink regularly. They may blink fine for a awhile but then stops for a period, and then suddenly all missed blinks blinks in a rapid succession. It’s extremely annoying. There are other bugs, like when you are using the auto pilot where it sometimes may suddenly jerk the wheel even though there is nothing wrong with the road. Scares the shit out of you. That has happened thrice now."</p>

I would like to thank Daox and any other people who may have worked behind the scene to make it possible.&gt; My initial goal was to make available the knowledge and possibility that anybody with a few tools and gumption could convert discarded air conditioners, and dehumidifiers into very high efficiency heat ources, or cooling sources. Through the years, we have received reports of success from many people, living in many states, and countries.&gt; Another goal was to make zero money from this project, to give it away and to encourage others to take it, share it, sell it.&gt; In the beginning I thought that maybe 200 people would find this interesting.

It didn’t mention if he did this, he might have done, but it’s important to have a continuous taped vapour barrier on the warm side of the insulation to prevent water vapour from passing through, condensing on the timber structure and causing it to rot. Also ventilate the cold side of the insulation or a least have a gap to form a capillary break with the cold outside wall. I’ve seen a few badly done insulation jobs in timber buildings that have needed floor joists and studs cut out and replaced. It only takes about 15-20 years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is debt peonage. The trouble is, the US law against peonage was not drafted tightly enough.&#34;The holding of any person to service or labor under the system known as peonage is abolished and forever prohibited in any Territory or State of the United States; and all acts, laws, resolutions, orders, regulations, or usages of any Territory or State, which have heretofore established, maintained, or enforced, or by virtue of which any attempt shall hereafter be made to establish, maintain, or enforce, directly or indirectly, the voluntary or involuntary service or labor of any persons as peons, in liquidation of any debt or obligation, or otherwise, are declared null and void.&#34;[1]As you can see, the reference is to &#34;the system known as peonage&#34;. So, new, innovative means of accomplishing the same result may or may not be covered. So far, cases involving training repayment agreements do not seem to have taken the peonage route.[2]The PetSmart case in California makes several arguments. One is that PetSmart is illegally operating an unlicensed educational institution. The &#34;California Education Code provides that “a note, instrument, or other evidence of indebtedness relating to payment for an educational program is not enforceable by an institution unless, at the time of execution . . . the institution held an approval to operate.” (Cal. Educ. Code § 94917&#34;) There are other specific California labor laws probably being violated here.

Second, just because you can, doesn&#39;t mean you should :)I think it&#39;s art, so be careful about adding more.  The minimalism is beautiful.  Just a bunch of moving lights, but they capture the feel of night driving! If you add everything mentioned as upgrades, it will be a simulation.  An impressive engineering feat, but (I think) less as a work of art.I wonder, what does someone who&#39;s never ridden/driven in a car at night &#39;feel&#39; when they see this?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reminds me of a passion project I started in high school that went completely viral and took on a life of its own. Wrote a small script for my friends to check their AP scores a few days early. Required high schoolers giving clear text access to their entire CollegeBoard account so I could log on and scrape their scores. Somehow it got posted to Reddit and from that year on, grew wildly. Got to almost 2 million students checking their score in its peak year. It was immensely fun while it lasted (ran for about 7 years) and honestly I miss the thrill of it. CollegeBoard now releases all scores on the same day so the site is pretty much useless now. Definitely always looking to chase the thrill of that score release day again though.Congrats on a successful end to a fun high school project! Stories like this are always fun to read."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Epic stuff, and I think this experience may well be more valuable than the homework you avoided. Basically you did harder homework in order to avoid easier homework.The problem is letting other people use it; of course it&#39;s nice to help people, and it&#39;s altruistic to do so for free, but some of those people might actually need this homework to learn, and you may have deprived them of that. (Although I also think watching a video and doing some multiple choice questions is the laziest low-effort homework assignment there is, and the damage may not have been all that big.) But you used logic and programming to work around a math problem, which are roughly in the same field, so I think that&#39;s fair.A slightly similar situation: my previous job was at a bank, and banks over here are bound by all sorts of ethics and rules, and are required to regularly train all their employees in balancing the interests of customers, society, and the bank. This bank did that by gamifying it: we had an app where we had to answer all sorts of ethical questions and make sure our score in the app was over 70% at the end of every month.A coworker used our testing framework to access the app, answer questions randomly like you did, and store the correct answer to use next time. It apparently worked very well, but using tech to avoid ethics questions is quite a different issue than yours. (He shared it with me when he left, and I tried it, but it didn&#39;t work for me.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was in university, I scraped an internal job postings site for students to find internships. The site was terrible- each job description would load in a pop-up window controlled by Javascript, and loading a second description would override the first. It was also really slow and had limited filtering. My version could load job descriptions in new tabs, presented the table on a single page, and you could mark jobs that you weren&#39;t interested in or had already applied to.The university didn&#39;t take kindly to that. They accused me of trying to take down the co-op system and threatened to sue me for copyright infringement. Since I linked into their system for job descriptions, I was able to show that the data I actually had (company, title, location) wasn&#39;t creative work and therefore not copyrightable. I also had some friends in the university faculty and staff who spoke up for me, since I had reported security vulnerabilities in the past, indicating that I wasn&#39;t acting with malicious intent. In the end, I just had to take a business ethics course, which I probably would have taken anyway."</p>

I love it.ZFS - Filesystem that I love, for it has many wonderful features, and they all just work. (Also cute compression)Wine + DXVK/VKD3D - Thanks to this, I was able to completely drop windows partition, and go full Linux.LaTeX - Thanks to it, I could have cute workflow for writing documents (And yesterday, wrote CV with its&#39; help :D)Calibre - Man.. what a behemot of book software. Makes anything ebook related painlessCommon Lisp(SBCL) and Haskell(GHC) - Very interesting 
languages, with very wonderful features. I love them both.Cool retro term - For playing roguelikes, lets me experience them in very retro, retro way.Obviously, ublock origin, makes browsing web not a nightmare.Aseprite - wonderful pixelart software.There is more, but...

Indispensable.Arduino, I don&#39;t think I would be able to tinker with microcontrollers as much if I had to write C and use obscure toolchains directly.Solvespace, a limited but usable free CAD for simple parts to be 3d printed. Wish there was a real contender to the commercial ones though, or a free tier that doesn&#39;t smell like it&#39;s going away any time. Still very thankful that SolveSpace exists.The Scala 3 compiler and the VSCode plugin for v3. Absolutely love the language and the experience is so much better than with IntelliJ, haven&#39;t had as much fun writing code in ages.This will be a bit controversial, but Kubernetes, because if people use it via GKE, EKS etc. then I won&#39;t have to learn their organically grown solution to the same dozen-or-so operations problems, and I have yet to see one that isn&#39;t a hot mess in some way or other. Also anything running on top of Kubernetes won&#39;t be built the very old-fashioned vi-edits-on-server way, great for sanity.Various modern messenger apps (Telegram, Whatsapp, Instagram&#39;s direct messages, ...) because I would hear a lot less from some highly cherished and very non-technical people in my life without these incredibly slick and fun and convenient apps. As one who&#39;s old enough to remember being dependent on landlines and payphones and letters, this still feels like a miracle."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Two indicator lights (red/green) serve as attention getters and ensure a far reaching call function when a respective message is displayed. The red light is used for system and emergency information, the green light for communication information. The lights are steady in normal situations and will flash in emergency situations.&gt;The ACPs give a long-range visual indication about the system status (e.g. PAX call active). They are installed at the ceiling in the middle of the aisle between the passenger/crew doors, close to
the attendant stations.&gt;The lighted segments are activated either continuously (steady) or flashing.
In case of &#34;normal&#34; calls they are not flashing (steady), in case of &#34;abnormal&#34; or &#34;emergency&#34; situations they will flash. Only the blue PAX call field will never flash, this will be always a &#34;normal&#34; indicationThese indicator lights would be helpful in narrowing down if the emergency system was being engaged or not.  Could potentially point to exploitation/hack of the PA system rather than rogue utilization of normal functions."</p>

Google calendar asks me to install an app every time I open a web version on my phone, my work laptop has 1 active notification in system settings for a year because I didn&#39;t enable iCloud backup.I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s the solution here. I stick to the apps I use because I know what I&#39;m doing, but so many users will just click &#34;yes&#34; when shown a pop-up. On the other hand, the built-in integrations provide value (e.g. it&#39;s better that people use and save random passwords in Keychain than using the same one everywhere).

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the next frontiers as a barrier to browser switching will be &#34;software&#34;-backed WebAuthn/FIDO2/&#34;passkeys&#34;.If you look at the APIs available on MacOS/iOS at present [0], and how WebAuthn works, you need to &#34;trust&#34; the client-side software to correctly identify the site origin (i.e. protocol, domain, port) and pass it to a physical security key. In the case of a software token, you need to restrict which app(s) can pass this information through to the system carrying out authentication.The end result right now, as I can see it, is that if you sign up to a website using a &#34;passkey&#34; via Safari (for example), there is no real supported workflow that isn&#39;t site-specific, for migrating to a new browser - you are effectively beholden to Apple&#39;s keychain for getting you back into that site.If you want to enrol a new device (say an Android phone using its own software implementation of WebAuthn), you would need to find a way to sign into your old account (which requires your MacOS/iOS passkey to log in), then enrol your Android device (which is a separate physical device). You&#39;ll likely get stuck here.An expert user could add a physical FIDO2 token to their account from the old device (Safari), and use that as the authenticator to log in on the new device, but this is significant friction for a non-technical user.While moving users away from passwords might make sense, I do think we&#39;ll see these &#34;passwordless&#34; authentication mechanisms become the next major point of friction in user browser choice. Even if you can implement WebAuthn in your rival browser, unless you get access to the system key store, you won&#39;t be able to let users sign in. That will prevent them switching.[0] https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/supporting-a..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think you partly may just be biased by happening to notice ads more if they fit the topic you sent to your wife or being lenient in deciding if ads meet the categorization. And if you dwell on an ad because it seems to match, you may get more similar ads.Here is how I think you could design a more robust (but less fun) experiment:- Come up with a bunch of topics, write them down on slips of paper, put the paper into a hat- Each Monday, draw three topics from the hat, send some WhatsApp messages about the first, Messenger messages about the second, and don’t discuss the third. Don’t put the topics back in the hat.- If you see any ads relating to one of the topics, screenshot them and save screenshots to eg your computer with a bit of the topic- Separately, record which topic went to which platform- After doing this for a while, go through the screenshots and (each of you and your wife or ideally other people) give a rating for how well the ad matches the topic. To avoid bias, you shouldn’t know which app saw the topic.- Now work out average ratings / the distribution across the three products (WhatsApp vs Messenger vs none) and compare"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"(wrt some comments in this thread)Is it so hard to believe that Meta is snooping on WhatsApp conversations? Meta, a company of unprecedented size that was built over monetizing your private data? A company who&#39;s been caught in plenty of scandals (like Cambridge Analytic) about this exact sort of thing (violating their users&#39; privacy)?Someone from this community, which generally means educated, tech-literate and sensitive to these topics shares a perfectly plausible observation, of something that has been experienced as well by plenty of other folks, me included; and then some people come and try to make up the most convoluted explanations (candy boxes from Kazakhstan just happened to be trending that specific day, nothing to see here, move along!) to this phenomena and try to shift the blame away from Meta. Why do you do this? Are you Meta employees? A PR agency they hired?It&#39;s just baffling. Apparently some people DO want to be abused.Plot twist: we all get ads about candy boxes from KZ now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who has actually worked on end to end encryption at Meta, I can tell you I am not aware of anything where the company reads your WhatsApp messages - either in transit or device. The company takes fairly serious measures to ensure it cannot even accidentally infer such contents.I don&#39;t know what is happening in this specific case. Perhaps the ads came from some other similar search queries. Perhaps they came from the keyboard intercepting what was typed. Or perhaps something else that I can&#39;t think of. But I&#39;m nearly certain it did not come from meta intercepting the contents of your messages.It&#39;s hard to convince people at this point because many have lost trust in Meta as a company, and I understand that. But I still find it stunning that so many people are making so many false claims without any actual knowledge to back it up."</p>

That was news to me since I had seen countless &#34;Do you want to enable push notifications (yes|no)?&#34; screens in top apps but that rule has changed and no longer allows you to pre-ask. I complied but the very next day I opened an app from a billion dollar company and I got a pre-ask that I was able to dismiss without popping the system dialog. wtf...Why am I expected to bend over backwards for app review when these serial abusers get a free pass (no ban AND they can do things smaller apps get slapped down for)?I know the answer is &#34;money&#34; but I fucking hate it."</p>

Not “theirs for the taking”, but literally if they could find a way to obtain it, they considered it their right to have it. Like it was baked into the culture of the company. The more I read about Facebook’s practices, the more it rings true."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If an app needs a webview, it should always strive to open that view in an embedded Safari webview (called an SFSafariViewController) or link to the view in the user&#39;s own choice of browser. 
The app is prevented from seeing ‘inside’ this view.Sometimes an app needs to control some aspect of the external view - for instance listen to some Js event, or inject authorization - and this can be for totally legitimate reasons in the flow of the app. Then the application needs to use another type of embedded webview called a WKWebView, which by definition allows the app to see into the user&#39;s interactions in the embedded browser.Most developers and apps use these for totally necessary reasons - but Facebook is deviously abusing this functionality.Some of the posters in this thread are blaming Apple for Facebook&#39;s evil behavior, but a lot of totally legitimate functionality that needs this type of app/browser communication would be impossible without the ability to enable it for genuine and well-founded reasons."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Teams doesn&#39;t have to be good to succeed. It just has to exist. It&#39;s not even very important how good it is. Given it exists, IT will make everyone use it on Microsoft&#39;s behalf regardless of how bad it is.Or another way to look at it is that the real customers for Teams are IT departments. It makes their lives easier because they don&#39;t have to do anything and it meets all the compliance requirements they are supposed to enforce.Which in turn reflects that the real customers of IT are regulators and auditors. Nobody with decision making power actually cares whether any of the software in use in enterprises works well or not."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Long ago Microsoft had MSN Messenger, which was one of the leading messaging apps. It worked well, and many &#39;normal&#39; users were using it. Then Microsoft dissolved the team behind it and screwed up the product so bad with bloatware and ads that everyone moved to WhatsApp (except in the US where people went back to texting).Then Microsoft came out with Communicator, renamed it to Lync, which was a corporate messenger/meeting software. It used its own server, that could federate outside. It worked very well. They added LiveMeeting as a separate app for meetings, built on the same protocols. Our company used it with the &#34;roundtable&#34; camera from 2008, and it all worked amazingly well. We had meetings with people joining in from home and other offices over the internet using inexpensive webcams, 15 years ago.Then they bought Skype and it went downhill from there. I don&#39;t know what happened, but they took a lot of time integrating technologies from Skype (peer-to-peer) with their own tech (which was more telecom/server based) and tried competing with ever-changing perceived competitors by copying parts of their features and UI, without ever making any feature really good. They integrated everything into a single program, Skype for Business, now renamed Teams, and made it bloated and obnoxious. Just try to get it to not start at login... It&#39;s like MSN all over again.I think the Communicator/LiveMeeting software combo they had 15 years ago would still (conceptually) do pretty well as messenger/meeting software now, when modernized. It was much less intrusive and behaved like nice software that you actually wanted to use."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My 2 cents of venting on this sorry excuse of software- Backtick formatting in a chat post only works after typing the closing backtick, deleting it, re-typing it- Text copied from a conversation is polluted with names and time stamps. &#34;I really want this feature&#34; said nobody ever- The mute/unmute button is hard to find, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever attended a Teams meeting without someone struggling with this. Teams should change its name to &#34;You&#39;re on mute&#34;- Multiple windows, I never know which is the &#39;main&#39; window, which is the meeting window, where are they, which has focus- Too hard to know which chat you&#39;re replying to, who is in it- Updates in chats are not consistently acknowledged, you have to change focus, and back again. Even then the &#34;Activity&#34; tab still shows unread items that I have read- Random crashing- Random communication freezes, everyone else is chatting, I don&#39;t see any updates nor notification of any problems until I restart the app- &#34;Reply&#34; is sometimes in the chat context menu, sometimes not.- Media handling is inconsistent, sometimes I can&#39;t paste photos, sometimes I can- The size of the text chat column in a meeting cannot be changed and is very narrow, forcing you to find the same chat in the &#39;main&#39; window"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A summary of the original findings by the European Commission (1):&#34;By decision of 18 July 2018, the Commission fined Google for having abused its dominant position by imposing anticompetitive contractual restrictions on manufacturers of mobile devices and on mobile network operators, in some cases since 1 January 2011. Three types of restriction were identified:1. those contained in ‘distribution agreements’, requiring manufacturers of mobile devices to pre-install the general search (Google Search) and (Chrome) browser apps in order to be able to obtain a licence from Google to use its app store (Play Store);2. those contained in ‘anti-fragmentation agreements’, under which the operating licences necessary for the pre-installation of the Google Search and Play Store apps could be obtained by mobile device manufacturers only if they undertook not to sell devices running versions of the Android operating system not approved by Google;3. those contained in ‘revenue share agreements’, under which the grant of a share of Google’s advertising revenue to the manufacturers of mobile devices and the mobile network operators concerned was subject to their undertaking not to pre-install a competing general search service on a predefined portfolio of devices.&#34;1: https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/p1_3862705/en/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cool. The EU does have its [many!] faults. But they have a pretty good track record when it comes to consumer rights and consumer choice. Next up I&#39;d like to see them do the same for the plethora of incompatible cordless power-tool systems out there as they did with insisting all mobile phones standardise on a USB connector."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The fallout from this should be interesting. This fine is a substantial part (roughly 25%!) of Google&#39;s overall revenue from the EMEA region (Europe, Middle East, Africa), of which the EU is probably like 90%, at least, of the total, so it&#39;s probably toing the line of actually making the EU unprofitable to Google considering the costs of future compliance to avoid being fined again. Worse: this was not as steep as the fine could have been, they could&#39;ve fined them about double this amount under current regulations, but chose not to. Probably because that would have pushed Google&#39;s EU operations into the red for sure and made the decision easy for them.To be sure the company won&#39;t be in trouble financially, their global revenue can cover the fine, but that doesn&#39;t stop the EU from potentially being a net loss for the company going forward. Abandoning the EU would be a drastic step, though. It&#39;s going to be interesting to see how they adapt to this. Another fine on this scale and I think they will pull out."</p>

On FB I have been finding interesting local groups and events (just moved to a new city) and on Instagram, I have been enjoying seeing updates from real friends.On the other hand I recently deleted Twitter from my phone. I love twitter for getting interesting infromation and staying up to date with news, but the whole culture there has just turned into cheap dunking on one another, and its just guaranteed to leave you feeling angry about something. Extremely disruptive to mental state.I spend some time on the TikTok-like products as well (youtube shorts / fb reels) and have found them to be just a really easy way to completely waste an hour for no reason whatsoever. Less disruptive to mental state than twitter though."</p>

Time to use the skip button.I guess that&#39;s simply how it works nowadays in publishing: writing the book is work, but then you also need to spend quite some time promoting it, in the hopes not only that it boosts sales, but also that the boosted sales put the book in some bestseller lists, boosting sales even further."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is already an open media format (edit: for object-based immersive audio), it&#39;s called SMPTE 2098. Granted it&#39;s basically the mutant stepchild of DTS and Dolby ATMOS, but it does exist.The real problem isn&#39;t the hardware manufacturers but the content producers. Dolby engages in blatant anticompetitive behavior that basically requires hardware manufacturers to support their codecs and make it impossible to innovate on the actual media formats in a way that might compete.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me the core of this issue is that sometimes government officials truly believe their missions are more important than free speech. They may think that their job is actually to suppress free speech unfortunately.Especially common is for national security to override free speech in the minds of government officials. They can easily convince themselves that they need to suppress certain viewpoints in order to save many lives. It just coincidentally also saves their own jobs.I think unfortunately that young people would prefer less free speech and for the government to enforce more confirming perspectives.One other core issue for people who want the tech companies to stop listening to government to consider is the fact that the government has police, guns, prisons, and legal sanctions available to enforce it&#39;s policy decisions."</p>

The CDC or other government agency says &#34;We believe X is misinformation, and if you don&#39;t act on that, we will penalize you in some way&#34;.The former is perfectly legitimate, and exactly what e.g. public health agencies ought to be doing: offering opinions and advice to the private sector and public. The latter is a first amendment violation.Presumably, some of these cases will also turn on whether there was an implicit regulatory threat in the &#34;recommendations&#34; given.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is distributed SQLite 3, running (I assume at least partially managed?) LiteFS[5] for you. Which is pretty cool!What I&#39;d like to have seen is how this compares to things like rqlite[1] or Cloudflare&#39;s D1[2] addressed directly in the articleThat said, I think this is pretty good for things like read replica&#39;s. I know the sales pitch here is as a full database, and I don&#39;t disagree with it, and if I was starting from scratch today and could use this, I totally would give it a try and benchmark / test accordingly, however I can&#39;t speak to that use case directly.What I find however and what I can speak to, is that most workloads already have database of some kind setup, typically not SQLite as their main database (MySQL or PostgreSQL seem most common). This is a great way to make very - insanely, really - fast read replica&#39;s across regions of your data. You can use an independent raft[3][4] implementation to do this on write. If your database supports it, you can even trigger a replication directly from a write to the database itself (I think Aurora has this ability, and I think - don&#39;t quote me! - PostgreSQL can do this natively via an extension to kick off a background job)To that point, in my experience one thing SQLite is actually really good at is storing JSON blobs. I have successfully used it for replicating JSON representations of read only data in the past to great success, cutting down on read times significantly for APIs as the data is &#34;pre-baked&#34; and the lightweight nature of SQLite allows you to - if you wanted to naively do this - just spawn a new database for each customer and transform their data accordingly ahead of time. Its like AOT compilation for your data.if you want to avoid some complexity with sharding (you can&#39;t always avoid it outright, but this can help cap its complexity) this approach helps enormously in my experience. Do try before you buy!EDIT: Looks like its running LiteFS[5] not LiteStream[0]. This is my error of understanding.[0]: https://litestream.io/[1]: https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite[2]: https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-d1/[3]: https://raft.github.io/[4]: https://raft.github.io/#implementations[5]: https://github.com/superfly/litefs"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really cool! Unfortunately i primarily am interested in offline databases so perhaps i&#39;m just not the target audience. However i have to ask, on that note, does this have any application in the offline space?Ie i wonder if there&#39;s a way to can write your applications such that they have less/minimal contention, and then allow the databases to merge when back online? Of course, what happens when there inevitably _is_ contention? etcNot sure that idea would have a benefit over many SQLite DBs with userland schemas mirroring CRDT principles though. But a boy can dream.Regardless, very cool work being done here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Developing against a relational database requires devs to watch out for &#34;N+1&#34; query patterns, where a query leads to a loop that leads to more queries. N+1 queries against Postgres and MySQL can be lethal to performance. Not so much for SQLite.This is misleading AFAICT. The article(s) is actually comparing remote RDBMS to local RDBMS, not Postgres to SQLite.Postgres can also be served over a UNIX socket, removing the individual query overhead due to TCP roundtrip.SQLite is a great technology, but keep in mind that you can also deploy Postgres right next to your app as well. If your app is something like a company backend that could evolve a lot and benefit from Postgres&#39;s advanced features, this may be the right choice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I hesitated posting this, because I don&#39;t want to be too negative, but: ugh.  ChromeOS is just more Google adware/tracking-ware, locking people into the Google ecosystem, and (by default, at least) creating a more locked-down environment than a general-purpose OS would have (not quite iOS or even Android, but still not with the flexibility of a &#34;mainstream&#34; OS).  I feel like Framework could be spending their time doing much better things.  Granted, if they believe that this will be a big boost to their bottom line / margins / sustainability, then I&#39;m in favor of it on the grounds of helping make sure Framework is a successful company.My hope was that this is just running on the standard Framework laptop hardware, but it looks like it required a bit of a mainboard redesign, as well as a different input cover and keyboard.  Extra hardware like that just makes their offering more difficult for a customer to navigate and understand, not to mention the added support and manufacturing burden on the company&#39;s side."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a couple HP Chromebook 13 G1 laptops that I loved quite a lot for ~5 years as my primary personal laptop.  It worked really well for 95% of my needs, especially once it got the Linux container support (which was ~4 years in).The first one I got was $550 for the 8GB RAM model with i5 and &#34;retina&#34; screen, that was a refurb from Woot, almost half off.  The second one I got around a year ago when Linux container support landed, 16GB RAM, i7, &#34;retina&#34; screen.  That one I got off ebay for $120 landed.  I also got my son one that he used until a few days ago.  Pretty decent little machine for that price.My son switched to a $120 Windows ASUS laptop this past weekend because the Chromebook wouldn&#39;t run Windows games.  I was half expecting him to give up on the new laptop because 4GB isn&#39;t much RAM, but he says it works great.My mother in law was recently asking for laptop advice for a &#34;ward of the court&#34; she oversees that could do with a laptop to do zoom meetings for the court appearances, and to use for school.  I went looking for Chromebooks and found: they are all priced the same as a similarly speced Windows laptop.  The things I value about ChromeOS (&#34;instant&#34; updates, &#34;nothing really on the device&#34;, &#34;security&#34;) aren&#39;t things the average person (let alone teen) really care about...  Kind of hard to recommend a Chromebook for the average person these days, unless I&#39;m missing something."</p>

On 18 September he then wrote a letter to the German astronomer Galle at the Berlin observatory.After receiving the letter 5 days later Galle immediately set up his telescope the same night and found a +8 mag star (within 1 degree of the Le Verrier&#39;s calculation) not listed on the official Prussian star chart. The next night he managed to measure the star itself moving by 4 arcseconds, finally confirming Le Verrier prediction of a new planet (and to this day last).At ~30 AU (30x the distance sun-earth; Uranus being at ~20 AU) the discovery instantaneously made the solar system 1.5x bigger ;)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have written this before but I’ll put it here again. What I would like to see is a federated search engine. Based on activitypub that works like mastodon. Don’t like the results from one source? Just remove them from your sources, or lower their ranking. Similar to yacy but you can work with the protocol to connect or build whatever type of index you want using whatever technology you like, and communicate over an existing standard. Want to build the worlds best index of Pokémon sites, then go do it. Want to build a search engine using idris or ats? Sure! I did note the professors are on mastodon so perhaps this may actually happen.One of these days I’ll actually implement the above assuming nobody else does. I figured if I can at least get the basics done and a reference implementation that’s easy to run it could prove the concept. If anyone is interested in this do email my in my bio.What I worry about for this project is that it becomes another island which prohibits remixing of results like google and bing, and its own index and ranking algorithms become gamed.I wish the creators best of luck though. I am also hoping for some more blogs and papers about the internals of he engine. So little information is published in the space that anything is welcome, especially if it’s deeply technical."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seriously... I really wanted to like this project, but it seems everything EU touches as of recently gets worse.From the webpafe that half of the time shows &#34;Resource Limit exceeded&#34; to a technology stack diagram on the bottom of this page https://openwebsearch.eu/the-project/ being completely unreadable due to bad scaling.It is very disappointing really. Another example from the top of my head. Here in Poland we have ID cards(as every other EU country) . Those ID cards have to be renewed every now and then (10~15years). In last years an online system for government services was implemented  including for renewal of those cards. One could take a photo with a mobile phone, submit an application and pick up a card from a gov office in few weeks time. Unfortunately, EU made a law that ID cards applications have to be acommpanied by biometrics (fingerprints) so this system has been thrown away. One has to physically go to the gov office, scan their fingerprints, apply for a new id card and then go again to pick it up...Ok, so what happens in 10 years time? They should have the fingerprints already, right? No. They take the fingerprints, they store them only until one picks up the id card and then they are deleted. There are no fingerprint database, they are not stored anywhere. The fingerprints are used only to ensure the same person that submitted the application picks up the document. It makes zero sense, other than to break the previous online system. Thanks EU."</p>

DLSS is always great on any title that offers it, but again the real issue is that most of the games that people put real time into are the types of games for which RT is irrelevant. Graphical showpiece stuff is just a lot less relevant to the contemporary gaming market than it used to be."</p>

The test harness appears to do a `sleep(1)` between test creations, but this sort of thing can have weird boundary cases, particularly because (1) it does cleanup after creation, which will have variable latency, (2) `int()` will truncate the fractional part of the second from `time()`, and (3) `time.time()` is not monotonic.I would not ask the author to spend money to test it again, but I think the 409s would probably disappear if you replaced `int(time())` with `uuid.uuid4()`.Disclosure: I work at Google - on Google Compute Engine. :-)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anecdotally I tend to agree with the author. But this really isn&#39;t a great way of comparing cloud services.The fundamental problem with cloud reliability is that it depends on a lot of stuff that&#39;s out of your control, that you have no visibility into. I have had services running happily on AWS with no errors, and the next month without changing anything they fail all the time.Why? Well, we look into it and it turns out AWS changed something behind the scenes. There&#39;s a different underlying hardware behind the instance, or some resource started being in high demand because of some other customers.So, I completely believe that at the time of this test, this particular API was performing a lot better on AWS than on GCP. But I wouldn&#39;t count on it still performing this way a month later. Cloud services aren&#39;t like a piece of dedicated hardware where you test it one month, and then the next month it behaves roughly the same. They are changing a lot of stuff that you can&#39;t see."</p>

Which I can&#39;t see until the form is submitted.At the time I was using Opera, so I wrote in to their customer support suggesting that the prompt appear after the new page loaded. I never heard back, but a couple months later their next major release implemented exactly that behavior. A few months after that, every other browser followed suit.I can&#39;t have been the only one bothered by the existing behavior, but given how long browsers had worked that way before I wrote in, I like to tell myself that the timing wasn&#39;t a coincidence, and that my little suggestion rippled out into a change that made a small thing better for the whole world :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a developer who’s been working with React since the beta, I can confidently say that the author is speaking the truth. Especially so near the end of the article where they can’t seem to quit React.For all the annoyances of Hooks, they really are a godsend when it comes to composing state. And refs do indeed suck, but they sucked even more with class based components. I can’t tell you how many times I was able to solve a complex DOM state issue with custom hooks wrapped around refs.Newer tools like Svelte and Solid do look promising as far as removing boilerplate, but they personally feel a step too far off the path of “it’s just JavaScript.”Has anyone else here successfully left for greener JS pastures?"</p>

Use a functional component in these cases. But if you&#39;re doing something more complicated then stop treating class components like the fucking devil. They have their place."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A great idea.  Now, everyone that learns this stuff, show some restraint!The drawback of a powerful type system is you can very easily get yourself into a type complexity mudhole.  Nothing worse than trying to call a method where a simple `Foo` object would do but instead you&#39;ve defined 60 character definition of `Foo` capabilities in the type system in the method signature.Less is more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Over the years, the type system of TypeScript has grown from basic type annotations to a large and complex programming language.Give someone (particularly a developer) the opportunity to build something complicated and undoubtedly they will. So now you have two problems, the complicated program that actually does some hopefully useful work, and another complicated program on top of it that fills your head and slows you down when trying to fix the first complicated program. You may say &#39;ah yes, but the second complicated program validates the first!&#39;. Not really, it just makes things more complicated. Almost all bugs are logic bugs or inconsistent state bugs (thanks OOP!), almost none are type bugs.However, static analysis of existing code (in Javascript), without having to write a single extra character, may well have great value in indicating correctness.Edit:&gt; TypeScript&#39;s type system is a full-fledged programming language in itself!Run! Run as fast as you can! Note that this &#39;full-fledged programming language&#39; doesn&#39;t actually do anything (to their credit they admit this later on)Edit2:&gt; [...] is a type-level unit test. It won&#39;t type-check until you find the correct solution.&gt; I sometimes use @ts-expect-error comments when I want to check that an invalid input is rejected by the type-checker. @ts-expect-error only type-checks if the next line does not!What new level of hell are we exploring now??I am genuinely afraid and I&#39;m only halfway through this thing. What&#39;s next? A meta type level language to check that our type checking checks??&gt; 3. Objects &amp; Records&gt; COMING SOON!&gt; this chapter hasn&#39;t been published yet.Thank God, I am saved."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I currently have to occasionally contribute to a TypeScript codebase at work. I appreciate how much better it is than Javascript. When I write code as an outsider (Java and Go developer), I feel like I use the type system in sensible and readable ways. When I look at the code written by the native TypeScript experts in my company it is a bewildering, abstract, unreadable morass. I have no idea what&#39;s going on half the time."</p>

So, if such a system was to &#34;denoise&#34; (or compress, which - if you think about it - is basically the same operation) CT scans, X-rays, MRIs, etc., in ambiguous areas it could plug-in diseased tissue where the ground-truth was actually healthy.Or the opposite, which is even worse: substitute diseased areas of the scan with healthy looking imagery it had been trained on.Reading recent publications that try to do &#34;denoising&#34; or resolution &#34;enhancement&#34; in medical imaging contexts, the authors seem to be completely oblivious to this pitfall.(maybe they had a background as World Bank / IMF economists?)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few thoughts that aren&#39;t related to each other.1. This is a brilliant hack. Kudos.2. It would be great to see the best codecs included in the comparison - AVIF and JPEG XL. Without those it&#39;s rather incomplete. No surprise that JPEG and WEBP totally fall apart at that bitrate.3. A significant limitation of the approach seems to be that it targets extremely low bitrates where other codecs fall apart, but at these bitrates it incurs problems of its own (artifacts take the form of meaningful changes to the source image instead of blur or blocking, very high computational complexity for the decoder).When only moderate compression is needed, codecs like JPEG XL already achieve very good results. This proof of concept focuses on the extreme case, but I wonder what would happen if you targeted much higher bitrates, say 5x higher than used here. I suspect (but have no evidence) that JPEG XL would improve in fidelity faster as you gave it more bits than this SD-based technique. Transparent compression, where the eye can&#39;t tell a visual difference between source and transcode (at least without zooming in) is the optimal case for JPEG XL. I wonder what sort of bitrate you&#39;d need to provide that kind of guarantee with this technique."</p>

It required me to resolve a CAPTCHA challenge for every other search. This luckily only lasted a day.Cloudflare shares IP reputation data with partners like Google, coordinated through a program called the Bandwidth Alliance. So, my original offense might not even have been against Cloudflare. It might have received the reputation data from a partner, and it just propagated through the Bandwidth Alliance network.That&#39;s not what Bandwidth Alliance is at all. It&#39;s about reducing or eliminating egress fees between a cloud provider and Cloudflare. Not sure where the idea that it&#39;s about sharing IP reputation data comes from.https://www.cloudflare.com/bandwidth-alliance/So, if Google Search started showing a CAPTCHA that&#39;s not Cloudflare."</p>

Captchas are everywhere: in many cases, you can&#39;t even complete simple GETs of blogs without donating free labor to CF.And the most infuriating part, you get CF marketing messages right in your face while your browser is calculating hashcash (I guess?)... At this point I can recognize every single one of them: something about bots making up 40% of all internet traffic, something about their web scraper protection racket, something about small businesses (???), etc etc...To be fair, Tor exit nodes have an awful reputation for sure.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This essay is getting a surprising amount of hate, and I must confess that my first impression on reading it was that it sounded an awful lot like a Robert Kiyosaki book [1].  But then I followed the two links in the essay [2] [3] and that put it into perspective: the thing that Paul learned from his users is that they are looking for The Answer, the formula, the procedure for how to succeed, and there is no such formula.  It&#39;s like Goedel&#39;s incompleteness theorem, except that it&#39;s not a theorem.  People come to YC and buy Robert Kiyosaki&#39;s books hoping to find an Answer that simply doesn&#39;t exist.The difference between Paul and Robert is that Paul is up-front about this while Robert is cagey and deceptive and makes his money by stringing people along thinking that The Answer can be found by buying one more of his books.  But I think a lot of the hate here is driven by disappointment that Paul is honest, and that his answer is that there is no Answer.  It can be frustrating to hear that (which is also something that Paul explicitly points out).---[1] https://www.amazon.com/Rich-Dad-Poor-Teach-Middle/dp/1612680...[2] http://paulgraham.com/lesson.html[3] http://paulgraham.com/before.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Prompted by the negative feedback that this essay received, ranging from being a sales pitch in disguise, to being a word salad going in all directions without answering the central question posed by the author right in the opening paragraphs, I had to go and re-examine the piece and see if these concerns are valid or not, and unexpectedly the second reading reaffirmed my initial positive reaction that this is actually a good piece, maybe not the best, but still good.In spirit of open discussion and intellectual curiosity here, I share my insights in the following order matching that of the post:1) PG opens with the best advice that he could dispense to prospective applicants which is &#34;what you&#39;ve learned from users&#34;.2) He proceeds to ask himself the same question.3) He then informs readers that his users; startup founders, usually face the same set of problems across the board.4) Since these problems are the same, he thought of automating the solution to scale his business (dogfooding in some sense).5) That blew up in his face spectacularly that he had to rework the plan and concede that his solution won&#39;t scale.6) But these same problems are not recognized uniformly by founders as they sometimes face difficulties identifying them in the first place, that&#39;s where the YC partners&#39; role come to fill this unmet need.7) Even when people are good at identifying problems, some are bad at determining the severity or urgency that these problems pose, cue again the YC partners&#39; role.8) Even when they&#39;re good at risk assessment, some are bad at risk mitigation, and won&#39;t listen to the advice given by the partners but it is not made clear what he means exactly by &#34;not listening&#34;, dismissing/not acting on solutions proposed by YC staff, or not acknowledging that there&#39;s a problem to begin with?9) Getting down to business to solve these problems warrants focus, and how this focus is tied into speed, and how YC can help with that.10) Startup colleagues are more important than YC partners when it comes to realizing success with their feedback, guidance and even practical help, and how YC is the best in class in this regard.Even though the marketing language, esp the value propositions in the piece is a bit stronger for my taste, but I can&#39;t say with honesty that it overpowered the core message of the essay nor was it incoherent or disjointed in anyway that made following or understanding impossible as some have claimed here.Verdict: 8/10"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Instantiating a runtime in microseconds is deeply exciting!Though after skimming through the docs, I&#39;m still left wondering a few things:- JS is notably missing from the list of languages supported on the front page. But I see mentions of a Spidermonkey.wasm in the blog post. Is running JS on top of wasmtime in production a realistic prospect today? If so, where can I read more? (mainly interested in this for the instantiation time benefits, though maybe all/most of that will be negated by the embedded JS engine?)- How should I go about building a typical web service on top of wasmtime? Can wasmtime itself handle network requests/connections or would I need to build the web server in some other host language and pass request data to wasmtime modules? Haven&#39;t been able to find anything in the docs about this.- What would it take to build a multitenant web service where customer code is isolated using wasmtime, like the one like described in the post?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m sold on the future of wasm. What really still bothers me is the effort and hoops I have to jump through to actually leverage it. Networking, just fix networking so I can drop in most things and it would be great. The fact that I have to rewrite the majority of my network access to do any external IO is painful but I get that containers took more than a decade after Google&#39;s use to get there too."</p>

For every new document-id or comment-id, there will be a new pre-flight request.Alternative hacks: Offer a variant of your API format that either1. Moves the resource path to the request body (or to a header that is included in &#34;Vary&#34;). Though the rest of your stack (load balancing, observability, redaction) might not be ok with this, e.g. do your WAF rules support matching on the request body? You also will no longer get automatic path-based caching for GET requests.2. Conforms to the rules of a CORS &#34;simple&#34; request [1], which won&#39;t trigger a pre-flight request. This is what we did on the Dropbox API [2]. You&#39;ll need to move the auth information from the Authorization header to a query parameter or the body, which can be dangerous wrt redaction, e.g. many tools automatically redact the Authorization header but not query parameters.[1] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simpl...[2] https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation/http/docume...

Once this happens it starts recommending videos you&#39;ve already watched or older videos from creators you&#39;ve been watching lately.Personally, I&#39;d love it if you could curate the recommendation system a bit more. I&#39;m never interested in rewatching stuff I&#39;ve already seen. And the recency bias for recommendations means you&#39;re always getting more if what you&#39;ve recently consumed. I&#39;d like it if more older interests were mixed in. Finally, I&#39;d love to be able to blacklist certain topics and games entirely.There&#39;s so much missed potential with YouTube recommendations.Some might say that you can still use search, but that has been crippled to include unrelated recommendations after one page of results. Not only that, I want YouTube to help me discover new content. When the recommendation system works and it shows me new kinds of interesting stuff, it&#39;s superb. TikTok is eating YouTube&#39;s lunch in this regard.Edit: forgot to mention this. On mobile if you do a recommendation refresh it&#39;ll show a New to You filter which you can use to explore more diverse recommendations. I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s hidden in this manner."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I didn’t like when they removed the dislike counts, and I still don’t like it.When I look for videos of folks working on Subarus, I don’t want to have to manually scrub through the video to gauge the quality. Before I’d just look at the ratio and if I was feeling generous I’d preview the frames to see if they had what I wanted.Now it takes me at least 2 mins longer to get to the same judgement which begs the question of why I’m watching a video when I have a book on my lap and a car waiting outside."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of how games (coughLeagueOfLegendscough) match me up with a player that I literally just reported for harassment, griefing etc. in the previous match.  Like, there weren&#39;t any other possible players to match me with out of the many thousands?  I don&#39;t mind waiting a few more seconds to match up with someone else!I&#39;m getting a lot of responses as if I expect the player to be totally blocked from matching with me, but that&#39;s not really what I mean.  Even a basic &#34;temporary match score reduction&#34; would work.  I would also expect a cooldown system where the reduction caused by reporting no longer applies.  Arguing against the idea &#34;because it creates a prisoner&#39;s island&#34; misses the subtlety of a well-thought-out implementation where reporting simply lowers the matchup &#34;rank&#34; for a while, and serial-false-reporters have their reports basically nullified/ignored."</p>
