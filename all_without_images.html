								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"E Ink is a great example of how the patent system stifles innovation.One company developed a small, expensive, newspaper-quality electrophoretic display with a refresh rate so terrible it was only suitable for books, decided that that was good enough, and 15 years later every comment in this thread is looking forward to finally seeing some innovation in this space &#34;once the patents expire.&#34;That is some first class bullshit. We could have had large form, glossy brochure quality displays with video refresh rates by now, but nobody outside of China wanted to get anywhere near this patent minefield."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a 13.3-inch Dasung e-ink monitor, and use it daily for three to six hours (basically, whenever I use my PC). Some days ago the HDMI cable it came with broke, so before I had the opportunity to replace it, I had to switch back to an LED monitor for the time being. Well, surely anyone can already guess what happened... After just a couple of days, I came upon a long forgotten enemy: eye fatigue. Blurry vision, trouble focusing it, and a light headache.Like many others here, I wish the technology could have advanced faster and been made more accessible for everyone. Without the obstacles it still faces, I&#39;m sure we would already have color screens with a good refresh rate. C&#39;est la vie."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It looks like the breakthrough here is in making a large (bigger than e-reader-sized) e-paper display available as a self-contained, HDMI-compatible monitor instead of just a display assembly for OEMs and experienced DIYers.While I don’t expect this to also be a breakthrough in terms of pricing, hopefully it starts driving the volume that will eventually make this type of display more accessible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s no intentional or manual effort at Google to promote pinterest.Pinterest shows up because they understand how the Google algorithm works and built their website to display all the signals that Google looks for in relevant image content.They understand user intent and generate URLs that present content in a way that google expects to see.Examples of how they do this from their engineering team:https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/demystifying-seo-wi...More:https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/tagged/seo"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related: in the last several years, there started appearing these StackOverflow mirrors. It&#39;s gotten to the point that you can&#39;t google a programming question without running into at least one. Some copy the questions and answers verbatim, some use machine translation to (crappily) translate them into my native language. Sometimes they even rank higher than the real StackOverflow.I really wish there was a non-hacky way to ban sites from Google search results. I also feel like Google&#39;s ranking algorithm is utterly broken since it&#39;s amenable to this kind of exploitation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One big reason why Pinterest ranks so highly, and why you are seeing different tld&#39;s in the results, is because they have a variety of tld&#39;s that they use and those tld&#39;s all have separate crawl budgets from each other. So Google crawls Pinterest about an order of magnitude more than most other sites. You can read more about this here: https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/how-switching-our-d...Source: I run a think tank focused on Google’s web crawling advantage and have been studying stuff like this for a couple years now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; &#34;But why&#34;, I hear from the back. Having Linux available makes it easier to port emulators and fb or console games.&gt; Most importantly, because I can.Good. All I can say is at least it is something different to what I keep seeing on HN. (React, Rust, Kubernetes, JAMstack, JavaScript, etc.)Probably present this somewhere in a conference (CCC, FOSDEM, etc). Who knows who could be looking at this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To be clear, this is a tech demo; we&#39;re long past the point where running anything useful on a system with graphics and 4MB (8MB with expansion) of RAM under Linux is reasonable. You can barely get the kernel itself that small. There&#39;s a reason why even cheapo consumer routers have at least 64MB of RAM.So it&#39;s for fun; you won&#39;t be able to run any existing &#34;normal&#34; Linux emulators and you&#39;d be better off porting stuff to run on bare metal than trying to squeeze it in under Linux on an N64. Cool project, fun, great that it&#39;s getting upstreamed... just keep in mind it&#39;s not really useful for end users for anything (unlike, say, Wii Linux, where with ~80MB of RAM you can actually get somewhere, though still with many limitations).OTOH, as other people have mentioned, it makes a good test case for N64 emulators. If they can run this, that&#39;s good validation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is, of course, cool. No doubt. I have an EverDrive 64 and I’ll probably test this out later today or tomorrow.I am skeptical that this would be the preferred way to port emulators or graphical games. You’re not getting a budget SGI workstation out of this, because the OS kernel itself is only a small part.The N64 is built around a chip called the Reality Control Processor, or RCP. This contains the RSP, stripped-down MIPS CPU core with a fixed-point SIMD vector unit, and the RDP, a rasterization engine that does simple trilinear texture interpolation and color blending. This is the hard part of programming the N64, and it’s not something that’s addressed by swapping out the OS kernel.There are… a number of major challenges you will still have to face if you want to make homebrew software for the N64, unless you are okay with just having something on the CPU and writing to the framebuffer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the original paper&gt;&gt; SrTiO3 is a suitable photocatalytic material for the assessment of this possibility. This compound is a well characterized photocatalyst with a bandgap energy of 3.2 eV (ref. 11–14), and its EQE for overall water splitting has been improved by up to 69% over the past years using various refinements.Here, we increased the EQE to its upper limit by constructing highly active HER and OER cocatalysts on SrTiO3:Al particles site-selectively. This was accomplished by using a stepwise photodeposition method instead of an impregnation process, which results in random dispersion of the cocatalysts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The abstract of the paper makes it sound good:&gt;Overall water splitting, evolving hydrogen and oxygen in a 2:1 stoichiometric ratio,  using particulate photocatalysts is a potential means of achieving scalable and economically viable solar hydrogen production. To obtain high solar energy conversion efficiency, the quantum efficiency of the photocatalytic reaction must be increased over a wide range of wavelengths and semiconductors with narrow bandgaps need to be designed. However, the quantum efficiency associated with overall water splitting using existing photocatalysts is typically lower than ten per cent1,2. Thus, whether a particulate photocatalyst can enable a quantum efficiency of 100 per cent for the greatly endergonic water-splitting reaction remains an open question. Here we demonstrate overall water splitting at an external quantum efficiency of up to 96 per cent at wavelengths between 350 and 360 nanometres, which is equivalent to an internal quantum efficiency of almost unity, using a modified aluminium-doped strontium titanate (SrTiO3:Al) photocatalyst3,4. By selectively photodepositing the cocatalysts Rh/Cr2O3 (ref. 5) and CoOOH (refs. 3,6) for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively, on different crystal facets of the semiconductor particles using anisotropic charge transport, the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions could be promoted separately. This enabled multiple consecutive forward charge transfers without backward charge transfer, reaching the upper limit of quantum efficiency for overall water splitting. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of overall water splitting free from charge recombination losses and introduces an ideal cocatalyst/photocatalyst structure for efficient water splitting.Not so sure about the fuelcellsworks article clickbaiting up the &#39;quantum&#39; bit when all it means is one photon splitting one H2O."</p>

Or use its own DSL for simpler scripts.I wish it had support for a more modern / more popular languages for scripting. I wonder if QuickJS[1] can be integrated into it. Or Python.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Illiad.  As the foundation of Western literature, it may have received the greatest amount of hype that it is possible to receive.I had attempted to read it and The Odyssey when I was much younger, in middle school, maybe too young, and failed miserably.  But as it is always with cultural touchstones, references to it are inescapable, and a few years ago, in my mid 50s I overcame the reluctance accumulated in the intervening time and set out to read the Samuel Butler prose translation of 1898.  Most of the translations I&#39;d previously approached were in verse, which is in some ways its own hill to climb when one is customarily a prose reader, so this seemed perfect.And so it was, and I was bowled over.  It was a mind bending experience for me the likes of which I experience much to infrequently as age and experience take their toll on the novelties of youth.  I can&#39;t say the last work I read I experienced as electrically.  For all the stiltedness of epic story telling, the personalities of Agamemnon, Achilles, Zeus, et al are both vivid and convincing; the violence of battle is  horrible, electric, and wierdly beautiful in a way that will resonate recognizably with fans Sam Peckinpaugh or Hong Kong action movies.  Though the characterizations are far more stereotyped, as befits the age in which it was produced, than modern readers are accustomed to, they still evince a polish that rises above conventional story telling into true literature.  Worth every ounce of effort you expend to summit this one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Wire.I&#39;d tried to watch it a few times, but only a few months ago actually got past the first two episodes. I think it helped that I quite quickly saw it as a morally ambiguous discussion of the institutional ineptitude of conservative western cultures in mitigating the effects of crime, rather than a typical &#39;good vs bad&#39; cop show.With that mindset, the possibly-underwhelming finale of S1 is much more effective, and the sudden pace-change in S2 is more meaningful."</p>

So many of the guys i work with know about LSD (Limited Slip Differentials) and locking differentials/hubs, but dont entirely understand why they are needed or how they work once the wheels are back on the ground.if you really want to see something cool, check out interaxle differentials and detroit dfifferentials. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-d-uOYCrREtorsen differentials are incredible as they can in many cases overcome the traction difference problem https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEiSTzK-A2A"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The lack of background music and pace is really interesting to me.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A good thing about that film is that after seeing it if I can&#39;t remember how a differential works I usually can remember the steps they took to get to how a differential works and then figure it out myself from there.That suggests that it didn&#39;t just tell me how a differential works. It taught me how someone who needs to invent a differential should think about the problem."</p>

[...] The law means you won&#39;t have to make anymore phone calls to obscure customer service hotlines to cancel services like news subscriptions, music streaming or meal plans, for example.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have one that is even better. Bell Canada. They require you to speak to the &#34;loyalty&#34; team before you can have a service cancelled.  That team is only available by phone. That team has a 1 hour wait time during the hours that they are open. That team likes to hang up on you.  That team calls you back from numbers that cannot accept calls.  That team is not available by chat or email and every other department has no access in the tools to effectively cancel a service.I escalated to the crtc and opened a case. I got a call back from someone who was very good at apologising for this policy but was at the same time very clear that this was within their legal rights as a service provider.Super convenient that I can sign up to any service with one click though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am pretty sure Baremetrics wouldn&#39;t be able to do business in California with that policy.CA passed a law in 2018 requiring companies that allow people to signup online to also allow them to cancel online https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtm...&#34;In addition to the requirements of subdivision (b), a consumer who accepts an automatic renewal or continuous service offer online shall be allowed to terminate the automatic renewal or continuous service exclusively online&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I owe my career and livelihood to Ruby, Rails and the community. When I started learning programming I was overwhelmed because of c, c++ and JavaScript. Tried a bit of Python too. 
I thought I would never get a hold of any programming language ever. One day I tried this mysterious language from Japan(That&#39;s how I knew Ruby at the time) on tryruby.org. Ruby was breath of a fresh air. Code read like English. I was making small CLIs which required so much work in every other language. That was enough to get me hooked. Then I learned about Rails and never looked back.
Happy to see this language making new strides with this release. This is a thank you note to Matz and the community."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember when Rails first was released. I kept the source code for Ruby and for Rails handy, and it was sort-of possible to wrap my head around both. One of the most fun non-AI conferences that I ever went to was Merb Camp in San Diego where the Merb team announced merging with Rails.I have such good memories of the four or five years when Ruby was my main driver. Great job by Matz and core team with the 3.0 release.I have gone back to my 1980s roots and now once gain use Common Lisp as my main driver, except for deep learning where I need to use Python (tried Julia and Swift).I think Matz has it exactly right. As programmers it is important to be happy using a language. Life should be fun most of the time, and there is nothing wrong with trying to optimize life for maximum joy we bring to ourselves and other people.BTW, happy holidays!"</p>

I couldn’t wrap my head around it and make myself apply the discipline.A year ago I was dropped in as the lead on a large Ruby project. Suddenly everything clicked. Now all the reading I’ve done on domain driven design and TDD actually has meaning and I’ve written more solid code in a year than the rest of my career combined.And on top of that, while every corner of tech has its toxic personalities, the Ruby community is overwhelmingly friendly, welcoming and mature."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Too bad, maps.me was by far the best maps application for non city use, and ideal for hiking. Commendable initiative to bring it back in its original version!A few examples of why it was so great:Simple, non social bookmarks. As in: place a bookmark so you don&#39;t get lost while hiking, or when you find a nice spot you want to come back to later. Yep, a utility feature that doesn&#39;t somehow map to some stoopid business OKR in advertising. I am sure this is possible with Google maps or Apple maps somehow, but only after you&#39;ve created an account, logged in, and made sure you have the equivalent of a South Korean inner city internet connection.Also, easily downloadable maps that just stay on your phone. I am hiking, I don&#39;t have internet and need the map on my phone. 
I know Google Maps allows you to do that but it is tedious unlike maps.me, which is instant."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One time when I was younger, in my late teens, I was walking through the city around 8pm. I suddenly felt rather cold, and went through the typical 15 seconds of internal grumbling. I then had an epiphany, and walked into a nearby department store to purchase a jacket. Somehow I&#39;d never even considered that as a possibility previously.As silly as it may seem, I use that singular point in time as the reference for when I commenced adulthood. I&#39;ve got no idea if others have similar experiences (I grew up very poor, so I was probably primed against the idea of spontaneously buying something to begin with), but the contents of this list seems to be very much in the same vein."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of an old video of Steve Jobs. His idea is simple, but it&#39;s really powerful. In short: the world is something you can change, not merely participate in.When you grow up, you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world, try not to bash into the walls too much, try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money.That’s a very limited life. Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact, and that is that everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.And the minute that you understand that you can poke life and actually something will, you know if you push in, something will pop out the other side, that you can change it, you can mold it. That’s maybe the most important thing. It’s to shake off this erroneous notion that life is there and you’re just gonna live in it, versus embrace it, change it, improve it, make your mark upon it.I think that’s very important and however, you learn that, once you learn it, you’ll want to change life and make it better, cause it’s kind of messed up, in a lot of ways. Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYfNvmF0Bqw"</p>

AirDrop is really useful when you&#39;re out and about somewhere and you want to send someone a file. In those cases there&#39;s possibly not a WiFi available or in the case of visitors to your home; only you are on the network, not your friend.

And add-ins and tools, like Howard&#39;s own nbdev, can help address what&#39;s missing in Jupyter Notebook.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a UI/UX agency that focusses on B2B SaaS, I’ve always found Fantasy UIs fascinating. It’s the complete opposite of the simple &amp; clean interfaces clients ask us to design.I’ve spent some time thinking about why these Fantasy UIs are so fascinating despite the fact they seem not very user friendly.My conclusion was that fantasy Interfaces are very much like the early web. Lots of moving parts (dancing banana gifs) and you had to figure out the navigation on each website you visited. Today, everything looks and feels the same and we lost the creative spirit of interface building.Figuring out the interface might not be best practice. But at the same time, I remember sharing websites with friends purely based on how fun the navigation and overall controls were.We lost the Art of interface building and turned it into a complete science. There are arguments for both sides.My wish is that... Hopefully.. one day, someone will contact us with a project that allows us to build the first fantasy UI for a real-world SaaS product."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The single biggest common denominator between so many fantasy UIs, is transparent (HUD-style) interfaces. I was just watching the latest episode of The Expanse, last night, and saw them all using these transparent PDA/phones.Ever try using a transparent UI? It&#39;s absolutely maddening.Looks cool on the screen, but is pretty much unusable IRL."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Looking up who Roderick Colenbrander is (person who submitted the patch over at https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-input/patch/20201...), it seems they are the &#34;Director of Hardware &amp; Systems Engineering&#34; over at Sony. I&#39;d expect them to spend time on more higher-level things, but seems here they either was involved with actually writing the driver, and/or are just the public face for the patch. Seems unusual though. Kudos if directors at Sony still get to write code, especially low-level code like this.Edit: Seems there is more details in a almost year old article on phoronix (https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Sony-HID...):&gt; Roderick Colenbrander of Sony who serves as their Directory of Hardware &amp; Systems Engineering, chimed in on the matter of adding this Gasia controller support (And, yes, this is the same Roderick Colenbrander who in his spare time serves as a Wine developer and if going back to the early 2000&#39;s was the NVClock NVIDIA overclocking tool developer as opposed to being some eager Sony employee):So seems Roderick is a true hacker! I&#39;ve used both Wine and NVClock in the past so if you&#39;re around here, thanks for your work on all these things and upstreaming them as well! :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I still remember that I connected a PS4 controller a few years ago to test a unity game that I was making. I typed apt search ps4 but could not find something so I pressed some buttons and magicly the UI changed. It all just worked no setup no nothing. I also used the controller on windows 10 but you had to use the xbox driver with special software to map the controls to that driver. The fact that everything just worked on linux amazes me to this day."</p>

So for me YouTube is a fountain of knowledge, visual and musical aesthetics etc. Every day I get inspiration, healthy kind of fun and learn something cool, useful and healthy.But people who watch stupid and destructive stuff (even once) are doomed because they are going to get the same and worse kind of content recommended over and over. This is a particularly underestimated social problem indeed.That&#39;s why I recommend to avoid signing-in into YouTube. Better watch anonymously so you can always clean the cookies and get out of the pit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know I&#39;m old but dang for some reason I really dislike recommendations from almost any company.For media I grew up in the 70s and had the TV Guide. I&#39;d look through to see what I wanted to watch, circle some things and then watch. No spying what-so-ever.So, I like for example HN where AFAIK I&#39;m not tracked so much and I choose what I want from the top of the list.Conversely I mostly hate Amazon, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, Youtube, Twitter, Instagram, and all the ad services and any other service that uses some algorithm to decide what to put in my face.It&#39;s to the point that 3 out 4 time I&#39;ll open videos in private windows so they don&#39;t get added to my profile and used for recommendations.I don&#39;t mind going to a tech sight and seeing ads for tech or a car site and seeing ads for cars. Do mind visiting an apartment listing site and then going around the net and having every other sight shove ads for apartments in my face."</p>

Call your parents when you think of them, tell your friends when you love them.83. Compliment people more. Many people have trouble thinking of themselves as smart, or pretty, or kind, unless told by someone else. You can help them out.84. If somebody is undergoing group criticism, the tribal part in you will want to join in the fun of righteously destroying somebody. Resist this, you’ll only add ugliness to the world. And anyway, they’ve already learned the lesson they’re going to learn and it probably isn’t the lesson you want.85. Cultivate compassion for those less intelligent than you. Many people, through no fault of their own, can’t handle forms, scammers, or complex situations. Be kind to them because the world is not.86. Cultivate patience for difficult people. Communication is extremely complicated and involves getting both tone and complex ideas across. Many people can barely do either. Don’t punish them.87. Don’t punish people for trying. You teach them to not try with you. Punishing includes whining that it took them so long, that they did it badly, or that others have done it better.88. Remember that many people suffer invisibly, and some of the worst suffering is shame. Not everybody can make their pain legible.89. Don&#39;t punish people for admitting they were wrong, you make it harder for them to improve.90. In general, you will look for excuses to not be kind to people.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;8. When buying things, time and money trade-off against each other. If you’re low on money, take more time to find deals. If you’re low on time, stop looking for great deals and just buy things quickly online.&#34;I&#39;m finding, as I&#39;ve gotten older, that almost every time I&#39;ve chosen money over time I&#39;ve made a bad decision.And I see this among my family and friends, too.  There&#39;s a mentality that emerges when exchanging time for money that somehow makes it so you waste your time and you end up spending almost or more money than you originally would have.I&#39;m known for saying, &#34;There is a professional person for that...  Let&#39;s get one,&#34; instead of trying to fix the water heater ourselves or get transport 2 tons of gravel.  Others in my family would have dragged the old trailer out of the barn.  Oh, it has a flat.  Fix that.  Oh, the trailer hitch doesn&#39;t fit the new truck, oh, get a new hitch (we&#39;ll use it someday again, surely).  Or get the old truck working, or the older truck working (cause they keep buying cheap used trucks that break down and sit on the property for eternity).  Then go get whatever, and deal with not knowing what they&#39;re doing.  Me, just get it delivered.  Maybe more money, waaaay less hassle.  In the saved time I&#39;ve polished up my CSS skills...Time really is the most precious resource you have.  Think hard before you trade it for anything else."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When it comes to buying things I find my satisfaction is much higher when I spend money to remove an irritant rather than get something completely new.Our home has a long run from the water heater to basically anywhere it is used (This is in the USA where storage heaters are typical).  When it died I had its location moved and got a model with a circulating system that loops around to the downstairs locations (kitchen/bathroom).  Now what took 20-30 seconds to get warm water is 2-3 seconds.  I spent a lot (for me) and it was worth it.I replaced the 2 DIN radio in my car with an android head unit.  Driving became much better with my personal audio selection rather than over the air radio (What&#39;s that?).  A few years later I upgraded the unit and reduced the start time from 20-ish seconds to 2 seconds.  Both changes removed irritants and noticeably improved my quality of life.Previously I would wonder if getting a new car, or bigger TV, or going to Hawaii would improve my life.  Now I am more inclined to seek out irritants and try to find ways of applying money or effort to reduce them.  I&#39;ll still make the occasional new/splurge purchase, most recently Ring video cameras - they&#39;re fun, but that comes second and I&#39;m happier for it."</p>

This was also much of the draw of using frames (which were also attractive for some front-end design use-cases later re-solved with CSS).As apps got more complex, clients got more compute, bandwidth grew, and as web audiences grew, offloadingl much of the page rendering to the client helped to both contain server-side costs and increase or maintain responsiveness to user interactions.Now, as desktop client performance improvement slows down (this isn&#39;t just the slowing of computer speeds, computers are also replaced less frequently), average bandwidth continues to grow, app complexity and sophistication continues to grow, but as server compute cost falls faster than audience size grows, shifting rendering to HTML back to the server and sending more verbose pre-rendered HTML fragments over the wire can make sense as a way of giving users a better experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve never seen one of these &#34;logic in html-attributes&#34; systems take error checking seriously. In stimulus they start to mention it in &#34;Designing For Resilience&#34; (though only for feature-checking), but in &#34;Working With External Resources&#34; where it uses calls network/IO bound calls they never mention how to handle errors or if the framework just leaves it up to you. Stimulus is also where you need to write your own js code, so I guess you could handle it yourself but in turbo when I skimmed the handbook I find no mentions of what/how to handle errors (or even what happens when turbo gets one), and when loading stuff over the network that is pretty much crucial.From the turbo handbook: &#34;An application visit always issues a network request. When the response arrives, Turbo Drive renders its HTML and completes the visit.&#34; Using the phrase &#34;When the response arrives&#34; begs the question of what happens if it doesn&#39;t arrive, or if it takes a minute for it to arrive, or if it arrives but with a faulty status code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As others have noted, seems reasonably similar to LiveView, Livewire and Blazor. I’m somewhat bullish on these approaches - server side rendered monoliths (Rails, Django, etc.) are SO productive, at least for the first few years of development, but lack of interactivity is a big issue, and this solves it well.However, another big issue is the dominance of mobile. More and more, you’ve got 2-3 frontends (web and cross-platform mobile, or explicitly
web, iOS and Android), and you want to power them all with the same backend. RESTful APIs serving up JSON works for all 3, as does GraphQL (not a fan, but many are). This however is totally web-specific - you’ll end up building REST APIs and mobile apps anyways, so the productivity gains end up way smaller, possibly even net negative. Mobile is a big part of why SPAs have dominated - you use the same backend and overall approach/architecture for web and mobile.I’d strongly consider this for a web-only product, but that’s becoming more and more rare."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another great win for the EFF. We shouldn&#39;t forget how much time and effort fighting this kind of thing takes, and we are very lucky to have an organization who&#39;s willing to put in the legwork from which all of us are huge beneficiaries. (Edit: just donated.)I guess it was implied by the article, but wasn&#39;t perfectly clear to me: does this mean that .org just stays with its current holders, ISOC? (Internet Society)As much as ICANN and Ethos Capital acted maliciously in this whole debacle, it&#39;s very possible that the most malicious actor of all was ISOC. In 2002 they were granted the management of a public good (the .org registry), with the idea that they&#39;d administrate it responsibly and fairly. In return, they were well compensated as they managed .org registrations over all these years, which is more or less a license to print money.However, it&#39;s obvious with this attempted sales that ISOC never considered themselves to be a higher-minded steward doing anything for the greater good. To them, .org was an asset to be pumped and dumped at the first, best offer that came along. They were well aware that Ethos had plans to turn .org into a major profit center with a captive audience of all existing .org holders, to the detriment of tens of thousands of non-profits (and many others) worldwide, and enthusiastically agreed to the plan anyway. It was money in their pocket, and the money was good.What would it take for the ICANN to claw back the .org registry and grant it to a more ethical caretaker? (CCOR for example [1].) It seems to me that &#34;easy come, easy go&#34; is a perfect ethos for this situation, and the ISOC shouldn&#39;t be allowed to take another dime from .org.---[1] https://www.ccor.org/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The reason you can’t buy a good webcam is the same reason you can’t buy a high quality monitor outside of LG’s unreliable apple collab.The lazy conglomerates who sell these peripherals often don’t actually produce the parts in them. They simply rebrand commodity cameras and IPS panels in a crap plastic housing and slap their logo on it.Then they give the product a hilariously user-hostile product name, like “PQS GRT46782-WT” as an extra f-you to the user.They don’t care about you because they have no ongoing relationship with you, and their executives mistakenly see their own products as commodities.Combine this with the fact that most home users don’t care about good quality or even know what it is, and you have the current situation.A friend once described the peripheral market as “Assholes selling crap to idiots.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you are looking here to improve your webcam because you started to do remote work, don&#39;t.First try to improve lighting and audio.Any camera will look bad in bad lighting. It is always better to first improve your lighting before you invest in a new camera. Use high CRI lightbulbs and ensure even source color temperature in your room (ie. all lightbulbs should be emitting same color temperature).Audio is also very important. It is processed by different parts of brain and we don&#39;t put so much attention to it but the quality will influence the other person, subconsciously. Also, audio is how the information is being passed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The real reason is buried in the article:You can’t buy a good webcam because the number of people willing to pay a lot of money for a high end webcam is very small.At the lower end, people are satisfied with their built in laptop parts or a cheap webcam that sits on top of their monitor.At the high end, people go down the rabbit hole of buying a do-everything mirrorless camera that they can use for so much more than just a webcam.A high end webcam would have to be cheap enough that the first group doesn’t mind spending a bit more, but not so expensive that the enthusiast target audience just decides to buy a full-featured mirror less camera instead.Granted, there is a lot of room for improvement in that budgetary middle ground, but how many people actually care? Common webcams actually perform decently when given proper lighting conditions. We’re not streaming high-bitrate 1080p H.265 on our 5-person Zoom calls. After compression and denoising the extra sharpness and low noise of a high end camera doesn’t add much benefit.Enthusiasts are a difficult group to market to because they have extremely high expectations. They’d also rather spend weeks scouring the Internet for the perfect deal on a used mirrorless camera than to spend a dollar more than necessary to buy a high-end webcam."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t really get these modern async APIs. In languages like Javascript I thought they only made sense because JS interpreters are (historically) single-threaded, so you really have no choice but async to express some concepts. Fine.But in Rust you can just spawn threads, share data through channels or mutexes, use OS-provided async IO primitives to poll file descriptors and do event-driven programming etc...I tried looking into Tokio a little while ago and I found that it led to some incredibly complicated, abstracted, hard to think about code for stuff I usually implement (IMO) much more simply with a basic event loop and non-blocking IO for instance.I&#39;m sure async can get the upper hand when you have a huge number of very small tasks running concurrently because that&#39;s generally where OS-driven parallelism tends to suffer but is it such a common scenario? That sounds like premature optimization in many situations IMO. Unless you actually think that async code is more expressive and easy to read and write than basic event loops, but then you must be a lot smarter than I am because I have to take an aspirin every time I need to dig into async-heavy code.I guess I&#39;m trying to understand if it&#39;s me who&#39;s missing something, or if it&#39;s web-oriented developers who are trying to bring their favourite type of proverbial hammer to system development."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who has criticized Rust for the small standard lib and lack of stability in the ecosystem I&#39;m very, very happy for this. This is one of the biggest milestones for Rust. Rust itself is great enough. The lack of a de facto async runtime and libs for your standard networking needs were a real barrier for non-enthusiasts environments. It will help its adoption in general purpose business apps, I guess and hope."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can someone explain to a non-rustacean what Tokio introduces that&#39;s not part of Rust? It looks like Rust provides the async/await semantics, so I&#39;m guessing this is an event loop and dispatching system?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Learn to answer the more ambiguous questionsThis is something I have never done before my most recent job search but it has been a huge help.  Previously all my interview prep was on tech and I pretty much winged it for the behavioral stuff since interview prep guides seem to always focus on the tech side.  Plus it always feels worse and more obvious when you struggle with or fail to properly answer the tech questions.What I did is I prepared 10 different stories about my career experience and then tagged them with a bunch of prompts.  For example I have a story about one project that had dual PMs that experienced a lot of scope creep and eventually fizzled on release.  I can now use that story to answer a broad range of questions from failure to various project management approaches.  Overall I now have prepared stories to answer probably 50-75 different questions immediately.Another benefit is that I have also told these stories multiple times in interviews now and I get better telling them each time. Even if the answer isn&#39;t 100% relevant, I feel more confident and likely come off better launching immediately into a detailed story about my experience rather than trying to awkwardly come up with an answer on the fly.  It is also easy to drop irrelevant parts or expand on specific details when the basic framework of the story is already something that feels natural.I will even have the document with all the prompts and story bullet points open whenever I am doing phone or remote interviews.  I could probably even create a cheat sheet to use for in person interviews since I usually would bring an executive style notepad with me anyway to interviews to jot down notes about the company.Maybe this is obvious advice, but I think I am relatively smart and never done it previously or even seen this approach recommend so I am guessing there are other people who could use this tip."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One additional tip on recruiters: have a cheat sheet ready (web page or public Google doc) that answers the basic questions they&#39;ll have for you and makes clear your expectations.Here&#39;s the info I ask them to provide:- Job Title and Salary- Job Description- Company Overview and Location- Steps in Hiring ProcessWhenever I&#39;m emailed by a recruiter, I politely thank them for reaching out, paste the link to the cheat sheet, and invite them to review it and write back if they still think I&#39;m a good match. It quickly separates the professionals from the wannabes. (You usually don&#39;t hear back from the wannabes.) The ones who do write back often thank me for it.I&#39;m pretty cynical when it comes to recruiters. So I find it interesting that 3 of my last 4 jobs have come through one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Keeping those skills sharp even when you’re not job hunting.Can I just add &#34;Leetcoder&#34; as a part time job on my resume?

This is your &#39;partner&#39; getting greedy after you&#39;ve done a lot of hard work. It wouldn&#39;t have happened without you. Don&#39;t undersell yourself.Your 40% is worth $400k based on that initial funding valuation, right? Assuming it&#39;s as successful as you seem to be implying, it is almost certainly worth more now.Everyone is telling you to roll over but seriously, fuck them. This other toxic guy is the one who should be getting pushed out, not you.The other investor ultimately has power in this situation, not you or him, so whoever convinces them that they are the person to go with gets the seat and gets to continue with the project.If he has a good relationship there you&#39;re probably fucked, but results matter... and if you can prove you&#39;ve done great stuff since joining and and have great plans for the future, he can be replaced.To be clear: this guy has decided to blow up the project so he can get a bigger share, if it all fails now he can only blame himself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Do NOT sell. keep 40% of nothing, matter of pride first and for all. Secondly, they are more than  likely bluffing. They don&#39;t want to put advertising that would generate 5k/mo means they are trying to make things look artificially worse so you leave and keep the rest for themselves.Don&#39;t fall for the 40% of nothing once you are close of making money. They just don&#39;t want to share the pie."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since you have a 1-year cliff and have only been there 11 months, sounds like as of today you have 0% equity. So the immediate question may be whether your co-founder can fire you.In 1 month, you&#39;ve vested 25% of your grant, or 10% of the company. So I would try to get to that mark to strengthen your negotiating position. Any references to 40% are red herrings at this point.Unless there&#39;s a specific buyback clause in your stakeholder agreement, they&#39;re under no obligation to buy you out at any time. (They may have the right to do so. That&#39;s not uncommon.)Of course, you&#39;re under no obligation to resign, either. So this is a negotiation.So the way I see it, you have a few options:1. You take your 10% and leave. You &#34;don&#39;t want any equity&#34;, but better something you don&#39;t want than nothing.2. You agree to a buyback, potentially at a discount to FMV. If you don&#39;t know what FMV is, it&#39;s hard to negotiate one way or another. It&#39;s v. likely not $1M. Sounds like this is a no-go.2B. You agree to a non-cash buyback, e.g., in IP. You spent 11 months building the tech: what if you took that with you?3. You flip the script and buy your co-founder out.In any case, your relationship is over. You might walk away with nothing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The case revolves around the question of whether XRP is a security or not. The SEC has given the definitive guidance on the topic, which is based on the Howey case:&gt; The U.S. Supreme Court&#39;s Howey case and subsequent case law have found that an &#34;investment contract&#34; exists when there is the investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others.[5]  The so-called &#34;Howey test&#34; applies to any contract, scheme, or transaction, regardless of whether it has any of the characteristics of typical securities.[6]  The focus of the Howey analysis is not only on the form and terms of the instrument itself (in this case, the digital asset) but also on the circumstances surrounding the digital asset and the manner in which it is offered, sold, or resold (which includes secondary market sales).  Therefore, issuers and other persons and entities engaged in the marketing, offer, sale, resale, or distribution of any digital asset will need to analyze the relevant transactions to determine if the federal securities laws apply.https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/framework-investment-contract-an...Ripple (as distinct from the XRP token it created), currently holds a large block of uncirculated XRP created at the beginning of the network. This network does away with mining in favor of the Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm:https://ripple.com/files/ripple_consensus_whitepaper.pdfThis protocol foregoes mining in favor of a system without proof-of-work. The tradeoff (or feature, depending on how you look at it) was that the distribution mechanism would involve Ripple itself giving away and selling XRP. This gave Ripple complete control of the money stock at the network&#39;s inception.This is very different from how Bitcoin currency distribution works."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Been following cryptocurrency for almost a decade now. I would generalize that XRP is an asset that is primarily purchased by speculators with sour grapes that they missed &lt;$1 Bitcoins, and hope to see the same sort of returns despite the significant differences in technology and organizational structure.I don&#39;t feel like there is much &#39;smart money&#39; investing in XRP, so I think increased regulatory oversight is probably beneficial here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One time when I was younger, in my late teens, I was walking through the city around 8pm. I suddenly felt rather cold, and went through the typical 15 seconds of internal grumbling. I then had an epiphany, and walked into a nearby department store to purchase a jacket. Somehow I&#39;d never even considered that as a possibility previously.As silly as it may seem, I use that singular point in time as the reference for when I commenced adulthood. I&#39;ve got no idea if others have similar experiences (I grew up very poor, so I was probably primed against the idea of spontaneously buying something to begin with), but the contents of this list seems to be very much in the same vein."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of an old video of Steve Jobs. His idea is simple, but it&#39;s really powerful. In short: the world is something you can change, not merely participate in.When you grow up, you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world, try not to bash into the walls too much, try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money.That’s a very limited life. Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact, and that is that everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.And the minute that you understand that you can poke life and actually something will, you know if you push in, something will pop out the other side, that you can change it, you can mold it. That’s maybe the most important thing. It’s to shake off this erroneous notion that life is there and you’re just gonna live in it, versus embrace it, change it, improve it, make your mark upon it.I think that’s very important and however, you learn that, once you learn it, you’ll want to change life and make it better, cause it’s kind of messed up, in a lot of ways. Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYfNvmF0Bqw"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An astonishing amount of this list amounts to “spend money”, so while these things may play well here I think it’s worth pointing out that a large majority of the population is not allowed to do those things because they can’t afford to."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Too bad, maps.me was by far the best maps application for non city use, and ideal for hiking. Commendable initiative to bring it back in its original version!A few examples of why it was so great:Simple, non social bookmarks. As in: place a bookmark so you don&#39;t get lost while hiking, or when you find a nice spot you want to come back to later. Yep, a utility feature that doesn&#39;t somehow map to some stoopid business OKR in advertising. I am sure this is possible with Google maps or Apple maps somehow, but only after you&#39;ve created an account, logged in, and made sure you have the equivalent of a South Korean inner city internet connection.Also, easily downloadable maps that just stay on your phone. I am hiking, I don&#39;t have internet and need the map on my phone. 
I know Google Maps allows you to do that but it is tedious unlike maps.me, which is instant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is an existing f-droid version of Maps.me [1] and this looks like a separate effort.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For me YouTube recommendations are not toxic, they are so amazing I some times wonder how comes the world around is not heaven when everybody has free access to this.That&#39;s because I always watch high-quality educational content and some beautiful comforting and inspiring music. So for me YouTube is a fountain of knowledge, visual and musical aesthetics etc. Every day I get inspiration, healthy kind of fun and learn something cool, useful and healthy.But people who watch stupid and destructive stuff (even once) are doomed because they are going to get the same and worse kind of content recommended over and over. This is a particularly underestimated social problem indeed.That&#39;s why I recommend to avoid signing-in into YouTube. Better watch anonymously so you can always clean the cookies and get out of the pit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know I&#39;m old but dang for some reason I really dislike recommendations from almost any company.For media I grew up in the 70s and had the TV Guide. I&#39;d look through to see what I wanted to watch, circle some things and then watch. No spying what-so-ever.So, I like for example HN where AFAIK I&#39;m not tracked so much and I choose what I want from the top of the list.Conversely I mostly hate Amazon, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, Youtube, Twitter, Instagram, and all the ad services and any other service that uses some algorithm to decide what to put in my face.It&#39;s to the point that 3 out 4 time I&#39;ll open videos in private windows so they don&#39;t get added to my profile and used for recommendations.I don&#39;t mind going to a tech sight and seeing ads for tech or a car site and seeing ads for cars. Do mind visiting an apartment listing site and then going around the net and having every other sight shove ads for apartments in my face."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you want a glimpse of the average person&#39;s youtube experience, open the site in incognito and go to the &#34;trending&#34; tab.It&#39;s a completely different site depending on what you initially search for when you start using it.The problem is, 80% of youtube userbase never really typed a search query for anything in the first place, and as a result the stuff they get recommended and watch is pure shit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Learn to answer the more ambiguous questionsThis is something I have never done before my most recent job search but it has been a huge help.  Previously all my interview prep was on tech and I pretty much winged it for the behavioral stuff since interview prep guides seem to always focus on the tech side.  Plus it always feels worse and more obvious when you struggle with or fail to properly answer the tech questions.What I did is I prepared 10 different stories about my career experience and then tagged them with a bunch of prompts.  For example I have a story about one project that had dual PMs that experienced a lot of scope creep and eventually fizzled on release.  I can now use that story to answer a broad range of questions from failure to various project management approaches.  Overall I now have prepared stories to answer probably 50-75 different questions immediately.Another benefit is that I have also told these stories multiple times in interviews now and I get better telling them each time. Even if the answer isn&#39;t 100% relevant, I feel more confident and likely come off better launching immediately into a detailed story about my experience rather than trying to awkwardly come up with an answer on the fly.  It is also easy to drop irrelevant parts or expand on specific details when the basic framework of the story is already something that feels natural.I will even have the document with all the prompts and story bullet points open whenever I am doing phone or remote interviews.  I could probably even create a cheat sheet to use for in person interviews since I usually would bring an executive style notepad with me anyway to interviews to jot down notes about the company.Maybe this is obvious advice, but I think I am relatively smart and never done it previously or even seen this approach recommend so I am guessing there are other people who could use this tip."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One additional tip on recruiters: have a cheat sheet ready (web page or public Google doc) that answers the basic questions they&#39;ll have for you and makes clear your expectations.Here&#39;s the info I ask them to provide:- Job Title and Salary- Job Description- Company Overview and Location- Steps in Hiring ProcessWhenever I&#39;m emailed by a recruiter, I politely thank them for reaching out, paste the link to the cheat sheet, and invite them to review it and write back if they still think I&#39;m a good match. It quickly separates the professionals from the wannabes. (You usually don&#39;t hear back from the wannabes.) The ones who do write back often thank me for it.I&#39;m pretty cynical when it comes to recruiters. So I find it interesting that 3 of my last 4 jobs have come through one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Keeping those skills sharp even when you’re not job hunting.Can I just add &#34;Leetcoder&#34; as a part time job on my resume? It is amusing how in this industry, your ability to interview will not at all be improved by spending time doing your job unless it is algo heavy. It is a separate job entirely."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t really get these modern async APIs. In languages like Javascript I thought they only made sense because JS interpreters are (historically) single-threaded, so you really have no choice but async to express some concepts. Fine.But in Rust you can just spawn threads, share data through channels or mutexes, use OS-provided async IO primitives to poll file descriptors and do event-driven programming etc...I tried looking into Tokio a little while ago and I found that it led to some incredibly complicated, abstracted, hard to think about code for stuff I usually implement (IMO) much more simply with a basic event loop and non-blocking IO for instance.I&#39;m sure async can get the upper hand when you have a huge number of very small tasks running concurrently because that&#39;s generally where OS-driven parallelism tends to suffer but is it such a common scenario? That sounds like premature optimization in many situations IMO. Unless you actually think that async code is more expressive and easy to read and write than basic event loops, but then you must be a lot smarter than I am because I have to take an aspirin every time I need to dig into async-heavy code.I guess I&#39;m trying to understand if it&#39;s me who&#39;s missing something, or if it&#39;s web-oriented developers who are trying to bring their favourite type of proverbial hammer to system development."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who has criticized Rust for the small standard lib and lack of stability in the ecosystem I&#39;m very, very happy for this. This is one of the biggest milestones for Rust. Rust itself is great enough. The lack of a de facto async runtime and libs for your standard networking needs were a real barrier for non-enthusiasts environments. It will help its adoption in general purpose business apps, I guess and hope."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can someone explain to a non-rustacean what Tokio introduces that&#39;s not part of Rust? It looks like Rust provides the async/await semantics, so I&#39;m guessing this is an event loop and dispatching system?"</p>

It just really shows how low the bar is to get something published.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"YC has historically had a big influence on improving financing terms for founders and reducing founder-hostile behavior by investors, by creating competition among investors for YC companies. Should YC maybe consider developing and enforcing a code of conduct addressing these issues, that might similarly improve the situation for start-up employees?They could maintain a public list of YC companies that abide by the code of conduct in order to encourage good behavior, and to help communicate to potential employees that they would get a “fair” option deal (as early investors, they would clearly have access to the terms of any financing deal).[EDIT: they could also maybe publish a list of investors who have committed to following the guidelines, and consider excluding VC firms from YC events if they won’t commit to those standards]Depending on how serious YC was about making a difference here, going against the code of conduct might even be grounds for exclusion from the YC community? My understanding is that YC has always focused on what’s best for the founders, even when they were the outsiders in silicon valley and at their own financial expense. Maybe now that YC is such an important player in the silicon valley ecosystem, they could use that power to maintain the health of that ecosystem in a way that few others could?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m facing a headache with some options I was granted for a startup back in 2013 for being an advisor. I didn&#39;t exercise the options at the time (hindsight is 20-20).The startup is doing well - it recently raised ~$300m at a ~$3b valuation, but my options expire in Dec 2023 and I&#39;m growing increasingly concerned that they won&#39;t have a liquidity event before then.If I exercise my options before then it will be taxed as income which could leave me owing &gt;$100k in taxes to the IRS - but if the company hasn&#39;t yet had a liquidity event then I can&#39;t sell the options to pay that.Seems like a ridiculous situation for early employees/advisors to be placed in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was lucky enough to cash out of a startup after 7 years and 3 or 4 rounds of funding (I had left by the time I got the payout) as a share buyback for one of the VC investors.I was diluted from 3.2% to about 1.3% but the value of the company had clearly risen so _at that point_ it was unimportant.However in my opinion the company&#39;s burn rate and lack of growth clearly meant a later exit (likely an acqui-hire IMO) would have seen dilution without an equivalent growth in value, not to mention the ever-increasing VC non-dilution shares accelerating that.I got majorly screwed on tax because the startup made no efforts to be efficient and were very chaotic in their arrangements for payout so that is definitely another important factor.Overall by winning the startup share lottery I made roughly $500k for 5 or so years working there and that was as employee #1 so the maths given the pay cut probably don&#39;t work out too well (perhaps break even if I&#39;d played the career game well).However of course I am hugely grateful it happened and I got to see a startup grow from 3 people to more than 10x that and learnt a lot, as well as changing my coding career direction substantially.I wouldn&#39;t recommend joining a startup as a non-founder other than for changing career or starting out. The trade-offs don&#39;t really make sense in most cases and you get a lot less say than you think you might (founders understandably want to control what is their baby) - never do it for the money.note: I posted a more detailed overview of what happened at https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25496667"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I only skimmed the paper past the abstract, but for what it is worth.The MOND favouring group is a fringe of the cosmology community. The vast majority feel that there is enough evidence to rule it out.I mostly mention this because I don&#39;t like that fact that popular science magazines (or at least their content that I see posted here!) has a bias towards &#34;new and possibly exciting&#34; or &#34;controversial&#34; research. Which I understand - revolution is more interesting that &#34;physicist reduces error bars by 50%. Big picture unchanged&#34;. But, if all you read is these articles, you will get a very skewed idea of what the consensus is.Just so there is no confusion, modified gravity as an explanation for Dark Energy is very possible, as an explanation for Dark Matter, the consensus is that it is ruled out.Edit: I clarified my point below but will do it here too so everyone see it. I don&#39;t have a problem with this paper, I&#39;m glad people are writing papers with alternate explanations to the consensus, that is how science is done.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just want to point out how special interests can actually pretty insidiously change your viewpoint by making you think &#34;that&#39;s the way things have always been&#34;. It was relatively recently that I discovered that jaywalking, as a crime, was a distinctly American phenomenon, when in an HN discussion someone mentioned that British folk think the crime of jaywalking is insane (in the UK you can cross pretty much wherever you want as long as you&#39;re not impeding traffic). My initial reaction was &#34;Wait, that&#39;s nuts, of course jaywalking should not be allowed.&#34; I didn&#39;t even realize how the &#34;default&#34; of what I was used to in the US was basically just constructed by the auto industry for their benefit.Glad this is coming to light and hope more places get rid of jaywalking."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I spent some time at a university and got to field DMCA complaints.  Typically they&#39;d list the file getting shared and a timestamp (often without a timezone) and the university IP/port.  They never included their own IP address...Of course, the traffic was behind a firewall.  I had the logs but wasn&#39;t about to accuse / punish anyone when there were a bunch of potential students behind any given complaint, and without the other end of the connection I couldn&#39;t identify which one for certain.Funny thing is they refused to give their source IP because they didn&#39;t trust us to not leak it to whatever pirates to put on a blocklist.But of course, I had their source IP because I had the network traffic.  Were I in kahoots I&#39;d have just listed all 5 of the possible snitching peers to the badguys.Shady and incompetent then, same now I guess."</p>

And when you sue people off information they provided you, it&#39;s your name on the lawsuit. Sure you can try to sue the companies after you lose, but good luck with that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like the sentiment of this article. It&#39;s a great analogy.Might be a little off topic, but it reminds me how I am happy that the Go programming language and its philosophies gained popularity even though I don&#39;t use the language regularly. Watching Go talks made me appreciate simplicity and clarity.It made me accept that I don&#39;t always need to use every design pattern in the book. It made me think about the readers of my code, who might not always be experienced enough, or might not always have time to understand the brilliant architecture I came up with. I can have some repeated code sprinkled around in the codebase. I don&#39;t always need to have n+1 layers in my architecture where all the layers just call the next layer anyway. It might be better to use functions over a complicated hierarchy of classes. It made me appreciate simple tools and widely accepted conventions that result in codebases that feel familiar the second you dive in.Of course, go is not the only community where these ideas are prevalent, and it&#39;s good to know your design patterns and architecture, etc... Finding the balance is not always easy, but it&#39;s good to have a popular, successful &#34;counter force&#34; community."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; By &#34;functions&#34; here I mean &#34;pure functions&#34;.After programming for Clojure for quite a long time (~2 years), I fully share this sentiment. Using pure functions for business logic (and also using simple data structures instead of, say, classes and encapsulation) seems to generally makes the code more simple and maintainable in the long run.&gt; Of course the qualifier is &#34;mostly&#34;: this isn&#39;t a dogma. Writing a 100% functional system (&#34;going vegan&#34;, if you will) often requires you to jump through a bunch of extra hoops to get all the functionality you need.Also this. Sometimes going fully functional makes things much more difficult, so a little of &#34;impurity&#34; is also fine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This nugget stood out for me: &#34;In my experience most codebases have a pure functional subset, and I believe writing that subset in a pure-functional style is nearly always a win for the long-term health of the project.&#34;This is probably often true. In high level applications, the idea of classing or abstracting out your i/o from the core functionality is appealing from a security and reasoning  perspective, but not sure if serious developers think that way.Would you need to understand the rationale behind the codebase from a functional perspective, and even the economics of the business logic behind the features? It&#39;s kind of an architects view of &#34;this thing essentially reduces to a queue and if I optimize for this, I get more value.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The reason you can’t buy a good webcam is the same reason you can’t buy a high quality monitor outside of LG’s unreliable apple collab.The lazy conglomerates who sell these peripherals often don’t actually produce the parts in them. They simply rebrand commodity cameras and IPS panels in a crap plastic housing and slap their logo on it.Then they give the product a hilariously user-hostile product name, like “PQS GRT46782-WT” as an extra f-you to the user.They don’t care about you because they have no ongoing relationship with you, and their executives mistakenly see their own products as commodities.Combine this with the fact that most home users don’t care about good quality or even know what it is, and you have the current situation.A friend once described the peripheral market as “Assholes selling crap to idiots.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you are looking here to improve your webcam because you started to do remote work, don&#39;t.First try to improve lighting and audio.Any camera will look bad in bad lighting. It is always better to first improve your lighting before you invest in a new camera. Use high CRI lightbulbs and ensure even source color temperature in your room (ie. all lightbulbs should be emitting same color temperature).Audio is also very important. It is processed by different parts of brain and we don&#39;t put so much attention to it but the quality will influence the other person, subconsciously. Also, audio is how the information is being passed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The real reason is buried in the article:You can’t buy a good webcam because the number of people willing to pay a lot of money for a high end webcam is very small.At the lower end, people are satisfied with their built in laptop parts or a cheap webcam that sits on top of their monitor.At the high end, people go down the rabbit hole of buying a do-everything mirrorless camera that they can use for so much more than just a webcam.A high end webcam would have to be cheap enough that the first group doesn’t mind spending a bit more, but not so expensive that the enthusiast target audience just decides to buy a full-featured mirror less camera instead.Granted, there is a lot of room for improvement in that budgetary middle ground, but how many people actually care? Common webcams actually perform decently when given proper lighting conditions. We’re not streaming high-bitrate 1080p H.265 on our 5-person Zoom calls. After compression and denoising the extra sharpness and low noise of a high end camera doesn’t add much benefit.Enthusiasts are a difficult group to market to because they have extremely high expectations. They’d also rather spend weeks scouring the Internet for the perfect deal on a used mirrorless camera than to spend a dollar more than necessary to buy a high-end webcam."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Okay this is a bit meta, but the whole cluster of &#34;everything old is new again&#34;, &#34;the pendulum of fashion has swung&#34;, &#34;nothing new under the sun&#34; takes is ignoring what tends to drive this sort of change: relative costs.The allure of xmlhttprequest was that over connections much slower than today, and with much less powerful desktop computers, a user didn&#39;t have to wait for the whole page to redownload and re-render (one can argue that focusing on better HTTP caching on the server and client might have been smarter) after every single user interaction. This was also much of the draw of using frames (which were also attractive for some front-end design use-cases later re-solved with CSS).As apps got more complex, clients got more compute, bandwidth grew, and as web audiences grew, offloadingl much of the page rendering to the client helped to both contain server-side costs and increase or maintain responsiveness to user interactions.Now, as desktop client performance improvement slows down (this isn&#39;t just the slowing of computer speeds, computers are also replaced less frequently), average bandwidth continues to grow, app complexity and sophistication continues to grow, but as server compute cost falls faster than audience size grows, shifting rendering to HTML back to the server and sending more verbose pre-rendered HTML fragments over the wire can make sense as a way of giving users a better experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve never seen one of these &#34;logic in html-attributes&#34; systems take error checking seriously. In stimulus they start to mention it in &#34;Designing For Resilience&#34; (though only for feature-checking), but in &#34;Working With External Resources&#34; where it uses calls network/IO bound calls they never mention how to handle errors or if the framework just leaves it up to you. Stimulus is also where you need to write your own js code, so I guess you could handle it yourself but in turbo when I skimmed the handbook I find no mentions of what/how to handle errors (or even what happens when turbo gets one), and when loading stuff over the network that is pretty much crucial.From the turbo handbook: &#34;An application visit always issues a network request. When the response arrives, Turbo Drive renders its HTML and completes the visit.&#34; Using the phrase &#34;When the response arrives&#34; begs the question of what happens if it doesn&#39;t arrive, or if it takes a minute for it to arrive, or if it arrives but with a faulty status code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As others have noted, seems reasonably similar to LiveView, Livewire and Blazor. I’m somewhat bullish on these approaches - server side rendered monoliths (Rails, Django, etc.) are SO productive, at least for the first few years of development, but lack of interactivity is a big issue, and this solves it well.However, another big issue is the dominance of mobile. More and more, you’ve got 2-3 frontends (web and cross-platform mobile, or explicitly
web, iOS and Android), and you want to power them all with the same backend. RESTful APIs serving up JSON works for all 3, as does GraphQL (not a fan, but many are). This however is totally web-specific - you’ll end up building REST APIs and mobile apps anyways, so the productivity gains end up way smaller, possibly even net negative. Mobile is a big part of why SPAs have dominated - you use the same backend and overall approach/architecture for web and mobile.I’d strongly consider this for a web-only product, but that’s becoming more and more rare."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A crazy memory I have with this game is related to its successor, Championship Lode Runner (mentioned in the article).  The original allowed you to jump to any level through its title screen, so you could skip hard levels, or play them in any order you want.  The Championship game, however, had 50 levels that you could only play through in order, and only after you had beaten the prior level.  As my brother and I got stuck in one of of the lower levels, this was very frustrating since we had no way of enjoying the higher, more advanced levels.Somewhere along the line, we figured out that you could start the original game, go to the level-jumping screen, remove the 5 1/4&#34; original floppy disc and replace it with the one for the Championship game, and then enter the level you wanted to play.  The original gameplay would load the Championship level as if nothing was out of the ordinary!  I only think this was possible because the two games shared so much code structure.  It gave me an idea of how the memory vs disc model of the game was operating.  But I don&#39;t think it would be easy to  do today since switching the floppy discs was so instrumental to making it work.  Maybe today you could do kernel dumps or swap the in-memory vs disk binaries, but we were just kids not advanced computer wizards.  Hurray for analog hacks!By using the trick we were able to enjoy all 50 of the Championship levels at our leisure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What made Lode Runner the must-have game to have is that it was the first game with a built in level editor.  Before Lode Runner, once one finished all of the levels in a game, it was time to move on to another game.  To make custom levels, one needed to program their own game in Basic.With Lode Runner, one could open up the level editor, easily make a custom Lode level, then playtest and share it with friends."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My brother and I were raised by a single mom. Getting our first computer (my first computer, as my brother wasn&#39;t interested) - a Commodore 64 - was a watershed moment. I couldn&#39;t believe it the day my mom got it and brought it home. This was when it&#39;s prices were getting slashed to prices should could kind of afford (approximately 1984-85). I pulled it out of the box after nearly breaking her neck with hugs and put it all together, hooking it up with to a massive, very pale and low contrast wooden cabinet color TV.And then it dawned on me. I had no way to play any games! I actually needed a disk drive (something that nearly cost as much as the compute itself!). For the first couple of weeks, I entered lines of BASIC I either read in the manual or from the back of magazines.When we finally got the drive, I could feel the surge of power! This would have been 9th grade - my last year of middle school where I went to school. I remember grousing about it during math class that I finally had all this gear and no money to buy the games for it. A guy ahead of me turned around and said he could bring me a stack of disks tomorrow.We became solid best friends. That dude had a modem and was able to pull down &#34;free&#34; games from his telephone line all night long. It was the darkest, most seductive black magic I&#39;d ever heard of.I remember getting a copy of Top Gun before it was even available for retail. Crap game, but I thought it was something magical at the time.The floppy disk was a life changer.---For what it&#39;s worth, Lode Runner was one of my favorite games as a kid. And it was one of the few my brother really liked, too. In fact, he was better at solving the puzzles than I was. I have multiple versions of the game for C64 to this very day, including a boxed cart.I love Lode Runner. Great article - thanks for posting it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As someone who has played with writing trading bots but never traded them with real money, some advice: if your results seem too good to be true, they probably are. Your trading bot may be doing unrealistic things or its results may not be reliable if the following are true:- You are trading in a market with low liquidity or one that is controlled by a small number of market participants. I&#39;m not an expert but I think this would apply more to markets like penny stocks and less to big markets like forex for major currency pairs- You are not taking transaction costs into account or not doing so properly- Your bot makes a low number of trades, making the results close or equivalent to lucky coin flips- Your bot is simply making trades that cannot be executed, or may be doing simulated trades of something that is not actually tradable.  This applies to a large number of research papers that assume you can just buy and trade the S&amp;P 500 itself. You can trade ETFs that are tied to an index but an index is not a tradable instrument in of itself. Once you realize this, a lot of papers seem very weird- You are not modelling other aspects of the trading process realistically, such as assuming the bot has infinite funds to trade, allowing it to take unlimited losses and continue trading when in reality you&#39;d be hit with a margin call and your trading would be stopped- Your code is committing any number of data snooping errors where the bot is asked to trade at time A (say the open of a trading session) but has access to future data (say the closing price of that day, future data that would not actually exist in a live environment)- Depending on what you believe about how market conditions change over time, your bot may have worked in the past but would not work if used today. I.e., the market may have adapted to whatever edge your bot may have discoveredThere are probably lots more pitfalls I don&#39;t even know about since I&#39;m not an actual trader.I&#39;m not discouraging anyone from playing around or trying things, of course.

I thought it was an enlightening experience because it showed me that the core principles behind regular languages are fairly simple, although you could spend years optimizing and improving your implementation. How do you deal with unicode? How do you modify your implementation to know how many characters you can skip if you don&#39;t have a match in order to avoid testing every single position in a file?It demystified the concept of a regex engine for me while at the same time making me realize how impressive the advanced, ultra optimized engines we use and take for granted are."</p>

It&#39;s great advice for students who are in college, know very little, and want to improve their CS skills.It&#39;s poor advice for someone who already has a STEM degree and wants to build something useful and profitable. If you already know how these things work, your time is better spent on the &#34;edge of the circle&#34;: http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/ which applies to businesses and startups as well.If you&#39;re in the latter group -- you&#39;ve already got the skills to build real shit. Don&#39;t waste your time on homework problems. Find a problem you have and build a solution for it. Don&#39;t listen to people who tell you to work on homework problems that have already been solved; it&#39;s a complete waste of your time if you already know the fundamentals.As for stock trading bots -- if you don&#39;t have a mathematics degree or equivalent (e.g. having incredible math skills), don&#39;t even bother. You won&#39;t be profitable, and you will learn nothing useful in the process, because you will approach the problem as a naive CS student would. Smarter people than you have made trading bots and have failed miserably. Without having an extremely strong foundation in mathematics, your trading bot will amount to nothing more than a futile exercise in gluing APIs together."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This happened back in the 1970s when some researchers tried to get follow-up information about whether alcoholics can moderately drink again.Here’s what happened: The paper Sobell 1973 made the bold claim that alcoholics could moderately drink again if given the right kind of therapy.  So, other researchers asked: What was the long-term outcome with those patients supposedly engaging on “controlled drinking”?So this research team including one Pendery asked Sobell for the list of patients so they could perform a proper follow-up.  The Sobell researchers refused to provide the list.  The Pendery team managed to get the list anyway.  The Sobells then sued Pendary and their team to stop them from using the list.After some litigation, the Pendary team got the Sobell lawsuit dismissed and then followed up with those supposedly moderate drinking patients.Out of the 20 patients the Sobell study claimed were moderately drinking, only one arguably was still moderately drinking a decade later.  Four of those “moderate drinkers” died from drinking too much.  Eight were engaging in out of control drinking.  Six were completely abstinent from alcohol.  And one could not be found, but appeared to be “gravely disabled”.No wonder the Sobells tried to block the follow up study with lawsuits: Because it showed that those “moderate drinkers” were no longer moderately drinking.After a lot of effort, the Sobell lawsuit(s) were dismissed and the truth won.References: https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/02/science/showdown-nears-in...https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/28/us/alcholism-study-under-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oof, that&#39;s not a good sign. For me, Japan is the place for the best camera and lens manufacturing. Most of the makers seem to split their manufacturing between Japan for their quality models/lenses and cheaper countries for the consumer stuff, which I think is a valid compromise. But this feels short-sighted on Nikon&#39;s part and rather like they have already failed. Perhaps instead of relocating their production they should re-evaluate their business model; my dad ended up swapping to Fuji after ~40 years of Nikon after his last camera failed and they treated him like crap as he tried to get it repaired. In contrast I bought an 11 year-old second-hand Canon DSLR which needed a new shutter mechanism and Canon Japan found an out-of-production replacement in their warehouse and shipped it to my repairer immediately.I&#39;ve always found Nikon to be lacking in competitive models with Canon in the places that count. Canon frequently make lenses of the same focal length but for different budgets, e.g. they have 4 70-200mm models. Nikon&#39;s range has always been weirdly spotty, with some excellent lenses at the high end but weird gaps elsewhere.Tangentially, I recently bought a superb Sigma lens and was  happy to see that it was actually still made in Japan as well; I thought all the third-party lens makers had moved abroad, but surprisingly a number of them are still there.I was also very happy to discover that Canon promotes wildlife reserves around its factories and headquarters. It&#39;s nice to see a company that reflects some of its customers&#39; interests: https://global.canon/en/environment/bird-branch/index.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I fear for Nikon, even though I suspect they have lifelines, given Bank of Japan’s quantitative easing. They’re the least diversified of the big camera companies.Sony has…a lot, from semiconductors to financial instruments. Canon has high-end video, scanners, and enterprise printing and copying. Nikon has photography-oriented cameras, some medical optics, and semiconductor equipment, and that’s about it. They’re just not the sprawling conglomerate that can absorb losses as easily as Sony.Sigh. I’m a camera nerd, and I hate to see the market shrink further. I know it’s going to—cell phone cameras accomplish the actual job to be done that most people have, which is snapshots of kids and cats. And, interchangeable lens cameras are getting to the point they’re over-serving the high-end market with ever-fancier lenses and marginal sensor improvements, with no real workflow improvements."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Heartbreaking, but they are a &#34;survivor&#34; company. They have lasted over 100 years, through a world war (including firestorm bombing), earthquakes, fires and tsunamis.They had never been particularly big, until the 1990s, with the advent of point-and-shoot digital cameras.That gravy train ended when the iPhone came out. They are probably contracting to their more traditional role, of Big Black Cameras, as well as some very good scientific optics.They have some of the finest scientists and engineers in the world, as well as a gigantic portfolio of patents. They aren&#39;t going away.From what I hear, the Thai do a great job, but it&#39;s still a big psychological shock to leave Japan. Their Japanese plants were considered the &#34;top shelf&#34; production facilities."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"That it takes such effort to pass a bill like this - 80% public approval, banning a clearly predatory practice, has turned me from a pure free market thinking into a believer in single payer healthcare. The free market just doesn&#39;t work when there is very little elasticity in consumption. I&#39;ve been on the receiving end of a $15K air ambulance bill (thankfully covered by insurance) as well as the out of network specialist at an in-network hospital. The latter is particularly galling. What are you supposed to do, interrogate every person that comes in the room?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Surprise bills happen when an out-of-network provider is unexpectedly involved in a patient’s care. Patients go to a hospital that accepts their insurance, for example, but get treated there by an emergency room physician who doesn’t. Such doctors often bill those patients for large fees, far higher than what health plans typically pay.How do courts uphold this? You go to a restaurant, they say you can buy the tasting menu for $100, but they have a temp chef working that day which will cost you $50 extra, which you find out as you&#39;re paying.I mean you might even be unconscious when this is happening?EDITActually someone brought up an important point. If you go to a restaurant, you are kinda expected to know that there&#39;s taxes and tipping to pay. Do the US courts think the same of healthcare? &#34;You were in a hospital, you should have known that the bill is always higher than the sticker price?&#34;It would surprise me as a European."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Some private-equity firms have turned this kind of billing into a robust business model, buying emergency room doctor groups and moving the providers out of network so they could bill larger fees.If this doesn’t describe evil, I don’t know what else would."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Why AMP exists?A website I consult in a popular sports niche and has a slow, broken, ad-infested main website grew its traffic 500% with AMP.On the main website, it&#39;s still broken. On AMP it&#39;s... AMP. So Google thinks it&#39;s fast enough/good enough.On AMP we implemented a lot of annoying CTAs to go to the main website. ”Read Full Article here” ”Read more” ”Details at...”In the past this website would have needed to optimize its real website to gain this much visibility in the search engines. Now they just AMP, then they optimize their AMP to real-world-website CTR, and can continue to have a... sub ideal.... website.AMP is whitelisted cloaking for slow websites. And a burden on webmasters and developers.I always say AMP is the internet if germans (most AMP leads were at one point germans) would have invented it (I am Austrian, we always joke about Germans ): Efficient, mostly boring and long term innovation harmful.I am rooting for AMP to die. Sadly it will still be around for about 5 years until the ”what a great journey” blogpost."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t even understand how AMP is legal or how they could possibly argue it gives any benefit to the user. Every single AMP page i’ve used has broken CSS and often broken content.The speed boost is negligible if it even exists and all it serves to do is add an additional stupid pop up I have to click out of to read a web page.I really wish I could switch to DDG but queries related to anything technical, like biology or programming, usually fail to turn up any relevant results."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another take - and why I like AMP.Web developers deliver crap, ad laden slow websites - with HORRIBLE users experiences.Content jumps around as the web page loads, sometimes even 5 - 10 seconds later!Autoplaying content is hell - but they seem to love it.Popovers, unders and sliders gallore.And for some reasons the GIANT mess of analytics trackers and CSS and dynamic content means the thing isa) slow
b) nightmare on a phoneGoogle has basically FORCED a bunch of these idiots to actually make a page usable and pleasant. It loads fast.What I don&#39;t get - all these high and mighty web devs can&#39;t seem to deliver clean websites that work without Google beating them over the heads with AMP. Is it that they cower in front of management with demands for YET ANOTHER tracker (seriously, websites ship with like 10 trackers - why?) They feel the need to show off their lazy loading dynamic content skills that jank the page?So thank goodness for AMP, perhaps developers will actually try to compete with it a bit by building usable non-amp websites.And trust me, users are getting trained that the lighting bolt actually does mean FAST.Anyways - when I read another rant from a web developer about AMP - a small request. How about de-jankifying and de-scamifying the web first a bit more? Then we won&#39;t need to turn to google for all this stuff."</p>

Apple Card was perhaps a dipping of the toes moment.In theory, Tesla shouldn&#39;t be worth what it is because the tech behind it is increasingly getting commoditized (though they work hard to stay slightly ahead). But people love Tesla and it&#39;s the first choice EV because they&#39;ve really thought through the UX of a semi-self driving car EV thoroughly.Apple is just about the only company with a similar ethos and enough money and patience to be a viable competitor and have a competitive brand known for quality."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Would Apple be required to make their car parts interchangeable with the generic aftermarket brands and car service centers? IIRC there is a law specifically for car manufacturing.I can imagine a dystopian future with custom non-standard parts, specialist repair centers, restrictions on what you can do with it, Apple being able to track everywhere we go, what we listen to, who is with us, and establishing a network of devices that work together but not with other brands.

Meanwhile, I&#39;m just sitting here enjoying the hell out of this game. The world is absolutely beautifully realized, both inside the city and outside. The glitches I&#39;ve encountered are of the &#34;Bethesda&#34; type and I haven&#39;t run into any game breaking bugs yet.I&#39;ve probably spent around 25 hours in it so far, with a good chunk of that on side missions. Just like in The Witcher 3, some of the side missions are really good. This game is a solid 8 for me right now, and it&#39;ll only go up with patches.Playing on Series X fwiw."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every single hacker news thread about the Cyberpunk fiasco has had a ton of top comments about they haven’t had any issues with the game.Performance/bugs aside, what about the completeness issues? How can the game be acceptable or fun when cars run on tracks and NPC’s don’t have a problem being attacked?That’s my main concern - I’m sure the performance/bugs will be worked out. But will the game actually be finished?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Marketing hype backfired. People are angry not just because the game was released buggy and unoptimized (although maybe standards are higher on consoles in this aspect). People are angry because they were promised a groundbreaking game, a landmark game, and got an unremarkable mix of Deus Ex and GTA. Except for raytracing, there&#39;s nothing exceptional about this game. No new mechanics even.I watched the disaster from sidelines, but what makes me angry is that the hype was so strong it made gamers fight each other, blame each other, and make excuses for the company. Gamers are not to blame for the game except for the fact they preordered. The deceptive behavior was rewarded and costs were recouped from preorders alone. Yes, CDPR is taking a reputation hit, but fans will believe what they want to believe."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thanks for sharing some programming-centric benchmarks using modern CPUs. I always wish that CPU reviewers would stop churning out pages of graphs with synthetic benchmark workloads and instead post things that actually matter, like compile times and other programming benchmarks.The M1 processor is extremely impressive for the price and power envelope. However, I&#39;m noticing a lot of people have taken Apple&#39;s marketing material a bit too literally and assumed that it somehow beats any and every desktop CPU out there, which is clearly not the case.Moreover, as the author mentions: A significant portion of Apple&#39;s lead came from buying exclusivity on TSMC&#39;s 5nm process through the end of the year. It will be interesting to see how AMD stacks up as they roll out 5nm parts in the future, compared to Apple&#39;s scaled up M1 successors.Exciting times. It&#39;s good to have some progress in CPU technologies again after years of Intel stagnation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The most impressive part to me is how the m1 compares to the 3900X. I’ve got a mere 3600X and every laptop I owned or worked on over the past year is noticeably and painfully slower than the 3600X. It’s been a relief to get home and turn on my desktop. It doesn’t matter if the laptops I’m using are very recent i7’s and i9’s, the desktop is always very noticeably faster.I got my m1 MacBook Pro 16GB yesterday and was pretty confused to find that Rust compilation felt faster than the desktop. To go from recent Intel laptops taking two to three times longer to compile Rust than my budget desktop despite the laptops&#39; whiny fans and extreme heat, to having my desktop be sightly outclassed by an ice cold laptop on battery (which got at least 15 hours of use, including said compiling, with no need to charge) is a world changer. I can’t remember the last time a laptop was this close to desktop performance for my everyday workflow.Now that I think about it, I haven’t even tried optimising compile times on the MacBook like I usually do with Rust projects. My desktop would have been running lld at least to make its compilation significantly faster, and the MacBook more than kept up in spite of the handicap."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I come away from this way more impressed by the M1 than I was going in. It&#39;s a comparison of a ~$700 stock, low end full computer Vs. $700 for high end CPU only. And the high end CPU has overclocking tweaks enabled, and overclocked memory.The M1 generally keeps up quite well, which blows my mind. 
The power use difference Is pretty big as well.Yeah, it would be great if Apple was totally open source.But this is going to push the entire industry to do way better."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing that surprised me as a latecomer to software development coming from a visual arts background is how much choice of technology and working practices are purely fashion driven. The thing about fashion is that the way if develops is largely arbitrary. Changes in fashion resemble a drunken walk through possible design space with the drunkard receiving regular shoves from &#34;influencers&#34; who are usually trying to sell you something. Occasionally you have a fashion &#34;revival&#34; where someone takes an idea from the past, gives it a new spin, and then sells it back to newcomers as the next big thing.This seems especially true in the types of startups and companies many HN readers work at or aspire to join / build - that is ones which are low stake / high reward.I think when you combine the low stakes nature of the VC driven startup world with its cult of youth and the in group conformity of young people this is what you get.[1] by low stakes I mean no one will die and you won&#39;t be prosecuted if your single page app startup goes tits up. Indeed you&#39;re supposed to &#34;fail fast&#34; precisely because the cost of failure is so low. Even if a VC or angel has invested a few million in you, to them that&#39;s still low stakes because they exist on an entirely different plane of wealth and you are just one of multiple bets.[2] We&#39;re going to rebel by all dressing the same but not the same as our dad!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; So what have we now? A “mono repo” codebase, because clearly a Git repository per function in your system would be too much, a large deployment descriptor per fine-grained component, which Spring maybe called “Controller” but is now called “Function”, and instead of combining them all on your desktop, you send them off to someone else’s mega-mainframe [AKA &#34;the cloud&#34;]. You deploy, get an error message, and login to CloudWatch to see what actually happened - it’s all batch-driven, just like the bad old days, so progress is slow. At least we’re not having to walk to the printer on every try, but that pretty much sums up the progress of the last half century. Oh, and a “Function” will be able to handle a single request concurrently, so here’s your AWS hosting bill, we needed a lot of instances, I hope you won’t have a heart attack. Yes, we run workloads that your nephew can run on his Raspberry Pi 4, but this is the future of enterprise.I&#39;ve mentioned as much to several C-suite executives and professional venture investors I know who tend to wax philosophical about &#34;exponential growth in cloud services and big data&#34; and whatnot. Invariably, their response has been to tell me that I just don&#39;t get it, or that I make no sense. They give me puzzled looks and maybe even get a bit exasperated with me.Surely others here on HN have run into similarly minded individuals too. They&#39;re not hard to find.Plus ça change, plus c&#39;est la même chose."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; You deploy individual stateless functions. But not inside a Java monolith, that is old, but on top of a distributed system. You would have been laughed out of the door if you had proposed that in 2000, and you should be laughed out of the door right now, but such is the power of marketing.I’m sorry but this absurd and blatantly ignores the reasons why people choose serverless. No mention of scale to zero, virtually infinite auto scaling, automated deploys, arbitrary runtimes, ability to spin up code in multiple regions around the world with zero operational overhead, the list goes on...These are non-trivial things. You’d have to pay engineers to build the same systems provided by serverless if you want smooth deployments and high availability. Also, imagine if you wanted to start operations outside of the continental United States. You’d need to find a data center provider, buy machines, pay someone to install them (and hope they do it correctly), and then, when ever you have a technical problem, you need to email the datacenter team to have someone plug in a KVM with 5 seconds of lag so your engineers can debug, and then you have to pay admins to constantly maintain the servers, and consistently pay for their rack space even if they aren’t being fully utilized. None of this is a problem on a fully managed serverless platform.This article is just click bait capitalizing on FUD in the software community. Serverless will be a part of the future of software infra whether luddites are mad about it or notDisclaimer: I work on serverless products so I am biased"</p>

Seems like it happened in 2015, which is why it seems that windows updates have been more unstable in the last couple of years.[2]I really want to like windows, but Apple&#39;s M1 and Linux&#39;s community make it hard to ever love windows again.Oh well, I guess I will be using Macbooks for the rest of my life. Which, actually, isn&#39;t so bad I guess.FWIW - I would say this is unacceptable on microsoft&#39;s part.

For the past more than a year, I struggle with intermittent touchpad scroll failure on multiple laptops (including surface pro, thinkpad, etc). Of course, the only support you can get from searching the web is to update the driver. In this case, I don&#39;t think driver is the problem, the windows multi-touch and precision touchpad component has internal bug, the cause scrolling, either touchpad or touchscreen, to loss response every a few minuets for 15s-ish period. Super annoying when you browse web without a mouse. I don&#39;t see any solution in the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, I cannot just dump all my windows PC and switch to either mac or linux, because I stuck with a few CAD software that only runs on windows."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Modern humans spend virtually no time on &#34;inward-directed thought&#34;, and not solely because we&#39;re too busy: in one US survey, 95% of adults said they&#39;d found time for a leisure activity in the previous 24 hours, but 83% said they&#39;d spent zero time just thinking.&#34;I think Pascal was correct because at least those people I know well enough to discuss such matters with tell me they don&#39;t spend much time thinking or contemplating about much at all.  This is a bit strange to me as I&#39;ve always thought about things—mind you, not necessarily things of great importance but about things in general. It&#39;s dead easy for me to daydream time away (unfortunately). (When I was at school one of the punishments was to be sent to stand in a corner and stare at the wall.  It used to send some kids almost crazy but never bothered me much—all I had to do was to go into daydream mode to pass time away!)Since reading this article it&#39;s occurred to me that those people who&#39;ve really struggled with the isolation of COVID-19 lockdowns and who continually seek the company of other people are perhaps those who suffer this &#39;inability to sit quietly in a room alone&#39;.  I mention this because during earlier posts on the topic of large numbers of people who were not coping with the enforced isolation, I said that for me, if anything, the enforced lockdown was a blessing as I wasn&#39;t continually having to deal with people I&#39;d rather not deal with.  Similarly, I find noise and activity distracting, even annoying at times.No doubt when COVID-19 is over and the postmortems begin in earnest, this connection will be researched.Another afterthought, perhaps those best suited to interplanetary traveling will be those who do have a good  ability to quietly contemplate things (after all, it&#39;s likely they&#39;ll be forced to do lots of it)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"With all the discussion about what the “big trick” is that makes the M1 seem to be such a breakthrough, I can’t help but wonder, if the M1 is more like the iPhone: The sum of a large number of small engineering improvements, coupled with a lot of component integration detail work, topped off by some very shrewd supply chain arrangements.Analogous to the iPhone being foreshadowed by the iPod without most experts believing Apple could make a mobile phone from that, the M1 was foreshadowed by the A1 for mobile devices with many(most?) experts not forecasting how much it could be the base for laptops and desktops.It seems, the M1 includes numerous small engineering advances and the near term lockup of the top of the line fab in the supply chain also reminds me of how Apple had secured exclusivity for some key leading edge iPhone parts (was it the screens?).So the M1 strikes me as the result of something that Apple has the ability to pull off from time to time.And that is rather hard to pull off financially, organizationally and culturally. And it more than makes up for some pretty spectacular tactical mis-steps (I’m looking at you, puck mouse, cube mac, butterfly keyboard).EDIT for typo"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the narrative around instruction set is a bit overblown. I was a chip architect for the shader core at a major GPU company. I worked on simulators and modeling performance for next generation chips where we changed the ISA for each family of chips. The big reason why Apple Silicon is so damn fast is because they were able to shape the design at modeling time exclusively around Mac system level workloads. At best, Intel would have some subset of traces come from Apple for important traces to optimize for. Combine getting to narrow traces down exclusively for one platform, and heterogeneous design space (cpu + coprocessors) and you can really tune a monster."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not clear what RISC-V has to do with the Apple M1.Also not clear what benefit RISC-V would have for &#34;coprocessors&#34;. GPUs and various machine learning speedup devices are massively parallel devices, intended to run small, specialized programs in parallel on multiple specialized execution units.Also note that the real win of the Apple M1 is lower power consumption. In terms of basic compute speed, there are Intel products that are roughly comparable. But they use more much more power. This is more about battery life than compute power. (Also heat. Apple laptops have had a long-standing problem with running too hot, from having too much electronics in a thin fanless enclosure. The M1 gets them past that.)The hardware video decoder is probably to make it possible to play movies with most of the rest of the machine in a sleep mode. The CPU is probably fast enough to do the decode in software, but would use more power than the video decoder."</p>

In the image-processing dept... still, it was more than 10x faster than the microvax that served the rest of the dept!It’s kind of amazing to me, having lived through all the change, that a modern Arm SOC like the $5 Pi-0 would blow away that at-the-time (1989) high-end workstation, in every respect. In the dust.In comparison, the first computer I ever got was the ZX81 (in 1981, so about 8 years earlier) and it had 1K of RAM, came as components that I soldered to the motherboard (I was 11 at the time, soldering was old-hat) and I was more interested in the black-and-white, dial-tuned, portable TV that I could have in my bedroom that came with it :) But to go from that to the DEC 3100 in such a short time was also massive progress."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m glad to see this and we need to concentrate on speeding this process up.  This isn’t the last pandemic and all things considered this one was a pretty benign one to have to fight.  The next one might not just kill mainly the old and weak and might need much more than a mask (that we still can’t get people to wear!) to prevent its spread.  Hopefully before then, we can work to get everyone more on the same page and have a rapid vaccine task force ready.My brother is a doctor and he got his Pfizer shot yesterday.  Less than one year has passed since the first case in the USA.  I consider this one of the great accomplishments of science.  It will go unnoticed by many idiots on social media but it is an amazing achievement by all the scientists and doctors involved."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; They identified the sequence for the spike protein, plugged that into their vaccine platform, and voila – an mRNA vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.Moderna zeroed in on the spike protein thanks th large amount of previous research on SARS-CoV-1. Vaccines effective in animal models of SARS were developed based on this approach starting around 2004:https://www.pnas.org/content/101/17/6641The article continues:&gt; The win-win here, however, is that the more we develop a universal vaccine platform, the more we can have the best of both worlds – fast plus safe and effective. But this also means we need public buy in, which requires reassuring the public about the process and the strategy. It also means reassuring the public that the process has not been politicized, and that objective experts are driving (something the TA did poorly).The MRNA approach requires an understanding of viral vulnerabilities and a lot of animal studies prior to the synthesis of a vaccine candidate. Again, that seemingly fruitless work with SARS more than a decade ago was the key to the success of Moderna and Pfizer today.It&#39;s a lesson that should not be forgotten but probably will.The other thing to keep in mind is that the Pfizer and Moderna approvals represent the first ever large-scale use of MRNA vaccines in humans. That substantially lowers the barrier to entry of new vaccines based on the same platform."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The layman&#39;s explanation I&#39;ve seen about how these mRNA vaccines work is that they get some of your cells to manufacture a protein that is characteristic of the virus, which the cells release and the immune system takes care of.Then later if you get the virus, the immune system already recognizes that protein and takes care of the virus.Question: why do we need to have our cells make the protein? Couldn&#39;t we synthesize and distribute the protein itself and inject that?Question 2: what happens to the cells that take in the mRNA and make the protein? Do they just make a certain amount of it, then go back to normal?Or do they keep making it for the lifetime of the cell, and stop doing whatever that cell is normally supposed to do?Or do they get killed doing this, much like if they were infected by the virus (except, of course, that unlike the with the virus, what they are making is not viral, so the maximum number of cells that would be killed making the protein is equal to the number of mRNA strands in the injection)?"</p>

They provide a performance quota grace period of a month, during which all tests passed with flying colours.

I had a very angry customer calling up asking me to please explain why they were seeing an average of 0.1 IOPS...From: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html&#34;The baseline rate is 50 MiB/s per TiB of storage (equivalently, 50 KiB/s per GiB of storage).AWS now provides a performance floor of 1 MiB/s, but at the time there was no floor.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m skimming this but so far I still don&#39;t understand how any kind of authentication failure can or should lead to an SMTP server returning &#34;this address doesn&#39;t exist&#34;. Does anyone see an explanation?Edit 1: Oh wow I didn&#39;t even realize there were multiple incidents. Thanks!Edit 2 (after reading the Gmail post-mortem):
AH! It was a messed up domain name! When this event happened, I said senders need to avoid taking &#34;invalid address&#34; at face value when they&#39;ve recently succeeded delivering to the same addresses. But despite the RFC saying senders &#34;should not&#34; repeat requests (rather than &#34;must not&#34;), many people had a lot of resistance to this idea, and instead just blamed Google for messing up implementing the RFC. People seemed to think every other server was right to treat this as a permanent error.
But this post-mortem makes it crystal clear how that completely missed the point, and in fact wasn&#39;t the case at all. The part of the service concluding &#34;address not found&#34; was working correctly! They didn&#39;t mess up implementing the spec—they messed up their domain name in the configuration. Which is an operational error you just can&#39;t assume will never happen—it&#39;s exactly like the earlier analogy to someone opening the door to the mailman and not recognizing the name of a resident.
A robust system (in this case the sender) needs to be able to recognize sudden anomalies—in this case, failure to deliver to an address that was accepting mail very recently—and retry things a bit later.

The fabricated evidence falsely asserted that the meetings included discussions of child abuse or exploitation, terrorism, racism or incitements to violence, and sometimes included screenshots of the purported participants’ user profiles featuring, for example, a masked person holding a flag resembling that of the Islamic State terrorist group.Ah. So it&#39;s not quite disrupting meetings, it&#39;s framing people as pedophiles an terrorists."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The part of the trail that&#39;s in Washington state is in pretty good shape. Next summer, the crucial missing link will be restored when the Beverly bridge across the Columbia is repaired. Amazingly, this project has an approved budget and a plan that that is (so far) being executed on schedule.The western part of the trail (from the North Bend to the Columbia, across the Cascade mountains) is in very good shape. The most scenic and pleasant part of the trail from North Bend to Thorp is amazing. It includes the 2.1 mile Snoqualmie Tunnel, which is exciting the first time you try it. The section through the Yakima River Canyon is my favorite.The eastern part (from the Columbia to Idaho) is pretty rough and a few small pieces are missing, but a road detour for a mile or two is probably a welcome change from the endless trail.A few years ago, some state representatives conspired to give away the eastern half of the trail to private land owners, but their own incompetence doomed this attempted theft of public land. The law, as written and passed, specified a section of the trail that had a length of 0. But it attracted enough attention and outrage, and as a result, there is now more of a budget for maintaining the trail."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazing to hear of this, I&#39;d always dreamed of a coast-to-coast bike route and never realized that it&#39;s actually been in the works for decades.

I&#39;ll definitely be donating to this, even if I won&#39;t get to experience the full thing for another 20 years."</p>

					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25477535">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was the first corporate web master for AltaVista and joined in January 1996 to manage everything except for the actual search engine itself.It was my first real job at a large company and taught me a lot about working in corporate America.I saw so many mistakes made within the year I worked there that were obvious even at the time for a lot of us that worked there, but at the same time there are many similarities to what happens with other very well funded projects trying to make sense of a new technology and way of doing businesses within a large very important company with a very different business model.I have seen virtually the exact same playbook happen in the enterprise blockchain space in multiple occasions over the last 5 years.It is sad in many ways to see what happened to DEC (probably more so than AltaVista). It was such an innovative company back in the 60s and 70s, but unlike IBM weren&#39;t able to reinvent themselves in first the new 80s world of PCs and then later internet. Classic case of innovators dilemma.AltaVista itself largely died, because in a misguided attempt to manage the innovators dilemma they just tried to rebrand everything network oriented they had as AltaVista.People only remember the search engine now and for good reason. But we had AltaVista firewalls, gigabit routers, network cards, mail server (both SMTP and X400 (!!!) and a bunch of other junk without a coherent strategy. Everything that had anything to do with networking got the AltaVista logo on it.The focus became on selling their existing junk using the now hip AltaVista brand, but the AltaVista search itself was not given priority.I learnt a lot from my experience there, grew to be extremely skeptical, learnt to love Dilbert and also learnt how cool the DEC Hardware and Digital Unix was compared to the Sun Sparc and Solaris stuff I had to work on afterwards."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s hard to explain just how good Google was back in the day, compared to those early search engines.I distinctly remember someone suggesting it to me at our CS lab in college. A few of us had never heard of it, and we all started to do some searches to try it out. There was silence for about 5 minutes, and then someone said &#34;this is really good.&#34;Say what you want about what Google has turned into, but it was an incredibly important tool that came around at the right time.Also, it makes me really happy that they&#39;ve kept the &#34;I&#39;m Feeling Lucky&#34; button around."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What drew me to AltaVista was that it gave me results that didn&#39;t exist elsewhere. It took some boolean gymnastics to get precise results, or going a few pages deep, but stuff, if it existed, was findable.I almost wish there were less precise and more obscure options out there today. A search engine that purposefully didn&#39;t index mainstream news, social media, nor shopping/product sites."</p>

This WSJ article was published a month after the bill was officially killed…The broader legislature has no  interest in such a tax.This is the bill in question:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Personally I disagree with the whole idea of wealth taxes, you should be taxed when you do things, not taxed just because you own something worth money. I should be able to go live in the woods alone and not have the government take some percent of my net worth just because I exist.I mean I don&#39;t have a tonne of sympathy for people with tens of millions of net worth, but it just seems wrong in principle. If I start a company and it gets valued at 30 million dollars, why should the government be allowed to force me to sell my company to pay their wealth tax? Seems wrong to me, if you own something you should be allowed to keep it indefinitely. Property taxes are a bit of a grey area, but they make more sense because of all the infrastructure required for a house to be accessible.Or another example, I own a piece of art or a car passed down through my family that is worth 30 million dollars (maybe it&#39;s a mclaren f1 or something). Now the government is going to force me to sell my car? I disagree with that, obviously that&#39;s an extreme case, but laws should still handle cases like that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not sure what the problem is. When Democrat supporters demand more more more via the politicians who promise more more more, where did they think the money would come from?Believe it or not, the bottom ~50% don&#39;t have enough money to tax. The next 30-40% have some but not enough to raise enough money to help. The taxes have to be focused on the top 10% and more likely the top 1-3% to raise enough to meet these demands.I think the biggest problem will be trying to enact this on people who aren&#39;t California (or even US) residents who are now out of state. You can tax visitors for actions they take while they&#39;re in your state (sales tax, hotel taxes, even income) but when they&#39;re not there and haven&#39;t been there for years?The State of California may get a rude awakening on this one."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The labor of medical residents is something hospital systems exploit during normal times, but that exploitation has severely deepened during the pandemic. At the hospital my partner works at, respiratory therapists and nurses got a $10k bonus for working during COVID; the residents got nothing despite working insane hours in ICU, routinely working more than the legally mandated 90 hours per week. Just because doctors earn more later in their careers does not excuse the level of labor exploitation they are subject to during residency.Stanford is not the only hospital system to restrict access to the vaccine from frontline residents. I can name 3 other local hospital systems in my city that have vaccinated administrative &amp; C-suite/VP level staff before doctors, nurses, and other frontline employees. If vaccine allocation is getting messed up this early on within these closed systems, I can&#39;t help but think the next 2-3 phases will go awry as well--what checks are in place to ensure these vaccines get distributed to grocery store workers before people who are willing to pay more to get it early?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Is retracting enough?So a news story gets out, millions read it, share or watch it. Then NYT retracts it. Maybe adding a footnote or correction (sometimes they don&#39;t even do that [1]) is added to the story. Maybe the story is removed from their site.However, the faulty information has already registered into the minds of millions of people.NYT has already intentionally or unintentionally indoctrinated the minds of many readers and with the &#34;retraction&#34; at the same time they can claim the highest standards of journalism.Unless in good fait, NYT tries to bring as much attention into the correction to the readers they have already impacted, the retraction is journalistic virtue signaling and a very small victory for truth.Even if they do as much work in publicizing the retraction so many people have already formed a biased view and it&#39;ll be hard to undo that.The only path forward is to fully hold NYT accountable. Fire the editor and journalist in charge of the story would be a start.[1] https://twitter.com/Timcast/status/1187036978463891456"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just listened to most of this earlier. I don&#39;t quite get it.IIRC, the original series did treat Chaudhry as dubious, but maybe partially truthful . He was caught on a timeline lie, confronted by the journalist, he adjusted his timeline... Also, the whole series was constructed somewhat naively. It follows the journalist&#39;s investigations sequentially. The &#34;story&#34; follows leads and narratives that do or don&#39;t turn out to be true. You&#39;re following an investigation in progress. In that frame, this is just further evidence as the story continues.Caliphate just isn&#39;t framed as a traditional print &#34;feature&#34; where the journalist weighs everything in advance and only references fact-checked reliable evidence once they&#39;re done.I actually felt that caliphate did a better-than-most job at communicating shades of certainty. I wish the NYT did more of this. Journalistic standards are good tools, but they do not (should not, IMO) just sort everything into &#34;true&#34; or &#34;unverified&#34; piles and . Uncertainty about truth is inevitable. Communicate this well, honestly, and we&#39;ll all be better informed.This felt like way more than a retraction. Maybe they&#39;re using it as a &#34;teaching moment&#34; about how journalism works. I don&#39;t love it though. I can think of much better targets for NYT mea culpa or soul search. Caliphate is not a low watermark for journalism in any way. Maybe I&#39;m missing something.If they (or any major paper) is feeling reflective, why not reflect on more systemic questions. How about double confirmed rumours from anonymous sources? Two sources, even if both remain nameless and have a personal interest in leaking to the press is considered fine.. I believe. This is common in political reporting. Stuff gets leaked. Journalists get confirmation from another insider.. maybe two. That can be printed. If it turns out to be a fallacious rumour, they still &#34;met standards.&#34; Maybe they print a retraction, but no one did anything wrong. Meanwhile, this is the cause of many untruths getting published each year."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Defaulting to generosity - while operating with healthy boundaries - is by far the most beneficial mindset.The alternatives are:Victim. &#34;I am too weak and poor to help anyone but I expect people to help me.&#34; This belief corrodes you.Stoic(can&#39;t think of a better word.) &#34;I don&#39;t help anyone and therefore I don&#39;t expect anyone to help me&#34;. Well, better than the victim but ends up passing up many opportunities where others are genuinely ready to help.Abuser &#34;I don&#39;t bother to help others but I take advantage of them&#34; - becomes obvious very quickly and you are ostracized and hated.Doormat &#34;I help everyone but because I don&#39;t have healthy boundaries, I end up attracting abusers and victims.&#34; Gross.The &#34;best people&#34; are clear and confident with their boundaries and generous with their time and resources when people are on the right side of the boundary. I see this a lot with truly successful senior managers and businesspeople, for example.Even in politics, when a candidate runs for office, they want to tell stories of &#34;X came to me and needed help and I really took the time to hear them and help them (kindness). Then Y came and they sought to rip us off and I told them to go fuck themselves (boundaries).&#34; We seek that as species, we expect that out of the best among us, and therefore we reward those who operate from this place (and it&#39;s good for lots of other reasons.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was doing all these things this week, and had a realization that the older I get more and more rely on me. I don&#39;t know how it got to be that way. But it was probably doing one kind thing followed by another. And now I&#39;m getting all kinds of help requests. Just in the last week, I helped my cousin move (ridiculous amount of stuff), donated to my other cousins gofund me for his restaurant and stayed up 3 hours talking with him about his problems. Fixed a family friends laptop. The list go on. Its like snowball. I&#39;m just accumulating connections I guess. So I suppose thats good, but on the other hand I probably spent 2 days last week on just doing things for people. If I reflect on it, I can see how this would improve someones mental health to be kind. You are connecting with people and interacting with them. So you definitely feel less lonely for example."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only issue that I have, is that so many people (in my industry/nation/orbit) mistake kindness for weakness.I live in New York, which has a basic culture of &#34;hyper aggressiveness.&#34; It isn&#39;t &#34;rudeness,&#34; as so many people like to think of New Yorkers. They can be aggressively kind and generous. They are just aggressive.I&#39;m also in the tech industry, which seems to have a very aggressive and competitive culture.It doesn&#39;t stop me from being kind and courteous, but it gets grating.My experience is that, when someone mistakes courtesy for weakness, they start trying to &#34;game&#34; me. I put up with it for a bit, until they push too far.Then the till gets slammed on their fingers.They get very, very upset. Far more upset than if I had just disabused them early on.I&#39;m learning to enforce my boundaries earlier. It doesn&#39;t make me as popular, but it also prevents those &#34;psycho freakouts.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I guess this article sums up why we&#39;ve had a rather bad experience with stripe so far: the API constantly changes, and the documentation or even Googling for a solution seems to be more confusing than ever since most articles you&#39;ll find are about some older API.It initially took us much more engineering hours to integrate Stripe into our processes then expected. Granted, we do worldwide sales, with multiple tax-flows and we accept multiple payment methods in both euros and USD. This was during the Charges/Sources days.Then this year we had to go through all that again to migrate from the Charges/Sources model to the PaymentIntent model. This was a pain as the popular payment method in our own country was still very much in beta for the PaymentIntent flow. Documentation was all over the place and customer service often did not know answers to implementation questions (though I must say, they always followed up eventually with some good pointers).Now we are receiving scary emails about how much money we&#39;ll lose if we are not SCA compliant. But following the link in that email shows we are SCA compliant... Confusing stuff. Let&#39;s just hope we don&#39;t have to go through a migration again.Disclaimer: I don&#39;t have any meaningful experience with other payment providers, so a can&#39;t really tell if Stripe is better or worse than others. I guess accepting payments is just really hard if you want to do anything beyond the &#39;hello world&#39; (which is: credit cards in the US only)."</p>

Apply that simplification that you wish you could have for your already launched application. Maybe you have a need to make your auth slightly more proprietary. If you churn out applications all the time yeah I get why this could all be seen as a waste of time.I don’t say this to belittle your service at all, looks neat! Just throwing out an alternative viewpoint for the sake of it :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SuperTokens looks really cool and I&#39;m glad it&#39;s open source, however, I think the big &#34;blue ocean&#34; here for self-hosted auth systems vs. AWS Cognito and Auth0 are security compliance.Many large orgs with data requirements need things like ISO 27001, FedRAMP, etc. If you build with a product like SuperTokens and then need to meet these requirements later in your development lifecycle, you&#39;ll have to:a. switch to Cognito/Auth0 for ISO, and for FedRAMP you can only use Cognito.b. modify SuperTokens by learning NIST requirements (costs engineer time, developers might not know Java)c. you can make your own, but that defeats the purpose for these systems (costs more time than b)I feel an &#34;Enterprise&#34; (paid) option by SuperTokens where security compliance is handled, with still the option for self-hosting, would be a massive win."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting write-up, but I feel like it would be helpful to put an image of the final render up front so the reader has a better point of reference for what the intended effect of all the steps is.https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gO2R-e5TmHs/X9umb0DXKFI/AAAAAAAAC..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Meanwhile Sony just announced they will be refunding purchases for this game and taking it off their virtual store due to it being extremely buggy and seemingly unfinished on consoles.  This is an unprecedented move for a game of this stature and is a monumental failure from CDPR.https://www.playstation.com/en-us/cyberpunk-2077-refunds/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very interesting article.Some humble thoughts:The discussion on the SSAO suggests that the game&#39;s system uses GTAO - lots of features suggest at the least heavy inspiration from the technique (see &#34;Practical Realtime Strategies for Accurate Indirect Occlusion&#34; - relatively accessible paper).The way the game&#39;s rendering is set up seems very carefully thought out. Namely, the relative lack of pre-baking and lighting &#34;tricks.&#34; This accomplishes several things at once: It simplifies development of locations and assets - hugely important in a game with a scope this large, it makes the lighting/visuals of the game more robust and consistent in quality, and it also allows the integration of ray tracing effects without changing the artists&#39; and designers&#39; process.Since even without ray tracing the game uses PBR and broadly physically plausible (though carefully designed) lighting, adding ray-tracing doesn&#39;t require a massive amount of extra work. All the information is already there, and it&#39;ll be much easier to make it look good.All in all, reading this article has done just as much to convince me that the game is &#34;next-gen&#34; (at least in terms of graphics) as actually playing it has :)As a comparison, the ENB mod for Skyrim allows dynamic lighting in that game, but to actually use physically plausible light locations rather than the base game&#39;s prebaked light maps essentially requires redoing the lighting for all the locations in the entire game (there are several mods that do indeed do this.)Before CP2077 I still hadn&#39;t seen a game that definitely beat what you could accomplish with modded Skyrim for visuals - even in very recent games it was all still fundamentally done the same way. Good to see that essentially a decade of near stagnation has ended. It&#39;s a little vexing that the state of PC gaming is so dependent on the release of new consoles, though.Edits: for minor fixes"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think most of the negative sentiment against Cyberpunk 2077 comes from three sources:1) Some players expected this to be cyberpunk-themed RDR2/GTA5. It turns out it&#39;s nothing like that, it&#39;s more like a new Deus Ex game.2) It just doesn&#39;t run on consoles. It&#39;s a very inferior experience, unless you&#39;re the type who can be happy with 2020 movies in .3gp format in your old Nokia phone. Having watched a video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5pHpQqhmR4) of how it runs on PS4, I now clearly see where all this hate comes from.3) There are some bugs and quirks, depending on your platform and luck. I haven&#39;t had any major issues, though I know for some it&#39;s just unplayable at the moment. This will likely get much better after patches hit.On a personal note, I like the game a lot. Yes it has its quirks, and I generally feel it&#39;s a less refined/polished game compared to what Witcher 3 was, but still it&#39;s an extremely fun, really well-made game. Combat is great, world is enticing, story-telling swings between good enough and great. For one reason or another whenever I launch the game another 5 hours passes without me noticing. FPS camera and general art direction also helps with suspension of disbelief, and the game is as immersive as it gets.It&#39;s a shame that this game now has such a bad reputation for relatively minor &amp; mostly avoidable reasons."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is incredible, and must be devastating for the development team, especially after all that crunching.As someone who&#39;s worked on a (digital-only) title for Xbox One, I&#39;m surprised this game got through the certification process in the first place. From our experience the platform holders are pretty involved, and we regularly gave MS updates on everything from monetization, to UX and controls, to extensive reviews for updates, which caused headaches when the client lagged behind our other platforms.Unfortunately for the developers, the fact of the matter is that there are tens of millions of base PS4s and Xbox Ones out there, and gamers got a bait and switch during this launch. As terrible as it is for them to get the rug pulled under them, Sony risks a lot more by not issuing refunds for incredibly broken products. A lot of the appeal of console gaming is the relative plug-and-play factor that comes with it, and the software regularly costs more to boot — via higher pricing, lack of sales, or both."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"-- What was the purpose of the crunch / rushing this out the door ?-- What was to be gained from it? Holiday sales? Delivering a product not delayed again? Management bonuses? Did the developers get bonuses for delivering &#34;on time&#34;?-- At what cost did the crunch / delivering the product cause the team of developers? Now they need to keep working; fix the bugs; get this back in the store(s) and try to make everyone happy?We go through our share of crunches. Bugs always get through and we have to fix them of course, but nothing as bad as some of the stuff I&#39;ve read about this.Management never realizes burnout is a real thing. I feel for these developers. It&#39;s double sided. Keep delaying the game / product and people get pissed off it&#39;s delayed. Ship it, and now they&#39;re pissed off its buggy. So now, everyone (programmers) are burned out; management is probably fuming over being removed from the store(s) and everyone needs to smile and get back to it, probably as a worse crunch than before. What a shitty way to spend the holidays.It&#39;s like getting made at a company building your house that your water pipes leak but you rushed them to get it done because of some arbitrary move in date. Take the time; do it right; do a good job. Cut corners and rush stuff and deal with the consequences."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Facebook and Google have completely smashed the online advertising industry. The whole reason online advertising is so difficult to profit on is because Facebook and Google have sucked all the profit out of the room. The Open Web is a total shambles because of nonsense from Google and Facebook so many companies don&#39;t even have an alternative to fall back on...  Now Facebook is claiming they are defending small business. What a joke.Anything which causes Facebook to make this much noise must be good."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s much more to this than meets the eye.I believe the basic reason Apple delayed implemening the proposed iOS 14 IDFA policy change is that Apple has their own ads business for promotion of app store installs which was using a device identifier in exactly the the same way as other publishers for conversion attribution. However permissioning for this sharing with Apple is controlled under a different &#34;default on&#34; setting under Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Apple Advertising than the one proposed for IDFA which is case by case permissions request. From what i am given to understand, due to this dichotomy, ad networks threatend Apple with anti-trust lawsuits if they went ahead as a classic argument of using an advantage in one market (device and OS they control) to unfairly shut out competition in another (ads) could be made.Now Apple will probably disable or remove this dichotomy in some way before they roll out the policy change but they probably will still have other problems. For instance their skadnetwork API [1] which they use for their app installs ads business and recommend to other ad networks supports only app installs conversion on their own app store and not other forms of conversion (eg. buying in e-commerce etc). But if they now restrict other forms of conversion attribution that used to be possible previously, could an argument again be made that they are using their dominance in one field to unfairly kill competition in another.I think the only way Apple can implement this policy change without wading into an antitrust minefield is to completely give up their own ads business. But i suspect it&#39;s quite lucrative, otherwise why wouldn&#39;t they already have shut it down?This is by no means a done deal. Let&#39;s get out the pop corn and watch the fun.[1] https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skadnetwo..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t understand Facebook&#39;s concern. Apple is merely allowing users to OPT IN to tracking. It doesn&#39;t matter if tracking is good for small business, because it&#39;s the users that are being tracked. And if Facebook tracking is so great for the users, then clearly every user will opt in. So why is Facebook worried? The only reason Facebook could be worried is if they know tracking is bad for users."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thank the gods for JetBrains. I love their software.Excellent business model, I get to keep the software I bought when the license expires. Never forced to continually pay for something you don&#39;t see value in updating. I think that&#39;s one of the key factors which drives them to continue to improve their products. If future version of their products wasn&#39;t vastly improved over the previous then people wouldn&#39;t upgrade because their current version serves them perfectly fine. And if you don&#39;t like this years update, maybe you&#39;ll like next years. No downsides whatsoever.Never used any of their TeamCity/Spaces stuff but it looks cool. I can definitely say I&#39;m a fan of their IDEs though. Use them every day."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ll repost my WGU experience from another comment:I dropped out of traditional college. Last class I remember they were talking about what a GET and POST request were. I had been a professional web developer for years at that point. I felt it was a waste of time.In WGU I had a similar easy class, stuff that was &#34;way below me&#34;. Not to worry, I passed the class in a day and stopped worrying about wasted time.I recently did a C++ assignment that was filled with artificial requirements making it artificially difficult, yet I learned some things about pointers and figured out the basics of CMake for the first time. Useful stuff. Now I&#39;m doing a similar assignment with Java. I knew I would have to set aside my distaste for things like Java (gross!), and with that mindset things aren&#39;t so bad. I&#39;m actually enjoying JavaFX.WGU&#39;s calculus class was harder than calc 1 at my brick and mortar university, but easier than calc 2. Once again, I knew most of the material and passed after only a few weeks of casual review. I also found a calculus text book I personally like (and will happily refer to again in the future), rather that just using whatever the department chose.I do agree that a CS degree doesn&#39;t teach as much as it sometimes gets credit for. I do believe WGU&#39;s CS degree is as good as many brick and mortar CS degrees, but with minimal &#34;bullshit&#34;, though there is still some."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Almost seems like the writer treated the process like playing a video game, without all the pretty colors and sounds that give you that dopamine hit.I feel like I did get a lot out of my Computer Science degree. I got it in 2004 and I picked up a lot of stuff I don&#39;t think I would have learned on my own. I also went to a small state University in the middle of nowhere that&#39; wasn&#39;t very expensive, and I didn&#39;t rack up any debt (a little in grad school, but still not more that I couldn&#39;t pay off in ~2 years).But you get out of your education what you put into it. I worked with people who went to 2-year associate programs who didn&#39;t understand BigO notation, and people who didn&#39;t go to college at all, but who knew their algorithms inside and out (one who even got in at Google in the early days).I&#39;m glad I got my degree, but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s worth the cost some people are paying now. I shared my concerns with my nephew and he ended up getting his CS degree at a smaller/cheaper state university. I&#39;d say if you can&#39;t get a degree without going into excessive debt, it&#39;s really not worth it today.I know I&#39;m just guessing, but the writer of this article seems crazy driven. Maybe, this is the type of person who could start their own small business out of nowhere, or survive long hours at SpaceX for the pure thrill of successful rocket launches? If you have the drive to run through something like this, there really aren&#39;t any limits to what you can do. I&#39;ve done pretty well at all my jobs and have learned a lot of cool stuff, worked in three countries ... but on a scale of Wally (from Dilbert) to Elon, I&#39;m certainly more towards the Wally side.Going back to games; I wonder if this type of education and training would be more accessibl if it was gameified. McDonalds Japan briefly tried to turn their training program into a Nintendo DS game (failed terrible and the game is very rare). That might be a model for new typed of education going forward."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Through a secure cloud connection, the Ellume COVID-19 Home Test provides real time reporting of test results and critical data to health authorities, employers and educators, for efficient COVID-19 mapping. [1]&gt; Real-time reporting through secure, HIPAA compliant cloud connection [1]My understanding is that a major hurdle was the FDA requiring test results be reported back to health authorities. Or at least there has been a lot of disagreement on the issue [2]. It&#39;s a bit unclear if the reporting via the app is 100% mandatory but I would bet on it sending at least something indicating positive/negative by default.I&#39;d expect the majority of the per unit cost to be the digital test reader and Bluetooth capability. I&#39;m skeptical if this is anything more than a fancy camera + Bluetooth like digital pregnancy tests. [3]I&#39;m glad we are finally getting an at home test but I can not help but think that having cheaper and simpler antigen test strips available months ago would have been a better solution.[1] https://www.ellumehealth.com/products/consumer-products/covi...[2] https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/06/health/coronavirus-rapid-...[3] https://hackaday.com/2020/09/09/digital-pregnancy-tests-use-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For anyone else wondering about the benefits/downsides of the various tests (why do one that takes multiple days when you can do that takes 15 minutes?), the FDA has a pretty good page on this subject:https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/coronavirus-d...The tests that swab your nose or throat and take multiple days are called &#34;molecular&#34; tests and are considered highly accurate. They use controlled heating and cooling cycles to convert the virus&#39; RNA to DNA, which can be detected by specialized lab technique after binding probes to it.Tests like this 15 min one are called &#34;antigen&#34; tests and are still accurate/helpful, but are known to produce more false negatives and false positives compared to molecular."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have mixed feelings.  It might undermine trust (already feeble in the U.S. across the board when it comes to both authority and science nowadays) if there are false results.  When Musk tweeted his results of what I believe were antigen (and not PCR tests, which are more accurate), and showed contradictory results with a WTF attitude, that&#39;s an example of what we&#39;ll see more of.  Musk is no shining example, but the messaging somehow needs to be &#34;this is just a first line test, you should really rely on PCR test.&#34;That last line seems too complex, as simple as it is, to relay via the news media and &#39;the public.&#39;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This isn&#39;t a bad list of topics about data structures, algorithms, and software fundamentals, but let&#39;s not pretend that computer science has anything to do with most software engineering roles. I studied computer science, and in 30 years, I&#39;ve hardly used any of it. There were a few jobs where some of the statistics and math were helpful, but in my long career, I&#39;ve seen very little overlap between computer science and working as a software engineer. Google and other big tech companies use these criteria to filter people out at the hiring stage, but the vast majority of work has nothing to do with any of this stuff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Spoiler alert: https://medium.com/@googleyasheck/i-didnt-get-hired-here-s-w...&gt; Last week I received a rejection email from the recruiter, and at first, I thought it was a mistake, and laughed it off. I checked in with my referral and he inquired into it and lobbied on my behalf, but in the end, it didn’t change the situation.... The thing that bothers me is that I didn’t even get a phone screen. I didn’t even talk to a recruiter over the phone. After all this work and enthusiasm, I didn’t even get a chance to prove myself.... After speaking with some folks related to Google, the best I can determine is that they decided to pass because there wasn’t a good fit on any teams where I might be qualified. This is in agreement with the rejection email I received — there were no roles fitting my experience and background.&gt; I’ve been hired as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon!Assuming you can get to the actual interview stage, the fastest option is to prepare by just grinding leetcode to maximize your chances of passing the interview. That won&#39;t help with aspects like the system design or behavioral interviews, but grinding leetcode will give you a better chance of passing the coding interview compared to studying CS theory."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have learned to be scared of my MacBook.  Seemingly safe behavior can cause permanent damage.  It does completely unexpected things, apparently by design.I do not put my pictures in the ~/Pictures directory for fear of what the newest app will do to “improve” them for me.  I fully expect it to apply lossy compression to my files without asking.  This is after Photos or whatever it was called at the time mangled the dates on a bunch of my vacation photos to 10 years before the actual trip.Oh and have fun when your photos are automatically uploaded to iCloud to save space locally then silently deleted from iCloud to... save space?  My sister lost her first year of baby pictures to that one.Same with ~/Music after iTunes wiped out a bunch of carefully curated metadata.  Yes, I did want that album art.I fat-fingered some key combination in Messages recently and got a prompt confirming I wanted to delete the entire conversation history.  I consider myself lucky it bothered to ask.I can add “view a PDF” to the list of things likely to leave me holding the bag."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why anyone treats PDF as anything but a write-once format is beyond me. It&#39;s so finicky that I&#39;m not shocked bugs like this happen. The only programs I&#39;d be reasonable sure wouldn&#39;t screw it up are Acrobat itself, and pdflatex and friends.I think we need a multi-image container format. It could be something that&#39;s literally a bunch of jpgs/pngs/pick your poison in a tar container, and given a new extension. OSes would open it and present it as a gallery in order. There&#39;s no value in a non-ocr&#39;d PDF existing. For OCR&#39;d text that gets more complicated, but it feels like we should be able to come up with a common denominator that doesn&#39;t have the legacy of a binary format derived from postscript in the early 90s."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work with a ton of PDF&#39;s between my Mac and iPad, and it mostly works but there are still just way too many bugs.It&#39;s a lot of little things, like in Catalina where opening up the sidebar for annotations (comments) seemingly randomized their order. (Big Sur, fortunately, fixed it to be page-order again.)Or how printing a PDF from a website (in Catalina, also seemingly fixed in Big Sur) would look right on the page... but if you copied and pasted the text from the PDF to somewhere else, something like 10% of the glyphs were scrambled (&#34;lik3 thZs&#34;), like some sort of character table corruption.Or reading a PDF with Books on my iPad, maybe 10% of the time bookmarking a page... doesn&#39;t bookmark it. Or removing a bookmark... doesn&#39;t remove it. Or a handful of highlights you just made have inexplicably disappeared the next time you open the file.Or whenever you open the PDF in Books it remembers which page you were on. Except sometimes it doesn&#39;t, so you can&#39;t really rely on that for saving your place.Or in Books, if you select some text to copy but accidentally hit the adjacent &#34;select all&#34; in the pop-up menu, and you&#39;re dealing with a 400-page PDF, it just locks up and you have to restart it.Or in Preview if you want to convert a PDF to black-and-white, there&#39;s an option for it but your PDF will balloon in filesize to 10x larger or something.I mean, I could go on and on. It&#39;s weird, because Preview is an incredible app, really. But it really is like they build it and then never bother to test if basic workflows reliably work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is actually pretty explosive news. Several of the ongoing antitrust cases involving the tech giants would require a more relaxed definition than the current   antitrust standard which necessitates linking direct consumer harm. This standard was established by a somewhat radical pro-free market court decision that reversed an earlier interpretation that viewed monopolies in and of themselves as a condition subject to antitrust litigation (without the direct consumer harm piece). The current definition poses an almost insurmountable challenge for regulators as all companies need to do in order to avoid meeting the statutory requirements for antitrust is to refrain from colluding and/or abusing their market dominant position (engaging in anti-competitive practices). It seems like Google and Facebook crossed that line in a pretty blatant way which is quite shocking considering they are fully aware of the consequences. They opened themselves up with this one in a way that could lead to their undoing. Crazy stuff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; 16. Having reached its monopoly position, Google now uses its immense market power to extract a very high tax of [redacted] percent of the ad dollars otherwise flowing to the countless online publishers and content producers like online newspapers, cooking websites, and blogs who survive by selling advertisements on their websites and apps. These costs invariably are passed onto the advertisers themselves and then to American consumers. The monopoly tax Google imposes on American businesses—advertisers like clothing brands, restaurants, and realtors—is a tax that is ultimately borne by American consumers through higher prices and lower quality on the goods, services, and information those businesses provide. Every American suffers when Google imposes its monopoly pricing on the sale of targeted advertising.Seems like a KO punch under the Sherman Act."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I enjoy how everyone discovers this &#34;feature.&#34; It really is a lot of fun to play with.True story, back in the cave person days, when television only came over the air waves and if you wanted to &#34;own&#34; a computer you shelled out anywhere from $500 to $5000 for something with an 8 bit processor that ran between 1 and 4 MHz and had, usually, much less than 65,536 bytes of RAM, peripherals for these things were few and far between. A couple of serial ports and a couple of parallel ports was considered a &#34;lot&#34; of I/O. You might have stored your programs on an 8&#34; or 5&#34; floppy disk, but if it was before 1978 you most likely stored programs on cassette tape. Anyway ...One of the things you could always count on was that these things radiated all sorts of spurious energy and being relatively low frequency beasts to begin with, finding a harmonic that you could pick up with an AM radio held &#34;near&#34; (where near could be 1&#39; to 10&#39; (.3 - 3m)) that interference and with the judicious use of delay loops cause that interference to modulate to &#34;tones&#34; and thus create recognizable &#34;music.&#34;As a kid in high school with just such a computer I can tell you that &#34;playing music&#34; (no matter how poorly) on a nearby AM radio was orders of magnitude more impressive than pointing out by the pattern of lit and unlit LEDs that your amazing machine had just calculated a logarithm. (even though the latter was significantly more difficult from a programming perspective!) Once I got a printer, being able to print out NSFW pictures was a neat trick but for crowd appeal and cheap accessories, music over an AM radio was still the top demo of the time :-)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If anyone has a Raspberry Pi and is interested, check out rpitx[0]. It bit-bangs a GPIO pin to transmit arbitrary radio, turning your Pi into a messy SDR transmitter. By connecting a wire to the GPIO pin you can transmit for tens of meters.I attached a low-pass filter to the GPIO pin and was able to control my ceiling fan with my Raspberry Pi.[0] https://github.com/F5OEO/rpitxEdit: This generates square waves which have harmonics. You will transmit signals on unintended frequencies if you don&#39;t use a filter."</p>

Brokerages can also receive payment for order flow from private firms, as long as it does not interfere with best execution. However, &#34;Robinhood explicitly offered to accept less price improvement for its customers... in exchange for receiving a higher payment for order flow,&#34; which is illegal.Full order: https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2020/33-10906.pdf"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is fantastic.  Thank you, GitHub.I hope this is a good demonstration of a hands-off approach at Microsoft in regard to company culture.I realize you likely still collect some analytics for yourself and that this change does nothing to alleviate that.  EG, first party javascript.  But it&#39;s great that it&#39;s divorced from 3rd parties.Presumably Microsoft has access to those metrics, though? I wonder how deeply that gets parsed in conjunction with everything else they collect.If only you could export some of that culture back to your corporate overlord.  I&#39;d love if MS Teams stopped exploding it&#39;s RAM usage until it eventually has to be killed if it&#39;s unable to get an OK response from its analytics endpoint.And I&#39;d love to turn off analytics in Windows altogether.  Even getting to the minimal analytic configuration is an exercise in futility spread out across a million different settings, some of which decide to reset themselves in obfuscated ways sometimes.  eg, some think updates reset them, either directly or by doing things like changing default programs to ones which require analytics (eg Office).  Or a change to one setting requires additional changes elsewhere to be effective."</p>

I stood in line for a food truck a couple years ago that offered a promotion &#34;$2 off your order if you show us your 5-star review of our truck on [site].&#34;  Obviously, you have to do this before you even order your food so I was intensely put-off by this.  I gave them a 5-star review with no comment, received my discount, then after I tried the food I edited the review to 1-star with an explanation that it probably would&#39;ve been a 4-star review had they legitimately just prepared good food but gaming the reviews was a sleazeball move.  The review was removed.Every single game on the Google Play store does this now, too.  Instead of just letting people review honestly, they show a pop-up saying &#34;Are you enjoying this game?&#34;  if so, they ask you to review it on the store.  If not, they ask you to review it via their own private feedback system.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I purchased the same webcam for my high school sophomore in September 2020, as school restarted (all online for him). The box contained a $20 &#34;gift card&#34; if I emailed proof of my 5-star review. It looks identical to the one I received (including the email address). Only the reward is different.I didn&#39;t try to write a review, I notified customer service in an attempt to report the seller.I documented everything including photos, my exchange with Amazon customer service, and the confirmation from the seller that they would pay me $20 for a 5-star review. I did not take the money offered ... I was appalled at the situation and more than a little angry that I had been tricked by bogus reviews.Here&#39;s what happened when I reported the seller:Me: Hi. The box for this product contained a card that says “Amazon $20 gift card” and looks like a gift card, but the back says I have to give a 5 star review and send my order information to an outlook email address. Is this legitimate? Is it really a $20 Amazon gift card?Amazon: Thank you so much for your information on this, I will certainly pass it along here so that we can check this promotion or offer directly with the seller. Because I am not seeing that advertised on the item at all And would not be capable of confirming if that is a legit Amazon gift card because, I do not see that offer on the itemMe: So what should I do?Amazon: My best suggestion would be to contact the seller directly for this through this link [redacted] So that you can confirm directly with them if this is legit or not Certainly giving away gift cards for good reviews is not professional And I have to report the seller for thatMe: I thought this type of offer was forbidden by Amazon’s own policies for sellers. But I will contact them using the link you sent to ask them if that’s what you recommend.Even though the CSR reported the seller, and I confirmed with the seller through Amazon&#39;s own communication system that they were paying $20 per 5 star review, nothing happened to the seller. The item (a webcam) is still for sale on Amazon, with thousands of additional 5-star reviews - more than 12,000 now, compared to 3,266 when I let Amazon know how they were gaming the reviews in September.Once again, the good guys (in the case, customers and honest sellers) lose out while the bad guys win, with no repercussions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a very similar experience last month. I ordered this toaster[1]. When I received it I noticed that in their user manual they were offering a &#34;gift&#34; in return for an Amazon review. Although to be fair they didn&#39;t explicitly demand that the review had to be positive. I submitted this 4-star review [2] to Amazon:I received the toaster not too long ago. It looks just like in the advertised pictures and works fine. But the language on the last page of the user manual (see picture) makes it clear that LOFTER is offering customers a &#34;gift&#34; in return for leaving a review. Perhaps they&#39;re within their right to do that but it makes me not trust the rest of the reviews on this product.A few days later I got an email from Amazon identical to the one in the submitted blog post[3]. I&#39;ve stopped trusting positive reviews on Amazon. These days I only look at the negative reviews to see if there&#39;s a consistent complaint about the product.[1] www.amazon.com/dp/B07S3TXD9H/
