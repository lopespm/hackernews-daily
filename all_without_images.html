								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Years back, every web browser&#39;s built-in password manager locked up the page when submitting a login form, waiting for the user to answer &#34;do you want to save this password?&#34; before proceeding.I thought that was silly: how do I know if I want to save the password before I&#39;ve seen whether it&#39;s correct? Which I can&#39;t see until the form is submitted.At the time I was using Opera, so I wrote in to their customer support suggesting that the prompt appear after the new page loaded. I never heard back, but a couple months later their next major release implemented exactly that behavior. A few months after that, every other browser followed suit.I can&#39;t have been the only one bothered by the existing behavior, but given how long browsers had worked that way before I wrote in, I like to tell myself that the timing wasn&#39;t a coincidence, and that my little suggestion rippled out into a change that made a small thing better for the whole world :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I havnt done this in many years but for a while I was making creative content that was published online. Once in a while someone would contact me saying they liked what I did. I started doing the same. If I read an article I liked a lot I would contact the person and tell them I liked it and why. About half the time they responded with Thanks.I didnt do this with NYT writers or anything. Just people who clearly dont get paid/paid much to make this content but I found it useful/interesting/helpful. I think that stuff goes a long way and it really doesnt take that long to do.I&#39;ve got a tech podcast now and about once every month or two someone contacts me to say they liked it or something nice. It&#39;s a huge reason why I keep doing it. I know that sounds silly but the internet can be such a black hole. A little feedback goes a long way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve worked in a few roughly-the-same-size (~50 engineers) web development shops. It&#39;s always the same. Doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s React, Angular, Class based components, Functional components with hooks, Just Some HTML, PHP, Rails views, etc.The frontend just collects the cruft of a product organization changing course very frequently. There are always a dozen half-finished fix-the-world ideas conflicting with each other, half-finished move-to-new-framework initiatives.I just mean to say that when I hear &#34;it&#39;s because React&#34; or &#34;it&#39;s because rails views&#34;, any other of the infinite variations of this, I kind of just tune out. Some part of your organizations chaos is going to reflect in code, and honestly I&#39;d rather it be in a big ball of frontend than in the data models, infrastructure, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I must be the only person in the world who likes class components in React.Sure, it&#39;s often overkill and a functional component does the same thing with less code. Use a functional component in these cases. But if you&#39;re doing something more complicated then stop treating class components like the fucking devil. They have their place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a developer who’s been working with React since the beta, I can confidently say that the author is speaking the truth. Especially so near the end of the article where they can’t seem to quit React.For all the annoyances of Hooks, they really are a godsend when it comes to composing state. And refs do indeed suck, but they sucked even more with class based components. I can’t tell you how many times I was able to solve a complex DOM state issue with custom hooks wrapped around refs.Newer tools like Svelte and Solid do look promising as far as removing boilerplate, but they personally feel a step too far off the path of “it’s just JavaScript.”Has anyone else here successfully left for greener JS pastures?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A great idea.  Now, everyone that learns this stuff, show some restraint!The drawback of a powerful type system is you can very easily get yourself into a type complexity mudhole.  Nothing worse than trying to call a method where a simple `Foo` object would do but instead you&#39;ve defined 60 character definition of `Foo` capabilities in the type system in the method signature.Less is more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Types are here to help but with this power comes great responsibility. 
The deeper you allow an input to be used in your library/method the more it makes sense to put a well defined type contract on it.
Exhaustive type definitions may show that the author doesn&#39;t have a understanding of a required interface, abstractions or pattern to use.
I use c# professionally for 20 years and I love the type system. It helps to tell the contract about the types and functions you expect yet you can overcomplicate things if you really about to. c# makes it &#34;hard&#34; to create method type definitions and you should use interfaces to achieve the contract definition. This helps to avoid the inline type definition as it&#39;s done in typescript.
My approach is to use types in typescript as I&#39;m used to in c#."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I currently have to occasionally contribute to a TypeScript codebase at work. I appreciate how much better it is than Javascript. When I write code as an outsider (Java and Go developer), I feel like I use the type system in sensible and readable ways. When I look at the code written by the native TypeScript experts in my company it is a bewildering, abstract, unreadable morass. I have no idea what&#39;s going on half the time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nice work!However, a cautionary tale on AI medical image &#34;denoising&#34;:(and beyond, in science)- See the artifacts?The algorithm plugs into ambiguous areas of the image stuff it has seen before / it was trained with.
So, if such a system was to &#34;denoise&#34; (or compress, which - if you think about it - is basically the same operation) CT scans, X-rays, MRIs, etc., in ambiguous areas it could plug-in diseased tissue where the ground-truth was actually healthy.Or the opposite, which is even worse: substitute diseased areas of the scan with healthy looking imagery it had been trained on.Reading recent publications that try to do &#34;denoising&#34; or resolution &#34;enhancement&#34; in medical imaging contexts, the authors seem to be completely oblivious to this pitfall.(maybe they had a background as World Bank / IMF economists?)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something interesting about the San Francisco test image is that if you start to look into the details, its clear that some real changes have been made to the city. Rather than losing texture or grain or clarity, the information lost in this is information about the particular layout of a neighborhood of streets, which has now been replaced as if some one were drawing the scene from memory. A very different kind of loss that with out the original might be imperceptible because the information that was lost isn&#39;t replaced with random or systematic noise, but rather new, structured information.."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few thoughts that aren&#39;t related to each other.1. This is a brilliant hack. Kudos.2. It would be great to see the best codecs included in the comparison - AVIF and JPEG XL. Without those it&#39;s rather incomplete. No surprise that JPEG and WEBP totally fall apart at that bitrate.3. A significant limitation of the approach seems to be that it targets extremely low bitrates where other codecs fall apart, but at these bitrates it incurs problems of its own (artifacts take the form of meaningful changes to the source image instead of blur or blocking, very high computational complexity for the decoder).When only moderate compression is needed, codecs like JPEG XL already achieve very good results. This proof of concept focuses on the extreme case, but I wonder what would happen if you targeted much higher bitrates, say 5x higher than used here. I suspect (but have no evidence) that JPEG XL would improve in fidelity faster as you gave it more bits than this SD-based technique. Transparent compression, where the eye can&#39;t tell a visual difference between source and transcode (at least without zooming in) is the optimal case for JPEG XL. I wonder what sort of bitrate you&#39;d need to provide that kind of guarantee with this technique."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; One bill opposed by the App Association is the Open App Markets Act, which aimed to help app developers use alternative in-app payment systems and avoid Apple&#39;s standard cuts of 15 to 30 percent.The cut is a platform fee, and collecting it via the in-app payment system is mechanism, not policy.The core issue is Apple&#39;s rate: although it is usually comparable to rates on other game platforms (eShop, Google Play, Steam...), (some) game and app developers want it reduced so that they receive a higher percentage of an app&#39;s retail price.The largely unfounded expectation that some developers seem to have is that changing IAP payment methods will cause Apple&#39;s platform fee to drop to zero, rather than causing Apple to simply collect it by other means.Edit: for some reason people are responding to me with complaints about Apple&#39;s policies and downvoting me because they don&#39;t like Apple&#39;s platform fees. I&#39;m trying to shed some light on what is actually going on: a dispute over platform fee rates.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well into the second day of Cloudflare’s blockade of my home internet connection, Google Search also began blocking requests. It required me to resolve a CAPTCHA challenge for every other search. This luckily only lasted a day.Cloudflare shares IP reputation data with partners like Google, coordinated through a program called the Bandwidth Alliance. So, my original offense might not even have been against Cloudflare. It might have received the reputation data from a partner, and it just propagated through the Bandwidth Alliance network.That&#39;s not what Bandwidth Alliance is at all. It&#39;s about reducing or eliminating egress fees between a cloud provider and Cloudflare. Not sure where the idea that it&#39;s about sharing IP reputation data comes from.https://www.cloudflare.com/bandwidth-alliance/So, if Google Search started showing a CAPTCHA that&#39;s not Cloudflare."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you&#39;d like to experience this treatment first-hand, try surfing the web using the Tor Browser.Spoiler alert: many websites simply refuse to load at all (e.g. any google service, and lots of websites &#34;protected&#34; by CF). Captchas are everywhere: in many cases, you can&#39;t even complete simple GETs of blogs without donating free labor to CF.And the most infuriating part, you get CF marketing messages right in your face while your browser is calculating hashcash (I guess?)... At this point I can recognize every single one of them: something about bots making up 40% of all internet traffic, something about their web scraper protection racket, something about small businesses (???), etc etc...To be fair, Tor exit nodes have an awful reputation for sure. Nevertheless, I have a hard time forgiving how CF makes browsing the Internet hell for those who actually need Tor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Harsh blocking/limiting/challenging is way too valuable to sites that are actually trying to make money online. It&#39;s not going away short of legislation banning it. Losing 1/10,000 legitimate customers to cut fraud attempts, spam, exploit attempts, and so on, by 90% or more, is just too good a trade-off.I have bad news about the most-likely fix for it, longer term, so we can lay off the IP-based reputation stuff and the geo-blocking: it&#39;s tying some form of personal ID to your browsing activity, so that bears the reputation instead of the address.Sorry.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"PGs take on why early stage VCs gain so much experience reminds me of my opinions on why car sales is the best sales experience.I sold cars for almost a decade and was pretty good at it averaging 30 cars a month. That means every year I helped people sign for $16 million of products. In the end I probably sold 3000 cars for over $100 million.(Note, I stayed in it way too long. I think most of these benefits would come from 2 years)I made close to 50,000 phone calls, leaving probably 20,000 voicemails. I closed atleast 1000 deals purely on the phone.I&#39;ve heard excuses, stalls, lies, promises and objections over 10,000 times.I&#39;ve seen thousands of married couples discuss if they should go ahead with spending $30-100k. I&#39;ve seen how they interact while waiting. (Nothing pains me more than couples, or moreso one party, playing games on their phones ignoring each other).While there is a lot more to modern tech sales than just closing incoming leads, I think car sales is an accelerator course for interacting with, reading, and closing people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This essay is getting a surprising amount of hate, and I must confess that my first impression on reading it was that it sounded an awful lot like a Robert Kiyosaki book [1].  But then I followed the two links in the essay [2] [3] and that put it into perspective: the thing that Paul learned from his users is that they are looking for The Answer, the formula, the procedure for how to succeed, and there is no such formula.  It&#39;s like Goedel&#39;s incompleteness theorem, except that it&#39;s not a theorem.  People come to YC and buy Robert Kiyosaki&#39;s books hoping to find an Answer that simply doesn&#39;t exist.The difference between Paul and Robert is that Paul is up-front about this while Robert is cagey and deceptive and makes his money by stringing people along thinking that The Answer can be found by buying one more of his books.  But I think a lot of the hate here is driven by disappointment that Paul is honest, and that his answer is that there is no Answer.  It can be frustrating to hear that (which is also something that Paul explicitly points out).---[1] https://www.amazon.com/Rich-Dad-Poor-Teach-Middle/dp/1612680...[2] http://paulgraham.com/lesson.html[3] http://paulgraham.com/before.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Prompted by the negative feedback that this essay received, ranging from being a sales pitch in disguise, to being a word salad going in all directions without answering the central question posed by the author right in the opening paragraphs, I had to go and re-examine the piece and see if these concerns are valid or not, and unexpectedly the second reading reaffirmed my initial positive reaction that this is actually a good piece, maybe not the best, but still good.In spirit of open discussion and intellectual curiosity here, I share my insights in the following order matching that of the post:1) PG opens with the best advice that he could dispense to prospective applicants which is &#34;what you&#39;ve learned from users&#34;.2) He proceeds to ask himself the same question.3) He then informs readers that his users; startup founders, usually face the same set of problems across the board.4) Since these problems are the same, he thought of automating the solution to scale his business (dogfooding in some sense).5) That blew up in his face spectacularly that he had to rework the plan and concede that his solution won&#39;t scale.6) But these same problems are not recognized uniformly by founders as they sometimes face difficulties identifying them in the first place, that&#39;s where the YC partners&#39; role come to fill this unmet need.7) Even when people are good at identifying problems, some are bad at determining the severity or urgency that these problems pose, cue again the YC partners&#39; role.8) Even when they&#39;re good at risk assessment, some are bad at risk mitigation, and won&#39;t listen to the advice given by the partners but it is not made clear what he means exactly by &#34;not listening&#34;, dismissing/not acting on solutions proposed by YC staff, or not acknowledging that there&#39;s a problem to begin with?9) Getting down to business to solve these problems warrants focus, and how this focus is tied into speed, and how YC can help with that.10) Startup colleagues are more important than YC partners when it comes to realizing success with their feedback, guidance and even practical help, and how YC is the best in class in this regard.Even though the marketing language, esp the value propositions in the piece is a bit stronger for my taste, but I can&#39;t say with honesty that it overpowered the core message of the essay nor was it incoherent or disjointed in anyway that made following or understanding impossible as some have claimed here.Verdict: 8/10"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Instantiating a runtime in microseconds is deeply exciting!Though after skimming through the docs, I&#39;m still left wondering a few things:- JS is notably missing from the list of languages supported on the front page. But I see mentions of a Spidermonkey.wasm in the blog post. Is running JS on top of wasmtime in production a realistic prospect today? If so, where can I read more? (mainly interested in this for the instantiation time benefits, though maybe all/most of that will be negated by the embedded JS engine?)- How should I go about building a typical web service on top of wasmtime? Can wasmtime itself handle network requests/connections or would I need to build the web server in some other host language and pass request data to wasmtime modules? Haven&#39;t been able to find anything in the docs about this.- What would it take to build a multitenant web service where customer code is isolated using wasmtime, like the one like described in the post?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m sold on the future of wasm. What really still bothers me is the effort and hoops I have to jump through to actually leverage it. Networking, just fix networking so I can drop in most things and it would be great. The fact that I have to rewrite the majority of my network access to do any external IO is painful but I get that containers took more than a decade after Google&#39;s use to get there too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Unfortunately this caching is still per-path. For example:    GET /v1/document/{document-id}/comments/{comment-id}

For every new document-id or comment-id, there will be a new pre-flight request.Alternative hacks: Offer a variant of your API format that either1. Moves the resource path to the request body (or to a header that is included in &#34;Vary&#34;). Though the rest of your stack (load balancing, observability, redaction) might not be ok with this, e.g. do your WAF rules support matching on the request body? You also will no longer get automatic path-based caching for GET requests.2. Conforms to the rules of a CORS &#34;simple&#34; request [1], which won&#39;t trigger a pre-flight request. This is what we did on the Dropbox API [2]. You&#39;ll need to move the auth information from the Authorization header to a query parameter or the body, which can be dangerous wrt redaction, e.g. many tools automatically redact the Authorization header but not query parameters.[1] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simpl...[2] https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation/http/docume...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The trick to improving YouTube recommendations is to regularly prune uninteresting videos and channels. Eventually this should start surfacing videos you&#39;re more likely to find interesting.I&#39;ve actually hit the end of my recommendation stream on the mobile app after marking dozens of videos with Not Interested. Once this happens it starts recommending videos you&#39;ve already watched or older videos from creators you&#39;ve been watching lately.Personally, I&#39;d love it if you could curate the recommendation system a bit more. I&#39;m never interested in rewatching stuff I&#39;ve already seen. And the recency bias for recommendations means you&#39;re always getting more if what you&#39;ve recently consumed. I&#39;d like it if more older interests were mixed in. Finally, I&#39;d love to be able to blacklist certain topics and games entirely.There&#39;s so much missed potential with YouTube recommendations.Some might say that you can still use search, but that has been crippled to include unrelated recommendations after one page of results. Not only that, I want YouTube to help me discover new content. When the recommendation system works and it shows me new kinds of interesting stuff, it&#39;s superb. TikTok is eating YouTube&#39;s lunch in this regard.Edit: forgot to mention this. On mobile if you do a recommendation refresh it&#39;ll show a New to You filter which you can use to explore more diverse recommendations. I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s hidden in this manner."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I didn’t like when they removed the dislike counts, and I still don’t like it.When I look for videos of folks working on Subarus, I don’t want to have to manually scrub through the video to gauge the quality. Before I’d just look at the ratio and if I was feeling generous I’d preview the frames to see if they had what I wanted.Now it takes me at least 2 mins longer to get to the same judgement which begs the question of why I’m watching a video when I have a book on my lap and a car waiting outside."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of how games (coughLeagueOfLegendscough) match me up with a player that I literally just reported for harassment, griefing etc. in the previous match.  Like, there weren&#39;t any other possible players to match me with out of the many thousands?  I don&#39;t mind waiting a few more seconds to match up with someone else!I&#39;m getting a lot of responses as if I expect the player to be totally blocked from matching with me, but that&#39;s not really what I mean.  Even a basic &#34;temporary match score reduction&#34; would work.  I would also expect a cooldown system where the reduction caused by reporting no longer applies.  Arguing against the idea &#34;because it creates a prisoner&#39;s island&#34; misses the subtlety of a well-thought-out implementation where reporting simply lowers the matchup &#34;rank&#34; for a while, and serial-false-reporters have their reports basically nullified/ignored."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"On our product (air quality monitor[1]) we made the concious decision to design it for long life and repairability by e.g.:- using no glue or snaps- all components on one PCB, no thin cables that can break- standard philips/torx screws- four screws to open the enclosure, four screws to take out the pcb- expensive sensor modules on pin sockets for easy reaplacement- only using components that are certified for longe lifetime -even if they cost a few dollars more (e.g. DC to DC converter)- not using plastic for packaging and we ask our supplier to not use plastic when sending us the parts (e.g. no bag around the USB cable etc)We wrote about this [2] and often do presentations for customers and have a slide about this and it gets a great response and I believe gives us an advantage compared to competing products on the market. As the market more and more appreciates this, Apple probably also realized that this can be a competitive advantage and give them positive press.[1] https://www.airgradient.com/airgradient-one/
[2] https://www.airgradient.com/about/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple started offering home repair kits for iPhone this year, but they’re super difficult to use: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/25/technology/personaltech/a...There’s speculation that offering the kits is an attempt to head off right-to-repair legislation. But seeing this redesign, I wonder to what degree the repair program is incentivizing repairability within apple’s corporate structure. Now that “profit/loss per self service repair” is tracked in a spreadsheet - does repairability matter more?Anyways - it’s great to see some improvement here, for whatever motivation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has got to be one extremely expensive toolchain and supply chain redesign to do, but since they have done it a few times before (instead of incremental changes) I suppose the money department has worked out when it is feasible to do that kind of thing while keeping the people in charge happy.I&#39;m curious to see if this is a &#39;test&#39; to see if this doesn&#39;t have too many downsides, I imagine ingress area increasing this much might be a point of worry (well, there are flexible seals for that now), and instead of having a one-way stack you now have a two-way stack so tooling and workstations around that (even if we just think in terms of assembly and rework) are going to be a PITA to convert or completely replace.Either this will be a success and allow for the architectural change to be applied to other products, or it&#39;s a medium-success in which this only works for specific parts/antenna/power envelope configurations and we won&#39;t see this design in other form factors.What does itch a little is iFixit whining about the parts needing be a signed set to work together. Nobody has come up with a better integrity protection method, and no-protection isn&#39;t an option either for the ecosystem. Besides, instead of having a &#39;safe&#39; and &#39;unsafe&#39; option for which practically no user will ever be able to make an informed decision, you can simply choose not to buy it if this is a feature you seriously despise."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some of the strong points of this calculator is the main thing I use in RPN calculators with stacks.  It&#39;s so helpful for me to duplicate a value and then operate on that, and be able to throw it away if I mess up, sanity check from where I started at intermediate calculations, etc.  it&#39;s not identical, but many points others are mentioning in this thread are what I value from an RPN stack based calculator.BTW, for anyone who is comfortable with RPNs, MacOS added the mode to their built-in calculator recently-ish.  it&#39;s not terrible either.  I&#39;ve switched to it for my default experience. (even though nothing beats the HP 48g, as it&#39;s what I&#39;m the most familiar with).Also, on the article, really cool that someone added this on mobile.  I love hearing about devs developing something that fills a niche and does so well.  I feel like I&#39;m out of ideas most days.  Good for her!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I want is a phone app calculator that works like the Python REPL/console. Save ALL previous calculations. Display the last dozen or so. Can scroll through them. Tap on one to recall it, edit one number, recompute. Done.This would beat by far the convenience and usability of this 2-in-1 calculator. I would KILL to have this.In fact, on my laptop, I use the Python REPL as a calculator. I hit Ctrl-T python ENTER. It opens a terminal and I start typing 48*152 ENTER and I see the result. The history of calculations is saved. I can access previous calculations, edit one number and recompute. I see the last 100 lines or so, on one screen.The only one somewhat usable Python REPL on Android is &#34;Pyonic Python 3 interpreter&#34; but it&#39;s clumsy to use as a calculator because it uses the standard alphabetic keyboard so you have to keep switching to the special characters layout to type math operators (-+/...) If this ONE detail would be fixed, and with some minor UI polish I believe it could become more popular than the 2-in-1 calculator..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What a wonderful kludge. People can’t imagine that they would be able to go back and edit, or even see, the history of their calculations, so putting two calculators side by side seems like a brilliant idea.It’s like if a new word processor consisted of two faithfully recreated typewriters, with a special button to send the most recently typed word back and forth between them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Pretty cool.The program itself was written in an existing intermediate language called URCL, which was then compiled to CHUNGUS2 assembly. CHUNGUS2 is the processor made with Minecraft&#39;s redstone mechanics. The processor was emulated for development, but the demo is running on MCHPRS, a Minecraft server that uses Wasmtime&#39;s Cranelift to JIT the redstone operations, which are represented as a weighted directed graph. Before MCHPRS, optimizing redstone performance using compiler techniques was not thought to be possible. With MCHPRS the demo takes 9 hours to run, it would take decades using Minecraft.https://github.com/sammyuri/minecrafthttps://github.com/MCHPR/MCHPRSAs for CHUNGUS2 itself, it&#39;s a proper RISC processor, it has a 4-stage instruction pipeline, 64 byte 8-way associative data cache, even branch prediction.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDiapbD0Xfg"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is truly amazing.Comment from one of the creators;This build does NOT run in real time. It runs on MCHPRS,   the server developed by StackDoubleFlow, which speeds up the game roughly 10-20,000x while running redstone. That brings the framerate to a much more reasonable 0.1fps, so the long timelapses in the video only took 9 hours to record in in total."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked on a CPU in Minecraft years ago and designed it to be a 7-bit CPU. I chose that number because it gave me the an appreciable number of operations plus space for arguments. I had only 6 bytes of RAM and about 32bytes of ROM. The ROM was just a circle of transparent blocks (zero) and solid blocks (one) pushed around by pistons.The whole thing was real slow, but it was so much fun trying to design something that would perform interesting calculations. I stopped working on it as at the time Minecraft had some odd bugs with pistons that would cause non-deterministic behavior.I think the most challenging aspect wasn&#39;t the programming or circuits, which were well understood and mapped out, but trying to create modules I could copy-paste inside a special Minecraft save editor to make the machine quickly, then manually dragging out data/command lines to hook the modules together."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Really love the idea, and the passion behind it. Def could have legs.Here’s the pitfalls I see you falling into:(1) seriously, what data are you collecting? “Everything” isn’t a great answer (who’s supposed to use ‘everything’, anyway? “Anyone”?). “Apples-to-apples police misconduct statistics” is a good one.(2) it’s important to clarify 1 because you need to know who you’re serving, and why. Different activists need different data. “Have all data” sounds good until you need to decide how to allocate your resources.(3) more deeply, data is the land of edge cases. Even just with police misconduct, you need to get DEEP to rigorously compare seemingly-simple stats like “# of unjustified police killings”. If you don’t start narrow, you’ll never show value. If you don’t show value, nobody will ever care you exist.When I look at the data you’ve collected, it ranges from annual reports, to municipal contact info, to crime stats. What’s important to collect at scale? To whom? What do they need it for?Again - great, ambitious idea! But $250k goes fast. Show value before it runs out!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You might try defining what the &#34;ideal&#34; department&#39;s data would look like: what categories of data, what columns each record has, what the values are for each, etc. Ideally you&#39;d stamp it with a year and give it a spiffy name so it could be the National Police Data Reporting Standard 2022 (NPDRS.2022) or something.Departments that are trying to be transparent (or who just don&#39;t want to deal with figuring it all out from scratch) may be happy to adopt something considered a &#34;standard&#34; for tracking and reporting data. In some cases it means it is a checkbox they can check without having to deal with annoying people and their annoying questions... but that hardly matters so long as the data is made available. It would also give companies developing software for police departments a target to aim for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is important. Locally, we had a sheriff who was being heavily, heavily criticized due to several deaths at the county facility. This was at the height of the protests a few years ago.It was a lot of work to find data on policing nationwide, because the question really was &#34;Is the sheriff doing a bad job, or do bad things happen sometimes?&#34;After some hard work trying to identify other cities with similar socioeconomic circumstances and populations, it became clear that our local sheriff was actually better than average, and that much of the outrage was fabricated.That&#39;s also when I learned that many people don&#39;t want to listen to statistics unless they agree with their own preconceptions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can&#39;t wait to get home to play it.Secret of Monkey Island 2 was my first PC game on a 486SX and VGA monitor.  The sound came out of the PC speakers... One day I got an Adlib card and was blown away.  Go ahead and download the remake on steam and notice something that kind of doesn&#39;t exist in any game (that I know):  when you enter the scene on Scabb Island, the relaxed reggae beat changes ever so subtly depending on the  bridge, the carpenter shop, the mapmaker, the bar, etc.For example, you enter the mapmaker and the Wally music comes on, which is the same reggae bagdrop to a clarinet or oboe, the music is a little deeper in the carpenter shop, there&#39;s an evil background tone when Largo LaGrande shows up and a more subtle one in the hotel, etc.With gorgeous hand painted digitized art.They don&#39;t make games like that anymore.  Can&#39;t wait to see if they actually did."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Two hours in and I&#39;m enjoying it.So far the puzzles have been fun, but not very difficult. The plot is a bit heavy with references to the story of the earlier games, but perhaps not too much (my partner enjoyed it too, having only played The Curse of Monkey Island, but not the others).The &#34;new&#34; art style is a bit odd at first but it&#39;s nice and consistent and it has a style of its own. All the earlier games had a different art style to each other too, partly because the early installments had technical limitations they had to cope with (and then there was that thing with the 3d graphics).The sound track is very nice with some tunes you&#39;ll probably know.I&#39;ll rate it four monkeys and a pegleg."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have the same problem (i.e. terrible short-term memory, though my long-term memory is fine), and I&#39;ve picked up a number of compensating behaviors over the years. By far, documentation is my #1 go-to strategy. I document code extensively, even if I&#39;m the only person who is ever going to read it again. People have mocked me for this, but I believe it&#39;s a superpower.Most programmers believe a number of blatant falsehoods about documentation, with the most prevalent being &#34;comments go out of date quickly, so there&#39;s no point in investing in them&#34;. Maybe I&#39;m just hyper-aware of it because my short-term memory sucks, but code comments have saved me on so many occasions that they&#39;re simply not optional.You can document your code. You can keep it up to date. It isn&#39;t that hard. You just don&#39;t want to."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve noticed as I&#39;ve gotten older that I lean more on remembering pointers to information rather than the specific information. I know something exists and can find it quickly, but may not know it off the top of my head.For example, how to get the length of an iterable in a given language. I may not remember the function name (or if it&#39;s a top-level function vs a method) but I know I can search &#34;string length in $LANGUAGE&#34; and find it. This scales better than memorizing every language feature I&#39;ll ever use.---PS: Dash is a great mac app, highly recommend.

My coworkers can maintain context about how a given thing works months after the fact. I can&#39;t. So, I leave private comments throughout the code.

I was rather put off by this: Instead of juggling pointers I was juggling integers. It made the code harder to debug and find logic errors. At least when I was troubleshooting C I could rely on the debugger to break on a bad pointer, but finding where an integer became &#34;bad&#34; was more time consuming.The borrow checker worked fine when all I needed to do was pass data up and down the callstack, but anything beyond that was difficult or impossible to express.

At all.From what I was able to gather, Wayland/libinput say they shouldn&#39;t be responsible for handling it and instead window managers should[0][1], meanwhile gnome says wayland/libinput should handle it[2] and ultimately - several years later - it&#39;s still not possible to in pretty much any Linux distro that uses Wayland(?)When I switch to my Linux laptop to test things, my trackpad is bonkers and I have to move my finger in like 1mm increments because otherwise I&#39;d scroll like 10 pages in Firefox. It&#39;s infuriatingly frustrating.[0] https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libinput/libinput/-/issues/18...[1] https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland/-/issues/87[2] https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-control-center/-/issues..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Wayland
&#34;The X11 protocol was designed around running graphical apps across the network. While some people use this feature, it&#39;s far from common. Wayland drops this requirement as a way to greatly simplify its architecture.&#34;X client and server are usually the same machine, but they don&#39;t have to be.  While on the road, you can use your notebook to open a Gimp session on your home machine and edit an image stored there.  That is, the Gimp runs on your home machine while your notebook has the GUI.This is a lot to give up for cool compositing effects..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing I dislike about Wayland is:  Sometimes the server will crash. Video drivers or something. Hasn&#39;t happened much with 22.04, but used to happen more frequently before. Both with Intel and AMD.When this happens in X11, the server restarts, I see the screen go black for an instant, that&#39;s it.When this happens in Wayland, all my open programs are killed. No save prompts or anything, just insta-killed. This makes Wayland unusable unless they can guarantee no crashes, ever."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have to say the fact that I was able to figure out how the puzzle worked - what I was meant to do - with no instructions in about 60 seconds is a good sign.I&#39;m also immediately kind of addicted to this....I really like it.The one thing that annoys me is that I can&#39;t see what a symbol is if the dog/bunny is on it because it&#39;s covered up. It&#39;s hard to remember when there&#39;s so many. Some transparency or slight design adjustment would fix this easily."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"(author here)Great feedback! Yes, I am the &#34;Land of Lisp&#34; guySorry about the potential epilepsy trigger- that was the fastest way I could think of to code a quick &#34;reward effect&#34;, I will do something different in the next version. I didn&#39;t really expect anyone to care enough to solve the puzzle lol.Now that I know people like the puzzle, I will build out the website and post regular puzzles, follow my Twitter @lisperati for updates."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Feedback:1. It was good enough that I finished. This is success! Good job!2. It took me too long to realize characters could occupy the same space, and the game doesn&#39;t draw characters occupying the same space very well.3. The flashing lights at the end are too fast, slow them way down and it will still look good. You&#39;ll probably only have to change a number in your code."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"First off, no, a full rewrite is not only not necessary, but probably the worst possible approach. Do a piece at a time. You will eventually have re-written all the code, but do not ever fall into the trap of a &#34;full re-write&#34;. It doesn&#39;t work.But before you re-write once line of code - get some testing in place. Or, a lot of testing. If you have end-to-end tests that run through every feature that is currently used by your customer base, then you have a baseline to safely make changes. You can delete code as long as the tests pass. You can change code as long as the tests pass.Once you are at that point, start picking off pieces to modernize and improve.Also, respect the team. Maybe they aren&#39;t doing what you would, but they are keeping this beast alive, and probably have invaluable knowledge of how to do so. Don&#39;t come in pushing for change... come in embracing that this beast of a codebase makes 20 million a year. So talk about how the team can improve it, and modernize their skills at the same time.Because if you walk in, saying, &#34;This all sucks, and so do you, lets throw it out&#34;, do you really have to wonder why you are hitting resistance?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; this code generates more than 20 million dollars a year of revenueFrom a business perspective, nothing is broken. In fact, they laid a golden goose.&gt; team is 3 people, quite junior. One backend, one front, one iOS/android. Resistance to change is huge.My mistake, they didn&#39;t lay a golden goose--they built a money printer. The ROI here is insane.&gt; productivity is abysmal which is understandable. The mess is just too huge to be able to build anything.But you just told me they built a $20M revenue product with 3 bozos. That sounds unbelievably productive.&gt; This business unit has a pretty aggressive roadmap as management and HQ has no real understanding of these blockersYou should consider quitting your job.As far as the business is concerned, there are no problems... because well... they have a money printer, and your team seems not to care enough to advocate for change. Business people don&#39;t give a damn about code quality. They give a damn about value. If 2003 style PHP code does that, so be it. Forget a rewrite, why waste time and effort doing simple refactoring? To them, even that has negative financial value.From their perspective, you&#39;re not being paid to make code easy to work with, you&#39;re being paid to ship product in a rats nest. Maybe you could make a business case for why its valuable to use source control, dependency management, a framework, routing outside of nginx, and so on... but it doesn&#39;t sound like any of that mattered on the road to $20M a year, so it will be very difficult to convince them otherwise especially if your teammates resist.This, again, is why you should consider leaving.Some developers don&#39;t mind spaghetti, cowboy coding. You do. Don&#39;t subject yourself to a work environment and work style that&#39;s incompatible with you, especially when your teammates don&#39;t care either. I guarantee you will hate your job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lovely knot to unravel!First, get everything in source control!Next, make it possible to spin service up locally, pointing at production DB.Then, get the db running locally.Then get another server and get cd to that server, including creating the db, schema, and sample data.Then add tests, run on pr, then code review, then auto deploy to new server.This should stop the bleeding…  no more index-new_2021-test-john_v2.phpAdd tests and start deleting code.Spin up a production server, load balance to it. When confident it works, blow away the old one and redeploy to it. Use the new server for blue/green deployments.Write more tests for pages, clean up more code.Pick a framework and use it for new pages, rewrite old pages only when major functionality changes. Don’t worry about multiple jquery versions on a page, lack of mvc, lack of framework, unless overhauling that page."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"To some extent I disagree with this, not that Google+Meta are under attack, but that the threat is coming from competitors.I’ve spent most of the last 10 years earning my living from an e-commerce business I own. The online advertising industry is unrecognisable from when we started. My thesis, in beef, is that the industries excessive uses of personalised data and tracking lead to increased regulation, and then a massive pivot to even more “AI” as a means to circumvent that (to some extent). The AI in the ad industry now, I believe, is detrimental to the advertiser. It’s now just one big black box, you put money in one side and get traffic out the other. The control and useful tracking (what actual search terms people are using, proper visible conversion tracking of an ad) is now almost non-existent. As an advertiser your livelihood is dependant on an algorithm, not skill, not intuition, not experience, not even track record.Facebook, Google and the rest of the industry were so driven by profit at all cost, and at the expense of long term thinking, they shot themselves in the foot.Advertisers are searching for alternatives, but they are all the same.I think online advertising, as a whole, is probably f***ed…"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"‘Microsoft’s social network, LinkedIn, is unglamorous but its business-to-business ads allow it to monetise the time users spend on it at a rate roughly four times that of Facebook, estimates Andrew Lipsman of eMarketer. It generates more revenue than some medium-sized networks including Snap’s Snapchat and Twitter. &lt;...&gt; So far [Apple] is only dabbling in ads and does not report sales figures. But Bloomberg reported recently that Apple’s ad business was already generating sales of $4bn a year, making it about as big an ad platform as Twitter.’Twitter is now a unit of being moderately unsuccessful at advertising."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;ll be interesting to see what kind of innovations Rockstar is able to come up with for the next GTA, nothing stands out to me from these development leaks.The problem with GTA is that it&#39;s a fairly shallow game, which limits what kind of immersion you can experience. Imagine if it included more realistic elements like economics and persistent characters. You could decide you have a vendetta against Bob and steal his cheese every time he goes out shopping for groceries. Heck, you could become the cheese kingpin and monopolize access to cheese. Although a more thematic approach would probably have to do with drugs, which doesn&#39;t seem like too far of a bridge to jump considering the game genre."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hopefully it has a good single player mode. I have no interest in GTA online or any other online game for that matter. Gaming for me is about escape and immersion, not toxic interactions with others which is 90% of what I got when I tried GTA online."</p>

Most other countries in the Anglosphere have been through a &#34;plain english&#34; language push in both contract &amp; legislation, while the US has stuck to &#34;this language is proven through precedent&#34; more stubbornly than anywhere else. This seems to be particularly prevalent in IP law, although that might be my tech bias showing.I would very much argue against those (even in this thread), that say that the lay-person isn&#39;t the intended audience for lots of contracts, particularly for T&amp;Cs where they are often written by a contracts lawyer, for a contracts lawyer or judge, but should ABSOLUTELY be written for the lay-person to understand.Anyway, I think the legal profession can &amp; should do better."</p>

The loud parts (including explosions and music) are too loud for her, so we have to turn the volume down during those parts, but the dialog is too quiet and mumbly for me to hear, so we turn the volume up during those parts. We now just keep the volume low and turn on subtitles--easy but shitty solution.Sound engineers need to stop needlessly flexing all that dynamic range that modern tools give them, and just produce a watchable movie.

I could also ask: &#34;Why do all these 60-Somethings have the TV on as background noise while doing other tasks?&#34;To me it seems closed-caption usage is correlated with actually paying attention to television consumption.People who have their TV on at all hours, as background entertainment to support their lifestyle, tend to not use CC. Why should they? The words literally don&#39;t matter, it&#39;s just an aesthetic.People who actually desire an immersive experience, who deliberately pay attention to the shows they watch, tend to care about CC since it complements the audio &amp; visual nicely. I don&#39;t have any evidence for this but I&#39;d wager that plot synthesis and comprehension of television shows is greatly improved by CC. Or maybe it&#39;s that people who use CC tend to value and perform better at synthesis and comprehension? Regardless of causality, CC seems related to an individual&#39;s desire for more active entertainment."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A probably naieve question. If the VPU can be used as the bootstrap loader for the CPU, much as a PDP11 on the door of the Vax 11/780 acted as bootstrap loader for the Vax, can we not simply replace all the complex VPU resident functions with &#39;just run on the CPU&#39; and then resolve the external device bindings in normal CPU code?Maybe I misread it, but it read like the VPU does more than the tiny necessary bootstrap to find an image, and chain load it. It reads like it has to do some timing critical initialisations of subsystems, but I cannot but think a CPU should be able to do this for itself, once it has some run state with a kernel in memory.It&#39;s as if the VPU has to make the other bits of blobby hardware be alive, for the CPU to be able to see them. Most odd.Oftentimes there are magic bits of this to do with ring states, and priviledge to alter ring at runtime. Maybe this is part of the story: the VPU initialises a specific ring state and some outer higher trust ring MUST be pre-initialised for the CPU ring state to be allowed to talk to it: it would violate the ring model, if the CPU did it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This project focuses on being a drop in replacement to the proprietary firmware needed to bringup Linux on the other processor. (The ARM processor.)Isn&#39;t anyone going to talk about running random stuff on the VPU itself?!  Given it&#39;s the thing used for 3D and stuff, I imagine it&#39;s going to be crazy fast at certain computations, much faster than the ARM is.Untapped potential of all Raspberry Pies out there... maybe the VPU can be (ab)used to do stuff similar to what the Raspberry Pico can do."</p>

It is implied that the Driver is setting their own pricing and terms of employment. They may legally technically be doing so, but what they&#39;re really doing is agreeing to the same terms set by Uber and defined by Uber as every other driver, as if they were employees. This allows Uber to really do whatever they want to an &#34;independent contractor&#34; which has agreed to their terms of not setting their own rates, having no transparency, and being totally subject to Ubers conditional compensation agreements."</p>

It shouldn&#39;t be hard to add CMake and bazel support, for instance. Even mostly dumb makefiles should be workable.- Approaching the community this way could avoid fracturing the community more than it already is.- Targeting specific success metrics (like CVE causes) could provide focus around design and requirements- Seems simpler and easier to learn and teach.Cons:- The pitch assumes C++ modules are implemented, ready to use, and reasonable accessible.- There will be a lot of tooling to reinvent: static analyzers, syntax highlighters, etc.- At least for a while, debugging cpp2 problems will involve juggling multiple parallel realities: cpp2 code, C++ code, and actual program behavior (i.e. compiled binaries).- Doesn&#39;t address other major C++ ecosystem problems like build times, packaging, build systems, etc. cpp2 could make them slightly worse."</p>

This new C++ syntax is just a gimmick that we don&#39;t need. The C++ community seems it&#39;s feeding itself to create a new standard every couple of years. It&#39;s just disappointing..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Important to note that this 5th Circuit ruling conflicts with the 11th Circuit&#39;s ruling.  And SCOTUS had previously reinstated an injunction against this very same law.And this 5th Circuit opinion has very idiosyncratic reasoning [0, just the first few pages will blow your hair back].  A sample:  &#34;In urging such sweeping relief, the platforms offer a rather odd inversion of the First Amendment. That Amendment, of course, protects every person’s right to &#39;the freedom of speech.&#39; But the platforms argue that buried somewhere in the person’s enumerated right to free speech lies a corporation’s unenumerated right to muzzle speech.&#34;

How the 1st Amendment might protect a corporation&#39;s religious POV but not its exercise of editorial control is a very good question.  I&#39;m not saying this very conservative SCOTUS won&#39;t adopt the 5th Circuit&#39;s reasoning, but it still seems unlikely.  In my view -- much more likely is that they resolve the Circuit split by adopting the 11th Circuit&#39;s view wholeheartedly.[0]: https://techfreedom.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2022-09-1..."</p>

What if I have a big list of a complaints about a certain politician (use your imagination, there&#39;s more than one politician to complain about), but the &#34;other party&#34; doesn&#39;t follow me, in fact, I have very few followers overall.So I create a bot that spreads my opinions by replying to millions of other Tweets. Anyone who mentions the politician of interest will receive a reply from &#34;me&#34; (my bot) within 2 minutes. Now I will be heard by millions, and my lawyer is ready should I be banned from the entire site.Now imagine many people doing this, what a cesspool, you make a Tweet and the bot flood gates open. You Tweet about your grandchild and 30 seconds later you have 400 replies expressing &#34;political opinions&#34; about shady websites with cheap Viagra. Twitter can&#39;t ban them though. Welcome to truly free speech. You better learn to code if you want to be heard.We&#39;re already at the point where websites can&#39;t control bots. AI that can write better than most humans is knocking on the door, and it can run on my personal computer. This law will only make it worse by adding real legal risk to banning suspected bots.Am I exaggerating here, or is this actually possible?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here we are, deep down in the dystopia of Automatic Content Classification by robots.Far less important of an example, but I was just put in &#34;Facebook jail&#34; for 24 hours for posting a picture of my son at the beach in his bathing suit with no shirt. Y&#39;know, as one does at the beach. I can only assume it&#39;s because my son has long hair and the Convolutional Neural Network or whatever decided he was a girl and therefore I&#39;m a pervert.Sadly it was the &#34;appeal&#34; I submitted that got me blocked. Presumably by a &#34;human&#34;, but who knows.Before I appealed they were simply going to not show the picture. Appealing got me in &#34;trouble.&#34;  That might be even worse than the original misclassification. On top of that, if I was actually a &#34;community standards&#34; violator who posted potential child exploitation imagery, I&#39;m not sure how a 24-hour ban on activity on Facebook is of any use, either? Except I&#39;m terrified to imagine a world where Meta might have called police on me based on the output of a neural network image classification.Others have said but I&#39;ll say it again: This kind of business doesn&#39;t scale ethically. You can&#39;t have billions of people on a bulletin board. It doesn&#39;t work. Moderation is essential to modern communication. But you can&#39;t do moderation automatically or at scale and in a universal way.Very dark patterns emerge the moment you go FAANG scale and toss algorithms tuning for advertising and &#34;engagement&#34; into the mix, and attempt to do so with the help of computers.&#34;Sad&#34; as it is, we will need to &#34;retreat&#34; back into smaller forums and BBSs where communities self-police.Facebook has infiltrated so many aspects of society. Want to interact with the parents from the local school your kids go to? You have to do that on Facebook. Event announcements? Keeping in touch with your distant aunt? Facebook.If something like Facebook is really a universal utility, it will have to be put under public administration; like the post office. But clearly, that isn&#39;t going to happen and would have other problems.I am going to have to find some other way to engage with old friends and family.Frank Herbert had some intuition with his whole &#34;Butlerian Jihad&#34; thing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem is that no automatic method we have now will catch context. There is a difference between &#34;Jews were murdered by Germans during war&#34; and &#34;Jews destroyed German economy before the war&#34; that will not be recognized by any machine we have nowadays. The first is true, the second is bullshit, how algorithm can now this?More, even if Facebook employees humans to do moderation still for some contractor from Asia &#34;Jews destroyed German economy before the war&#34; might not be easy to verify. For a contractor maybe Jews did that, who cares, I have 20 seconds to moderate this and move to other post. The same way if I was asked to moderate some historical details about India-Pakistan conflict or other historical facts about Asia, Africa I have no knowledge about at all.I was reading quite a lot recently about war in Angola and still I have doubts which side was &#34;good&#34; and which was &#34;bad&#34;, besides that people who lived there were hurt in the history like almost no other nation.Even worst. Some, especially historical, facts are judged from different perspective. For instance in Poland Napoleon Bonaparte is a mythologized person that brought hope to Polish hearts to get back their homeland [1]. From the point of view of someone from Austria or Italy, well, Napoleon is considered to be far from hero.We don&#39;t have to go back that far in the history. US intervention in Afghanistan or Iraq can be seen differently depending on somebody views.How to moderate all this?[1] Fun fact: not a big surprise that Napoleon didn&#39;t give a crap about Poland, he even refused to give them a proper King at the short time he could (he has chosen some Saxon prince). At the end, when Napoleon lost, remains of Polish military units were sent to Haiti to help France to maintain their colonies. Many Polish soldiers died from tropical illnesses there, many joined Haitians as they saw that those people were fighting for their freedom like Poles were."</p>

The firmware would need some way to do aborts/timeouts and kick a partially complete request back to software too.Is it complex...?   Yes.    But will the compute savings be worth it...?

Whenever I’m reminded that I’m not alone, I get a little bit more self-compassion and that makes me more excited to release my game and helps me appreciate all the progress and hard work to date.I’ve been working on King of Kalimpong [0] on and off since playtesting a one-week prototype of it in 2014. I had no idea how much work a networked physics vehicle/movement shooter game would be. (I should have, I was 8 years into a programming career).Working part-time was critical (for many reasons), but so was learning that progress is a product of discipline, not motivation, and that I needed to learn “infinite endurance” (I think that’s what Chris Hecker called it).Once I adopted the perspective that I was some finite number of 3-4 hour blocks of concentration away from turning a goofy idea into a game that anyone could play, finishing became something that felt inevitable — as long as I kept going.I’ll take the time to write about my experience after I release (which is now months instead of years away) in case any other game developers get anything out of it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thing is, it‘s true in essence, but talking about this stuff without numbers is completely pointless. It is written in a sensationalist way.1. Subsidies for wood pellets were a thing but are phased out in Germany.2. The awareness of some stupid calculations of burning wood come up quite frequently in the German media (the Twitter thread is like 2-3 years late).3. There are no numbers in the thread about the carbon emitted in the process of producing and shipping wood pellets.4. Not all wood burned in Germany is wood from the US.5. Not all stoves in Germany are utterly bad. The tech advanced in recent years.6. The comparison with coal is kinda dumb, because we had different goals a hundred years ago.- I personally think burning wood in housing areas should be banned entirely for health reasons.- I think the general gist of the thread is true: burning wood is at least partially some kind of green washing scheme.- But the reality is more complex than this thread claims."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well, I stopped reading here, because it is complete bull** &#34;Nearly 40% of Europe’s so-called renewable energy is currently obtained by combusting wood, much of it coming from forests in the US.&#34;I live in Poland and my (self built) house uses a wood pellet heat source. 30% of the surface area of my country is used for woodlands. Most of the wood produced is used by manufacturing industry. One of the byproducts made when manufacturing furniture and other things from wood are shavings, wood chips and wood dust. This can be made into many engineered wood products, but a lot of it is purchased by small manufacturers of wood pellets as fuel. Before I chose a heat source for my house I did enough research to know that the pellets I use (and are mostly accessible here) come from sustainable sources.So if there are countries in Europe that import their fuel wood from US it is not &#34;much of it coming from US&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does not trump the absurdity of heavily subsidizing an american EV company in order to buy their cars, then telling users not to charge them during the winter.As an EU-country citizen I am concerned by the dominance of political appearances in all the workings of EU since before the pandemic. Insisting in formerly-popular CO2 deadlines in the face of long-lasting ukraine war is absurd. Phasing out ICE cars too early is absurd. Subsidizing buying EVs throughout europe, even though many countries clearly can&#39;t support the future EV load is absurd. Fining power production through coal is absurd, as is not having a nuclear strategy. Keeping the marginal pricing of wholesale energy during war, is absurd. Begging the dictator of azerbaijan for oil at the same time that they are attacking their neighbor, while also sanctioning russia for doing the same thing, is absurd.Ursula VdL is a bad leader, and Charles Michel (president of the council) has recently publicly called her out for her bad leadership in energy. This EU that we see now is unrecognizable: inward-looking, woefully stuck in its own processes and populist obsessions, preoccupied with appearances (e.g. demanding gas and and even power cuts from countries that are NOT dependent on russia), and complete lack of vision. I am personally thankful to the US for taking initiative in nearly all fronts: arming ukraine, providing LNG to northern europe, coordinating sanctions and even Pelosi showing her support for democracy in the region."</p>

I know it is fashionable to mock the EU regulatory efforts in the US, but the EU has a tendency to step in once something reaches proportions where regulation is actually needed. Ridiculously high roaming charges, for example, have been eliminated through regulation.Once you are the dominant provider of something that is nearing life-essential utility status, you should provide support and escalation routes, and you should be accountable."</p>

Some people will always fall through the cracks - whether that&#39;s due to their own negligence, lack of technical understanding or some algorithmic false positive doesn&#39;t really matter imho.The real problem here is, that there&#39;s nothing that can be done to resolve something like that, AFTER it already happened. Not even if you were willing to pay for support to help you.If you got good contacts, are famous, manage to go viral or something, you might be able to actually get help - but as a regular, boring, everyday person, you&#39;re just fucked.

You&#39;d have to be pretty smooth about it, but it seems worth preparing for and giving it a try.Alternative idea: If you&#39;re really desperate, you could even try to dig up the phone number owner&#39;s address and show up at their door or something and explain it that way. (Note I&#39;m not recommending these per se; I&#39;m just pointing out what&#39;s possible. Obviously be very careful to consider everything before doing such a thing.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Their answer:  Dear &lt;user&gt;,

  Thank you for contacting FogBugz Support. I understand that you have received a billing notice and do not want to be charged. You may be wondering why you have received this communication and wish to have your account deleted.

  In the first place, please be rest assured that you will not be charged unless you have added a valid payment method to your account. The notification you have received is due to the recent changes to the FogBugz Base Subscription Model. Please accept our apologies for any misunderstanding this may have caused.

  Additionally, be aware that your subscription will be automatically canceled and scheduled for deletion 30 days after the current billing period unless you add a valid payment method.

  Finally, please be aware that trial accounts that were not active for a period of 9 months are automatically disabled, and will result in an Error 500 if you try to access the URL. These customers may have still received a notification despite not having an active account or a configured payment method.

  Since there is no further action required from our end at this time, we will be marking this ticket as solved. That said, if still you have any other questions or concerns with which we may assist, please let us know, and we will be happy to help as required.

  Thank you.

Then an invoice.Here&#39;s what I don&#39;t get: After a stunt like this, any reputation/brand value that you might have had is gone. So, the obvious conclusion is they bought the company purely to pull this trick. Any other value the company might have had is deleted. Can that have been worth it? Very few people will pay voluntarily, I can&#39;t imagine them successfully collecting the money, and the acquisition price probably wasn&#39;t 0 either. I can&#39;t imagine that the math checks out, or does it?"</p>

If they&#39;re able to copy everything, including private data from all apps that could be quite bad. For example many countries now use apps to login to online banking, with private keys for the login stored in the app. Will that be copied? Will it ever be found out if one of the 3000 government officials with access to this data sold it on darknet markets?Maybe some months after your travel you suddenly wake up one day to find all your money transferred from your bank account to some account in Nigeria."</p>

Any malicious person savvy enough to pull off a crime of interest to the Feds is smart enough to provide a wiped or burner phone to DHS/ICE, and they have to know this. So, what is the point in doing this if not to target law abiding citizens.2. USGOV has a spotty track record of keeping this information secure. A foreign actor is likely to access this info eventually. As one former government official once joked many years ago - concerning Chinese hacking - &#34;Well, its probably more secure in the CCP&#39;s data center, so I wouldn&#39;t worry.&#34;This is the problem when a non-technical generation makes the rules and regs.

These are basic functions of normal video playback devices like blu-ray players or cable boxes.A Plasma skin can&#39;t do any of this.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"EVGA is doing what every iOS developer secretly dreams of doing whenever they have to deal with some new stupid bullshit from Apple. Respect.Also, I&#39;ve always liked EVGA. I&#39;ve bought a few of their cards over the years, and many power supplies, and I&#39;ve never had a bad experience. It seems like they really care about making quality products, which is pretty rare to see nowadays.If they start expanding into new products with the same focus on quality, that&#39;ll be a net gain for the world. Maybe they&#39;ll try making laptops again?Or maybe this is all just an elaborate power move to put pressure on Nvidia and renegotiate their relationship."</p>

If they truly don&#39;t expand into AMD GPUs or something else as they&#39;ve said, I don&#39;t see them sticking around in the long term. A bit sad, they have been a good company to their customers.I don&#39;t blame them though, it sounds like Nvidia is a PITA to deal with, and the recent pains with GPU shortages and mining have likely exacerbated it as well.My best wishes to their employees, hope they all find good work elsewhere."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think it&#39;s worth repeating: at this point, MFA that is not based on Webauthn (https://webauthn.guide/#about-webauthn) should be considered dangerously insecure. Uber almost certainly enforces MFA for remote access; I strongly suspect we&#39;ll end up hearing that it was successfully provided during the authentication step (update: screenshots on Twitter appear to confirm this). As we saw in the case of the 0ktapus campaign, a sufficiently-skilled attacker will simply proxy the MFA calls to the real identity provider in real-time, the user none the wiser.Webauthn, however, binds the authenticator to the domain and port, and requires https as the scheme. If a user gets phished, they cannot be compromised: the phisher&#39;s domain will not match and any Webauthn authentication challenge would fail.So if your workplace is letting you authenticate with SMS codes, push notifications to an app, or 6-digit codes generated by an authenticator app/hardware device, you need to start banging on pots and pans up your reporting chain to get your security team the support they need to make Webauthn + FIDO2 hardware tokens or Webauthn + Mac Touch ID happen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why are people talking about MFA on this thread. Look, as someone whose day job is responding to such incidents, someone targeting Uber and is persistent will get in, MFA or not. Infostealers for Mac are a thing (Uber is a mac heavy shop I hear) and that&#39;s all it takes to steal cookies and tokens post-mfa, or why even bother with that, if you&#39;re running code just make it a reverse shell.The big screw up here is powershell script on a network share. A cheap pentest would have uncovered something like that.Modern security is not perimeter focused where you try to keep the bad guys out. Yes, you should do MFA,firewalls,vpns the whole schtick but(!!) your presumption should always be that threat actors already have a foot-hold in your network. This is very important because it helps you  focus on basic things like scripts and gpos with creds in them but also you treat internal devices the same as internet exposed devices. It&#39;s sort of what the whole &#34;zero trust&#34; thing is about as well. In other words, host/user compromise is a given but lateral movement should be at least as difficult as breaching the perimeter.But my prediction is, just like top commenters here, they will slap MFA on it and of course cleanup scripts with creds and call it fixed until the next compromise. Oh and FYI, MFA on VPNs is a PITA, that&#39;s rarely done for good reason, instead you use device certificates in addition to passwords which is what the recommendation should be not yubikeys or webauthn (vpn!=web??) because VPNs need to reconnect and you can&#39;t have people insert a yubi each time their connection drops. Ideal setup would have 7 day valid (or however long is reasonable for users to disconnect their PC and remain out of office) mutual-auth certs+ocsp getting conditionally reissued new certs to remain connected (compliance stuff like patching, unapporoved software,security alerts for the device). If you think about it, you typically issue users two yubikeys not just one so if the backup gets stolen you have a problem depending on how easy it is to social engineer users or reset their password with a good yubikey but a stolen laptop means certs+password revoked immediately."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unconfirmed method of breach: https://twitter.com/hacker_/status/1570582547415068672- Socially engineer an employee to get on their VPN (could have been prevented with webauthn / hardware 2fa)- Once on VPN, scan their intranet and find a network share- Network share has powershell scripts with admin credentials for their PAM vendor, Thycotic- From there can get full access to all systems"</p>

And I will give them the benefit of the doubt when it&#39;s not exactly up to par because 1) they seem to be new and characterize themselves as still being in beta and 2) it&#39;s self-hostable OSS and the inherent security of this offering is something I value deeply."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"* I far, far, far prefer Craigslist interface to anything else in that space.

And I&#39;ve completely given up on eBay over last decade.However.* Nothing is on Craigslist anymore in my area (Greater Toronto Area). Until about... 5-6 years ago, I could find comparable number of photography, computer, music &amp; kids stuff on Craigslist and Kijiji. Today, Craigslist is a desert, a void, an oasis of empty search results.So network effect wins, as always :-/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate FB Marketplace.It&#39;s actively hostile to buyers.Like, try to find a &#34;kinda nice&#34; bicycle. You can&#39;t find the bicycle category  (though it does exist as a sub-group of Sporting Goods), you can&#39;t just say &#34;show me bikes&#34; unless you hack the URL, you can search for the word &#34;bicycle&#34; but for some reason people selling a &#34;Specialized Rockhopper&#34; think you know it&#39;s a bicycle so don&#39;t use that word.Oh, and when selling, they just suggest random categories instead of letting you choose from their heirarchy. So you get bicycles in Hobbies. You get them in Sporting Goods. You get them in Bicycles. But... You can&#39;t search for them by type.That&#39;s not even complaining about the lack of attributes, like &#34;type=BMX&#34; or &#34;type=Mountain&#34; or &#34;Size=Large&#34; or &#34;Frame Material=Carbon Fiber&#34;... all of which are in Craigslist and eBay.And! when searching, they actively work to inject ebay-like selling (non-local) into the mix by resetting my distance preferences every time I change the search. &#34;Find bicycles&#34; -&gt; &#34;Find bicycles in 30 miles&#34; -&gt; &#34;Find &#39;Specialized Rockhopper&#39;&#34; -&gt; Why am I getting &#34;Ships To You&#34; results?! Why am I getting non-bicycle results?! Oh. They reset my distance again.^-- BTW they do this because they actually make money when the sale happens through FB. If you just buy it in-person with cash they don&#39;t get a cut. Misaligned incentives, as they say.And! even if I do find the bicycle category, if narrow the category by searching with a word in there, like &#34;Rockhopper&#34; it takes me out of the bicycle category to do the search!G. A. R. B. A. G. E."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My problem with Craigslist isn&#39;t that it looks old, the problem is that they seemingly refuse to modernize anything else about the site. Craigslist is chock full of spam and people abusing the search feature. I&#39;m no anti-spam guru, but surely there is a way to cut down on people submitting the same thumbnail dozens of times using as many keywords as they can so their cellphone screen repair service shows up when looking for just about anything.Craig is no saint, and actively goes after any competition to his site. That, coupled with the complacency or refusal to go after spammers leaves me with a very sour opinion of the platform and Craig himself."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; What Went Wrong?It&#39;s in the title of the article. It&#39;s a &#34;Blockchain Game&#34;. That&#39;s what went wrong. It was a flawed concept from its inception. Blockchains are pretty cool from a math/cryptography standpoint, but they really do not provide added value in most areas people try to apply them to.CryptoKitties is a digital trading card game. You get cards, you can &#34;breed&#34; cards together to make new cards, you trade/buy/sell cards. That&#39;s it. Nowhere at any point in this &#34;game&#34; is a blockchain necessary. Nowhere at any point does a blockchain add any value whatsoever. In fact, due to transaction fees, I&#39;d argue the blockchain actively detracts from the game.The idea of an artist signing their work in a cryptographically unique way is not new or revolutionary, and it certainly doesn&#39;t need a blockchain. There&#39;s a reason the general sentiment the art community has towards NFTs is overwhelmingly negative: it&#39;s because they literally actively harm us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I don&#39;t see addressed in this article is that as far as I know, it&#39;s basically impossible to trust the reported price or volume of NFT transactions, because there&#39;s no way to distinguish fake wash trades from real ones.So it&#39;s hard to draw any conclusions about whether the data reflects an actual peak in user activity, or just a peak in scams."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a great writeup overall. I was happy to see Tyler&#39;s initial outreach before conducting his tests [0]. However, please note that these tests are also being revised shortly after some brief feedback [1]:- The sendfile tests at the end actually didn&#39;t use sendfile, so expect much greater performance there.- All the Caddy tests had metrics enabled, which are known[2] to be quite slow currently. Nginx does not emit metrics in its configuration, so in that sense the tests are a bit uneven. From my own tests, when I remove metrics code, Caddy is 10-20% faster. (We&#39;re working on addressing that [3].)- The tests in this article did not tune reverse proxy buffers, which are 4KB by default. I was able to see moderate performance improvements (depending on the size of payload) by reducing the buffer size to 1KB and 2KB.I want to thank Tyler for his considerate and careful approach, and for all the effort put into this![0]: https://caddy.community/t/seeking-performance-suggestions-fo...[1]: https://twitter.com/mholt6/status/1570442275339239424 (thread)[2]: https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/4644[3]: https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/5042"</p>

Lots of nginx, Apache, Caddy, Traefik, Envoy, etc.The HAProxy configuration is just as simple as Caddy for a reverse proxy setup.

In a thread I started asking for feedback on my Caddyfile (https://caddy.community/t/suggestions-for-simplifying-my-cad...), mholt determined I&#39;d found a bug and rapidly fixed it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"from the article,&gt;&gt;As much as we love exciting new features, we also want to see people create games on the full spectrum of devices for everyone to enjoy.This is one of the main attitudes of the Godot team I really appreciate a lot. It might be easy for people in more developed nations to upgrade their hardware every few years, but there&#39;s people still playing games running on computers from 2002 and before. I used to know of a player who used to play (an old MMORPG) games on a computer he aimed a table fan at to keep it cool. The whole casing was open, it was kinna funny to look at it and it had hardware he got as a birthday gift more than 10 years ago. He played that old MMORPG because newer games wouldn&#39;t even start on that old thing. But most people who played that MMO were in the same boat, it was one of the very few ones they could run.The requirements for some of the games coming out these days is sometimes so insane a lot of people from around the world are unable to play them. I always found it funny how we had so much developer time wasted on supporting ie6 because a small percentage of people were unable to upgrade their browsers, but when it comes to gaming, all bets were off and you are now expected to spend a few grand a year on upgrading your computer to play newer games. And don&#39;t get me started on the bandwidth costs to play some of the new games."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I played with Godot back in the early 3.x timeframe (3.1? 3.2?) and then fell away and spent some time with Unity. But between some of Unity&#39;s missteps and Godot getting dotnet 6 support it is time to give it another go, plus a bunch of nice changes to gdscript that might make it something I&#39;m okay with using (functions are first class citizens now unlike before where you just passed the name of the function as a string which always felt incredibly gross).Though based on the discord conversation there are still a lot of bumps even in the beta so I would not expect smooth sailing yet, but lets see if it is any good.For anyone interested, the main documentation on their site is still pointing at 3.x.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a current software engineer at Adobe, I was really disappointed when I got the internal email announcing this this morning. It&#39;s reminiscent of Microsoft&#39;s anticompetitive behavior in the early 00s. Figma is the better product and Adobe knows it - but instead of using that to light a fire under them and work harder to create a better product, Adobe just used its deep pockets to make the problem go away. I was already planning on leaving the company for other reasons but this is the nail in the coffin for me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Used to work for a “high risk” payment processor, we inherited tons of accounts that were terminated by Stripe, Square, and PayPal. Here’s one small bit of inside info that may help the newer businesses out there:Most real payment processors (e.g. banks, merchant services companies) “underwrite” a company BEFORE allowing them to process. Underwriting means they look over the business model, financials, etc and make sure the business is an acceptable risk, not doing anything illegal or against their terms, etc. So you’re more likely to be declined initially, but if you’re lit up, you should be good for the future because the underwriters actually saw the deal and approved it.While I haven’t worked for these other companies, a lot of experience seems to show that Stripe, Square and PayPal operate differently: they light up ANYONE, and then only underwrite when the account hits a critical threshold of revenue. So it’s easy to get an account there, but if you scale up, that’s when you’ll be scrutinized and potentially terminated. It’s a very unethical practice because it ends up hitting businesses at the worst possible time, when the termination or suspension causes a huge financial hit.So basically, always have a backup processor and use these web based services at small scale to prove out your model, but NEVER rely on them as your sole payment solution."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a very similar experience, except it was on our launch day.We hadn&#39;t charged a single live customer yet, but we had done plenty of tests using the Stripe testing environment. So we go live with a huge launch event, and we have customers signing up in droves. When they get to the last step -- payment -- they get an error.Logging in to the dashboard I didn&#39;t see any indication that there was anything wrong with our account. No alerts or notices. We had already gone through the approval process you go through when signing up, and been told we were approved.The thing that surprised me the most was that there was just no indication anywhere that our account would not be able to charge cards. Wouldn&#39;t it make sense for there to be an indicator somewhere that just says &#34;Not ready yet&#34;?Apparently, they had never even begun reviewing/vetting us since the time we signed up for the account months earlier. We reached out to customer support and it took them about two weeks to get us activated. And, similar to OP, they never gave us a shred of information about what was going on. I still don&#39;t know to this day what the issue was.Next time I build something with Stripe I&#39;m going to test it in production before launching, with my own real credit card!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is bad.There are more and more Stripe horror stories like this, and from an outsider perspective it looks awfully like PayPal behaved back in the day (probably still does but I&#39;d never touch it again as a merchant).I have positive experiences with using Stripe in my last startup and we&#39;re currently building Stripe integration on another, which will process about 50% of our revenue (the other payment method being direct wire transfer).There might be just a tiny minority of people that end up treated like this, but with every story, I&#39;m less confident about our move."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Prior to the merge ethereum’s trust was controlled by the organizations with the most money who bought/built massive data centers to mine it.With the merge &amp; staking that abstraction layer has disappeared and it’s still the organizations with the most money who control it.Sure it’s great that non-productive math problems no longer need to be solved &amp; consume so much energy and hardware to make it all work. And it may be an incremental improvement over traditional global finance because there is a much greater ability to publicly scrutinize what goes on.But no one should consider this a fundamental paradigm shift &amp; democratization compare to traditional financial systems controlled by a a very small number of big players. Their influence still can override the mining process that’s supposed to be the final word on transactions.Although I’ll clarify a bit: I’m actually a proponent of having a layer of human judgement that can fix a problem when things go off the rails. The issue is that in crypto this layer is even less accessible to smaller players than in traditional finance. The DAO was able to throw its weight around and get a hard fork, but how many other groups with much less influence have suffered from similar problems and exploits without that same benefit?Yes, even in traditional finance there are some types of irreversible fraud. But for every day transactions, for using money as a daily part of transactions necessary to live your life and not just as a speculative investment, crypto falls far short.If a criminal spies on my credit card # as I make a purchase and uses that to go on a spending spree I can fix it with the credit card company with little cost but a few hours of time and frustration. If my wallet is pick pocketed or I simply lose it by accident I have a similar recourse to mitigate the fallout. Crypto? No. It may, eventually, have some other benefits though that’s yet to be seen. But as a major change &amp; liberation of people from massively powerful banks and governments there seems to be nothing more that shouted rhetoric and wishful thinking."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It&#39;s like Finland has suddenly shut off its power gridSo, have we observed global energy usage go down by about one Finland?Shouldn&#39;t that be observable somehow? Shouldn&#39;t there be some power stations reducing their output as a reaction to reduced demand?Anyone know how this would be visible, and on what kind of time frame we expect it to become visible?I&#39;m not claiming it hasn&#39;t happened. I just feel surprised to not see more coverage of that in this article, nor here in the comments. Energy efficiency is largely the point of this major change. Shouldn&#39;t there be graphs of the power grids everywhere showing a big drop? Maybe my expectations are just off on that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The Merge is one of the largest technological events in the industry to date.I feel kinda ashamed. I work in the IT industry and I claim to have knowledge about (&#34;good&#34;) software engineering practices, distributed systems,  compilers, algorithms, etc. Nevertheless, I didn&#39;t understand a word of what the article is saying. Could you recommend serious references (preferably books and not random blogs) I could read to catch up with what&#39;s going on with crypto these days?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sounds like they have a interesting history behind the creation of Penpot:&gt; Penpot was (effectively) born in a Kaleidos personal innovation week (PIWEEK, aka recurring hackathon) in 2018. Back then we had been recently forced to break one of our sacred rules at the company “only open source tools and platforms are allowed to build technology” due to F1gm4’s overwhelmingly productivity boost for designers at the company. “We are second-class citizens in open source, it’s frustrating and it’s painful!” they cried, and they were right.https://kaleidos.net/ seems like an interesting place to work as well.Gonna be exciting to see where Penpot moves from here. I&#39;m a 100% Figma user who just signed up for Penpot and gonna see if it&#39;s possible to adopt for my own workflows.Particularly interesting for me as a Clojure/Script developer is that Penpot is written in Clojure and ClojureScript, but the average user won&#39;t care about that. But will also be interesting to see if they&#39;ll be able to keep iterating at the same speed as they currently are, and how the language will affect it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am an avid Penpot convert, but from Sketch App, that I have been using since so many years now. I set up a system so we can install Penpot in no time self-hosted in house, including dns setup and ssl certificates. There are still some rough edges on Safari, such as text not displaying in place, so I may switch to Chrome or Brave for it.I just wrote a blog post on how to install it here: https://blog.setip.io/foss-subscription-savings/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is the beauty of FOSS. It might be rough at the edges but you can always have access to it and not have to worry about losing your daily driver (talking to you Figma). Every organization  needs to start thinking about this and invest in good FOSS tools for any recent technology to avoid business continuity  risk."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Notable highlights for me:&gt; Lockdown Mode is available in iOS 16 and coming soon in iPadOS 16 and macOS Ventura.&gt; Web browsing - Certain complex web technologies are blocked, which might cause some websites to load more slowly or not operate correctly. In addition, web fonts might not be displayed, and images might be replaced with a missing image icon.The first sentence I believe is referring to disabling JIT (just in time compilation of Javascript), which is dangerous as it allocates W+X pages which are often used by the final stage of an exploit. Apple did an amazing job already of hardening iOS by severely restricting which applications can use JIT (and this is their justification for why non-Safari browser engines are not allowed on iOS) and even enabling per-thread memory page permissions. Many more details are in this fantastic post from Google&#39;s project Zero: https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/09/jitsploitatio...Overall it&#39;s very interesting to see Apple invest so significantly in something that will benefit relatively few users -- not that I&#39;m complaining!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For kids over 1 year, some sanity saving notes (I have more than 4 kids, was about to go crazy when I got my second and then learned the things below):- everyone wakes halfway up multiple times each night to see if everything is OK. Make sure they don&#39;t fall asleep with anything that can&#39;t stay with them during the night: music, tv, light, food, drink or another person (you or others).- to teach kids to sleep, make them feel safe about it. What I did was walking in at a fixed schedule, starting at exact 3 minutes between the first night (I used a digital kitchen timer back then, a smartphone later) and increasing by two minutes every night. Surprisingly fast, my kids learn that I didn&#39;t disappear, and he&#39;ll be around even if they don&#39;t cry. Once they realized this they started playing with the toy the were allowed to keep in the bed. But, keep in mind: don&#39;t stop coming back if they are silent. A major part of the idea is that they realize that they don&#39;t have to do anything to make sure we don&#39;t forget them. Oh: and keep a very close ear with them in the beginning so they don&#39;t wake up and think they are alone.I never really could get myself to accept the idea that &#34;they need to cry themselves to sleep&#34; and every thing I tried before this didn&#39;t work on my oldest.This worked on my oldest kid, she started sleeping through the night within a week and also became calmer and I got my sleep back. With the rest of them it took 2-3 days only since I started earlier (shortly after they was a year old).Maybe other methods work too, but this was easy for us and we didn&#39;t have to let the kids cry to sleep or anything else I have seen recommended online that I didn&#39;t like."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My partner is a doctor mainly working in early childhood prevention. When she did some recent training on evidence based early childhood care (which is surprisingly rare, most early childhood care is not really evidence based), she learned a couple of things that she said she really would like to have known when we had our children were born.One is that you get told a lot about averages. So commonly parents get told that babies (should) sleep around 12h a day. What nobody talks about is the variance. There are babies who sleep only 8h a day and others who sleep close to 20h. So you end up with parents who thing they need to get their child to sleep, even though the child is absolutely not tired.Also a lot of people talk about not giving children too much impressions/stimulation. Which is also generally false, giving them stimulation will actually make them tired and sleep better, they also learn stuff. Obviously you don&#39;t do that just before or when going to bed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One day, I believe car design regulations will be amended to allow fully electric braking (ie. no hydraulics, drums, rotors, or pads).   At that point, the motor can be moved into the wheel (unsprung mass = bad, but weight savings from not needing an axle or gearbox will outweigh this).  Suspension and steering design is then far easier, because there is no axle to need to keep straight.Braking redundancy will be achieved by having motors/brakes on all four wheels, and within each motor 3 independant phase coils with independant controllers, such that there are effectively 12 brakes on a car.   Normally the controllers work together for smooth braking, traction control, software differential, etc.  But even after 3+ failures braking performance should still be satisfactory for an emergency stop.Obviously braking energy needs to go somewhere.  In the happy case, it&#39;s regen&#39;ed into a battery.  If the battery can&#39;t accept it, it gets dumped into dump resistors.  If the dump resistors fail, it gets dumped into motor coils (of which there are 12 remember).  Obviously the motor coils will heat up very fast, so this is probably a one-use-only failsafe, like airbags.So the whole system (except the pedal itself) is 12 way redundant."</p>

Since Pingora&#39;s inception we’ve served a few hundred trillion requests and have yet to crash due to our service code.&gt; In fact, Pingora crashes are so rare we usually find unrelated issues when we do encounter one. Recently we discovered a kernel bug soon after our service started crashing. We&#39;ve also discovered hardware issues on a few machines, in the past ruling out rare memory bugs caused by our software even after significant debugging was nearly impossible.That&#39;s quite the endorsement of Rust. A lot of people focus on the fact that Rust can&#39;t absolutely guarantee freedom from crashes and memory safety issues. Which I think misses the point that this kind of experience of running high traffic Rust services in production for months almost without a single issue is common in practice."</p>

The CEO went on a rampage and fired some people on the spot for something they weren’t even responsible for, which destroyed the already fragile morale and created a steady exodus of good talent over a couple of years.It didn’t kill the company for several reasons, but primarily because:1) The company had enough momentum, revenue, and cash in the bank that they could go on hiring sprees to replace everyone. The new hires had a lot of churn when they realized what was going on, so they just kept hiring until enough replacements stuck around.2) Many of the employees who didn’t quit saw this as their opportunity to rise through the ranks and fill the voids. They weren’t wrong and it paid off for many of them in the form of rapid promotions and advancement. The CEO became more hands-off as he realized his micromanagement wasn’t helping, so they basically inherited a slightly better situation.After this experience, I don’t really see a developer exodus killing any big company with good momentum and decent cash reserves. As long as a company has cash flow they can spend their way into hiring replacements as long as it takes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Being a senior engineer is weird when looking retrospectively. I remember being a junior and experiencing what the author is talking about with respect to puzzlingly staring at my seniors when they could answer obscure questions.Now I do it and do the same things they did with me: facilitate my thought and troubleshooting process rather than give me answers. I think the people that are successful in Senior+ engineering are that way because of certain technical and character traits they&#39;ve developed.One is a willingness to be right in the long run. When I was a young engineer I would make my cases hard with data. As a senior engineer I sit back and let the machine mull for a while because I know that&#39;s what the engineering machine will do regardless of how technically right I may be. Another is knowing that right isn&#39;t always right. Sometimes the right answer is technically wrong, or the learnings of wrong need to be made before we collectively can be right. Another is a lot of patience; patience for myself, patience for others. I recently admitted I was behind on work because my power was out for three straight days. Young me would&#39;ve found a coffee shop and worked those days with a single monitor down to the bone. Senior me took my dog to the park.Not everyone makes it to senior, had I not forked my path in certain places I don&#39;t think I would have. My advice, relish your time as non-senior and ask lots of non-technical questions. The technical stuff comes over time and by necessity."</p>

You inject more and more ads followed by more and more suggested content, thereby reducing the in network content. The in network content doesn’t get as much of traction, therefore people stop posting. This in turn forces the feed to have more and more suggestions and a few stale in network posts from days ago. This drives engagement down from people who want to see in network content and they leave. So what is left is people who do engage with suggested content, pushing the product to make decisions to push even more suggested content. All of this continues till eventually fatigue sets in and a sudden rapid drop in engagement kicks in because your global maxima of a quality product was lost long time ago and your product dies."</p>

And they already have all of that functionality built, so they could run significantly leaner, and hence not have to drive their remaining users away with excessive ads.This seems like a good idea to me.

Playing with a controller is slightly slower, and will take some getting used to (just as it does when playing with keyboard and mouse for the first time). After becoming familiar with it, I find it very comfortable. I recommend everyone to play through the first levels of our tutorial campaign, as it&#39;s a great way to get acquainted with playing Factorio with a controller."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Full post from Jack Conte&#39;s Instagram post:&#34;Hi everyone - I have some sad news to share: today, Patreon is doing a layoff of about 80 employees, about 17% of our team. This was ultimately my decision, so I wanted you all to hear directly from me about the reasoning.Before I do, I want to say two things: first, today will be painful for many people, and I am deeply sorry to the incredible teammates who will be leaving Patreon - they are good, kind, creator-first, exceptionally talented, and smart people.And second, I remember how nerve-racking it was when I was a full time creator - before starting Patreon - to watch companies that I depended on go through moments like this. So for those of you who rely on Patreon for your business and communities: I want to assure you that the company is making this move precisely for that reason - so we can continue to be a rock for your business.As the world has recovered from COVID lockdowns and entered a broader economic slowdown, it has become clear that the original plan we built doe he year, to support outsized growth through the pandemic, is no longer the right plan for the company.I take full responsibility for choosing that original path forward, and for the resulting changes today, which will be so difficult for our team.It&#39;s important to me that we continue to deliver for our creators and patrons with new features and products like native video, new content creation and organization tools, a wold-class mobile experience, and new ways for creators to grow their membership and strengthen their communities. To ensure that we make progress on that roadmap, we are increasing our investment in product, engineering, and design, which means decreasing our spend on other ares of the company.Ad difficult as this is fo our team, I know this is the right thing to do for Patreon, because it ensures that the company maintains a position of strength, even through an economic downturn, while continuing to deliver for our creators.If you want to read more about this decision, I just published the internal note I sent to our team this morning, and it&#39;s linked in my bio. I&#39;m going to stop posting here for a while to be 100% present internally for our teammates at the company. But I promise to come back in a bit - I will see you all soon.- Jack&#34;"</p>

And unlike his predecessor and colleague Bazin, Godard went beyond theory to actually create films that embodied the radical new ideas about film that the Cahiers crowd promoted. I&#39;ve seen people in the thread mentioning Italian Neorealism, and some of the great Hollywood films of  the 50s, all fantastic examples of forward-thinking film art. But Godard and his contemporaries&#39; contributions were about synthesizing earlier developments with a pop-art bent in a way that destroyed established boundaries of the medium and paved the way for explosions of film creativity on the continent and beyond. His genius was finding a middle ground between directors like Hawks and Rosselini, or Ford and Renoir, and using that space to create indelible masterpieces. RIP JLG"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Le Mépris (Contempt) is by far my favourite movie, peak cinema. Absolutely stunning Mediterranean cinematography, beautiful coastal and indoor shots, a decent plot with Odysseus in the background, and certainly not hurt by Brigitte Bardot&#39;s onscreen presence. Overall unbeatable aesthetics.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0Ju0ONwGUWatching it is like taking a short vacation. Phenomenal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is hard to overstate how much Godard changed cinema, even in America. If you don’t believe me check for yourself. Open the best picture nominees between 55’-65’ and watch their trailers. Films like Marty/On the waterfront/12 angry men/To kill a mockingbird/The Caine Mutiny/Sweet smell of success is what movies were like in the late 50s.The acting/writing was pompous, actors talked like reciting Shakespear. The movies were about heros of impeccable character doing heroic things and there always was a happy ending. Movie shots followed strict guidelines and the creative head of the movie was the producer while the director was akin to a contractor, someone hired to film the scenes.Starting in the mid 60s there was a radical shift, topping the nominations we have films like Five Easy Pieces, The French Connection, The Godfather, One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, The Deer Hunter, Dog Day Afternoon, Taxi Driver etc. Actors would act and behave like normal everyday people facing everyday problems. The new Archetype is the Anti-Hero, someone with flaws/vices in their character, someone that viewers can relate to. We see the rise of the director as the auteur, the creative master of a film. Every known filmaking rule is being tested to it’s limits and broken by young experimenting directors.The catalyst for this change was the French New Wave, a group of young filmmakers tired of the old style of cinema wanting to do films about their own life and experiences. The poster boy for the New Wave was Jean-Luc Godard starting this revolution with his 1960 film Breathless."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I made an API for a bank...   I was a third party and made the API by screen scraping their webUI.   I sent their devs a link and initially there were positive messages going back and forth.The API allowed you to see balance, transaction history, and make payments.Before long, the API got quite popular, and lots of people were using it to make lots of payments automatically.You know what makes money laundering super easy...   a banking API so you can split the million dollars you want to launder into 1 million 1 dollar payments.   And an API client which lets you treat each login cookie and account as an object in python.Before long, the API and all users who had ever used it were perma-banned from the bank, because it was determined they posed too high a fraud/money-laundering risk.I&#39;m still salty because, after spending a week of my life building and refining that API, they banned me and 6 years later still claim they can&#39;t return the $350 that was in the account because they are still &#39;investigating&#39;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Anything that you can achieve with PDFs, presence, and persistence in a bank branch you can do with our API.Not sure how to take this. With a small tweak like &#34;you can eventually do&#34; I would let it pass without criticism.I work with bank cores, imaging, BSA and related middleware on a daily basis. The scope and complexity of these systems is incomprehensible to most. Many of our clients don&#39;t even try to think about how fucked up their business is. They prefer to hire Deloitte and other vendors like us to be stressed about it for them.To give you an idea of how comprehensive a &#34;full&#34; banking API is, our combined WSDL and XSD references total ~9 megabytes. This is before codegen. The final reference sources as generated into the .NET codebase total nearly 20 megabytes. This is just the types &amp; method signatures. The actual implementations live in an IBM system manufactured some time during the previous millennium.But, none of that really matters. Whatever API method you call against a specific bank will have behavior that ultimately depends on a million things specific to them _and the region within which they operate_. So, its not enough to simply integrate with this massive API. You also have to understand a multi-dimensional matrix of regulations, end-customer behaviors, technological constraints, active geopolitical affairs, et. al."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"W4 Games&#39;s CEO Juan Linietsky is the creator and lead dev of Godot. Their primary mission, from my understanding, is providing the non-open-source tooling and support that&#39;s needed to make it feasible to use Godot as an environment for developing console games. The SDK&#39;s and their APIs cannot be included in the FOSS Godot code directly.Juan shared a blog post about the state of console support in Godot shortly before the launch of W4 that gives some more insight: https://godotengine.org/article/godot-consoles-all-you-need-...Often time folks say that what Godot is missing is a &#34;killer app&#34; that shows that the platform is viable. I think that this could potentially go a long way towards that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve started using Godot (4.0-alpha) for some hobby game dev recently. In the past I&#39;ve done a fair amount with Unity and touched Unreal once or twice. Thoughts so far:Godot is far from perfect. It&#39;s definitely more sparse than the others in terms of features. I&#39;ve encountered some bugs (nothing show-stopping, and it&#39;s tough to say how much of that is just from using the alpha version, but it has impacted my flow). There are unfortunate quirks; for example, saving scripts always saves the whole scene, and saving large scenes can pause the editor for multiple seconds, which is a particularly annoying combination. The programming model is heavily OOP. The custom scripting language, GDScript, is a blessing and a curse; its tight integration with the engine comes at the cost of subpar tooling (and of course, just learning a new language with new quirks).But.Godot has the distinct feeling of being cohesive. It feels like it was designed by one person, who knows what it takes to make games, and set out with a holistic vision. Everything you might need to do has an answer, or at least a story. You don&#39;t get confusing mixed signals from different parts of the interface or from the docs; there&#39;s one, intentionally-designed way to do each thing. GDScript has its quirks, but it also has very elegant built-ins for doing engine-specific stuff that would be super clunky in a general-purpose language. Using Godot almost has the feeling of using (good) Apple software; somebody anticipated your needs, and made sure they&#39;d be met. Maybe not in the exact way you would have picked, but in a way that will work, and will fit in with everything else.That, combined with it being fully open-source, makes it feel like it has good bones. Especially in contrast with Unity - which felt like a growing pile of corpses being tossed on top of each other with each release - it&#39;s been so refreshing that it&#39;s singlehandedly gotten me back into hobby game dev. I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m wasting my time learning one half-baked API that&#39;s going to be replaced with another half-baked API six months from now. For every annoyance or missing feature in Godot, I have faith that things will continue to improve - because they&#39;re built on a solid foundation - or that I could at least build it myself if I really needed to.I believe in the vision and the future of this piece of software. And that makes it feel worthwhile to invest the time learning all its quirks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice! I don&#39;t think W4 has created any games though. To get some REAL traction, Godot needs some full well-known games published. Basically, we need a game to do to Godot, what Undertale and Nuclear Throne did to GameMaker.We have Wrought Flesh by Miziziziz, but other than that I can&#39;t think of a single game actually produced by Godot. I know it is capable of it, but we need a &#34;killer app&#34; to make it really blow up."</p>

I pick it up from time to time and enjoy chewing on one or two chapters of material.But I&#39;ve yet to figure out if the book actually has a specific thesis.  I know it&#39;s all about the power of interpretation and the way in which interpreting a formal system as self-referencing has the effect of completely blowing up the intended design of that system.  But can someone sum up how this connects to consciousness beyond the obvious way in which consciousness plays the role of the interpreter?  Or is that itself the thesis of the book?  Or maybe that consciousness is the originator of self-reference?Bottom line is that I think the thesis can be summed up in a few sentences, but apparently it takes a whole 800 page book to get to the point.  Would love other people&#39;s thoughts on what that point is ultimately.  By the way, as salty as I sound about it, I love GEB.  So don&#39;t get me wrong :)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The cost of building a consumer audio product is generally no more than 30% of retail. 30% COGS (cost of goods sold) is virtually a maximum for items sold at mainstream retailers.There’s nothing wrong with this. These are standard ratios, not some dirty secret.The cost of goods sold is only a fraction of the costs that go into getting products all the way into the customers’ hands and supporting them (customer support, warranty replacements, lost shipments, fraudulent orders, etc.). That’s not even counting the R&amp;D investment costs that go into making the product, as the post says.Salaries, warehousing, shipping, insurance, and all of the others costs of doing business add up.It’s not actually realistic to expect an entire company to be selling you a $300 product that costs them something like $250 to build. Every business in existence must build in enough margin to pay the people who do all of the work to make it happen and support it.If this seems shocking, consider that the COGS of software as a service products are much lower by comparison. Doesn’t matter, though, because you have to pay all of those expensive salaries to make it happen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems to apply across the entire Small Plastic-covered Electronics sector.  I worked for an instrumentation/sporting goods manufacturer among others and this reads like I wrote it myself.The CEO, even of a small operation, likely has no idea what the performance characteristics of their devices are.  They exist to raise capital and deal with paperwork.We operated at about a 25% bom cost which was muuuuch higher than it needed to be but we were the aforementioned $50 components assembled by baboons case.  The products were very high end meters and sensors with the electrical sophistication of a McDonalds toy, just using whatever the highest end parts Arrow et al would sell us.Like they aluded to, ultimately it&#39;s all the little stuff that gets you.  Packaging, whatever voodoo the S&amp;M team is up to, random IT bullshit, heath insurance, random FCC compliance stuff, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Years ago I visited a friend in emmm..., &#34;Europe&#34;. He was not home and the neighbour let us in. He asked us to entertain ourselves until he gets back. It took little time to notice the pair of speakers: 50cm cubes, almost. I managed to turn them on and connect them to the TV. There I heard the most lifelike sound I ever heard from any speakers. I wondered: these should be some crazy European brand... no brand names anywhere on the boxes.Later that night I asked about the speakers and he went: &#34;What? They sound good?&#34;It turns out his friend works at &#34;Insert big European brand, not only audio here&#34; and they decided to make a great pair of speakers. Then he brings home a measurement device north of 6 figure €s, and they tune it so that you would not be able to distinguish a person talking behind you, from the recording of them being played with these speakers... Or as close you can get to that.Then they take their product to the company only to be laughed at: &#34;for anything below 5000€, we don&#39;t use any part above 50€. You have parts north of 500, this is not feasible for the market.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a degree in Studio Arts in addition to being a software developer (and recently I&#39;ve started making a lot of creative work with AI). Back when I was in school, there was already plenty of debate about &#39;what is &#34;Art&#34;&#39;? It&#39;s always been hotly contested. Most of my teachers felt that &#39;technique&#39; was not Art. Others were more purists – life painters, etc – and felt that, no, technique is art.Duchamp poked the art establishment in the eye with his &#39;readymades&#39; (urinals on the gallery wall, etc.) Warhol with his &#39;factory&#39; making silkscreens.The &#39;reverse Monet&#39; (too lazy to link) that caused such an uproar when it was shared last week was ironic – apparently people aren&#39;t aware that the impressionists themselves were considered &#39;not artists&#39; by a lot of people at the time.The camera and photography made many painters sit up and say, &#39;hey, it can&#39;t just be about &#34;image&#34; anymore&#39; – enter abstract expressionism, fauvism, cubism, etc. Work that shifted the focus from the image represented in the painting (&#39;a window into a world&#39;) onto the surface of the canvas itself: Rothko, Albers, etc.The thing is, people have wild misconceptions about what this technology does. Many clearly think it&#39;s a photocopier. As if StableDiffusion is hiding copies of all these works inside. When in fact what&#39;s been done is to take all of this online knowledge and create an incredible new tool with it. Like a music synthesizer times a million.It&#39;s understandable why this technology makes people uncomfortable. There are legit fears about displacement, economic uncertainty, etc. But we are fundamentally tool makers – it&#39;s arguably intrinsically part of what makes us human (borrowing from Carl Sagan&#39;s &#34;Dragons of Eden&#34;).If I were back in the art department last century, I&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;d be really excitedly discussing how these new tools will enable entirely new forms of expression. And sure, there&#39;d be the old guard saying it was awful, and &#39;not Art&#39;.This is a really interesting debate – I just wish it scratched deeper than the surface more often than it does, with a bit more historical context."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Aside from the debates about &#34;artistic merit&#34; and the ethics of using AI trained on existing artists&#39; work, one of the key things is that this new technology allows anyone to flood a place with images.There are some scifi-themed subreddits that I visit that allow posting art, and at this point it feels like 50% of all submissions are Midjourney/Dall-E generated art. Fine, it looks ok, but there&#39;s such a low barrier to creating and posting these, it&#39;s beginning to drown out other valuable content. The article even speaks about this:&gt; In July, one AI furry porn generator was uploading one image every 40 seconds"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s important to keep in mind that these art communities represent one very narrow kind of art, one that is more focused on illustration and graphical style, and most often not the kind of art that major art institutions work with. In the past 5 years, AI-generated art has been accepted and incorporated in the contemporary art world, with major works produced by luminaries such as Pierre Huyghe (of Ideal), Trevor Paglen (Bloom), and Hito Steyerl (Power Plants). For these artists, the graphical potency of the generated images is usually only one factor of the work, which also centers on how the artists use the technology, its origins, history, and broader uses, and what it might imply.For this kind of artwork, the kind made by artists who feel threatened by AI, I’ve been thinking for a while that a computer could likely do it better. Intricate detail, repetition, sampling and recombination of popular styles, optimization for aesthetic popularity and mass appeal — these practices are all squarely in the domain of automation, data science, and marketing. We might call it the Netflix-ification of illustration art, but it’s quite different, because the tools for making are available to many. As an arts educator and artist, I welcome these new tools, as they allow easy experimentation for newcomers, but also as they reveal that art based primarily in deployment of technical skill and eye-popping graphics is missing something vital."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The UK media (not just the BBC) continue to profess &#34;amazement&#34; at the speed and efficiency of the transitioning from a dead monarch to a living one. There&#39;s been much speaking in awed tones at the pace of the various proclamations, committee meetings, document signings, etc, as if this pace tells us why we should be impressed.Personally I&#39;ve found it borderline sickening.If there was a curtain that could have slipped, we all knew what would be behind it: a bunch of cherry-nosed coffin-dodgers with old-school-tie chums ensconced in the machinery of state, parliament, the military, whatever.Sure. Fine. Yadda yadda, blah blah. The &#34;deep state&#34; dancing hand-in-hand with the old school elites. Yuck. Disgusting but hardly a clear and present danger.But to see this machinery spring rustily, creakily into action has been truly eye-opening. Hitherto unknown people wearing ritualistic outfits have marched into public spaces in several cities, and declared that a member of the elite has been replaced, the continuum is unbroken. And this has been broadcast 24/7 by pretty much all media in the UK and in other countries. Elected representatives from all political parties have fallen into line.It is not okay to ritualistically march a bunch of military-state personnel into multiple public spaces across the country, under the protection of the police and with the consent of multiple international media outlets, and expect public passivity and capitulation.And yet, that&#39;s what has happened. And it keeps happening.It&#39;s bizarre in the extreme, and we really should not be okay with this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They aren’t being arrested for being anti-monarchy though.They are being arrested for being rude about it.Was the fella on radio 4 who stated to the entire nation that ‘King Charles and his family should be put in a council house and that the Monarchy should be abolished’ arrested? No.If you are going to attend a funeral, any funeral, be it the Queen’s or anyone else’s and hurl abuse or hold up signs with obscenities, you will be arrested.There were arrests in which the arrestee has been unarrested, when the police made a mistake. Like the fella who stated that ‘we didn’t vote for him’ when King Charles was pronounced King.You can, quite legally, protest the Monarchy. Being a dick about it and trying to upset people mourning will however be considered a breach of the peace or some other public order offence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The new law allows police to act in cases which they deem to be &#34;unjustifiably noisy protests that may have a significant impact on others&#34; or seriously disrupt an organization&#39;s activities.Doesn&#39;t take a political science degree to see what&#39;s wrong with this law. When cops get to decide what is a justifiably loud protest and what isn&#39;t you no longer have the right to protest. Protests are meant to disrupt, if you can&#39;t be loud about it then it no longer has its intended effect."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Riding a bike doesn&#39;t need to be the only or primary way that people get around in every city, all the time, for it to drastically improve quality of life for people living in cities the world over. Most people are capable of riding a bike - especially an e-bike - to get to where they&#39;re going. It&#39;s cheaper than a car, it can be faster than driving a car, and it is obviously better for both the global climate and the local environment.More than half of all daily trips in the US are less than 3 miles[1]. If cities give people the option to ride a bike for those shorter trips without feeling unsafe, a lot of people will ride bikes to complete those trips. That&#39;s shown over and over again. Change is hard, but a future with less cars and more trips by bike and public transportation is better, and possible.[1] https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1230-marc..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just bought a bike in Bangkok.To be honest it sat in my living room for a week because of the fear of riding it on these most dangerous streets. (Bangkok has bad reputation for accidents worldwide).But today I took it out.I rode to work and it was amazing. People here respect two wheels a lot and drivers slow down for you.Normally I’d walk to work for the exercise 3km. Which is about 45 minutes for me each way.But today the riding took about 10-15 minutes with a great cardio workout.I’ll take the bike out most of the week now instead of taking a cab.Here motorcycles are the mainstay. But I’ll stick with my bike for shorter distances and cabs for longer ones."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t understand take that this is not possible due to disabled people, winter, hills. Climate and city planning is an incremental problem. Just 2 new bike lanes significantly change the way I am able to commute, even far into the winter, and when it’s raining or snowing I switch to car or public transport. I live in a reasonably bike friendly city for us standards, and it’s clear that some overhauls have made the road much more efficient for cars themselves, pedestrians don’t stray out nearly as much into the road, as did the consolidation of parking spots into parking lots. Just go see some European cities for how not only public transport, biking and a more modern street layout make life better for almost everyone.For disabled people, having dedicated parking spots as well as a pedestrian friendly street layout makes life easier than having to navigate a busy street.Make the city better for bike doesn’t mean making it hell for cars."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m glad this research is being done. I don’t use cannabis, but I also don’t frown upon it. However some of the conversations on the use of cannabis recently have changed from “it’s a drug, but it isn’t that bad” to “it is completely harmless”. Which in my opinion is very dangerous and could harm entire populations before we have enough research. In my opinion, it should be considered similar category as alcohol, cigarettes, fat and sugar, a national health issue and research needs to happen asap on various short term and long term effects."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is this really surprising?Any time I had used cannabis I felt like my IQ dropped 20-30 points and I would lose hours of my day where it was difficult for me to learn. It made doing household chores not terrible, but brought out a lot of panic inducing moments and erratic behavior. I was thinking about a 100k other things while doing one thing. Later on I realized I wasn&#39;t even doing that one thing so well. Anything that drops cognitive abilities for a moment is going to be awful long term and especially for babies.I know a lot of people think cannabis isn&#39;t bad, but it is intellectually dishonest to disregard the broader effects of effects on cognition. I say that as someone who used to smoke a ton of cannabis.Not having to rely on drugs to find calmness has made a profound change in my life, and I can&#39;t believe that I used to turn to weed, alcohol, etc. when all I needed to be permanently (key word) happy was already present within me. Prior, when the effects went away I spent just as much time craving and suffering heavily.That being said I don&#39;t think it should be criminalized or anything like that. It is up to adults to do whatever, but it is useful to be honest as well. Not everyone uses it for epilepsy, none of the dispensaries here sell CBD products. Its all high THC products meant to &#34;fuck you up&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The amount of research over last decade has been huge, even outside of this. It used to be the only way companies could research cannabis was by getting really crappy samples from a government grow house, but with legalization the supply of research samples and the quality of researchers willing to work on it has grown considerably.This is a direct safety issue. I used to moderator one of the bigger cannabis subreddits and one of the bigger questions that always came up was whether it was safe to smoke while pregnant. The answer I always gave was that we just don&#39;t know, and so it should be avoided. The lack of research though meant that people couldn&#39;t make informed decisions, and the stereotype around cannabis being safe meant that people did not always err on the side of caution. Now there is something concrete we can point to."</p>

I got no answer until a year later saying &#34;not applicable anymore&#34; since the app basically got a rewrite.At least I&#39;m happy a lot of it got rewritten however it still seems as unstable as before, with random crashes and stories that can disappear on their own.[0] https://github.com/daterre/Cradle[1] https://github.com/klembot/twinejs/issues/898"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"With a few tweaks (monospaced variant), it could make a great coding font.Coding fonts have essentially the same goal: make similar looking characters different: 1liI|, 0O, etc... Code naturally strains our visual acuity: we want to see as much as possible, it means that we may use a smaller font size than we would find comfortable reading text with. Single letter, punctuation, etc... can be really important, in regular text, you can understand even if you can&#39;t read all the characters. So a hyperlegible font can help coders, even those with good vision, and many coding fonts already have &#34;hyperlegible&#34; features."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I also find the website confusing, the font is available here however  
https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Atkinson+Hyperlegible"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminder that fonts are subjective.This one is good for specific people, not everyone. I can&#39;t use it because I find it overly rounded with tics.An example of a font that is also meant to be legible, but is on the squarish side, is Tiresias Screenfont.Increased legibility does NOT mean &#34;flow&#34;. Just because each character is more &#34;distinct&#34; does not mean that the whole word is able to be processed with ease. Important to evaluate them in body text.Also, one&#39;s cultural background absolutely affects which fonts are preferred. If you grew up with German blackletter writing, you&#39;re not necessarily going to like or appreciate a sans-serif font. In Germany&#39;s case, the change from blackletter to latin shapes happened fairly recently (WW2). It&#39;s happening now again, Kazakhstan has decided to stop using cyrillic and change to latin characters."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To be honest, what I love about legos is the free play aspect.When I play with my kids, (now 8 and 10), I find that the key thing is not what pieces we have (admittedly, we have a lot of pieces), or instructions, but developing some theme or challenge.The theme could be ‘space’ or ‘under water’ or ‘I’m going to build the taller possible leg structure’ or ‘I’m going to build a vehicle that can be blown across the floor with a fan.’  Once they have a theme, they will do amazing stuff.Also, I believe it’s important to have a big slush pile of pieces.  It’s amazing how much builds change when your are scrounging for piece X, and you see piece Y and think, actually…I see that this app is technologically interesting for the developer, but it doesn’t address my core problem: inspiring kids to get started on free creativity.  For that, I’d more like a Lego theme of the day app, maybe slightly inspired or guided by the kids ages or genders.  If I did that, I’d have the kids submit pictures of their results, and use those over time to assess and improve the quality of my suggested themes at different ages and Lego piles sizes (there is your AI, if you must).The pitch would be ‘inspire your kids to new creativity.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just tested it on my kids lego clone bricks; there are like 800 of them but they are almost exclusively basic shapes (1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 2x3, 2x4 and 1x4) in red/black/blue/green/yellow/gray. This is a picture of the box: https://static-v3.e-jumbo.gr/uploads/resources/137879/201611... ; you&#39;ll see they are exactly like legos.The app identified 400 pieces (of the 800) and unfortunately the resulting ideas were not possible to be constructed because it required pieces we don&#39;t have. Of the 50 ideas I was only able to construct 1 or 2 that had very few pieces.I tried it a couple of times with diferent layout in pieces or lights, nothing really changed.Sorry but it doesn&#39;t work, at least with my kind of bricks."</p>

It&#39;s quite a polished UI, but there are a lot of features missing. The first ones that come to mind are:- No way to specify a seed. This is an important part of SD workflows, letting you redo an image with a slightly tweaked a prompt.- No way to specify a custom model. Alternative models (such as Waifu Diffusion) are fun to play with too.- No way to generate batches of images.- No way to specify which sampler to use.- No way to adjust the weight of specific sub-phrases, or use negative weights.There&#39;s also no img2img yet, but it sounds like that&#39;s a planned feature.Other GUIs such as https://github.com/sd-webui/stable-diffusion-webui, https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui have many more features - but not all will be trivial to port to M1.P.S.: For the people asking - yes, it can do NSFW images. I checked."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can confirm that this works great on the M1 Max. It has been taking less than a minute to run the model and generate the images. So far I have been really satisfied with the output. Let&#39;s please make one-click installers the norm for future technology.

Oh, how much fun running your own TLD would be...[1] https://web.archive.org/web/20150319211308/http://to/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Some have A records pointing to the root servers. I’m not sure why this is - I think it might be because no DNS has been configured in the TLD zone for these TLDs.I was also curious about this. It turns out that it&#39;s because dig interprets some TLDs as DNS record types (MD, MG, MR, MX) or DNS classes (IN and CH) of the same name! Not sure why, but when given only a type or class (without a domain name), dig actually queries for a list of the root servers, which explains the strange results. Looks like using the -q option to specify the domain name works around this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was responsible for the Turbo C (later Borland C/C++) run-time library in the late 80s and early 90s.Tanj Bennett created our original 8087 floating point emulator. It was real mode, 16-bit code, that kept an 80-bit float in five 16-bit CPU registers as a working value during its internal math calculations. If you ever coded for the PC you will appreciate just how precious register space was on the 8086/8088.It&#39;s been a few decades and my memory is fuzzy but I don&#39;t recall any critical places where the registers had to be saved and restored. He choose math algorithms and code paths specifically to keep all five live at all times. Tanj&#39;s code flowed with an economy of motion that brought to mind the artistic performance of a professional dance troupe. I did not have the math skill and could not have ever created it as he had. It brought me genuine pleasure just to read his code.Eventually, it came time to port it to 32-bits (real and protected modes.) I wrote new exception handlers and replaced the instruction-decode logic with a nice table-driven scheme but did not touch the core math library. It still ran in 16-bits under the hood exactly as Tanj designed it.Tanj, if you happen to see this, I have fond memories of your emulator. It was beautiful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nobody has mentioned Knuth’s corpus of work in Pascal-Web for the TeX ecosystem. This is code written for an era where there wasn’t an ecosystem of libraries for common tasks and even things like being able to access a file in random access order couldn’t be counted on. Even 7-bit ASCII couldn’t be counted on as a given (EBCDIC-based IBM mainframes were a significant element of the computing landscape still).Against all that, Knuth wrote code that could be ported to other systems (I first used TeX on an IBM mainframe running VM/CMS, then later on a VAX minicomputer running VMS, then on a PC with DOS, PC with OS/2, PC with Windows and now a Mac with OS X/MacOS. His presentation of code and internal documentation intermingled is something which I could see still being useful now, although sadly, literate programming seems all but dead now. I still go back to Knuth’s code to understand how to solve some problems on occasion even though it’s about 30 years since I last wrote a line of Pascal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Postgres code is very good, redis as well. Some of the core parts of Linux also totally worth learning from.I also remember how Qt UI code and docs were a revelation after the nightmare of win32 and related frameworks.Bellard&#39;s original Tinycc was very entertaining and took a while to digest.Most old and well-maintained projects are worth learning from.Apart from some local tips and tricks what is more important is understanding that there&#39;s nothing special about other people&#39;s code."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is one of the most exclusive banks in the world, counting the British Royal Family among their notable clients, and they can&#39;t even be bothered to keep their mobile app up to date. Pretty much sums up what rich people think about technology: make it sexy and powerful but I don&#39;t want to hear about ongoing maintenance costs. According to Wikipedia, new clients needed £500k in disposable funds to set up an account back in 2001.[0][0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coutts"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I find really amazing is that we have here an incredibly elite service that the vast majority of people will never be able to afford, and yet its elite clients are dependent on essentially the same mobile devices that everyone else is. You can spend ~$2k on a phone, and it will be the best phone you can buy. There&#39;s no $20k phone that will be any better.It&#39;s like flying in first class and then having to queue up in the same immigration line as everybody else - except in that scenario you can pay your way into a priority lane.True, ~$2k is still a lot for a phone, but it&#39;s within reach of so many more people than the gatekept world of private banking and jets.This is not a comment about wealth disparity - it&#39;s about goods which seem to resist the impact of wealth disparity; where there is a relatively low upper bound on how good of a thing you can buy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Using three separate identification strategies we show that, controlling for own-vehicle weight, being hit by a vehicle that is 1000 pounds heavier generates a 40–50% increase in fatality risk. [...] We consider two policies for internalizing this external cost, a weight-varying mileage tax and a gas tax, and find that they are similar for most vehicles. The findings suggest that European gas taxes may be much closer to optimal levels than the US gas tax.In an environment of wealth inequality, this seems like another way that the wealthy can benefit: easily afford to drive heavier vehicles that increase their personal safety while increasing the lethal threats against the poor.How about instead: if larger vehicles are more dangerous for the population overall, then they should be banned for everyone, not only effectively off-limits to the poor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They even had to change a decade old standard crash test to account for increase in weight and count of current style SUVs. IMO they should be banned as the creeping normality will lead to all of us sitting in battle mechs eventually:https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/small-suvs-struggle-in-new-...https://youtu.be/3Lu-t5dJrxI"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like heavier cars being a separate license or an endorsement on your existing car license is a sensible idea. They have very different handling characteristics, and it&#39;s pretty noticeable a lot of their drivers lack the skill required to operate them safely.I mean the idea that you can sit your license test in a subcompact and then go out and drive a 4 door high displacement ute/pickup truck is pretty absurd on the face of it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh hey HN. This is in the Caddy 2.6 beta already: https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/releases/tag/v2.6.0-bet... - please try it out!Thanks to Marten Seemann for maintaining the quic-go library we use. (I still haven&#39;t heard whether Go will add HTTP/3 to the standard library.)Caddy 2.6 should be the first stable release of a general-purpose server to support and enable standardized HTTP/3 by default. HTTP versions can be toggled on or off. (Meaning you can serve only HTTP/3 exclusively if you&#39;re hard-core.)PS. Caddy 2.6 will be our biggest release since 2.0. My draft release notes are about 23 KB. We&#39;re looking at huge performance improvements and powerful new features like events, virtual file systems, HTTP 103 Early Hints, and a lot of other enhancements I&#39;m excited to show off on behalf of our collaborators!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using Caddy in a 3 node HA cluster sharing an anycast bgp address for about 18 months now and it&#39;s been fantastic.  Certs &#34;just work&#34; across the cluster once consul is wired up.  I recently added IPv6 which also &#34;just works.&#34;greenpau/caddy-security is fantastic and &#34;just works&#34; for OIDC sso.mholt, thanks for recently adding the ability to bind to multiple specific IP addresses by default, this help me conserve precious public IPv4 addresses."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thanks for a great piece of software that I use every day in production and just works.At first I was scared of how stupid simple it is. It feels like web servers are supposed to have giant config files with a hundred mysterious knobs to twiddle. Now I always default to Caddy, and have yet to find an instance where it didn&#39;t fit my needs. Congrats."</p>
