								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The other day I wanted to learn Svelte. Even though the tutorials on the Svelte homepage are great, I found the MDN Svelte tutorial to be better: it explains the conceptual differences wrt other frontend frameworks well, it explains in detail how to enable Typescript and migrate your projects, and it has a dedicated section that describes different deployment options.While of - of course - all of these infos can be found somewhere on the web as well, I very much appreciate such a well-written, holistic intro to a framework. I signed up for the MDN Plus 5 plan.P.S.: If someone from the MDN team is reading this, maybe include a &#34;sign up&#34; link directly in the blog article from Hermina."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems fair enough. It won&#39;t prevent anyone from accessing the actual content and it probably makes it easy to justify paying something to MDN to employers.In practice, if you are not paying:- Bookmarks can most certainly easily replace the Collections feature- you can clone the MDN repository for having the documents offline- notifications could be computed from the commit logand the subscription probably makes these features more convenient, at least for the notifications and the offline without actually removing rights from anybody.Seems clever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"MDN is literally the documentation for everything front-end web that is built-in to browsers and a little more. I hope all of the income from this goes back into MDN. If there&#39;s a project that deserves my eternal gratitude, MDN is up there as a web developer.Thank you to everyone who has ever worked on MDN or contributed at any capacity."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really miss a consistent user experience. A core idea that I as a user can rely on to predict how a new app will work. I was in awe when I discovered as a kid that user interface were a research area. Things like Fitt&#39;s Law and so on. It was not just opinion.Today I get the feeling it&#39;s mostly just opinion. Either the designer&#39;s opinion or the wish to copy the look of something.Whenever I see a hamburger menu I silently think &#34;Here someone has given up&#34;.And there are a lot of behaviors that are not functioning well.Is something a button? Should I click it or double-click it? How about long-press on it? How can I know when there&#39;s no visual clues?Things like &#34;Hide cursor while typing&#34; in Windows. It has not worked properly for decades and today only work in some super old apps like Notepad.Another thing is type-ahead. I remember in classic MacOS, people pressed shortcuts and started to type the filename or whatever. It was all perfectly recorded and replayed. In modern Windows, press Win-key and start to type, oops, it missed the first keypresses, presented the completely wrong results and made a mess of your workflow.I feel confused and disrespected as a user every day and I&#39;ve been using WIMP graphical user interfaces since 1986. Sure, computers do more today, but there&#39;s less consideration of almost everything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree 100% with the author, the old GTK button was gorgeous, it will be missed.&gt; I have had to explain to people tons of times that the random word in the UI somewhere in an application is actually a button they can press to invoke an action.This is one of my biggest complaints with the super flat modern designs. Many widgets lost their skeuomorphic depth, which encoded a lot if visual information (the clickability, the current status), but in many cases nothing was added to supplant the loss of those visual cues, so now it is just a label (or a label in a white or grey box) and there is no way of knowing if it is clickable or its current status."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m going to take a risk here and say that I&#39;m a designer who generally likes flat design.I see a lot of hate here against flat design, and it makes sense. A lot of designers abuse it, making their UIs ambiguous. It&#39;s probably true that if flat design was never conceived, UIs would be less confusing on average.But it&#39;s clearly possible to do flat design well. iOS is mostly flat, but it&#39;s quite beautiful and user friendly. You usually know when something is a button because the context makes it obvious. If it&#39;s not obvious, it&#39;s probably not a critical feature, just a nicety for those who discover it. There will always be people who hate everything Apple designs, but I think they&#39;re usually channeling a hatred of something else, like monopolies or proprietary things.Moreover, I think flat design is not a fad but an inevitability. As a rule, designs become more abstract over time, because as users get more used to UIs, they need fewer clues. It used to be that UIs needed to be skeuomorphic to be familiar and recognizable, but now simple outlines can do the job.Why do we need to remove unneeded clues, you ask? To make room for more important things. If Instagram was littered with gradient buttons and blue underlined links, they&#39;d draw attention away from the real content, the pictures. If Figma had too much personality, it&#39;d influence users&#39; designs.You could argue that we&#39;ve gone too far too fast. I don&#39;t have a dog in that fight. But I would bet my big toe that we&#39;re not going to reverse time and end up with skeuomorphism again. Instead, we&#39;re going to take advantage of faster GPUs to visualize abstractions in ways we couldn&#39;t before. We&#39;re seeing that with blurred background effects becoming more common. Excited to see what&#39;s next."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Rant engaged. As a person who feels responsible for ensuring what I build is secure, the security space feels inscrutably defeating. Is there a dummies guide, MOOC, cert, or other instructional material to better get a handle on all these things?SSH keys make sense. But certificates? Is this OIDC, SAML, what? Is it unreasonable to request better and deeper &#34;how to do {new security thing}&#34; when PKI is a new acronym to someone? Where can I point my data science managers so they can understand the need and how to implement measures to have security on PII-laden dashboards? As so on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel that trying to make SSH keys short-lived is becoming more painful each year because there&#39;s an increase of tools that use SSH keys for purposes other than SSH logins. For example, age [1] encrypts files with SSH keys, agenix [2] does secrets management with it, Git can now sign commits with it [3], and even ssh-keygen can now sign arbitrary data [4]. All of these become useless the moment you start using short-lived keys.[1]: https://github.com/FiloSottile/age[2]: https://github.com/ryantm/agenix[3]: https://calebhearth.com/sign-git-with-ssh[4]: https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ssh-keygen.1.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article was very illuminating. And, I wish it was written like this:  To really secure your SSH server, do these three things:
  1. Setup a trusted authority
  2. Use ssh certificates
  3. With ssh certs, you can easily add MFA for logins expire until you reauth.
  Now that we&#39;ve established this, here are the gory details.
  Lorem ipsum, lorem ipsum, lorem ipsum.


It&#39;s a great narrative, but I wish I knew the big payout in advance."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think its important to recognise that quite a lot of modern web based companies are running their business on the 0 cents model. That is they take the marginal cost of a customer and push it down to zero and rely on scale to make a profit from it. They can&#39;t add anything to their business that would scale with the number of their customers that has any real cost, computing resources even are heavily optimised for let alone having an actual human to speak to.What this means is that as a 0 cents customer (even if you pay them) you are completely disposable, no customer matters to them at all. This culture comes along with a cold disdain for customers and a desire to run everything off algorithms and if some people get caught up in error they just don&#39;t care. As a customer its annoying and you can loose a lot of data, but for the companies its their business model. The only way as a customer to not be in that situation is to avoid the businesses based on this model. If they were somehow forced to provide human customer support they may very well be substantially less profitable or not viable as a business anymore."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently had the experience of trying to do a banking operation that required an in-person visit.  For some reason this bank required me to do this operation at the branch that I originally opened the account, which is not where I live anymore, and it&#39;s very inconvenient for me to go there.So, while I was in another city of that country, I decided to try and handle that problem.  I went to a branch and asked them to do the operation, saying that there must be a way to do it without me having to travel hundreds of km.  The person absolutely refused to even try to help me.  &#34;No, there&#39;s no way to do it, you&#39;ll have to go to your branch office.&#34;  I begged, I got angry.  (This was after leaving this issue for a couple of years -- travel has not exactly been easy, so there are reasons I didn&#39;t manage to do it yet, and was getting desperate.)  All to no avail, the person just. could. not. help me.Fine, I left, very annoyed.  The next day, I went to a different branch, told the same story, and explained how extremely inconvenient the whole thing is.  I went in expecting failure.  To my surprise, the person responded kindly, said &#34;okay, I can send an inter-branch memo, I&#39;ll do the operation you pay this much, done and done.&#34;  I signed something, walked out smiling, and the next business day, received a confirmation email from my branch in the other city.Moral of the story: I completely agree with the premise here, but just keep in mind that even if you talk to a human, your millage may vary greatly depending on who you speak to and what side of the bed they got up on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree that companies have a responsibility to listen to and address customer complaints. The problem is that a small percentage of customers create the bulk of the customer support burden. With phone support this gets even more skewed. You can&#39;t have engineers do phone support or they won&#39;t be able to get any real work done with all the interruptions. You can have engineers investigate and address all complaints that arrive by email. I strongly believe email support that goes directly to the people most knowledgable to fix the underlying problem is the best approach.Companies that provide bad customer support just don&#39;t care. They&#39;ll provide phone support if they feel they have to, but they&#39;ll outsource it for cost reasons. Talking to people who are friendly but clueless is at least as frustrating for me as creating a ticket that doesn&#39;t go anywhere."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This does indeed seem to work for me, but the repeated emphasis on the patents and trademarks makes me suspicious. It looks like a company who cares much more about patent royalties than about their invention - whom I would never be willing to give my money to. Having seen the principle, I could write a browser extension in an hour. I suppose I&#39;ll have to wait 25 years (or whatever the French patent expiry length is), though.If you want to read the patent (in French), it&#39;s here: https://data.inpi.fr/brevets/FR3052587.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have some feedback regarding the testimonial from “Sangeeth”, whose Memoji shows a Sikh person. Did the user choose their Memoji? The two don’t go together well for reasons of odd cultural differences in the Roman/Latin transliteration of sounds in the south and the north of India. The -th- cluster represents the dental t, IPA /t/, but only in South India. In the North the same sound is represented by -t-. Therefore you might find a Sikh named Sangeet, or a non-Sikh named Sangeeth, but a Sikh named Sangeeth? I’ve never seen a Sikh name using the -th- cluster in my life. There are Sikhs who grow up in South India of course but their names use the North Indian transliteration rules.What I’m trying to say is: if you chose the Memoji with a turban to show an Indian person, it doesn’t match the -th in the name. As an Indian my first reaction was that the testimonial was fake, for this reason."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Bionic reading aims to encourage a more in-depth reading and understanding of written contentby reading faster? I mean the examples are pretty compelling and it did feel like I was reading faster, but at the same time their goals are at odds - faster reading doesn&#39;t necessarily mean more attentive reading, or being able to absorb more information.Still, interesting technique. I just wish they made their examples / comparisons actual text instead of images; surely they can just write a snippet of JS or some HTML to render the effect in the browser itself. Or would that be giving up their secret sauce?Also if any of the authors are here, please get rid of the &#34;small text in between big text&#34;, I&#39;m not sure if I need to read the one and then the other, or refocus my eyes on the big then the small text."</p>

Not completely inconceivably given that Python gets its name from Monty Python. I&#39;m thinking there are other similarly fandom-based namings of popular tech tools (the only other one that comes to mind is the occasional assertion that Knuth&#39;s choice of TeX was to honor his alma mater CalTech²).2. I created a short-lived California TeX Users Group in the late 80s/early 90s which we dubbed CTUG after being warned off naming it CalTeX (but being at Harvey Mudd College³ at the time, I was disinclined to name it that anyway).3. Which, of course, summons to mind one of my favorite pranks⁴ in the HMC-CalTech rivalry in which the freeway sign identifying the exit for CalTech and Pasadena Community College had parentheses added so it read “CalTech (Pasadena Community College)”4. Most people would consider the Fleming cannon theft to be the pinnacle of the pranks (when I had my pre-frosh campus visit, the cannon had just arrived on the Mudd campus), but I think the freeway sign gets points for being more creative."</p>

Distracted by the attack, the back door slammed shut behind me.  Since my key was only good for the front door, I had to walk around the building.  That damn crow followed me the entire time, dive bombing my head, and screaming bloody murder at me.  It was a little spooky.When I finally got back inside and upstairs, I went and looked out the living room window, which looked out the same direction as the back alley.  The crow had flown back around and was at the 8th floor looking in the window, from the other side of the pigeon netting we had on our balcony.   On the inside of the pigeon netting, was another crow, desperately trying to figure out how it could escape.  Not really sure how it had got itself through the pigeon netting in the first place.I went out and sliced a hole through the netting and the trapped crow quickly joined its mate outside, who finally stopped screaming bloody murder.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People use centralized systems because they actually like the convenience that comes with it. And with that, comes the decentralized system changing in such a way that it changes to almost NEEDING centralization. The problem is that engineers and cybersecurity people all think that everyone else thinks like they do, when in actuality the complete opposite is true.The biggest example is the internet itself - the internet is a completely decentralized network until it wasn&#39;t, with website certs becoming required. People use popular web hosting because it&#39;s easier and just better than what they could do. Email is completely decentralized, and it&#39;s very easy to set up your own web server - as long as you want every single spam system to immediately block all of your messages.&#34;Decentralized&#34; systems will all go the exact same way. And it&#39;s because people don&#39;t want to spend time setting up their own shit, they are very happy to pay in either money or data to have someone else do it for them. Yeah, it&#39;s very easy to say &#34;well just set up your own thing&#34; but once you get to a critical mass of everyone using Gmail instead of their own server then the system becomes unusable without centralization.Decentralization is a fantastic idea, and it works great in theory, but it fails to actually consider any of the practical problems that come with decentralization and doesn&#39;t consider what people who aren&#39;t programmers actually want to do with their time and money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; A lot of Web3 platforms are in fact centralized. Your wallet (MetaMask), marketplaces (OpenSea), APIs (Alchemy) are all central platforms. Sure, they use a distributed database (blockchain), but before that it’s still a Go app on AWS, meaning its centralized.&gt; Your wallet (MetaMask)Run your own node. This is lazy reporting to reach the end point about fawning over FreeBSD (its in the article, literally an article about having fun staying poor), when you can just as easily inspire and teach people how to use custom RPCs. There is an opportunity to inspire people with the tools to know what to look for, even if it&#39;s absurd to suggest people actually compile and run a node themselves. Tell them why the default behavior is a convenience and if they are interested in the decentralized parts then here is what to do.&gt; marketplaces (OpenSea)Yep. It is a GUI ontop of their smart contracts (public access backend code). You don&#39;t have to use their GUI. You should inspect their smart contracts for centralized control, or at least look to see if anyone else has. There is an opportunity to inspire people with the tools to know what to look for, even if its absurd to suggest people actually do all the analysis themselves.&gt; APIs (Alchemy) are all central platformsa fine example. don&#39;t use Alchemy or Infura as your RPC endpoints? Why not just make blog posts about that?This kind of energy could just as easily be steered into &#34;how to improve the concept of Web3&#34; which lots of people are actually doing. It could just as easily be &#34;This isn&#39;t decentralized! Let me fix that!&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Self-hosting is something that we should be constantly iterating on making easier; it&#39;s really the path forward for privacy centric folks. The main challenges are managing workload scheduling (SystemD is complicated for a layperson). Networking is another challenge; for instance, if you wanted all or part of these services to remain offline or on a Mesh VPN there&#39;s a lot of knowledge required.There&#39;s some projects trying to tackle the workload orchestration piece; CasaOS (https://www.casaos.io/) being one of my favorites but there&#39;s also Portainer (https://portainer.io). TailScale and and ZeroTier are great for Mesh VPN networking, where you may need to run some workloads in the cloud but want them networked with your home applications (or just to keep them offline). They also allow you to access applications running on a home server that doesn&#39;t have a static IP. Cloudflare Access is okay; I haven&#39;t tried it because it deviates from the mesh VPN model significantly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is why I&#39;m building Timelinize [1]. It&#39;s a follow-up to my open source Timeliner project [2], which has the potential to download all your digital life onto your own computer locally, and projects it all onto a single timeline, across all data sources (text messages, social media sites, photos, location history, and more).It&#39;s a little different from &#34;self hosting&#34; but it does have a similar effect of bringing all your data home and putting it in your control. We have to start somewhere, might as well start with bringing in all the data we&#39;ve put out there. (It&#39;s not a replacement for self-hosted media servers, for example.)The backend and underlying processing engine is all functional and working very well; now I&#39;m just getting the UI put together, so I hope to have something to share later this year.[1]: https://twitter.com/timelinize (website coming eventually)[2]: https://github.com/mholt/timeliner"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Self hosting is hard. You need to take care of security, backups, software updates, software installation and so on.Even on something like a QNAP (which can be compared to managed hosting) this can be hard. Flip the wrong switch and you expose something to the world. Missed a security update: your device is now vulnerable.While I host a lot of things myself I can understand self hosting is not for everyone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"First of all, it is amazing that the author managed to analyze the patch in so much details, it probably is an effort comparable to the bug fix itself. Still I think the article is missing some bits. I would expect any core migration to require barriers (either implicit or explicit) on both the old and new core otherwise the process would risk seeing its own stores and loads out of order.But in this case the barrier is predicated on the execution of some cache manipulation instruction, so I suspect things are more complicated. Maybe these specific cache manipulation instructions do not respect the usual architectural memory ordering and require some different set of barriers. Possibly they bypass cache coherence completely and require an actual flush of the cache. That is going to be very expensive and it make sense that it is only done only if the process was actually fiddling with these instructions. &#39;jmgao&#39; else thread reported that tegra has coherency issues on migration, so it might be related."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Makes you think, do Linux, Windows and Mac handle this properly? Honestly, I doubt it!Context switches, idle state transitions, etc tend to be fairly delicately handled as a common cause of CVEs and Heisenbugs.  I&#39;m sure there&#39;s still plenty of bugs but more attention ends up being paid to these things on general purpose operating systems.  More eyeballs on the code, more security researchers, more hardware variants to expose things that were thought to be fine.  Also fuzzing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; And how do you even find / debug a bug like this?As someone who has worked on cache code, I suspect it&#39;s quite possible they were just reviewing this code again and realised the potential hole. Or they were trying to track down some horrific bug and fixed this along the way (whether or not it caused it), reviewing anything to do with caching is probably worth doing because it&#39;s notoriously difficult to get right, especially with context switching involved.Another possibility is that the bug is more deterministic than it looks, under the right conditions, and they managed to replicate it and analyse it in a debugger."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Life finds a way. My wife had generalized tonic-clonic seizure for an entire year (non previous seizure history) without any cause being detected by multiple MRIs. She was taking increasing doses of Levetiracetam that somehow controlled the scope of the seizures but not avoid them completely. After a year of this, we go for another ER visit after the latest one and she ask, somehow randomly, to have a pregnancy test, it comes negative but, finally, the root cause of the seizure does appear on imagery, at that point a low grade astrocytoma. She went into major brain surgery to try to remove it and pathology confirms the low grade astrocytoma, and after a month of recovery, the oncologist recommends to start a chemo and radio therapy treatment.As the low grade astrocytoma is treatable and with high long term survival rate, he recommends that we might extracts some ovules if we decide to have another kid in the future, as the chemo had a high chance of infertility. We had one son, and being both on our middle to late 30s, we agreed.We go to her OG for this, and as he is performing an preliminary echography... a heart beat start blasting on the speakers, over two months of his negative blood pregnancy test, after major brain surgery, after major doses of meds of all kinds, she was, indeed, pregnant. We knew exactly when she got pregnant, it was 5 days before that ER visit. She &#34;knew&#34; it that day in the ER, that&#39;s why she asked for the pregnancy test (that, once again, came negative).She decided to have the baby, no matter what the risk for her it was, no matter what risk for the baby it was. Chemo was out the question and radio treatment was a high risk and had to wait for at least another month. 6 months later we had a healthy baby, who is now a healthy 10 year old girl.Sadly, some months after given birth to her, my wife had a relapse, the brain tumor came back, this time as GBM, a month after the girl second birthday, she passed away.Life found a way, tho, and my wife never had any remorse of the decisions we made and she would be proud of what her sons are coming to be"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Several years ago my wife and I agreed we&#39;d actively start making a baby and quit contraceptives. She was on the pill (progestogen-only) and we&#39;d been using it for the better part of three years. Worked fine, she took it religiously at the same time every day.So we agreed to quit, and the next day she comes to me, awkwardly, saying &#34;It worked!&#34; half-jokingly. I stared at the pregnancy test, positive and unambiguous as ever. At the second test, too.Turns out she&#39;d been already pregnant for almost a month. That kind of contraceptive is only 99% effective. Our daughter was born eight months later.Safe to say, the missing percentage is warranted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wife and I had an unlikely pregnancy ourselves.  We tried for possibly 8 years with no luck, finally we gave in and started the process to do in vitro with entailed lots of tests and everything.  Then, the day before we were scheduled to start the process (during xmas no less) and lay down a lot of $$$ for the procedure, wife takes a pregnancy test and shockingly, it indicates positive.  Kid was born healthy and happy.  I hesitate to call him some kind of xmas miracle kid, but I mean.. the context and everything really drove the point home.  :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve spent a long time with folding bikes over the years. My advice: bite the bullet and buy a Brompton[1].Yes, Bromptons are expensive.  But they ride like a bicycle, have gears, a stiff enough frame, luggage racks etc.  There&#39;s very little compromise.  The fastest I&#39;ve done on mine is 45 kph and I&#39;ve ridden 70km in a day. I carry it on and off buses and trains multiple times a day without issue.In the past I had an A-bike[2].  It&#39;s a fun and cute little design but the wheels are absolutely tiny and has no gears.  You feel like you&#39;re riding a folding contraption rather than a bicycle. The build quality was rather plasticky too.  I like the idea of an A-shape with telescoping tubes. It&#39;s quite an ingenious fold.I&#39;ve also ridden (but not owned) a Pacific CarryMe[3].  The ride experience again suffers for the short wheels and no gears, but it could be useful for some.  The fold still leaves you with quite a long package.I&#39;d love to try the Kwiggle bike.  I don&#39;t think the strange seat will cause as many problems as people think, but I suspect the overall ride experience to be a bit bouncy and flexy. Maybe it&#39;s worth it for the small fold.For a more out-there design I think the Halbrad/Half-Bike[4] could be quite nice but it never really got past the prototype stage.  Under-seat steering is a bit of an adjustment too.[1] https://www.brompton.com/[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-bike[3] https://pacificcarryme.com/[4] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQIC138vmlE"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thank you for having us here to discuss Kwiggle. I am the inventor and owner of Kwiggle and would like to give you some insights:We have been developing Kwiggle for 10 years and producing Kwiggle for almost 3 years.Every detail has been carefully designed to create a 10kg lightweight folding bike that can even be folded into hand luggage and still go as fast as a normal bike. We have selected materials and manufacturing processes for the drive unit and rims with the highest wear resistance in the bicycle market. We use high-strength aluminum and stainless steel parts for the frame and have extensively tested the stability of the frame and drive unit dynamically and statically.Our 35 suppliers for material, components and parts manufacture according to our requirements with highest precision, because precision is another important factor for stable and durable components of a folding bike.In the meantime, our greatest motivation is the many enthusiastic feedbacks from our many customers, who at the moment still come mainly from Germany. We are already shipping the Kwiggle all over the world and Kwiggle already is ridden on every continent.So we are happy if you take a close look. Please assume that we have already thought about almost every little critical detail that is discussed.So if you are looking for a very compact folding bike, feel free to take a close look.The movement on the Kwiggle is new, but very close to your natural walk. And when even a 85-year-old man writes to us, &#34;I can only do two things: ride a rollator and ride a Kwiggle, but I enjoy the Kwiggle more.&#34; Then you can assume that you can ride the Kwiggle very well, too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It looks absolutely amazing, but calling it &#34;affordable&#34; at €1600+ is a stretch. You can find non-electric folding bikes for under €200 that are quite sturdy and dependable (although not that small when folded).A few months ago I bought a used folding bike for €100, equipped it with a motor and battery that cost less than €400, for use on train trips.Nothing feels better than getting out of a long-distance train trip, unfolding your bike and going about your way in a different city... No taxis, no complex public transport map to understand, nothing but freedom."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The comments on this thread seem to be quite wildly missing White&#39;s point. Many of the arguments taking place here seem premised on the idea that Ken White has attempted to solve, once and for all, the &#34;cancel culture&#34; problem --- or somehow write a dispositive argument that &#34;cancel culture&#34; isn&#39;t real.He&#39;s not doing any of these things. He&#39;s responding to a specific NYT staff editorial.White agrees with many of you that disproportionate responses to speech happen, are harmful, and are occurring regularly. He cites several instances, from both sides of the American political spectrum. You don&#39;t have to come up with an elaborate argument about how White is wrong about how harmful &#34;cancel culture&#34; is; White almost certainly agrees with you (at least in a general sense; maybe not in your particulars).His point is that you have to discuss something more particular than &#34;the right to speak your mind without fear of shame or shunning&#34;. You&#39;ve never had that right. You can&#39;t have it. To be free of shame or shunning is to be free of other people&#39;s speech. If you&#39;re saying something provocative, you are almost certainly responding in a sense to something someone else said; if you think you have the right to speak without shame or shunning, so does the person you&#39;re effectively responding to. At best, you&#39;re arguing for what White has in the past mockingly referred to as a &#34;replevin of feels&#34;; at worst, what you&#39;re asking for is totally incoherent.This Substack post would be bigger news if Ken White had, Solomonically, worked out the whole problem of disproportionate responses to speech. He has not, and I think he&#39;s probably much too smart to try. He&#39;s just critiquing someone else&#39;s bad argument. That&#39;s all you really have to engage with here; you don&#39;t have to let cortisol trick you into believing this is an amassing of the forces of &#34;cancel culture isn&#39;t real&#34; that you must mobilize against."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;&#34;Our failure to have a serious discussion about defining “cancel culture” encourages this. When some people vaguely complain about “cancel culture” in a way that lends itself to promoting this constant partisanship, other people not unreasonably see it as partisan.&#34;Popehat seems to be falling into the trap of thinking the precisely defining something will lead to clarity. It rarely, if ever, does. Each one of us has our own conception of a term - wordfeel, if you will - and virtually no one actually knows or holds to the literal dictionary definition. We hear words and apply them if they seem right to us. Even if you managed to precisely define cancel culture, people would easily try to claim that some alleged cancelling event it is actually something else, &#34;accountability&#34;, &#34;showing you the door&#34;, etc.. Never underestimate someone&#39;s ability to lawyerly redefine what something is or isn&#39;t.Additionally, I think Popehat is dead wrong here:&gt;&#34;Saying we should “end cancel culture” means we’re saying some people should refrain from some exercises of speech and association to promote other people feeling more free to speak.&#34;No rights are actually being infringed by this. It is possible to have cultural mores that are in the spirit of free speech. The opposite stance, not calling on people to end cancel culture, is also accepting a reduction in speech. Even so, by Popehat&#39;s own worldview, because the government is not restricting cancel culture this shouldn&#39;t be seen as some infringement of liberty.  I don&#39;t know what Popehat actually wants here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with the debate on &#34;cancel culture&#34; is a lack of specificity. The fact is that there are certain occasions where &#34;canceling&#34; seems fine, and others, where it does not. And I think a problem with the progressive argument is the refusal to acknowledge that there can ever be any excesses.For example, there is the case of Dorian Abbot, who was disinvited from an MIT lecture after he wrote an op-ed criticizing affirmative action [1], even though the MIT lecture had nothing to do with affirmative action. I just don&#39;t see how allowing him to speak about climate science significantly impinges on the free speech of the members of the MIT community who found his views objectionable. I think it&#39;s also significant that 73% of the US population agrees with Abbot (I support affirmative action for the record). Basically the message that I get from MIT&#39;s behavior is that if you have a thoroughly mainstream opinion, you better not mention it in public if you want to have a successful academic career. This is chilling for science. If I were still a practicing social scientist, I wouldn&#39;t touch any hot button social issue with a ten foot pole. Or at least not if I wasn&#39;t prepared to p-hack a socially acceptable result.I also think that shutting out views that you disagree with is terrible for personal intellectual development. Only hearing views that correspond to your priors is a recipe for group-think and intellectual laziness. I make a point of trying to read a wide range of opinions (National Review to Jacobin) because I believe having my ideas challenged makes them stronger. I don&#39;t see how you can have an informed opinion about anything without doing the same.Lastly, if the polls that nytimes cite are true, &#34;cancel culture&#34; is a huge political mistake for progressive. It risks making the democratic brand toxic so that electoral victory, and any real change is impossible.[1] https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/us/dorian-abbot-mit.html"</p>

Meaning they can send me through screen after screen trying to convince me to stay (dark pattern) or even worse forcing me to call to cancel.As a user, if you want to offer this fine. But as long as the ability to subscribe through Google or Apple is not removed I will be fine.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For people wondering about how they get access to these systems, it feels like they use the weakest human link in the chain.I checked their telegram group and I can see that they specifically recruit people with access to VPNs/internal support systems. This okta breach seems to have happened through similar means. The group has made specific calls for access to gaming companies, hosting providers, telcos, call centers, and bpm providers. They offer payment.It doesn’t feel difficult to see how some overworked, underpaid support agent (or even a well paid disgruntled one) might decide to go with this. Just takes 1 well placed agent to give creds and this group has access to a huge attack surface instantly. This might sound like an overreaction, but corporations in the future might need to make least privilege access and access logging everything a priority from day 1.https://t.me/minsaudebr/162 (Link to the recruitment message)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"And this explains how the LAPSUS hacker group was able to breach Microsoft, NVIDIA, and countless others. Apparently, they have been inside of OKTA systems for nearly 2 months now.[1] https://www.theregister.com/2022/03/21/microsoft_lapsus_brea...[2] https://www.wired.com/story/lapsus-hacking-group-extortion-n...[3] https://analyticsindiamag.com/lapsus-hack-leaves-nvidia-in-a..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"And this is why I would ultimately never trust a centralised company with our authentication infrastructure: because something like Okta is an infinitely more attractive target than we are. Their offering is sweet, and I’m always tempted to just give in, but this confirms me in my decision."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wonder how much of this is part of a genuine attempt to bring a safe product to market, and how much is to pressure the German government (and soon thereafter, the EU) into making this sort of promise mandatory for all car manufacturers, including those that are ahead of Mercedes in the self-driving space. I.e. to create a legislative moat in an area where they&#39;re behind.While I don&#39;t agree with Tesla&#39;s strategy of playing it fast &amp; loose, I&#39;m afraid that risk aversion will lead us to demand perfect instead of the good enough.A car manufacturer might not be willing to accept 100% liability, but their system might still be a lot safer than a drunk driver returning home from the bar.Realistically we&#39;re not going to be able to pick &#34;well, don&#39;t drive drunk then!&#34;, it&#39;ll happen. By demanding that these system are that reliable before they&#39;re in common operation we&#39;ll have incurred a net loss in terms of safety.I don&#39;t know what the right solution is, probably some mixture of the two. Clearly you don&#39;t want manufacturers to be incentivized to ignore the risk associated with their systems, but you also don&#39;t want these systems not to be offered when they&#39;d be a net gain in safety.The point at which they&#39;re a net gain is not the same point that they become financially viable to the manufacturer from a liability point of view."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Handing over driving responsibility completely requires extremely particular circumstances. Right now, Drive Pilot can only engage at speeds under 40 mph (60 km/h in Germany) on limited-access divided highways with no stoplights, roundabouts, or other traffic control systems, and no construction zones...The system will only operate during daytime, in reasonably clear weather, without overhead obstructions. Inclement weather, construction zones, tunnels, and emergency vehicles will all trigger a handover warning.Those are some big caveats that mean that you won&#39;t be able to use this in most situations.  It is basically only good for stop and go highway traffic which is a situation that other driver assist features handle pretty well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Mercedes is perhaps the only auto company that is both supremely innovative and supremely respectable at the same time.Tesla is innovative, but they get ahead of themselves, and Musk is a glorified internet troll who bullies and arguably lies.The Big 3 are respectable in that they don’t really overhype or misrepresent, but Mercedes will probably out-innovate them in self-driving like they’ve out-innovated them (and pretty much everyone else) in just about every other aspect that matters over the past century.Disclaimer: I drive a Toyota Sienna and a Subaru Outback. But I’ve seen a few Mercedes up close (and sometimes driven them) over the years. The only really crappy one in my experience was the ~2006 G500."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m very sorry to hear that.You need to consult with a lawyer to decide the way to go from here. He/she can tell you what your odds of winning are, and what the best strategy is. As someone not emotionally involved with the case, and having access to all the details, an impartial person is the best one to trust. I don&#39;t think you should see this case as revenge or closure for the death of your son, because you will be disappointed one way or another. You also don&#39;t have the personal responsibility to fix the failings of such a huge company.Personally, the only advice I can give you is that the way you are living is unhealthy. It is an unimaginable tragedy what happened to you, but you have to somehow gather the strength to rebuild your life again. Your reaction is understandable. However, try to think of the way forward as much as possible. You are likely relatively young, and you have the possibility to start over. There is no way to change the past, only the future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They offered to settle because they&#39;ve been forced to pay out for similar cases before. Just last year, Republic Services (who is almost certainly who you&#39;re referring to, if not WM, but RSC is closer to $40B) was found responsible in a similar case in Nevada and the mother was awarded $38 million by the jury: https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-las-vegas/jury-awa...It doesn&#39;t bring your child back, but working with an accident attorney who is compassionate and may be able to wage the battle without too much direct involvement from you may get you more of what you feel is justice in this case.I&#39;m so deeply sorry for your loss, by the way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I stopped working so that I can go to the cemetery to stay with my son everyday. It&#39;s been almost two years.Hey, this is quite concerning. The pain must be unimaginable. And the atmosphere around you (understandably) is also not in a position to help themselves, let alone help others. But, if you do read this, please, get help. Somehow, someway. There is always a solution.This is a good first step. Seek for help like you sought help here, friend. Best of luck."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My company runs without containers. We process petabytes of data monthly, thousands of CPU cores, hundreds of different types of data pipelines running continously, etc etc. Definitely a distributed system with lots of applications and databases.We use Nix for reproducible builds and deployments. Containers only give reproducible deployments, not builds, so they would be a step down. The reason that&#39;s important is that it frees us from troubleshooting &#34;works on my machine&#34; issues, or from someone pushing an update somewhere and breaking our build. That&#39;s not important to everyone if they have few dependencies that don&#39;t change often, but for an internet company, the trend is accelerating towards bigger and more complex dependency graphs.Kubernetes has mostly focused on stateless applications so far. That&#39;s the easy part! The hard part is managing databases. We don&#39;t use Kubernetes, but there&#39;s little attraction because it would be addressing something that&#39;s already effortless for us to manage.What works for us is to do the simplest thing that works, then iterate. I remember being really intimidated about all the big data technologies coming out a decade ago, thinking they are so complex that they must know what they&#39;re doing! But I&#39;d so often dive in to understand the details and be disillusioned about how much complexity there is for relatively little benefit. I was in a sort of paralysis of what we&#39;d do after we outgrew postgresql, and never found a good answer. Here we are years later, with a dozen+ postgresql databases, some measuring up to 30 terabytes each, and it&#39;s still the best solution for us.Perhaps I&#39;ve read too far into the intent of the question, but maybe you can afford to drop the research project into containers and kubernetes, and do something simple that works for now, and get back to focusing on product?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at WhatsApp, prior to moving to Facebook infra, we had some jails for specific things, but mostly ran without containers.Stack looked like:FreeBSD on bare metal servers (host service provided a base image, our shell script would fetch source, apply patches, install a small handful of dependencies, make world, manage system users, etc)OTP/BEAM (Erlang) installed via rsync etc from build machineApplication code rsynced and started via Makefile scriptsNot a whole lot else. Lighttpd and php for www. Jails for stud (a tls terminator, popular fork is called hitch) and ffmpeg (until end to end encrypted media made server transcoding unpossible).No virtualized servers (I ran a freebsd vm on my laptop for dev work, though).When WA moved to Facebook infra, it made sense to use their deployment methodology for the base system (Linux containers), for organizational reasons. There was no consideration for which methodology was technically superior; both are sufficient, but running a very different methodology inside a system that was designed for everyone to use one methodology is a recipie for operational headaches and difficulty getting things diagnosed and fixed as it&#39;s so tempting to jump to the conclusion that any problem found on a different setup is because of the difference and not a latent problem. We had enough differences without requiring a different OS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Grooveshark didn&#39;t use any of that. We were very careful about avoiding dependencies where possible and keeping our backend code clean and performant. We supported about 45M MAU at our biggest, with only a handful of physical servers. I&#39;m not aware of any blog posts we made detailing any of this, though. And if you&#39;re not familiar with the saga, Grooveshark went under for legal, not technical reasons. The backend API was powered by nginx, PHP, MySQL, memcache, with a realtime messaging server built in Go. We used Redis and Mongodb for some niche things, had serious issues with both which is understandable because they were both immature at the time, but Mongodb&#39;s data loss problems were bad enough that I would still not use them today.That said, I&#39;m using Docker for my current side project. Even if it never runs at scale, I just don&#39;t want to have to muck around with system administration, not to mention how nice it is to have dev and prod be identical."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Never start coding (making a solution) unless you fully understand the problem.While I agree with this in general, I find that to reall fully understand a problem, I need to attempt to code, or at least formulate, a solution to it.a) because when I break down a problem into its code-able component parts, I learn a lot about itb) because in the process of then actually implementing these parts I often discover edge cases or undefined cases (especially in naturally grown business-logic)c) because what the problem actually IS, is often not that clear at the start of the problem. Yes, in an ideal world, changing requirements would wait until the next version, however, sadly that&#39;s not what happens in the wild."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s one more from me: count your liabilities.1. Code is a liability. No code? No bugs. The best commit is one that removes unnecessary code. This includes dependencies.2. State is a liability. Multipliers for: hidden or non-obvious state, shared state, externally (by actors you don&#39;t control) accessible state, concurrently accessed/mutated state. Often the worst offenders are environment settings/configuration, such as Windows Registry, environment variables, installed dependencies, daemon services, etc, scoring full points.3. All publicly observable behavior is a liability. Also known as Hyrum&#39;s Law: &#34;all observable behaviors of your system will be depended on by somebody&#34;, or https://xkcd.com/1172/. Huge multiplier for systems with a long expected lifespan, and another huge one if you guarantee backwards compatibility to paying customers. Program under this assumption, and if you can hide or control your internal behavior, do it. E.g.: maybe don&#39;t output results reliant on a HashSet order - sort them.None of these are hard &#39;rules&#39;. Often the liability is necessary, or worth the saved effort or gained feature. But be aware of them, and minimize them where possible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Listing Performance as the lowest value bugs me. I understand that most software isn&#39;t performance-critical, you can probably afford to use a garbage collected language for most use-cases. But putting performance last contradicts the high priority of Usability in the list, because Usability strongly depends on performance.Your product might still work if it has a second of lag after every operation, but I won&#39;t want to use it. And if there aren&#39;t any decent alternatives, I am going to experience irritation and sadness on a continuous basis.Jonathan Blow said[0] (5 minute interview) that software authors have an ethical responsibility towards their users. How many people use YouTube, or Windows? The time wasted might be small on an individual scale, say a minute a day, but multiply it by a billion people (eg. YouTube or Windows) and that&#39;s 16 million man-hours per year.I&#39;d argue the same responsibility exists just as strongly even if you have one user! Do you want to frustrate her, constantly waste her time? Of course not! She is not going to be very happy with you if you do that :)[0] Jonathan Blow on Success and Ethics in Software Development https://youtube.com/watch?v=k8gIJOy0c2g"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The report points out (Image 8) design choices that contributed to a raging fire, once the fire started:* no emergency electricity cut-off device, an &#34;economic strategy choice of the site operator&#34; - the electrical room where the fire started was hot, 400C at the door (measured by thermal camera), with meter long electrical arcing from the door, thundering deafening sounds. Making access of utility technicians &#34;difficult&#34; - it took them 2 hours to cut incoming electrical service from the utility. On site UPS devices also had no cut-off, so they kept supplying.* emergency water network provided only 70m3/h at the site. A firefighting boat arrived, Europa 1, was called, supplying 14.5m3/min max flow rate.The freeflowing air cooling design, a good design choice as it saves on operating costs for cooling, contributed to nourishing the fire."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a great thing for startups that OVH provides servers at such an amazing low cost. Yes, there is always a risk that someone will make a mistake in the building design. There&#39;s a chance that eliminating some redundancies increases the possibility of a failure. There&#39;s always a chance that something bad will go wrong.However, this isn&#39;t just a matter of Hanlon&#39;s razor (incompetence vs malice), but more of a matter of an intelligent guesstimate of risk versus a lack of knowledge in some areas (wasn&#39;t this OVH&#39;s very first datacenter?), and a strong focus on reducing costs. Perhaps the latter went too far, and definitely some obvious mistakes were made by not having a universal power cut off of some sort, but dealing with the amount of power on tap in a datacenter is always dangerous, even when there is no fire at all.I&#39;m not saying we need to give OVH a complete pass on this. I&#39;m just saying that there are a lot of extenuating circumstances and, except for the power cut off, it&#39;s not clear that OVH made any choices due to extreme negligence or cost-cutting. In other words, they didn&#39;t do anything immoral. At worst, it appears that (even from the most anti-OVH party here), this was just a mistake in the design of a new (at the time) style of datacenter, and it did work properly for many years before there was a problem. Making a mistake is not immoral."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For anyone interested, I maintained a server within the affected DC.OVH provided 3x the price of the service for the downtime. But for the recovery we needed to buy a new server from them as our backups were only accesible from dedicated machines...
At the end we basically received 2x the price of the server when discounting the temp machine. 
Communication during the downtime was not bad from OVH side, taking into account the huge amount of affected servers.
At the end, as a small customer I cant do or ask for much more. As it&#39;s not worth neither the money or the time. 
IMHO, 3x is not covering any business loses for anyone. We got our own backups within the OVH network and it took 3 additional  days to be able to access them as the network was a mess after the fire. That for some business is going to be a huge sum."</p>

Their main users are people who build games for phones and indies, with basically zero usage in the AAA space. And Unity&#39;s performance/stability is still not that great afaik.It seems to me that they are trying to prove that they are a serious &#39;AAA&#39; engine, but these demos aren&#39;t that convincing to me - AAA is a lot more than putting fancy shaders on high-poly models, it&#39;s about handling huge amounts of objects in a dynamics situation, displaying large worlds via streaming, having a workflow that accommodates every creative professional, and offering great performance and visuals  even on very complex scenes.I&#39;ve hear that even these highly impressive demos are fake - they built a ton of custom code for each one they rebuild core Unity features, meaning if you wanted to replicate this for yourself, you&#39;d be in for a ton of development.Comparatively UE5&#39;s Nanite demo showed off a tech that&#39;s ready to go for production."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is indeed rendered in realtime, but one thing to note is it&#39;s a &#34;4D&#34; capture, more-or-less meaning each frame of the animation is its own asset. This makes it possible to reproduce subtle physics like the lips sticking together slightly when the actor opens her mouth. The amount of storage space, alone, makes this impractical for anything other than demos. Unity claims they will be able to achieve this level of fidelity using a deep learning-based compression that will allow stuff like this to appear in game cutscenes, but all the movements will still be pre-baked. The only interaction possible will be moving the camera. At that point the technology will be very useful, but it&#39;s still a ways away from having such a realistic character that can react to you dynamically.(Though whether that&#39;s just a couple years of software technology progress, or a decade+ for hardware progress, who can say?)"</p>

Looks like a reasonable degree of evolution, but as they start to get up toward turn-of-the-century movie CGI in games, now you run into the same issues that you see in mocap for movies--including that a lot of details of an actor&#39;s expressions and movements actually aren&#39;t captured, so you have to have animators go back and laboriously add all those lost details back in to have something that looks convincing.(Mind, I say turn-of-the-century, but man, the fundamental techniques for rendering skin convincingly have come a long way, even in current game engines.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Built-in unit types are underrated. F# has them. Other languages should seriously consider adding them, despite the fact that feature bloat is a serious language problem and they&#39;re relatively niche: they are that useful, and I honestly don&#39;t think they would interfere much with other features.Something like:    unit type Meters = m
    unit type Seconds = s

    function sleep(time: Int[s]): void

    val speed = 5.4 m/s // Type = Float[m/s]
    val distance = parseFloat(prompt(&#39;enter time&#39;)) * 1 m // Convert unitless to meters just by multiplying
    val time = distance / speed // Type = Float[s]
    print(&#34;${time}&#34;) // Prints &#34;# s&#34;
    print(&#34;${time / 1 s} seconds&#34;) // Prints &#34;# seconds&#34;

    val complexUnit = 7 * 1 lbf/in2 // 7 lbf/in2
    // != 7 psi (too hard to infer) but you can write a converter function
    function toPsi&lt;N : Numeral&gt;(value: N[lbf/in2]): N[psi] {
        return value * 1 psi*in2/lbf
    }

It requires extending number parsing, type parsing (if the brackets aren&#39;t already part e.g. in TypeScript), and extending types to support units of measurement at least if they are statically known to be subtypes of `Numeral`.Naming variables with their units doesn&#39;t solve the issue of mis-casting and using units incorrectly, and newtypes are too inconvenient (and sometimes impossible without affecting performance) so nobody uses them. Even as a very software-focused programmer I encounter units like seconds, bytes, pixels, etc. all the time, they are almost never newtypes, and I get bugs from forgetting to convert or converting incorrectly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to work at a company with two database fields, speed_kmph.The documentation read &#34;speed_kmph - This field contains the travelling speed in MILES PER HOUR - please do not be confused by the name&#34;.Woo, great job guys."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Java and Kotlin have a nice Duration class. So in Kotlin you can do  delay(duration = Duration.ofMinutes(minutes = 1))

which is equivalent to  delay(timeMillis = 60_000)

Using the optional argument names here for clarity; you don&#39;t have to of course.Sticking with the JVM, a frequent source of confusion is the epoch. Is it in millis or in seconds? With 32 bit integers that has to be seconds (which will set you up for the year 2038 problem). However, Java always used 64 bit longs for tracking the epoch in milliseconds instead even before the year 2000 problem was still a thing. Knowing which you are dealing with is kind of relevant in a lot of places; especially when interfacing with code or APIs written in other languages with more 32 bit legacy.Things like network timeouts are usually in milliseconds. But how do you know this for sure? Specifying, them in seconds means that there&#39;s less risk of forgetting a 0 or something like that. So, using seconds is pretty common too. You can&#39;t just blindly assume one or the other. Even if you use the Duration class above, you&#39;d still want to put the magic number it takes as a parameter in some configuration property or constant. Those need good names too and they should include the unit."</p>

The goal is to solve some problem.Everything that I have to do to solve that problem is an unfortunate (but inevitable) reality.  But let&#39;s be clear: the goal is to minimize as close to zero, how much time you have to spend doing these things.CSS, like all code, is a total liability. I want to spend as little time designing and writing it as possible. Which is why I hate CSS: it demands you know the exact current and future (hahahaha) structure of your webpage. `!important` is not some panacea, but I cackle at the ignorance of suggesting that the user is wrong for misusing it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My experience is very similar. I tried the first iterations of Gnome 3 and was very disappointed.At some point I tried Windows+WSL but that was a complete disaster.A couple of years ago I decided to try Fedora+Gnome+Wayland. It is an outstanding experience. Everything is smooth, the UI is beautiful. Now with PipeWire and Libadwaita things are getting even better. After some stagnation, the Linux desktop is gaining momentum again.There are a lot of hate comments for Gnome in this post. My advice for those reading is: Try it for yourself! Most of the haters haven&#39;t used Gnome since 2004. Just try it!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is unfortunate that so many of the early comments are negative. Either Wayland is the future, or something that learns from Wayland&#39;s mistakes and leverages its ideas is. There is a really fertile field right now for experimentation in the world of compositors but I think people have been scared away by the long dark era of X Windows + binary graphics drivers. Maybe we&#39;re going to see a lot more of it on HN in the next decade?What kept me off Wayland was the screenshots thing, but the argument in favour of the idea is strong. The downside is Wayland&#39;s conception of permissions and interactions is too basic and crippled adoption for a few years but the fundamentals (blocking cross-application snooping) is going to be necessary. Operating systems have to be less trusting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had to go back to GNOME on Xorg. GNOME on Wayland won&#39;t run my 4k display at a consistent 60Hz, which results in horrible issues in games and emulators, as well as massive numbers of dropped frames in 50/60Hz videos. It is set to run at 60Hz in the display settings, but actually seems to run somewhere in the 50s.The easiest way to see this is checking the &#34;stats for nerds&#34; while watching a 60fps YouTube video and noting the persistent dropped frames. glxgears also doesn&#39;t maintain a consistent framerate.This doesn&#39;t happen in Sway, so I can only assume there is some bug in Mutter that has persisted across several versions of GNOME and Fedora. So Wayland might be great, but my experience with GNOME on it has not been."</p>

Riders pay a subscription for the scooter and access to the battery kiosk.Seems like a really great option.  I would love to have that in my city.  We have dockless bicycles and scooters but a more capable and personal option would be awesome.  I&#39;d sign up in a heartbeat.Sadly my city planners do not seem aware of motorcycles as a transportation option.  We have no laws or infrastructure to encourage them or take advantage of the benefits.  At a state level we at least get to cut ferry lines, but that seems to be the only perk."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder if the electric car market (i.e. Tesla) is ripe for disruption.I read the article and thought back to the demo [1] Tesla did years ago of automated battery swap.  Tesla did it as a stunt; they publicly stated that they didn&#39;t plan to market that.As a Tesla owner, I don&#39;t want battery swap as long as I am paying for the battery as part of the price of the car.  I&#39;d be worried that my brand new max-range battery would be swapped with old worn-out batteries, and I would feel like I lost value.However, on road trips, I would much prefer a 5-10 minute battery swap over supercharging (which they no longer give me for free).  The electric car experience would essentially be the same as the IC experience.If Tesla (or someone) sold me a car without a battery, and I had to buy a battery &#34;subscription&#34;, I might go for that.  I&#39;d get a huge discount off the base price of the car, and now I wouldn&#39;t be concerned about swapping since it&#39;s not my battery.  I&#39;d do my normal day-to-day as usual, and on road trips or unexpected usage, I could swap out in minutes.  I could get on board with that.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5V0vL3nnHY

This lets me easily see the order of operations in a distributed system."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using Meld since years ago, and it&#39;s my default go-to diff viewer. The visual style they implemented helps me a lot to reason about how lines have been added or deleted from documents in the side by side comparison. Very neat!The directory contents tree diff is also really useful.I wish they made it even easier the basic case of comparing aribtrary text. Maybe it should be the default mode after opening the program, instead of having to click on a couple buttons, because I use it a lot to manually paste pieces of text. For example, logs from a server during testing, to compare what went different between runs.Another welcomed addition would be &#34;ignore masks&#34;. Some kind of regex input that could be used to quickly tell Meld which parts of the text to skip comparing. That way, comparison of log files could be made where a timestamps column would be ignored."</p>

I suppose they always made it clear that they were not going to let their investment in Starlink stop them launching competitors constellations.I am still somewhat surprised by the UK governments investment in OneWeb, I hope the strategy pays off and it becomes an important national infrastructure project. My thoughts where that it may be about providing a future proof network for the remote areas of the UK but we aren&#39;t exactly a big country so I&#39;m not convinced that&#39;s the case.

I had to completely uninstall it, which didn&#39;t really help, because they still kept bringing it back after every update. I assume that they&#39;re going to do this with Teams now.For every egregious user-hostile behavior, you can search and find a ton of forum threads where people discuss at length how to reverse or mitigate them. The fact that Microsoft is aware of this and continues to prioritize this kind of abusive growth hacking over user trust, knowing fully how that impacts the company&#39;s reputation among enthusiasts, is perhaps more damning than the actual practices.Nobody at Microsoft who has decision-making authority actually cares. Contempt for the users is so deep in the DNA that this will never get better. It&#39;s disappointing, because it ultimately undermines all of the great effort that people elsewhere in the company have put into features like WSL that might otherwise make the platform attractive to modern developers.It creates a really adversarial posture between the user and the platform.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article nails a lot of the issues with Windows 11.I bit the bullet and upgraded to Windows 11 late last year thinking it must be an improvement over Windows 10. It turned out to be a big step backwards.- Changing the default browser is a lot of work instead of a single click.- I can&#39;t move the task bar to the side, even though almost every monitor nowadays has much more horizontal space than vertical.- All apps are not readily accessible from the start menu; I have to click another button to get to them.- I have a 2-in-1 laptop, and turning it into tablet mode is wonky.- I can&#39;t choose to not have grouped buttons on the taskbar.- The context menus UX is horrible. Some context menu items are now two clicks away instead of one. Also what&#39;s with the excessive rounded corners and slim selection padding?- The stacked notifications is confusing, and always shows the calendar when I open the notifications panel.- Lots of crap pushed on me, like chat (aka Teams), widgets (which require a Microsoft account), 3rd party apps that look like they&#39;re installed but actually get downloaded/installed on first use.I was able to fix a lot of those issues with ExplorerPatcher [0]. However, one day after a Windows update, Explorer didn&#39;t start at all after login (black screen, I thought Windows was hosed). This has since been fixed.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This menu is familiar to me because that’s what the Windows API allows you to create (as long as you are not creating it through Windows Forms.) There is no dark theme for this, but at least there are rounded corners.That is just a huge WTF. Since the very earliest versions of Windows there has always been the option of a dark (or white, or rainbow, or ...) theme, where you could adjust the colours and sizes and fonts, and everything using Win32 would follow it. Here&#39;s Win95 example:https://64.media.tumblr.com/6d3e8c64cd9a38e70d24c0b1b2c73cb5...Yet if I&#39;m understanding correctly, in Win11 that stopped working completely? It really sounds like the Windows team has no one left who knows what used to be possible but isn&#39;t anymore, being replaced with probably younger developers making constant excuses to &#34;modernise&#34; by rewriting and breaking stuff. To use an analogy, they&#39;re not just reinventing the wheel but making it square."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Having lived in Shanghai during 2005-2012 and seeing the construction boom there, I noticed some differences immediately after arriving in the US. It&#39;s common to hear about transportation projects taking decades to expand a few stations here. Mean while, since the time I left the Shanghai subway station has opened 21 new lines composed of 516 stations.Certainly, the air/water was worse in China but workers also had to work much harder (later nights, weekends, etc). But perhaps most importantly, the government would waste no time in getting land that it needed, and it certainly wouldn&#39;t ask for your consideration if it needs to do construction on a Saturday morning.While I appreciate that there is an inherent trade off between environmental consideration and speed, I think the author makes it clear that it&#39;s reached comic proportions in the US. The article is short, but I think the main premise is overwhelmingly accurate: The system exists to protect the status quo.There&#39;s also the reliance of transportation agencies on consultants:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m trying to build a house on empty land in Los Angeles. It’s about 15mins from downtown in Mt Washington. We bought the land in April of 2019 and started on the design and permitting process immediately. Despite it being in populated Los Angeles, we need a septic system, to widen the road and add curbs, move a power pole, relocate 3 trees, and extend a water line. We won’t have gas as we want to go all solar. All of this the city is making us pay for.Our permit for a small septic system took 14 months to approve.The power department has told us it will likely take 12 months for them to approve the pole movement (the city is making us move it as part of the road widening).The water main needs to be extended 12 feet, and it’s mandated that the utility company must do that work and it will cost us $75k.The tree permit took us 12 months to get and requires us to get a bond too.We still haven’t got approval for the road widening, it’s been almost 18 months. Keep in mind this is just the road in front of our house in a residential area of Los Angeles. There are lots of homes on our street already.I’m originally from Australia. The American bureaucracy is insane. The agencies don’t talk to each other. Often times we have been acting as the go between for different departments that worked in the same building!Los Angeles has a huge housing shortage. If my experience is anything to go by, it’s because the bureaucracy is so dense it takes years to just get the permits in place. It would be cheaper and better if I could just pay a bribe and get it done quickly.Americans seem to know what the problem is, but just accept that nothing can be done about it. Like you all know the DMV sucks and the USPS sucks, but everyone has just accepted that’s it’s just the way it is and decided to live with it. Why?! Hold your officials accountable to actually run government effectively."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For public transit in particular, the US has billionaires and politicans who actively campaign against such projects [1]. The effect of this cannot be overstated. People buy into the propaganda that their taxes will go up and/or it will bring crime to their idyllic locales (where otherwise property prices keep the riffraff out).Landowners in the US have very successfullly voted in measures that limit further construction (including higher density housing and public transit systems) and increase the value of their holdings.I&#39;ve mentioned housing here because it directly impacts a lot of potential construction, particularly public transport. You cannot build anything other than single-family homes in much of the US. This lowers population density and makes public transport less viable. It also diverts tax revenue to build infrastructure for the required cars: highways, parking lots, etc.There are a lot of local problems here too eg NYC&#39;s scaffolding laws [2], corruption in NYC construction projects [3] and CEQA in California [4].[1]: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/climate/koch-brothers-pub...[2]: https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/east/2020/10/08/585902...[3]: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/nyregion/new-york-subway-...[4]: https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/03/signature-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Higher education in the US is trying to fulfill so many roles it&#39;s unsustainable.    - teaching marketable skills so people can get jobs
    - teaching &#34;how to think&#34; and learning about art and culture
    - Performing cutting edge research
    - minor league sports teams

The large state schools are trying to fulfill all these conflicting roles. We should probably break them out to separate entities.If you have a physicist who&#39;s at the leading edge of research in their field, you want them doing that research, not teaching 18 year old&#39;s Newton&#39;s laws of motion. And they&#39;re mostly not doing that teaching, that gets farmed out to an adjunct paid starvation wages. So the kid who&#39;s paying through the nose to attend a top university with the best researchers doesn&#39;t get to interact with them much and gets an inferior education compared to one where they hired and properly compensated someone to actually focus on teaching.If we want to train people for specific jobs - create institutions that do that. If the upper class want someplace to send their kids to read poetry and binge drink for 4 years before they get a jr. associate position at their Dad&#39;s investment bank, create a separate institution for that. Major league sports should create and manage their own feeder leagues to develop players, no reason to cram that into a university. We should create dedicated research institutions so researchers don&#39;t have to pretend to care about teaching."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sam Altman makes a lot of grandiose predictions and statements.For example, in 2019 he said “Human radiologists are already much worse than computer radiologists. If I had to pick a human or an AI to read my scan, I’d pick the AI.” [0] However, most people with domain knowledge in this space still would not want their scan not to be read by a human. The AI radiology apps are generally narrowly focused and useful for consultation not diagnosis. [1]In 2015 he predicted: “Self-driving cars are going to get here much faster than people think,” Altman said. He thought we’d see them in three to four years. [2]I think he would be wise to learn from Bill Gates that it&#39;s a bad idea to over-predict what will happen in the short term. &#34;We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next ten.&#34;I&#39;ll add to this that it&#39;s generally a bad idea to make big predictions outside of areas that you have strong domain knowledge in. I doubt Sam Altman has strong domain knowledge around US higher education. Unfortunately, Silicon Valley culture is full of people who feel that because they&#39;ve succeeded in one domain they have some kind of hidden insight into others.[0] https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/26/sam-altman-on-ai-jobs-may-go...[1] https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00330-020-07230-9[2] https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/06/elon-musk-sam-altman-say-s..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the writing on the wall is clear regarding student loans.The entire notion of taxpayer funded student loans is a scam on both taxpayers and students.  It’s a system that allows the colleges/universities to charge any tuition they want and guarantees there will be an artificial demand.For about a decade at least 1M student loan holders default per year. Long before the defaults reached that high, everyone involved knew that student loans were far outpacing the economic value, and yet not a single college or university stepped up in goodfaith to blow the whistle, they continued to suckle at the tit to the detriment of their own students.Education is supposed to benefit students and the nation as a whole but the ridiculousness of loans has ensured it ruins lives and at &gt;$1.5T in taxpayer funded debt that continues to grow exponentially it is a detriment to the country.Collapse of student loans will of course have an impact of the college/university landscape, but the industry as a whole will not collapse, rather tuition will “collapse”, or come down, to what students can actually afford out of pocket without going into debt.  And if the universities/colleges somehow can’t survive on existing taxpayers subsidies from the Dept. of Educations $68B annual budget plus out of pocket tuition rates, then welcome to the real world your university/college is a failed business."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Stormlight Archive (series) by Brandon Sanderson has probably changed my life the most. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve enjoyed a book as much or have had one mean as much to me as I&#39;ve have with this series.The series is incredibly inspirational since despite being a high fantasy novel. In fear of spoiling the plot, I&#39;m being vague: it tracks the stories of (multiple) people who go through difficult life situations and learn to heal from depressive moments while having incredibly, intricate worldbuilding (which is excellent for taking your mind off of reality) and a twisty plot. If you go on the subreddit for this series, r/stormlight_archive, you&#39;ll see people talking about how this book (literally) saved their lives. I can tell you that in the most off-putting moments of life reading inspirational scenes from the Stormlight Archive has helped me stand up again. The messages and themes about life are simple, but also on-point. Overall, an excellent series. I recommend it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a really well written article, one of the best summaries of NAT traversal I have ever read. I started to laugh mid-way, because it&#39;s amusing (and a bit sad) the lengths we have to go to establish communications using the IPv4 addressing space.It&#39;s good to learn about ICE too. I had&#39;nt thought about the security implications : indeed this whole mess makes it very easy for an unprivileged attacker to trick the endpoints into relaying the traffic to their own gateway. For example, if I understand things well, another user behind the NAT can easily make the NAT device relay the traffic to them by sending probes at the same time. I&#39;m not sure how can this be defended against, and if it&#39;s even possible.Is anyone aware of any interesting reading on the subject of MITM of NAT traversal ?Are there any good software libraries that abstract away all these details"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Modern computing seems to be a story of &#34;worse is better&#34;, and not just the classical &#34;worse is better&#34; of Gabriel&#39;s paper but something that amounts to &#34;worse is better squared&#34;. Gabriel bemoaned the adoption of Unix and C over more &#34;well-thought-out&#34; designs, but Unix and C were at least designed. (&#34;Say what you will, at least it&#39;s an ethos.&#34;) The same could go for TCP/IP&#39;s lean design as opposed to the heavyweight OSI model. But it seems like even these designs are too onerous for the modern day, and instead we build what would normally go on top of Unix or TCP/IP on the Web. All platforms are now the Web platform, which was never designed to run programs and hence is a non-cohesive mess. All networking is now client-server, or indeed is now just HTTP requests: goodbye end-to-end principle (hello NAT!), goodbye protocols other than TCP or UDP. We can build the same things on this platform as we did with native platforms, but we have to do it using kludgy methods which sacrifice a lot of performance and only work 95% of the time: so instead of TCP, we get WebRTC, and instead of assembly we have WebAssembly. And what do we gain? We gain security, and we gain ease of installation (just go to www.zombo.com vs go to zombo.com, click on &#34;Downloads&#34;, click on &#34;Windows x64&#34;, wait 4 minutes for it to download... and so on).Can we do better? I think we can: if operating systems caught on to capability-based security, then the Web platform could become a legacy platform. (We see that phone OSes, which use capability based security, still direct us to &#34;the app&#34; rather than &#34;the site&#34;.) And adoption of IPv6 could void all the kludgy workaround of NAT that we&#39;ve had to develop.But we live in the world we inherit, rather than the one we imagine, so currently all we can do is traverse NATs and write webapps."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Librewolf is not primarily intended as the definite browser but a sane base template for easily customizable and extendable firefox builds.The librewolf AUR package is a great starting point to make custom builds of firefox; between two json files in the settings repo you can tweak basically any relevant setting, bundle extensions (e.g. use custom forked ones without needing to either sign through Mozilla or disable security), search engines, use your own fxa/syncserver, handlers, branding, etc.All in a git repo and you won&#39;t have to redo things next time you reinstall the browser or get a new machine (anyone else ever scratched their heads trying to recall that one about:config setting?)Building and tweaking vanilla firefox yourself is quite an exercise. Librewolf makes it a breeze. The sane privacy-by-default standards is just the cherry on the top.https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/settings"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was one of the two guys who came up with the original concept for Librefox.I was responsible for including uBO as default, among other things.Great to see that the project was brought back to life as LibreWolf - Mozilla lawyers had threatened us with legal action because the name was too close to their brand. They expected us to drop the &#34;Fox&#34; part of the name.Everytime I see LibreWolf on HN I feel proud that the spirit of Librefox is still alive.The biggest issue with LibreWolf and what&#39;s stopping it&#39;s further adoption is lack of auto-updates (especially on Windows) and lack of usability - it should work out of the box for everyone. Currently the security settings are too strict in default mode. There should be different levels of pre-configured security levels users can chose in the settings (i.e. &#34;standard&#34;, &#34;strict&#34;, &#34;very strict&#34;).(I don&#39;t use HN for commenting, which is why I created a throwaway account)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Been using LibreWolf for a week or so since someone mentioned it in a comment elsewhere - UX-wise, it&#39;s pretty much identical to Firefox. I&#39;m happy it doesn&#39;t have Pocket and the rest of Mozilla&#39;s recent product launches arguing for space in my life. My Firefox setup was already pretty solidly &#34;paranoid/misanthropic&#34;, so I haven&#39;t really noticed any new issues from Libre, but you may.Overall, it&#39;s a pretty good implementation of &#34;Firefox By Mozilla-the-Foundation not Mozilla-the-Corporation.&#34; I&#39;ve been using Firefox at least in part because I think a mono- or even duo-polistic internet is a Bad thing, but Mozilla&#39;s been indifferent-bordering-on-hostile to me as a user class, so I appreciate LibreWolf as a kind of &#34;Chromium for Firefox.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is how NYC raises money - when the revenue dips they send out the sidewalk inspectors, health inspectors, tow trucks, etc. and write up a bunch of fines.Most restaurants have a way to signal the kitchen that an inspector has arrived and they&#39;ll quickly toss everything they are cooking into the garbage because it&#39;s cheaper than getting a fine. Former mayor Bloomberg&#39;s planned crack down on soda drinks was more about issuing fines for not serving precisely 8oz of liquid - though the next mayor dropped it and all the special order measuring cups for the health inspectors went to a warehouse.I&#39;ve witnessed a fleets of NYPD tow trucks clearing out streets of UPS and Fedex trucks. They know what time the delivery companies hit various parts of town and they are ready for them.Recently the New York fire inspectors have started fining landlords for debris in the hallways (debris = amazon deliveries left at the door). So now if the delivery comes to the door you have to get it before the building super throws it away to save the landlord from being fined, if it gets left by the mailbox then the food delivery people steal it on their way out. No winning.About ten years ago there was a good samaritan going around feeding parking meters to keep people from being fined. He was arrested and taken to jail. They let him go without charges but not before he spent the weekend - because the person who processes releases doesn&#39;t work on weekends they said. I think he sued and ended up settling out of court."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some context for those not in NYC:* Illegal parking and idling are out of control throughout the city. This has been the case for years, but it’s reached new heights since the pandemic. Trucks and cars often idle because they’re parked illegally.* The city DOT, for a variety of reasons, is reluctant to redesign streets to prevent this behavior (e.g. by adding loading zones)* The police are reluctant to ticket for this behavior, and frequently idle in their police cars throughout the city.If a bounty system feels desperate/problematic, it is. Our city agencies have failed to deal with this problem and people are pissed about it. My hope is that this program is a bandaid until larger structural issues with the DOT and NYPD are addressed. We’ll see."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Mr. Slapikas said he pulled in $64,000 in rewards in 2021 for simply paying attention on his daily walks for exercise: “I would expect to get three a day without even looking.”That’s almost 10% of the total fines paid out last year, according to the article.I wonder what the distribution of payouts looks like. I assume it’s a small number of people collecting the bulk of the fines.Regardless, it looks like it’s working. Idling cars may not be producing the bulk of emissions, but it’s one of the easiest places to start cutting as it’s otherwise wasted fuel and emissions."</p>

Explicitly building the rendering pipeline really helped me understand the underlying data flow and rasterization techniques, which in turn made me understand GLSL much better. And extending the rasterizer with order-independent transparency, multicore rendering, antialiasing, and other niceties made me appreciate the work that goes into modern renderers.Highly recommend.[1] https://www.rayvertex.com/

You can play solo or compete with friends on other devices.I made it for my dad as a Christmas present. It also gave me an opportunity to learn about geocoding, etc.Tech: serverless, Leaflet, Turf, Svelte, TypeScript, Cloudflare pages. I tried to use as many open / free tools as I could. I originally used map tiles from OpenStreetMap but they were discontinued so it uses Mapbox and Maptiler now.Questions / feedback welcome. I also wrote a blog post with more information: https://adamlynch.com/back-of-your-hand. The code: https://github.com/adam-lynch/back-of-your-handWarning: it’s pretty difficult, unless your streets are numbered :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This would be actually helpful practice for first responders. FDs/EMS in my area are expected to memorize all of the streets in their region, and I imagine it’s the same for PDs too. Another layer on top of it would be to quiz you on how to get from a fixed point (the station) to a random intersection. For the US, you could also provide a random block on a street rather than an intersection."</p>

I used to write exclusively in bulleted list/outline format until spending time with Tufte&#39;s analysis. Now I get that the connective tissue of the document is vitally important to the reader even if it&#39;s not important to the writer. If you don&#39;t put in the connective tissue, your reader has to do it for you and they&#39;ll probably do it incorrectly (leading to, for example, the failure to prevent the Challenger disaster).[0]https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/pi/2016_2017/phil/..."</p>

From The Nature of Order (2002) “As architects, builders, and artists, we are called upon constantly—every moment of the working day—to make judgments about relative harmony. We are constantly trying to make decisions about what is better and what is worse…”Following this, he published a paper on “harmony-seeking computation” as an approach to optimize “wholeness.” He identified 15 elements of wholeness in designs that might be measured, like the presence of coherent centers, strong boundaries, local symmetries or roughness/imperfection. He proposes that “the harmony that is sought in these computations is indeed what we otherwise call ‘beauty’. But the result of harmony-seeking computations are not merely pretty or artistic. In most cases, they are also better functionally and technically.”Alexander,   Christopher &#34;Harmony-Seeking Computations.&#34; International Journal of Unconventional Computing 4 (2008)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very early in my software development career, i was frustrated and sad that i wasnt able to progress due to a lack of comprehension of how software is structured from smaller sub systems. I didnt have any kind of mentor available to me, and I seriously considered changing careers. I naively assumed that good software was written by naturally talented people, and because I was having problems growing I was obviously not talented and therefore would never get improve (I was young).Then i stumbled across “Notes on the synthesis of form” from some random internet recommendation.Not only was this book a complete eye opener, it helped me to understand so much about what I was doing was mostly by accident, and that design should be purposeful.The most important lesson for my fledgling mind though was that design was a process, and a process that improved with each application. That good software developers arnt “born”, they are self sculpted.I still have that battered, note riddled, page corners folded copy of “notes” and I take with me on holiday every year to re-read. Its my most favourite book I’ve ever read. It fills me with such inspiration everytime I read it.I’m very sad to hear of Christophers passing. I never got to thank him."</p>

The object that four different pilots saw visually, and was confirmed on multiple different sensors.  That was camera glare?The video is only one piece of the evidence.  The pilots are trained, and other sensor systems confirmed what the camera was showing.  This analysis is pretty flimsy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I honestly don’t know what to make of these observations other than I’m utterly convinced they’re not alien, super high tech or break the laws of physics (eg inertia). There was no alien crash in Roswell. I also file believe any government is competent enough for the claimed cover up and associated psyops.What I do find interesting is the overlap between people who buy into various conspiracy theories and people who are religious, were religious or would otherwise be likely to be religious.There’s some fascinating psychology here and I think it boils down to a combination of wishful thinking and the comfort derived from there being a Grand Plan rather than just a collection of random stuff that just happens.“Can’t be explained” is typically “hasn’t been explained yet”. Lack of an explanation is nothing more than that. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.I approach this from the other direction. Given the huge benefits of a Dyson Swarm and the fact that it seems to require no exotic materials and no more physics it looks increasingly likely that we are very alone in the Milky Way and even if we aren’t it requires an awful lot of hubris to suggest a species would spend the considerable effort and tens of thousands of years to come here and hide.Like this is Main Character Syndrome at its finest."</p>

( watch the interview...).- These Aliens show up exclusively during their training time and with sightings restricted to areas with US carrier groups exercises.Also...- The Aliens don&#39;t show up with their &#34;Tic Tac&#39;s&#34; or seem to be interested on the Ukraine conflict.- They don&#39;t care about EU or Latin America citizens...- Don&#39;t  want to play around with the Russian or Chinese Air Force.- They don&#39;t show up in the data of any of the existing Military satellites capable of reading a bus ticket on the ground from 400 km.- These Aliens don&#39;t show up in the observations of the 
  thousands of professional and amateur astronomers,

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In Germany a new law will take effect on July 1st 2022, that obligates online shops to provide an &#34;easily accessible, clearly visible&#34; cancellation button on their websites, that allows to cancel any contract that has been established online or via App.The entire procedure is described very explicitly in the law and breaks down to a 2-step process:1. mandatory cancellation button, which, if pressed, leads to a2. confirmation page, where a defined set of parameters is requested and a confirmation button then cancels the contract.In my eyes the defined set of parameters on the confirmation page can easily been abused to make the process more difficult for the user.The parameters required are:1. Type of cancellation2. Unique identification of the user3. Unique identification of the contract4. The desired end date of the contract5. Means of electronic communication for cancellation confirmation (email)Topic 2 can be made very difficult and is in my eyes superficial - if the user logged into his account, he is identified IMO.Topic 3 is ambivalent, how do you identify an contract? By title and date, by ID? In my eyes there should be a popup with existing contracts to choose from (which can easily be done if the user is logged in).Topic 4 is prone to errors, because many contracts have notice periods. So the user has to do research on his contract and if he gets the lifetime/notice periods wrong his cancellation will fail.Information (unfortunately only in german):https://www.voelker-gruppe.com/stuttgart/kuendigungsschaltfl..."</p>

But my experience was certainly not what was described in the article- basically a single button click.Big fat edit: OK, I was wrong. This article and the other comments here made me go double check and sure enough, the cancellation didn&#39;t go through. Perhaps I fell prey to a dark pattern, but I seem to remember seeing different pages. Maybe an A/B test. Either way, good timing on posting this article!"</p>

mess up when using a language that does not enforce memory safety.  We
estimate that at least half of our tracked security vulnerabilities would
have been impossible in Rust, and many of the others would have been very
unlikely.&gt;Arti is cleaner than our C tor implementation.  Although we&#39;ve tried to
develop C tor well, we&#39;ve learned a lot since we started it back in 2002.
There are lots of places in the current C codebase where complicated

needlessly hard to understand and improve.https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti"</p>

I&#39;m not looking for intermediary proxy handlers but an official method to force all user and system apps to use an arbitrary port.- If it is not possible to do so, does `NetworkManager` have a setting for this?- Is it possible to at least change Chrome/Firefox ports via CLI to an arbitrary port?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Crypto people love to say “it’s the early days.”But it’s not. Bitcoin is 13 years old. At that age, Windows was on &gt;90% of the world’s computers. Java at age 13 had taken over enterprise software and was about to conquer mobile via Android. Cryptos are used by maybe 0.1% of computer users (if we’re very generous about what exactly constitutes usage). Considering the amount of investment they are an expensive failure by any normal metrics like monthly active users.It’s not the early days. Rather these are the last days for VCs to sell you this tired old thing before the novelty wears off, and that’s why they are so frantic about pushing it via Hollywood celebrities and whoever else they can muster with money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the biggest drawbacks for blockchain is that transactions can&#39;t be revoked after the fact (with the only exception being costly forks of the entire ledger), and there&#39;s no additional human oversight (like I&#39;d get when sending a large amount of money through a bank) to protect me.If someone steals my credit card, I have my credit card company to give me some level of protection. They can block transactions if they think it&#39;s stolen, and if I report it as stolen I can claw back money from fraudulent purchases.If I purchase something and don&#39;t get what I paid for, I can contest it with customer service or my credit card company.With crypto, a software flaw used to steal crypto can kill an entire company. They&#39;re largely powerless to stop it once the transaction has gone through.With crypto, a xss attack or a misplaced password can cost me all of my coins.With crypto, I have to triple check the address I&#39;m sending coins to because I can&#39;t undo it.With crypto, I have to spend what&#39;s sometimes a significant amount of money just to complete a transaction, and transactions can take minutes or hours to complete.I think there&#39;s a future in crypto but we&#39;re in the dotcom boom days of it where most of the value is in speculation (and I suppose illegal purchases on the darknet). I&#39;ll wait for crypto 2.0."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nothing in here that hasn&#39;t been said in the last 10 year. It&#39;s tempting to dismiss it as a bubble. But; most bubbles don&#39;t get 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th... etc. chances. Every time bitcoin crashes people say &#34;this one is different, this time it&#39;s dead for real&#34;, then it bounces back. It&#39;s proving to be far more cockroach like than anyone anticipated.In the more distant future, if bitcoin survives, its utility will just be one thing, it will be regarded as a unit of measuring transaction value independent of any government. It will not be a replacement for any sovereign currency. Just this extra tool out there in the ether of finance. Notions of store of value, blockchain, proof of work etc. will be regarded as implementation details of achieving a global unit of account. Think of it like the SI unit of value, kilogram, meter, bitcoin. It&#39;s still far too illiquid to serve that purpose now; but, once it has at least an order of magnitude larger market cap it may."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t think this is limited to Russian oligarchs, I thought that because of its trust and crown dependencies system, London is a popular place for people to hide this kind of stuff. Russian oligarchs and other unsavory individuals like corrupt leaders in Africa, the Middle East and the developing world all dump their ill gotten gains into the opaque system away from prying eyes. The stuff you can actually see, like mansions in Knightsbridge are probably just the tiniest tip of the iceberg, everything else is held in such opaque ways that nobody even knows who it actually belongs to. It is so blatant that you couldn&#39;t really call it a dirty secret."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"London is known as &#34;The Laundry&#34; in Russia. No one in power has cared for two decades and only care now because it serves their interests to. Maybe they will crack down on it, maybe it will get swept under the rug again if the Russian invasion of Ukraine dies down as an important news story, either way, the root issue of why this was allowed in the first place won&#39;t be addressed and it will continue to occur with nationals of other countries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am realistically wondering now, what changes does this bring. 
If London won&#39;t be interesting anymore for oligarchs, what will happen with prices of accomodation in center? 
If Switzerland is not a neutral country anymore, where will the money go?There should be prisoners dilemma and therefore some country should emerge to fill this &#34;market need&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The scary thing is that it&#39;s easy to see how something how like this could drive a market boom and bust cycle. I&#39;m imagining a scenario where two iBuyer companies try to outbid each other algorithmically, driving the prices further and further out of reach of people who are looking for a primary home.Tangentially related, I talked to a friend who works on geospatial data for one of the big vacation rental companies, and he was remarking how many homes in many desirable areas are now rentals. It&#39;s not that uncommon to see nearly entire neighborhoods converted to short term rentals now in some areas where they&#39;re still legal. Hearing that really depressed me.We often talk about automation in terms of replacing various types of labor, but I&#39;ve become really interested in automation creating adverse market incentives for smaller market participants because that&#39;s exactly what buying real estate right now feels like.It&#39;s honestly quite scary how I&#39;m in the top 2% of income earners in my generation and yet I could barely afford to buy a small place in a semi-desirable area.   I can easily see myself not being able to compete in algorithmically dominated markets flush with venture cash in the future and I earn more than just about everybody I know today."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently bought a home. We toured a Zillow home, and I can understand what they were going for and where they failed.We were able to pull up to the driveway, book a tour for that minute, and walk in the front door. It was almost a magical experience compared to the process of finding and going to showings. The listings were clear and thorough. The experience was extremely compelling.The downside: the homes were absurdly overpriced. I bought a home for about 10% less than the last Zillow listing. For less, I got three times the land, 40% more square footage, a better location, updated appliances, new carpets, landscaped back yard, horseshoe driveway, two car garage. Almost zero effort had been put into modernizing the Zillow home and it showed.I suspect if I had come in with a very low offer, they&#39;d have accepted it. But for what?If I was Zillow, I&#39;d have licensed the tech to realtors. I&#39;d definitely be inclined to buy a home through them if they weren&#39;t the ones selling the property directly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was at Zillow for many years and left in 2020. On the tech side the pivot into iBuying was absolutely bonkers. The message from senior leadership was basically: I have no idea what your teams should be working on but it’s definitely not what they are currently working on so stop that and figure something else out.This has nothing directly to do with their market failure but they probably are driven by the same leadership problems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"C&#39;s most infamous parsing difficulty is:    A * B;

Is it A multiplied by B, or B declared as a pointer to A? It can&#39;t be resolved without a symbol table. But there&#39;s another way that works very well: it&#39;s a declaration. The reason is simple. The multiply has no purpose, and so nobody would write that. C doesn&#39;t have metaprogramming, so it won&#39;t be generating such code as an edge case (unless using the preprocessor for metaprogramming, in which case you deserve what you get).But there&#39;s a worse problem:    (A) - B

Is it A minus B, or casting negative B to type A? There&#39;s just no way to know without a symbol table. One might think who would write code that has a vacuous set of parentheses around an identifier? It turns out they don&#39;t, but they write macros that parenthesize the arguments, and the preprocessed result has those vacuous parentheses.D resolves both issues with:1. if it parses like a declaration, it&#39;s a declaration2. a cast expression is preceded by the keyword `cast`and D is easy to parse without a symbol table."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; My problem is that C was elevated to a role of prestige and power, its reign so absolute and eternal that it has completely distorted the way we speak to each other. Rust and Swift cannot simply speak their native and comfortable tongues – they must instead wrap themselves in a grotesque simulacra of C’s skin and make their flesh undulate in the same ways it does.Lol at this. Love this eloquent style, and pretty much agree. However, C&#39;s reign is not absolute. Virgil compiles to tiny native binaries and runs in user space on three different platforms without a lick of C code, and runs on Wasm and the JVM to boot. I&#39;ve invested 12+ years of my life to bootstrap it from nothing just to show it can be done and that we can at least have a completely different userspace environment. No C ABI considerations over here. It can be as romantic as just you and the kernel in Virgil land. Heh."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is hard to parse because it doesn&#39;t present any alternatives that the author considers better.- You have to speak the C ABI to talk to the OS -- yes, if you want an OS to support more than one language, or you want multiple languages within a single process, you need a common ABI of some sort.  What is the alternative that doesn&#39;t involve a common ABI?- C has too many ABIs -- yes, there are a lot of different kinds of hardware, and sometimes multiple software ecosystems evolved in parallel on the same hardware (eg. Windows and Linux).  What is the alternative?- ABI changes are hard to make in a non-breaking way -- yes they are.  It&#39;s fundamentally a hard problem.  You could compile everything from source every time, but the open-source world seems to have decided that there isn&#39;t enough time or CPU power to &#34;live at head&#34; and build from source every time, like Google does: https://abseil.io/about/philosophy#we-recommend-that-you-cho...  (Disclosure: I work at Google).- &#34;You Can’t Actually Parse A C Header&#34; -- this is, IMO, the most actionable objection that the article raises.  You could imagine a subset of C that does away with macros, typedefs, etc. in order to be easier to parse, and in doing so forms a more accessible ABI specification language.  That seems eminently doable.  But parsing is only part of the overall battle: actually implementing the ABI for 176 triples seems like the bigger problem.  Especially when you add the ABI-impacting function attributes mentioned in the tweet.As a C fan, it&#39;s hard to see the language itself blamed for what are (in my view) just fundamentally difficult problems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few years back I was in a role where it was my job to maintain a small but non-trivial open source project (~1500 github stars, 5 core contributors). I burned out after about two years in that role. People repeatedly demanding help in the github issues without even providing repro steps.  Hate mail to the project email list from users angry we didn&#39;t implement the feature they want in the latest release. We had people second-guessing all the time if we didn&#39;t ship the things they wanted or they disagreed with the decisions we made. Some people just like to get in touch to let you know your work sucks.The worst was the CEO of a small competitor company repeatedly hassling me over slack DMs and in github issues threads shamelessly trying to get me to prioritize free work that he wanted for his clients. Separately, over a period of several weeks, this same person asked me a ton of support questions and then compiled my answers without edits or attribution into a &#34;white paper&#34; he used as a resource to get people into the marketing funnel for his consulting shop. I came to hate that guy, such an asshole, but I couldn&#39;t totally block him because his company was a member of the open source foundation governing the ecosystem of tools my project was under.Honestly, it was hell. The most stress and irritation I&#39;ve ever had in any job. When I started the job I thought it was a dream getting paid to do open source, but now I consider that an anti-goal for any future role."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most of the comments here remind me of the famous Neil Gaiman quote, &#34;George R.R. Martin is not your bitch.&#34; [1] But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the right framing. People buy the first book because they hope there will be a second, even though they haven&#39;t paid for that second book and hence are not entitled to it. People use your open-source project because you said, hey, here&#39;s this exciting new thing, try it out, so they assume you&#39;d also want to listen when it doesn&#39;t quite work as it should. That&#39;s not about a false sense of entitlement or callousness on the part of your users at all. It&#39;s also not about freeloading, because a lot of those pull requests and issues on Github will be coming from people who publish their own open-source software. Instead, it&#39;s about managing expectations, like the post does. Put a big &#34;this project is not maintained&#34; warning on top, and nobody will bother you. Although I do understand that for larger active projects, it can be hard to explain to users exactly where on the spectrum between &#34;don&#39;t bother me&#34; and &#34;I&#39;ll fix your problem yesterday&#34; you are, and the bigger a project gets, the more likely you&#39;ll be to encounter people who enjoy exploiting your free labor.[1] https://journal.neilgaiman.com/2009/05/entitlement-issues.ht..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think there should be term like suffering from open-source fatigue.Being an active open source dev myself I can relate to this but at the same time I also have been on the other side of the fence when my oss projects didn&#39;t get a lot of traction and any mention from anyone, even if it was an issue, got me really excited and it also kinda validated my efforts.It&#39;s like being a mini celebrity feeling happy when somebody asks for your first autograph but as you become more successful more people want your time and attention and then you don&#39;t want it anymore. Also unlike being a celebrity you may get some fame but rarely any fortune, so that makes it all the more easy to get annoyed when people try to eat your attention for their own benefit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Zotero is one of those pieces of open source software that has really improved my life. I first discovered it as a teenager and it revolutionised writing papers and managing sources. Sadly I don’t find myself using it that much in my job.I always got a kick out of introducing it to my friends in the humanities and blowing their minds. I have no idea how anyone writes papers without zotero or another similar tool.
Keep up the good work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using this in beta for quite a while.  The PDF reader is really very good, and I love the fact that my highlights and notes are not added to the actual PDF file.  (I don&#39;t want to mess up the original PDF file, because I like to keep those files in pristine form so that e.g. I can share them with students.)Some people here are asking about paying for storage for the PDFs.  My solution to this is to store my PDFs using Dropbox, and to use links in Zotero.  That way, even if I give up on Zotero, I still have the files.  And I already pay for Dropbox, and just don&#39;t want one more bill to pay.And, woohoo, an iOS app!  That&#39;s very sweet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not just for scholarly reference management: Zotero is a great tool to keep track of the books you have if your personal library exceeds one or two Billies in volume. For books printed after 1970 the ISBN alone is enough to have it fetch the most relevant metadata for any book published anywhere from online catalogues. I find Zotero particularly useful when going to a book-fair; it is easy to export a list of titles and authors of books you own so you can easily reference it to see which books from a particular author or series you already have."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recently discovered VisiData and I&#39;m on a huge TUI kick right now because of it.  I know GUIs have their advantages and I use them, but opening a file in vim or VisiData at light speed feels so good compared to firing up IntelliJ or some spreadsheet program.  Good keybindings make working in the program a joy.  These tools are often made by hackers/for hackers, not some corporate structure trying to pad their resume with whatever new feature looks good but works like shit that nobody asked for.  When people developing the tool are also using the tool you get a good tool; this isn&#39;t exclusive to TUIs but it&#39;s common and it&#39;s one of the reasons that when they work they work so well.https://www.visidata.org/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the low-power aspect of TUIs, but the problem I have with using them over GUI software is there is no launcher or start menu functionality for TUI (re)discovery. I&#39;ll often find a cool TUI posted here, install it &#34;for later&#34; and then proceed to forget I ever installed it. When &#34;for later&#34; finally comes around, I have to guess the name using tab completion or open my browser, search my history and hope it&#39;s there.Is there such a thing as a TUI launcher out there? Something that allows fuzzy search of program names, tags and a short description (using something akin to .desktop files for the application metadata). Then, when I suddenly need a program for a certain task, I don&#39;t have to hope I memorized the correct command. I just open my TUI launcher, type something related to my task and get a list of some TUIs that could help."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For anyone who wants to add graphics to their TUI, notcurses is pushing the boundaries of what&#39;s possible and viable in a terminal. Still could use some bindings for higher-level languages and ergonomics. It also degrades pretty gracefully depending on terminal capabilities.Check out notcurses-demo and see what you can pull off in a terminal. My only gripe is that tmux degrades significantly. Regardless, dankamongmen is an awesome dude bringing back the demoscene vibes.https://piped.kavin.rocks/watch?v=dcjkezf1ARYhttps://github.com/dankamongmen/notcurses"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here. Thanks for all the feedback.I&#39;m aware that Lapce lacks lots of basic stuff. It&#39;s a personal project so the initial set of features and key bindings are tight to my personal preferences.I&#39;m currently working on the missing pieces, like multi cursor support(in master but not released yet), mouse support, sane default key bindings(probably I&#39;ll stick to an existing editor), basic UX etc.Feel free to submit a feature request or bug report in Github Issues or leave your feedback here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just tried it, on Linux.
Pro:- a single binary you can drop in ~/bin- native Linux version- really, really fast- git branches in the top bar by defaultCons (beside being super new and lacking ecosystem):- Use a custom window border, which is also pretty ugly IMO- cannot use arrow keys in the command palette (or any file dialog). I guess it&#39;s a bug?- default key bindings are... weird? ctrl+f doesn&#39;t prompt a find box for example- cannot make syntax highlight work even on common formats like MarkDown, JSON or YAMLSo, it feels very immature but for sure it is a great starting point, if I get good syntax highlight and code completion with a LSP (although it should already work) I might see me switching from VS Code to it, at least partially."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The court only confirmed what we already know – that &#34;open source&#34; is a term of art for software that has been licensed under a specific type of license, and whether a license is an OSI-approved license is a critically important factor in user adoption of the software.The court confirmed no such things. The decisions expressed in these two documents regarding the use of &#34;open source&#34; as a description of the product in question hinge upon the fact that someone else&#39;s software was released under a new license by Defendant, who had no authority to do so.The court did not care to define open source, except to clarify that a license used previously by the Plaintiff is an open source license, and a license used subsequently is not. The court also did not consider any license-approving practices, let alone those of the Open Source Institute, of whom I find no mention in either document used to justify OSI&#39;s claim."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the salient point of the article is this:&gt; However, the court held that it was improper for the defendants to remove the Commons Clause, and therefore the defendants’ claims in advertising that its ONgDB software was open source was false advertising.&gt; Even though the AGPL has a clause specifically allowing downstream recipients to remove &#34;further restrictions&#34; like the Commons Clause, the court stopped the defendant from doing just that.The decision of the trial court reads:&gt; Section 7 of the Sweden Software License only permits a downstream licensee to remove &#34;further restrictions&#34; added by an upstream licensee to the original work.&#34;Sweden Software License&#34; here refers to the AGPL+Commons Clause.Archive link: https://web.archive.org/web/20220317154012/https://opensourc...AGPL: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IANAL, but it seems to me that the court has only decided that if you fork software, and break it&#39;s license by removing clauses that aren&#39;t permitted to be removed (think removing one of the 3 clauses in a 3-clause BSD license), then you&#39;re distributing the software under a license that is a lie, and thus invalid, and thus not &#34;open-source&#34;.Could this be used as precedent if you release software and claim that it&#39;s open-source, but don&#39;t provide full source or even any source at all? Probably not IMHO."</p>

Download installer from Mozilla from your home network - Mozilla now has your home IP and installer ID.2. Transfer it via USB key to a secure, anonymous computer - one not linked to you, on a network not associated with you, such as public WiFi.3. Install Firefox using that installer on said computer. It transmits the installer ID to Mozilla, which matches the one given to your home IP, thereby deanonymizing you.4. Mozilla receives a warrant for this information, or it is hacked, or the organization is infiltrated by a single government or corporate spy.Edit: It gets worse. Suppose a newspaper IT department takes care of providing Firefox and other trusted software installers to their reporters. Now Mozilla can determine who that newspaper helped with IT, such as journalists or sources. Or if you provide trusted software to your friends, Mozilla gets part of your social graph."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m posting anonymously for obvious reasons.I&#39;ve been working at Mozilla since its inception. And eventually left the company 2 years ago.And I&#39;m so mad.Mozilla is not the Mozilla that was created almost 20 years ago. It&#39;s not the same people there. After the Firefox 4 nightmare, they started hiring product managers from big corp. We started seeing some ex-twitter, ex-microsoft, ex-amazon joining the company. People with more professional ambitions. We didn&#39;t know how to react to Google Chrome and the smartphone revolution. We all trusted the upper management, but upper management was slowly becoming non-mozillians.And an absurd mechanic started: original engineer were busy writing difficult code. upper-management was morphing into some BS silicon valley gang. New young engineers were hired, and they thought the core of Mozilla values lied in these upper-management people. And slowly the original engineers started leaving, leaving behind this BS people with these young engineers.Marketing became &#34;how to show we&#39;re good people&#34;. LGBT, women right, etc etc. Who gives a shit about Mozilla standing for these values? It&#39;s all marketing. The real only value, the manifesto, burnt a long time ago.Don&#39;t get me wrong, LGBT and such are important, but that&#39;s not the job of Mozilla.The last blow: getting rid of Brendan. Maybe he didn&#39;t have the same values employees had about LGBT, but fuck this. People in the silicon valley *love* being offended. And that thing was just too good of a fight for them. Brendan was the last bastion standing.I&#39;m so so so mad.Mitchell trusted the wrong people. We were seeing all these ambitious silicon-valley-puppets taking the position of PM, director, etc etc…Got damn, all we wanted is to make Gecko amazing, light, in a lightweight simple browser. But all these stupid features that were landing on our head…I&#39;m so mad…Rant over."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They seem to be trying to gather a lot of telemetry to measure how they can boost popularity of Firefox. I wonder did they tried to measure how the measurement itself influences popularity? Social measurements are like quantum ones, they change reality.There was a funny story of a Hawthorn Experiment[1], which tried to find ways to boost productivity but at the end managed to state just that the very attempt to conduct an experiment boosts productivity. It seems to me that with Mozilla the effect has a opposite sign and any attempt to measure decreases the target variables of decision making. And therefore they need to find ways to measure &#34;non-invasively&#34;, not to measure every little thing they can measure.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the spirit of the old saying, &#34;the two happiest days of a boat owner&#39;s life are the day they buy a boat, and the day they sell it.&#34;The best advice I got starting out was, &#34;be indispensable.&#34;The best advice I got four years later was, &#34;don&#39;t be indispensable.&#34;In a growing company, the indispensable people may find themselves being left holding the bag while new initiatives are undertaken. I very quickly learned the meaning of &#39;working your way out of a job&#39; after the first time this happened to me.I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some min-max game I&#39;m not playing with regards to how easy I am to lay off, but once I learned there are worse fates that being laid off, I stopped looking for them. Being &#34;stuck&#34; with responsibilities is unpleasant when things are going well, but it&#39;s miserable when things are going badly. If you aren&#39;t the one who got laid off, then someone you used to trade off with doing onerous tasks certainly was, and now you&#39;re stuck doing it every single time.If given the choice between &#34;my company would be just fine without me&#34; and &#34;everything would fall apart if I didn&#39;t show up to work,&#34; the latter feels very good for a brief period when you&#39;re young, until the weight of that responsibility sinks in.  &#34;My company would be just fine without me,&#34; can mean &#34;my work here is done,&#34; and you can ride off into the sunset with a clear conscience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first thing to remember is – no one is indispensable. If you get hit by a bus tomorrow the company will go on without you. People may have a bit of trouble at first, but new processes will develop and new people will gain expertise just as you have now. Heck the company might be better off in the long run without knowledge bottlenecks.Second, being indispensable doesn&#39;t do a whole lot for job security. If the company is doing well, you need to perform exactly at average to stay employed, no more. And if the company is down in the dumps and there are mass layoffs, who is going to judge how much knowledge you have in your head? All the people who know how good you are are probably getting fired as well.Third, you are probably not as important as you think you are. Upper management isn&#39;t sitting around singing your praises in their weekly meeting. No, they are focused on the rising star who is executing new ideas and launching new product lines. You are meanwhile being taken for granted.Now, if you are in this position the author writes about, the time to get out of it is now. Realize that no one can help you but yourself. Start redirecting people, or ignore them altogether. Make noise up the management ladder. Play dumb if you have to. Eventually the rest of the company will find some new punching bag and leave you alone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked for a european investment bank for a number of years, and they had a policy that every year, every employee (without exception) was required to take 2 weeks holiday as a contiguous block, and during that time, their access to the company was removed, so no email access, no remote login, keycard access to the office removed etc. They basically ran the &#39;suspend this person from the organisation&#39; script and restored you when you returned after your holiday.This was primarily in place to reduce the risk of fraud in the trading/operations side of the business, but it had the side effect that it made it very obvious if the business depended on someone being in the office, since managers would have to cope with people being off and unavailable for 2 weeks. It of course also covered people leaving, or being hit by a bus etc.Overall I thought it was a very simple mechanism to avoid the business risk of being exposed to one employee both from a business as usual, and also from a fraud point of view, and also made it much easier for people to free themselves from a particular role."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Next, we keep the DERP network costs under control… by trying to never use it. When using Tailscale, almost all of your traffic goes peer to peer, so DERP is only used as a backup. We continue to improve our core product so it can build point-to-point links in ever-more-obscure situations.This is mentioned in passing, but shows a very good technique.  They incentivize technical excellence by tying it to a concrete cost.  A free plan, with DERP, is the sacred cow that must not ever be removed.  If they don&#39;t fix the &#34;ever more obscure situations&#34;, then the cost goes up.  If they pay an engineer to investigate and fix this, not only does the engineer get to do interesting technical work, and not only does the system become more reliable and &#34;good&#34;, they can also think of it as increasing the profit margin of the product (by not increasing costs).I worked with Avery on Google Fiber, and we did the same thing.  Our sacred cow was excellent US-based phone support.  That is quite expensive.  If there were bugs in our product, users would call in, and our call center costs would increase because we&#39;d have to have more people working.  So every week in our team meeting, we would look at summaries of calls, and take on engineering work to address the most common class of problems.  That let us scale up the business and still provide friendly and competent phone support, because we were reducing the problems that people called in about.  (This was things like having our Wifi access points steer 5GHz capable devices away from flakier 2.4GHz signals, or fixing &#34;black screen&#34; bugs where TV randomly stopped playing for software or network reasons.)  Because we had that &#34;sacred cow&#34;, every obscure bug that we spent months fixing not only made the product better and were intellectually stimulating to finally figure out, but had a concrete impact on how costly it was to deliver the service.What most companies would do here to reduce costs is simple.  Don&#39;t fix DERP bugs, just charge for it.  Don&#39;t fix &#34;black screen&#34; bugs, just hide the phone number on your website so people can&#39;t figure out to call.Avery has found the perfect balance between cost reduction, interesting engineering, and the somewhat nebulous &#34;good product&#34;.  Normally conflicting concerns, all living together in harmony.  If everyone copied his technique here, the world would be a better place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me it’s the opposite: I actually don’t mind paying for a great product such as Tailscale (which I really like), but have security and privacy concerns!Mesh VPNs have substantial control over networks that they manage (they bypass firewalls by having users instal agents from within).  They could add hidden nodes to networks, which is a major security concern, and see who is taking to who, how long, what service they are running, etc, which can be a privacy concern. They are targets.Is there a way to address these concerns, and make them “really” (not just on website) zero trust or at least minimal trust? Will Wireguard preshared keys as an option help (a maliciously added public key lacks a secret key exchanged among peers out of band)?What are the implications of the substantial control that Tailscale has?Or we have no way, but to trust someone? Looking at events of the past decade, I don’t have a good feeling about this!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tailscale reminds me of Fly.io; fantastic tech that &#34;just works&#34;, run by people who know what they&#39;re doing and know how to write about it. What other companies belong in this all-too-exclusive cohort?"</p>

Fascinating from the perspective of how easy it is for foreign governments on the other side of the world to try to scare the shit out of US citizens by hiring some scumbag PI for probably as little as $5k.&gt; Beginning in September 2021, Lin hired a private investigator (the PI) in New York to disrupt the campaign of a Brooklyn resident currently running for U.S. Congress (the Victim), including by physically attacking the Victim. The Victim was a student leader of the pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in 1989, who later escaped to the United States, served in the U.S. military, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen. In September 2021, the Victim (then living in Long Island) announced his intention to run for a U.S. congressional seat on Long Island in the November 2022 general election.&gt; In hiring the PI, Lin explained that if the Victim was selected during the June 2022 primary election, then he might be “elected to be a legislator. Right now we don’t want him to be elected.” Lin emphasized that, “Whatever price is fine. As long as you can do it.”  He also promised that “we will have a lot more-more of this [work] in the future…Including right now [a] New York State legislator.” Lin explained to the PI that Lin was working with other unidentified individuals in the PRC to stop the Victim from being elected to U.S. Congress."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"An interesting aspect of this is that the endless printing of money in the last few years was a sort of stress test of modern monetary theory, which has been seeing lots of discussion in those same years. I never quite understood how this theory would work while avoiding inflation, and what&#39;s happening now seems to at least be related - https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/06/business/economy/modern-m...Conceptually the answer in the theory is to suck up the excess money with taxes, which of course is not going to fly in the US. But maybe this inflation will make that more viable in the future:
&#34;Ms. Kelton and her colleagues make clear that the pandemic relief packages did not follow one of M.M.T.’s key tenets — they did not try to account for resource constraints ahead of time. In an M.M.T. world, the Congressional Budget Office would have carefully analyzed possible inflation ahead of time, and lawmakers would have tried to offset any strain on available workers and widgets with stabilizing measures and tax increases.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"But the reason why so many historical figures were tutored or homeschooled is because there was no adequate public education system. This is confusing correlation for causation. Indeed, Bertrand Russell wrote:&gt; The method of a hereditary leisure class without duties was, however, extraordinarily wasteful. None of the members of the class had been taught to be industrious, and the class as a whole was not exceptionally intelligent. It might produce one Darwin, but against him had to be set tens of thousands of country gentlemen who never thought of anything more intelligent than fox-hunting and punishing poachers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you look at the sports world, you will see that its equivalent of tutoring is hugely beneficial and is alive and well. The Williams sisters and their father are one obvious example but if you dig deeper, you will see many more examples. Rafael Nadal was tutored by his uncle. Tiger Woods was tutored by his father. Also, look at coaches. They are often the sons and daughters of coaches.Tutoring allows exploring and independence of thought which is really how you improve your thinking whereas standardized education mostly does not. Tutoring is bidirectional and standardized education is most unidirectional."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m surprised at the number of commenters who think permanent DST is favourable to night owls and bad for morning people.I think it&#39;s night owls and delayed-cycle teenagers attending school who will suffer most under permanent DST.In the Winter, permanent DST means everyone has to get up an hour earlier for work or school&#39;s clock time, relative to the sun which regulates their body rhythm.Someone pointed out virtually nobody sets when they wake by the sun.  Fair enough.  But the sun does affect how well and how long they sleep, how restored they are, how they feel when they wake, and energy and concentration through the rest of the day.Night people already struggle with getting up early enough for clock-time social expectations.  As it&#39;s a struggle already, getting up an hour earlier is going to be harder for them.  (If the sun makes no difference, why is it already hard?)Research (e.g. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30691158) suggests that overall, health will suffer, sleep will be shorter, and educational attainment in teenage years will reduce.  Even brain development may be adversely affected.But there will be more shopping (economic activity), so that&#39;s ok."</p>

He responded this code was temporary and it would be gone by then.There was another PR on a certain Monday a few months later. Told ya so."</p>

Last year, Balaji Srinivasan tweeted about the idea of SaaS companies buying media companies – https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1374363031417753609 – and as an observer/operator in this space, I&#39;ve heard about a lot of conversations going on behind the scenes with larger companies expressing an interest in smaller media companies (including my own - I value autonomy too much but for the right multiple.. :-D).Consider Hubspot buying The Hustle, Robinhood buying MarketSnacks, Stripe&#39;s various acquisitions (like IndieHackers), Insight Partners bought The New Stack.. and this is all happening in the developer space too. Subscription based companies with high cashflow but high customer acquisition costs will continue to buy attention-based companies with relatively low acquisition costs because, frankly, the owners of the latter are generally quite happy with &#34;modest&#34; (&lt;$40m, say) exits that the former can easily cover."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think beyond the obvious large sports stadiums, local high schools are among the worst offenders. New tax levies for &#39;schools&#39; almost always pass despite much of that spent on new sports fields meant for the exclusive use of sports teams that constitute only a very small percentage of the student body population (not to mention the overall population). Meanwhile, the school will not even have safe ways for children to ride bikes to school and bus service cannot even be properly maintained."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The financials on this are settled. Sports stadiums are an awful financial investment.  However, running a government is not all about making sound financial investments.  Sometimes it is about pooling resources to provide a joint benefit to society.  Other times it is about trying to price in externalities to allow the market to do its work.  These two issues are not as settled as the investment angle and are almost never discussed.  Sports teams provide utility to people in the region, including people who never pay a cent for a ticket or merchandise. How do you quantity that value and should the government compensate the sports team for that value?  I don&#39;t know the right answer, but I would like to see some economists at least engage with that aspect of these decisions.Also the only way to stop these gifts to private companies is likely with a new federal law banning them. It is simple game theory. These businesses will go where the profit is. Any city or state that refuses to pay will lose out until every city or state refuses to pay.  The best way to force that is with a federal ban."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What really upsets me about public stadiums is when the locals can&#39;t even watch the game.  Take the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.  That stadium is 100% publicly funded by the taxpayers.Since 2011 the Rose Bowl game on Jan 1 has been on ESPN.  So two colleges, the majority of which have been public schools, play in a public stadium and the locals can&#39;t even watch for free.I think at the very least they need to make a law that says all events that take place in a publicly funded stadium need to be broadcast on a free local channel that reaches all of the taxpayers who paid for the stadium."</p>

One of which had also written a book about it. It was kind of funny to walk in into a book store, see these two guys drinking tea and then get pulled into a conversation out of curiosity. But, as for the stories themselves, probably not that funny. Some of the people (monks, mostly) had physical scars and their stories were anything but fun.I also went to their offices (a modest distance away from the Dalai Lama temple, but very walkable) and got to speak to senior officials there. I asked them basics questions like, &#34;What do you think is the future for Tibet?&#34; and they were very accommodating.We had tea, laughed and talked life.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a zen Buddhist, I&#39;ve always kinda felt our Tibetan &#39;dharma brothers&#39; style of buddhism (admittedly, I don&#39;t know a lot about) feels much more like a proper religion than the kind of thing I&#39;ve been into.. Which put me off quite a lot of it, I still hope to someday visit the place.It’s pretty sad that such an essentially peaceful and introspective group of people are abused thus, even if they believe in some pretty mad shit.I’ve never worked out what china wants in Tibet tbh though, does anyone have a clue? Chan is bigger in .cn than Tibetan Buddhism (and chan (which became zen) also rejects any kind of eternal self / reincarnation / non-impermanence) and so thus there are no such thing as a lama.So I guess the restrictions / bad business china got unto in tibet are related to some kind of territorial dispute? But what’s there? What do they gain?I can’t see how it’s making them a profit.."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Awesome! A huge amount of work must have gone into this.I did some playing around with VGA graphics from the Pico when it first came out (wrote a simple library to produce SNES like graphics, wrote it all up on my blog https://gregchadwick.co.uk/blog/playing-with-the-pico-pt6/). It felt like Doom should be doable but I figured you&#39;d need an off chip RAM expansion interfaced via the PIO. Clearly not.The Pico really is a very fun board to play around with. Could be a great target for a retro style mini console thing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This thing even has networked multiplayer! In about 256K of RAM and 2MB flash! (It&#39;s the Raspberry Pi Pico board)Carmack would be proud!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s cool, it&#39;s Doom in a completely self-contained cartridge size. Would it be possible to just hook up a cartridge like this to a monitor (through e.g. usb-c) directly?Also if the RP2040 is just $1, does this mean we should be able to get e.g. Doom on cheap handheld single-game devices like the old Game &amp; Watch and similar machines? I remember spending hours on these &#34;racing games&#34; or 12-in-1 Tetris LCD machines from the toy shop. How much does a small (2-4&#34;) color OLED or backlit LCD cost these days? Actually, what is the cheap handheld market looking like these days? I had a boggle at the local toy shop&#39;s website, VTech is still going for it but mainly with baby toys it seems, and those Tetris handhelds are still the same from 20-30 years ago, they cost just €3,99 these days. I&#39;m also seeing some products from a company called Wonky Toys, and miniature Atari arcade cabinets."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"First things first: I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with the design based on the screenshots. At least, nothing stands out as being so unusable that users would flee for your competitor.As for &#34;Gen Z preferences&#34;, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s enough to go on here to prove that. I&#39;m over 35 and have watched user interfaces go from the the fun, colourful and UNIQUE designs of the 2009-era iOS apps to the hyper-corporate, boring af grid system that&#39;s &#34;Apple Approved&#34;. Android is similar, w/ Material Design. I think they have a new one now that replaces MD, but I can&#39;t be bothered to look it up.You&#39;re creating a video speed dating app. Dating is supposed to be FUN. Why design it like Zoom? Have you used trivia apps like QuizUp? You&#39;ll notice how different the design and dynamics are compared to most apps that are designed to render text/image data in specified fields.Also look at TikTok/Douyin for an example of unconventional app design. They could have just copied Instagram, which is blandness personified. But they went with an unfamilar style that nonetheless took off. Nobody&#39;s asking &#34;how do I turn my camera on&#34; there, are they?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I stare at the page for a second. My brain hurts. I hate it. It felt... distracting, maximal, cluttered, weirdly transparent. Little sparkles animate over the page.&gt; &#34;How old are you?&#34; I asked.&gt; &#34;Twenty-five.&#34;&gt; &#34;Of course you are.&#34;You will never, ever, ever do good design while holding your audience in contempt.They are fully and completely entitled to their aesthetic preferences and those preferences have absolutely no bearing on their worth or right to enjoy the products they use in whatever way they choose to use them.If you can&#39;t have enough compassion for your users to design something they love respecting who they are then you shouldn&#39;t be designing for them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a product manager, I read this and found a founder clinically dismissive of user perspectives and feedback that doesn&#39;t align with their own internal viewpoints. Confirmation bias to the n-th degree. His quote of her feedback (&#34;It&#39;s so exciting. Every time I open it, it makes me happy. Sometimes they have doge pop up!&#34;) is almost certainly embellished and is a non-empathetic take on a genuine user perspective.The mock [1] even radiates the &#34;millennial snowflakes&#34; energy that used to be prevalent, with the &#34;You are unique. You are different&#34;.Thinking about it further, I actually think this is a super clickbait way to get hits and link clout? If you look at their blog [2], it&#39;s really just advertising all of the different dating verticals this company runs. And gosh, the names are horrifically cringey. &#34;Sappho Dating&#34;, &#34;Matzoball Dating&#34;, &#34;Subtle Curry Dating&#34;?1: https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6197f007be798d88368f80d7/623...
