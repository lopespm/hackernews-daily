								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh please do.  This seems like the perfect time to bring this up:I had a piece of software that used Discord for support.  They required that users be verified, which requires you to give you phone number to Discord.  I gave them my Google Voice number, which is the only number I have, and they rejected it because they don&#39;t support VOIP numbers.  I asked them if there was any other way to verify my identity.They told me, &#34;Just use a friend&#39;s phone to verify.  As long as they don&#39;t try to verify on Discord in six months it should be fine, we won&#39;t check again&#34;.Their official answer to identity verification was to impersonate someone else!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just wish people would use a system that&#39;s integrated into where the code is. I don&#39;t want to have to register for a forum when GitHub has a perfectly good ticketing system (and now discussions), and yet I have to register at another place where my details can be leaked from because who knows the technical capability of this one single person who may or may not have done any security.If it&#39;s a company, please have the forum integrated into your software.I seriously do not want yet another login unless there is a good reason. It&#39;s ridiculous. I have nearly 700 logins in my password manager and I&#39;d say probably 500 of those items are websites I&#39;ve registered once to ask a question (quite often questions that go unanswered). Half of these forums do not even provide the capability to removing my account without contacting the admins, which is just an unnecessary hassle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Author here. Thanks for submitting!I wrote this a year ago as my employer was starting up their forum[0]. While we have since added slack, the forum is the main support mechanism for our community (people who pay us money get support tickets).I still stand by that choice for:  * SEO
  * durability
  * question quality

I can&#39;t recall the exact numbers, but something like 5-10% of our overall traffic is to the forum.0: https://fusionauth.io/community/forum/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Bing image search has solved this problem.For each result you can see multiple pages that include the image. It also shows the resolution and file size of each version. I did a test search for &#34;bear&#34; and clicked on the first result. It showed 14 different pages containing the same image with different sizes and possibly slightly different crops. You can also select a subsection of the image to search for that.It makes Google image search feel like an old school internet tool. I know Bing isn&#39;t cool or popular, but their image search is undeniably superior.I don&#39;t think we need to blame Pinterest for having indexable content. This is a failing of Google image search for not showing alternate matches for the same image.Bing has it figured out. I can&#39;t tell if Google just doesn&#39;t care enough about image search to implement it, or if there&#39;s some obscure patent preventing them from doing so."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google prioritizes results from higher ranking sites. This is what PageRank was all about. It&#39;s entirely within Google&#39;s power to score Pinterest results lower, pushing them down in the search results.

Same story if somehow 1 license = 1 target. This is something that I don&#39;t think was explored enough in DD."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To be fair, it is quite murky to what extent groups like Al-Haq are associated with the PFLP (which, with its history of aircraft hijackings and suicide bombings, is undoubtedly a terrorist group). There is plenty of purported evidence of financial and personnel links out there, and I really doubt HN is the right forum to decide either way (unless someone is an expert)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For me Hot Reload is the most important feature, which will very likely be a reason for me to move a bit from Python over to .NET, which I haven&#39;t touched for 10 years. Back then I really used it a lot (after moving away from OLE/DCOM/ActiveX), in C++, Managed C++, C# and IronPython (no GIL!). I absolutely loved it, but it was limited to the Microsoft ecosystem.Yesterday, while randomly googling for &#34;hot reload&#34; I got aware of the drama which went down around two weeks ago, when Microsoft decided to remove this feature from the release, even after including it in the previews.Here is a good summary https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_pzDjw9HQ"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; In .NET 6, in-memory single file apps have been enabled for Windows and macOS. In .NET 5, this deployment type was limited to Linux. You can now publish a single-file binary that is both deployed and launched as a single file, for all supported OSes. Single files apps no longer extract any core runtime assemblies to temporary directories.This is a great! Now I can publish statically linked executables and run it everywhere. I don&#39;t have to tolerate Golang and its quirks just to have cross-compilation and static binaries, even though they will be larger in size."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So for context I looked at the papers behind the scenarios.- The heart rate sensing is done on a smart watch, not a phone, and needs data from the actual heart rate sensor every couple of days [1].- The breathing rate is determined from a phone put on the breast or the abdomen [2]. Not really a threat vector in that form.- The audio stuff is incredibly impressive [3], but it doesn&#39;t look like they can reconstruct text with meaningful reliability, it&#39;s more about identifying the person or at least the gender of the person on the other end of the line.The location and activity detection scenarios seem the most credible to me, but the for targeted attacks the audio reconstruction might also work. The other two don&#39;t really seem credible to me yet, but good to be aware of them.1: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.04667.pdf2: http://www.ijetch.org/vol8/900-M302.pdf3: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.05972.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Facebook reads the accelerometer all the time. Facebook actually shows a support prompt if a shake event is detected across the app. This could be one reason why Facebook reads accelerometer data.No. Shake gestures are handled at the OS level and you only get began/changed/ended callbacks. Raw accelerometer data requires the CoreMotion framework, and it’s a lower level API. They are definitely using it for something else.This is also confirmed by this:&gt;The prompt has an option to switch this feature off. However, switching it off doesn’t stop the app from reading the accelerometer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Now, if this social app is reading accelerometer data on your phone as well as the passenger’s phone, the app can easily figure out that both phones experience the same vibration pattern. ... Don’t be surprised if you receive a recommendation from the app to add this passenger as a friend.Overall I find the article interesting but this quote is borderline tinfoily. Given the amount of noise in the accelerometer data and signal s much closer to the sensor than the bus itself - such as body movements, it would be hardly precise. Moreover the cost of doing all that research and computation as well as data transfer would hardly pay off."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; A futuristic dystopia. A place where the real world sucks. Where people consider talking to someone a chore. Connection, closeness, ambition are replaced by detachment and dogmatic slumber. Society is satisfied with shallow thoughts and the pursuit of artificially created stimuli in an imaginary world.Beautifully written top-notch orwellian poetry. Seriously inspiring.Also as someone who has only ever used social media as a low-level content creator (we used to be called deadbeat artists) I feel like this starts an important conversation about the new problems that develop when you stop consuming and start doing.In my experience over the last  decade there are fewer and fewer ways to find a community and any success as a creator of any kind without getting corralled into social media and furthermore getting corralled into being a daily active user / consumer as to not get shadow banned by any given app.Doing rather than consuming feels much healthier than doom scrolling, but theres a larger dialogue that has to happen about the problems with creating in the 21st century imho."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe that many of you commenting here about the terrible dangers of social media&#39;s addictiveness and so forth more likely than not simply live in a bubble where you yourselves and the circles of people around you are unusually addicted to it.I can spend a few minutes on Facebook or Instagram a few times a day and that&#39;s it, no problem leaving and few problems with self image anxiety because of some influenciar or other people&#39;s profiles. Most of my friends are more or less similar, and if they use their own social media profiles for anything more heavily, it&#39;s because of work obligations, but outside of those obligations, they simply don&#39;t qualify as addicted.Of course, my own story may be coming from a different kind of bubble of its own, and after all it&#39;s no more than an anecdote, but I&#39;d love to see a concrete, empirical study that shows just how many people out of a given population (broken down by age or demographic groups maybe) really do get emotionally crushed by social media addiction, and how many people are more or less casual about using it and don&#39;t take it too seriously. The harping and woeful lamenting that I keep seeing on HN (ironically full of people who benefited financially from and helped facilitate this very technology in their careers) about how social networks are creating an emotional wasteland is no substitute for real data.All the above aside, the big social networks are indeed fully, empirically worthy of criticism for their endlessly parasitical scrounging for personal data and perpetual monetized surveillance of every person they can push into &#34;engagement&#34;. This however doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that they&#39;re succeeding as much as some like to think at the mass emotional manipulation aspect. The two things need not strongly correlate.After all, as many other seemingly contradictory comments on this same site have noted in the past, much of the ad and content suggestions that sites like FB or Insta push on people are often laughably off the mark at guessing interest or preference, yet at the same time, these same faulty algorithms somehow supposedly devastate the self images and belief systems of millions  of people? So, which is it? It could be both, but that seems rather doubtful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This may not be terribly popular, and its admittedly just conjecture, but I&#39;m of the opinion that its less about the quantity of social media, and more how one interacts with it and even more so consumes it.Some platforms are clearly more toxic than others, though I&#39;m increasingly of the opinion that they are all pretty toxic, just different flavors of &#34;world outlooks&#34; to choose from.I feel that those that actively participate (commenting, posting, responding, reacting) are more affected and more caught in the feedback loop. Those that more or less passively read these platforms, rarely interact, and largely work to keep &#34;perspective&#34; seem to have less of a tough time on it and allow it to impact their outlooks and moods less.Those that tend to interact more seem to get caught in a sort of feedback loop. measured/Nuanced/Moderate or considerate takes are generally frowned upon on most of the major platforms these days. Outrage and simplistic viewpoints reign supreme, and most will bury the rest, forcing even those with moderate stances to either &#34;consider a side&#34; when continuing or just outright not partake. And all of these seem to be, relatively speaking, vocal minorities.There are plenty of people that consume stuff and just dont have anything useful to say, or just dont have the energy to say it and defend it etc. Of course this seems to depend on the platform as well, for example I would never post this take on reddit....With that said, I go agree generally, that these are toxic and create unbalanced viewpoints and world views. As Dave Chappelle said, &#34;twitter isnt real&#34;, and to an effect that true. Twitter, reddit, youtube, facebook, dont necessarily pan out to the larger population&#39;s opinion as a whole, at least where its measured (such as in politics and polling)"</p>

I&#39;m thinking about libgen/sci-hub/whatcd(RIP), but entirely decentralized, protocol-based. We already have basically all necessary tools: BitTorrent/IPFS to distribute files, magnet links to link them, DHT to discover peers. We just need to combine them together in a smart way and maybe add some bits of missing functionality, like:- categorization and search;- voting for every entry;- maybe reputation system. Where peers regularly publishing good, high quality content get their &#39;karma&#39;[1] upvoted. So when downloading you can choose people with higher reputation. Or when building catalog of materials in certain area of interest, you can filter only peers with certain threshold karma.- incentive for peers to keep seeding whatever they downloaded at least until achieving certain ratio (say, 2:1). Maybe by rewarding with &#39;torrent tokens&#39; that you can spend on downloading, commenting etc.[2]- comments to every entry (published torrent). With means to combat spam, insults, irrelevant stuff etc. E.g. with voting system, where comments with, say, -3[3] votes become collapsed. Or/and with aforementioned &#39;tokens&#39; that you spend when comment.- personal blacklists to block people whose torrents/comments you don&#39;t want to see.Maybe I&#39;m reinventing the wheel here and something similar already exists, but for some reason not popular (since I never heard of it)? In that case we need to figure out why it didn&#39;t shoot and fix it to make it work.[1] Your ID will be a cryptographic key a la cryptocurrency wallet.[2] With rare but sought after torrents rewarding you with more tokens.[3] Personally adjustable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This isn&#39;t true at all. Its obvious for a senior/staff/principal engineer to claim that their skillset is infinitely transferrable to any job role that needs a staff level skillse, but its simply not true. There are tooling agnostic skills you learn (managing complexity, upleveling team members, how to actually be a technical leader and make improvements that a manager doesn&#39;t explicitly tell you to do) and there are tooling specific skills that you need in an organization (EX: dependency management in java, performance issues in certain DBs, the unwritten/not explicit API issues in different cloud platforms). If I am hiring for a staff engineer, I will be trying to get the combination of &#34;tooling agnostic&#34; staff engineering skills AND &#34;tooling specific&#34; staff engineering skills for my job opening because you don&#39;t end up paying more for an engineer that has a well matched &#34;tooling specific&#34; skillset, but they will be more productive. The net cost to me as an employer is simply time, I might need to source 3x the candidates to get a good fit, but its worth it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I strongly disagree.A senior engineer that has always worked in the backend won&#39;t be able to be up to speed with a complex frontend app quickly and be as effective as a senior frontend.There&#39;s just too much to know about browsers and underlying tech and a myriad it things.Same for a senior frontend starting to work on a complex backend all with god knows how many interconnected technologies.Being able to go from JS to TS? Sure. Being able to go from JS to Rust + Docker + (all your backend stuff here) not so much."</p>

We were down for over a day before we called it off.  Apparently this led to minor upheaval at several locations in Beijing &amp; riot police were called in.We were pretty puzzled as we had an index and had load tested extensively.  We had Oracle support working directly with us &amp; couldn&#39;t figure out why queries had started to become table scans.The culprit? A point upgrade to DBD::Oracle (something like X.Y.3 to X.Y.4) introduced subtle but in character sets.  So the index required using a particular Unicode character set, and we were specifying it, but when it was translated into the actually query, it wasn&#39;t exactly the right one, so the DB assumed it couldn&#39;t use the index.  Then, when all the banks opened &amp; a large portion of very populous country tried to buy tickets at the same time, things just melted.Not a fun day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why exactly would it be so bad to just put a suitable index on the table containing strings? The time complexity of the resulting search would be the same, so I assume there will be some constant factor slowdowns. Is it that indices over string fields are stored inefficiently on disk? (If so, can that not be fixed in the db engine directly?) Or is this fine today but wasn&#39;t fine 15 years ago?"</p>

That&#39;s right, I was that clueless newbie who came up with a completely ridiculous abuse of a SQL database that was slow, bloated, and obviously wrong at a glance to anyone who had a clue.&gt; My point is: EVERYONE goes through this, particularly if operating in a vacuum with no mentorship, guidance, or reference points. Considering that we as an industry tend to chase off anyone who makes it to the age of 35, is it any surprise that we have a giant flock of people roaming around trying anything that&#39;ll work?"</p>

Rebooting helps temporarily.Today I realized that data read/written since boot was about 1TB in a few hours on a brand new OS install, and I traced this back to the com.apple.Safari.History process. Somehow having bookmarks and previously using Safari 15.x caused a huge amount of I/O that wouldn&#39;t stop - the solution was to remove all bookmarks and reading list items. Performance was immediately back to normal, no reboot needed.So just logging in with your iCloud id, you could be &#34;importing&#34; whatever performance problem you&#39;re having on a new install.I recommend you reboot and take a look at your disk I/O stats - maybe this will help someone!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have created a learning framework for myself to learn literally anything.
First of all It’s not going to be easy to get started learning something new because there are many holes in your mental model about the material and the aim of the learning is to fill those holes.
We’re living in an information era. You can drawn yourself in surfing the web/docs/articles if you are some kind of perfectionism to convince yourself that you’re learning. But that’s the trap. You should spend about 30-40% of your time learning the material and 60-70% of your time applying it and then under the process you’ll find: “Oh I don’t know how or what is X” then you go to learn about X specifically. This works best. In other words as you will be applying what you have learned so far you start “learning on demand”. In other words filling the individual holes. This loop will force you to learn the topic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Overall a pretty good summary of how to teach yourself new skills. I personally went far too much into unguided learning early in my software journey. I took on personal projects that were far too ambitious and floundered with problems that would have been 10x easier if I&#39;d focused on grasping fundamentals.What&#39;s missing in this post is that it entirely focused in isolated learning, away from tutors and other forms of interpersonal teaching. Any approach to learning stuff &#34;quickly&#34; should take seriously Bloom&#39;s 2 Sigma Problem. [1]Partly offloading your learning problem onto an expert tutor trained in master learning has a good chance of vastly exceeding any learning approach a novice can adopt on their own. The internet has thus far failed to support this learning model, I think because it would be incredibly expensive for students.1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_2_sigma_problem"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I must say it&#39;s worth mentioning that as you build up a library of knowledge and experience in your mind, learning new things become more transitional than exploratory. Picture spoken languages for example. At first it&#39;s daunting and most languages have their quirks but overall after a few you find your marks easily.The effort becomes a memory concern where cheat sheets are how you transition or learn quickly into a new space.I&#39;m a polyglot in software development. I can work with most tech stack within 2-3 weeks and be efficient within 3-6 months, idiomatic within a year maximum. A big part of that is due to relatability between spaces. Every toilet has a flushing button and every kitchen has a sink and every language had a form of exposing positive or negative response.My advice is always throw yourself in and swim. Find whatever swimlane or swimming aid available and move forward.One caveat is learning spaces that are constantly shifting. For example, Swift. What a mess. Look up anything in that language and find 5 ways to do something, 3 expired, 1 manageable and 1 undocumented that works. It&#39;s sad but know that that&#39;s the outlier, not the average!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A couple years ago I had an experience with a spider that entirely changed my perspective on them and most insects, and now I make a conscious effort to help them as much as possible, instead of kill or even repel them.This particular spider kept running back and forth between my monitor and a window, and when it&#39;d get to my monitor, it would wave its front legs at me. If I moved to the left, it would run across to the left side of the monitor and waves it legs again. If I stood up and moved closer to it, it would run back to the window, turn around, and waves its legs at me. From watching YouTube too much, I was always under the impression that this was either a sign of aggression or a defensive stance.But after a few times of going back and forth like this, I realized there were approximately 50 baby spiders around a light by the window, which had been closed since the previous day. Normally this would be a nightmare for me (I&#39;ve always had a fear of spiders), but after a while, I had this crazy notion that the spider was trying to get me to open the window. So I did, and it immediately ran to the babies, wrapped a single strand of silk around the old webbing, and started dragging swaths of the babies&#39; webbing toward the window.I have no idea if the room was just dry and they needed some humidity, or if the food had been too scarce for too long. Whatever it was, that parent spider was in full blown panic mode, and managed to effectively communicate their problem to a human. I haven&#39;t killed any spiders or insects since (aside from a few particularly asshole-ish mosquitos), and actually keep small water dishes in my bathroom for two spiders who&#39;ve now lived with me for nearly a year. If any babies hatch inside and get close to me, I use my phone&#39;s flash to guide them back to a corner with a light on -- they are seemingly always drawn to the brightest light source.Spiders are incredible creatures, and I deeply regret not realizing that sooner."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of my school friends walked a different path from me and became a paramedic. He used to have to go to homes in &#34;socioeconomically challenged areas&#34; in order to revive people who had taken substances that they should not have taken - and also other things which were even less good. On one of these trips in a drug hell hole he saw a tank with a spider in it, and he realised that these people were likely mistreating it. So he asked if they wanted it and after a short conversation bought it off them for a nominal amount.So - he had a tarantula. I had never seen or met a thing like that and I was fascinated. It was very shy at first - it spent all day everyday hiding, possibly because of fear of drug addicts. But eventually it got a bit more confident. The thing was, it recognised and remembered individual humans. When it first met you or saw you it would hide. If you were calm and Kit (the paramedic) was calm with you it would come out and allow you to stroke it. This might take a few visits. But, once you had won it&#39;s confidence it would come right out and say hi as soon as you were in the room.I came to believe that it was self aware, and that it had a mental model that included social interactions and trust. It was just a belief, as it&#39;s really hard to see the anecdote and experience I have as data, but that&#39;s what interacting with it made me think. I thought it was as smart as a cat, or maybe even a dog."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Talking about Portias, I recommend reading &#34;Children of Time&#34; by Adrian Tchaikovsky, it&#39;s about the process of uplifting spiders and how humans re-establish contacts with them.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wish I could a 2-3 hour interview where I (or the candidate) showcase one of my projects and explain the architectural details and decisions in addition to showing any cool/hairy/insane code that got the job done. We can discuss those things and see how to improve them, or laugh at the crazy solutions.Honestly how many times do I need to rehearse these dumbass algos (blah blah blah, so I&#39;ll optimize for space with blah blah blah) okay already. I would much rather show you real world code that I&#39;ve built, or passion projects I spend my free time on. I want to bring me to your company/projects, so get to know what I&#39;m about holistically as an engineer. I think you can best understand that by looking at actual work done and judging whether or not the person is capable of contributing to your needs.Whenever we face challenges, we learn from them. At scale, we learn everyday. So just hire people who are passionate about facing challenges and learning from them. Not someone who can spend 8 hours a day like a college student playing leet code instead of building something useful. It really isn&#39;t that hard to memorize a dozen essential data structures and algorithms. But then what? So cringe."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having unscripted conversations is one of the best way to be swayed by unconscious bias in interviews.Even though this advice sounds awesome, I will be cautious of putting it into practice without thinking through the bias problem.I do remember reading multiple research papers on this, but unable to find them at the moment. From anecdote - In the last company I worked in London, only one team (DevOps) did not follow scripted interviews. It was the least diverse team, not just in terms of representation, but in terms of diversity of thought. Most of it was comprised of &#34;tech-bros&#34;.Scripted interviews do not mean you ask through a basket of questions. It just means that you stay within the guardrails of a set of topics and you go through all the topics. With in a topic, you have fair amount of flexibility. For example  if you are hiring for a mid level Java programmer your topics may include - Java 8, Testing pyramid, Functional programming, type safety, developer safety(CI/CD/Rollbacks/Code reviews/Pair programming etc), some domain specific knowledge and so on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Been on the hiring side for more than a decade. In addition to other advice in this thread, I would like to add -I treat the interview as my chance to help the candidate pass the interview. This bent of thought may seem subtle, but makes all the difference in meeting the candidate in their terrain, and seeing the world from their point of view.  Consequently, the case studies given explicitly state that if the candidate finds something else that intrigues them, I am happy to take that as a case study instead - gives them something to flaunt and for me to learn about.Some candidates are shy to open up, or just not comfortable conversing with strangers, or misread the power asymmetry in the interview and get anxious - I spend a fair bit of time just conversing human to human.For the really uncommunicative candidates, I make a slight of what they built (fake slight) and this gets the conversation going like a star. The good candidates exhibit a great amount of &#34;Builder&#39;s Pride&#34; and defend what they built.  They really good ones admit to the possibility that there were other better ways to have built, or explain to me the constraints under which they made the choices they did."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The future is not as dark as it seems because of the rat race of megacorps.You can use reduced versions of language models with extremely good results.I was involved in training the first-ever GPT2 for Bengali language, but with 117 million parameters.It took a month&#39;s effort (training + writing code + setup) and about $6k in TPU cost, but Google Cloud covered it.Anyway, it is surprisingly good. We fine-tuned the model for several downstream tasks and we were shocked when we saw the quality of generated text.I fine-tuned this model to write Bengali poems with a dataset of just about 2k poems and ran the training for 20 minutes in GPU instance of Colab Pro.I was really blown away by the quality.The main training was done in JAX, and it is much faster and seamless than PyTorch XLA, much better than TensorFlow in every way.So, my point is, although everyone is talking hundreds of billions of parameters and millions in training cost, you can still derive practical value from language models, and that too, at a low cost."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The GPT-3 family is still to expensive to use, too big to fit in memory on a single machine. Prices need to come down before large scale adoption or someone needs to invent the chip to hold it (cheaply).The most exciting part about it is showing us there is a path forward by scaling and prompting, but you can still do much better with a smaller model and a bit of training data (which can come from the expensive GPT-3 as well).What I expected from the next generation: multi-modality, larger context, using retrieval to augment input data with fresh information, tuned to solve thousands of tasks with supervised data so it can generalize on new tasks better, and some efficient way to keep it up to date and fine-tune it. On the data part - more data, more languages - a lot of work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Neat to see more models getting closer, thought it appears only one so far has exceeded GPT-3&#39;s 175B parameters.That said, what I&#39;m really curious is how those other models stack up against GPT-3 in terms of performance -- does anyone know of any comparisons?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I built games in the 90s. Graphics was obviously the hardest part.We thought about things in terms of how many instructions per pixel per frame we could afford to spend. Before the 90s it was hard to even update all pixels on a 320x200x8bit (i.e. mode 13h) display at 30 fps. So you had to do stuff like only redraw the part of the screen that moved. The led to games like donkey kong where there was a static world and only a few elements updated.In the 90s we got to the point where you had a pentium processor at 66 Mhz (woo!) At that point your 66Mhz / 320 (height) / 200 (width) / 30 (fps) gave you 34 clocks per pixel. 34 clocks was way more than needed for 2D bitblt (e.g. memcpy&#39;ing each line of a sprite) so we could beyond 2D mario-like games to 3D ones.With 34 clocks, you could write a texture mapper (in assembly) that was around 10-15 clocks per pixel (if memory serves) and have a few cycles left over for everything else. You also had to keep overdraw low (meaning, each part of the screen was only drawn once or maybe two times). With those techniques, you could make a game where the graphics were 3D and redrawn from scratch every frame.The other big challenge was that floating point was slow back then (and certain processors did or didn&#39;t have floating-point coprocessors, etc.) so we used a lot of fixed point math and approximations. The hard part was dividing, which is required for perspective calculations in a 3D game, but was super slow and not amenable to fixed-point techniques. A single divide per pixel would blow your entire clock budget! &#34;Perspective correct&#34; texture mappers were not common in the 90s, and games like Descent that relied on them used lots of approximations to make it fast enough."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve created a 4k UHD video editor for Haiku OS (https://github.com/smallstepforman/Medo), it’s a C++17 native app, with over 30 OpenGL GLSL effect plugins and addons, multi threaded Actor model, over 10 user languages, and the entire package file fits on a 1.44Mb floppy disk with space to spare. If I was really concerned about space, I could probably replace all .png resources with WebP and save another 200kb.How is it so small? No external dependancies (uses stock Haiku packages), uses the standard C++ system API, and written by a developer that learned their trade on restrained systems from the 80’s. Look at the old Amiga stuff from that era."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lower resolutions on smaller monitors. 256 colors at a time, no truecolor yet.Lower-res samples, if any.Lower framerate expectations - try playing Descent 2 on an emulated computer with similar specs to the lowest specs suggested on the box. Even one in the middle of the spec range probably didn&#39;t get a constant 60fps.More hand-tuned assembly (RCT was famously 99% assembly, according to Wikipedia; this was starting to be unusual but people who&#39;d been in the industry a while probably did at last one game in 100% assembly, and would have been pretty comfortable with hand-optimizing stuff as needed).Simpler worlds, with simpler AI. Victory conditions designed to be reached before the number of entities in the game overwhelmed the CPU completely.Simpler models. Most 3d games you play now probably have more polygons in your character&#39;s weapon than Descent would have in the entire level and all the active entities; they certainly have more polys in the overall character.I mean, really, three million tiles? That&#39;s insane by that day&#39;s standards, that&#39;s a bit more than 1700x1700 tiles, a quick search tells me the maximum map size in Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 was 256x256, and it&#39;s a fairly safe assumption that RCT1 was, at best, the same size, if not probably smaller. I can&#39;t find anything similar for Sim City 2000 but I would be surprised if it was much bigger."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In 2018 I built a privacy-friendly open-source consent manager (https://github.com/kiprotect/klaro) which is used on many websites across Europe. From the beginning I never liked the IAB, didn&#39;t implement it and told people that I regard it as unlawful since e.g. a user cannot possibly make an informed decision that involves thousands of third-parties. Still many of our users kept asking me about it since it was &#34;the way&#34; to become compliant.So I finally asked the IAB how one could potentially implement their framework as an open-source framework. Their answer was basically that it&#39;s not possible. You have to register as a CMP provider and ensure that your users are using your software in their compliant (ha ha) way, which is of course impossible to enforce with an open-source software that everyone can self-host. In general, in my opinion the IAB is mostly a framework to shift liability from the advertisers who steal the users&#39; data to the publishers and CMP providers. Therefore I&#39;m quite happy we never got around to implement this &#34;feature&#34; in our CMP, and I hope the IAB will quickly die and takes all those alibi CMP providers down with them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really hope they actually issue a hefty fine here, instead of just a &#34;now stop doing that&#34;.Not issuing a fine would send a signal that simply ignoring the law until you&#39;re told to follow it pays off, since the companies involved certainly made much more profit in that time than they would have made had they followed the law.Also, the fines should be issued to everyone involved in this mess - middlemen and library providers like IAB, the ad companies actually collecting the data, and most importantly the publishers that sent their visitor&#39;s data to them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don’t agree with this perspective: why do entry-level students have to understand the internals behind compiling their code, and weird edge-cases like misspelling import? In my experience this is actually the stuff that hinders learning and confuses students.The author claims that students won’t be able to do real-world programming without learning this esoteric stuff, but actually this is the exact stuff they don’t need to know: full teams can and have built huge java projects just by using the intellij project wizard and maybe a tiny bit of Gradle from stack overflow. Actually students can solve most of the author’s problems by spending 5 seconds on Stack Overflow.I’m not saying that these more esoteric details are completely useless. Learning e.g. the difference between char and UTF8 “character” is actually pretty important so that emoji inputs don’t crash your website. But this is stuff that should come in later classes, particularly for students who are interested in those details. Not everyone needs to know it.In fact my experience is that some colleges have the exact opposite problem: they teach students old tools and techniques which are tedious and not actually used much later on. Like writing code by hand and deducting points for syntax errors, or using some outdated framework e.g. jQuery. When I saw the title my first thought was literally “yeah stop making students use eclipse, they should be using IntelliJ!”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Using Java or Python in a professional IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, PyCharm, or Eclipse is not a good first introduction to programming for computer science students, whether they’re in the field to become web developers, systems software engineers, or academic computer science researchers.I was forced to program Java without an IDE and my experience is that I learned less in all those lessons over a year than in a few select days at work during my first year.Furthermore, according to a friend who is a specialist teacher this is a common problem:Most kids are inclined to see how things works as a whole while most teachers want to teach analytically by tearing everything apart.I&#39;m grown-up now and don&#39;t mind diving deep into stuff (in fact I enjoy it) but in my understanding we really should try to go with the flow when teaching:Teach kids the wonders of programming (and everything else) and then go into the details as needed.Because, if my friend is right and I understood him right (he doesn&#39;t teach programming) most kids doesn&#39;t want to learn programming because they want to know how to please javac but because they want to create cool stuff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Eclipse is poor tooling for teaching. Far too many buttons and noise that gets in the way. But the opposite, programming with no debugger and no linter is just as bad. It punishes you for getting the smallest syntax mistakes by waiting for the compiler and reading out erroneous messages.A debugger makes it far better to understand the execution of code line by line, and should be standard in education, but it&#39;s not.I feel that visual studio code, with some modifications, would be perfect to begin with. Then when building things at a higher level, introduce why to use eclipse, like how it handles packages, etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Early in my career I got a Monday morning meeting invite on a Friday afternoon just after I left the office. The meeting was called “The future of &lt;business unit I was in&gt;“Entire weekend was a write off. I was so anxious.  And yep. They shut down the unit (but I got to keep my job).As a result this is forefront in my mind as a manager. One thing that works great is whenever I ask questions about something, anything, I also say “this is on my mind because…” and I find that both calms people and gets me more useful information. Context matters so much."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; When you’re communicating with your team, lead with context and reassurance. Never message someone on your team, “let’s talk when you get a minute”. That’s void of information and scary as heck!This should be engraved on a plaque in every office building."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The way I see it, if &#34;let&#39;s talk when you get a minute&#34; comes across as spooky that means you already have a communication breakdown and mistrust has already blossomed. Here&#39;s a slightly different scenario: You have a disagreement with management; there are many subsequent conversations happening behind the scenes; but no one keeps you in the loop or updates you on what is being decided. In that situation, practically any message (apart from &#34;here is exactly what we are thinking..&#34;) comes across as spooky, and you will start reading into what _isnt_ said.
In short, if you think someone might want to know something, and they have a reasonable claim on deserving to know, let them know. Keep people informed, and if you do that then &#34;let&#39;s talk when you get a minute&#34; won&#39;t feel like such a lurking shadow."</p>

Possible increased adoption of nuclear in the future is not a reason to avoid setting sunset dates for emitting technologies now and commence transition to whatever low emission technologies are the most available and affordable right now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d be fine with more nuclear power plants, but if wind/solar plus batteries are cheaper, that&#39;s what&#39;s going to get built.Also, renewables don&#39;t require a high degree of trust in the human operators to manage risks appropriately.  I think that&#39;s really the main sticking point with nuclear; reliable reactors can be made, but how do you manage the humans who maintain the plants in a way that&#39;s not susceptible to corruption or corner-cutting?If nuclear can be made to handle more of our energy needs for a reasonable cost, then that&#39;s a good thing, and if it can be made cheaper by updating regulations without sacrificing safety, then I think that would be awesome.  But I think we should plan for the future under the assumption that most of our energy will come from renewables.  That&#39;s the lowest-risk plan that doesn&#39;t require major regulatory changes or new technology.  (Apparently there are also some major lithium iron phosphate patents that are expired or expiring soon, which should open up cheap battery manufacturing to companies outside of China.)"</p>

 &gt; “This is a window into the precarious reality of people who seldom appear in historical sources that were written almost exclusively by men belonging to the elite, and who as a result risk remaining invisible in the great historical accounts,” -
Many slaves were captured and famous intellectuals (Aesop is a famous example) or educated and used as tutors, they were not as modernists assume to be universally ill treated and abused. Slaves in Herculaneum were able to become free and it was a very racially diverse place where being a former slave of different racial background did not mean you were unable to have social mobility, many of the wealthy people of Herculaneum were indeed former slaves. Slavery was not a permanent state of being and the very elite the quoted author complains about often did write about slaves at least in name; the former slaves would take the last name of the old master and records were excellent."</p>

I swear that node hipsters at my last job spent four out of five of their working days wrangling with dependencies or their transpilers, linters, packagers, bundlers and whatever the hell else needs to happen to actually make a node program run. Meanwhile the geezers that worked on Java services reliably pushed new versions of their code sprint after sprint, no heroics, no drama required.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I appreciate the contrarian point of view, and I don&#39;t want to pick on the author, but this sounds like words of wisdom from someone who doesn&#39;t have much real world experience.I worked in such a project who never upgraded once. And then Specter/Meltdown hit, and we had the mandate to patch all our systems (and the threat was very real). Welcome to a hellish mess of outdated deps that took weeks to sort out.But is not only me. I watched a talk from a Principal Engineer from Amazon builder tools, and one of their biggest mistakes was not to upgrade often enough, which made each upgrade more painful.So what do we do now working in multiple, large, multi-year projects?First, we set tools that tell us when deps are outdated, and alarm when vulnerabilities are found.Second, upgrading deps is part of the regular dev process. When you make a change, take the chance to upgrade the deps. Vulnerabilities are addressed proactively. The vast majority of times upgrades require no code changes.Third, we regularly upgrade deps of inactive packages.Lastly, if a dependency upgrade requires significant work, we create a ticket for it and address it as a new feature. In practice this happens very rarely, so it doesn&#39;t disrupt the development process much.As other&#39;s said, the key is to upgrade often, and then it wont be as painful."</p>

If the second would also be a boy we could no longer give it this beautiful name. We knew the second would become a girl and we wanted to include the name Roan in it. After really long puzzling we came to the name: Norah. It contains all letters or Roan and an added H. Something for her specifically. When we had our third we wanted to do this again. Norah was already at the daycare by then and played a lot with a child called Roos. Somehow we liked the combination but it did not contain all the letters or Roan.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Pfizer’s phase 2/3 trial randomized non-hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients who were at high risk of progressing to severe illness to receive placebo or Paxlovid, a combination of the protease inhibitors  PF-07321332 and ritonavir. The efficacy analysis is based on 1,219 patients.One noteworthy feature is the newness of this drug:&gt; PF-07321332 was developed from scratch during the current pandemic. It’s a reversible covalent inhibitor that reacts with one of the main protease’s cysteine residues. Owen [director of medicinal chemistry at Pfizer] also discussed the chemistry involved in scaling up the compound. The first 7 mg of the compound were synthesized in late July 2020. Encouraged by the early biological data, the Pfizer team aimed to scale up the synthesis. By late October, they’d made 100 g of the compound. Just two weeks later, the chemists had scaled up the synthesis to more than 1 kg. Owen said 210 researchers had worked on the project.https://cen.acs.org/acs-news/acs-meeting-news/Pfizer-unveils...Less than two years from lab to clinic is highly unusual. If approved, I believe this would be the fastest lab-to-approval for a small molecule drug in the history of the FDA."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it’s hard to overstate what a big deal this is for science. This is a completely novel molecule that appears effective as an antiviral. This would a huge achievement for the field of drug design, and will hopefully lead to all kinds of great medicine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am thinking: if and when this is approved, we have to think about distribution.This drug is fantastically effective at preventing hospitalisation and death, if administered within three days of symptom onset.That gives quite a long time! But we still need to make it easy to take. Do pharmacies give it out? ER rooms? We don&#39;t want to wait until people are hospitalised; we are trying to avoid that.So when you test positive, does the government send you out a pill with the &#34;sorry, you have to isolate&#34; SMS?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the under appreciated legal precedents set a couple years ago was the Ohio V AmEx anti trust case. The case predicated against AmEx’s merchant contract forbidding merchants to steer customers away from using their Amex card. This was a common practice for many years, especially at restaurants since AmEx charged restaurants 6%.The Supreme Court ruled that amex was able to keep the anti-steering provision in merchant contracts because they defined credit cards as a two sided market, and the harm to customers couldn’t be proven. In essence, the Supreme Court set a precedent that in any 2 sided market, in order for something to be considered anti competitive, a high bar needed to be met: the government must show that both sides of a 2 sided market be harmed in order for something to be anti competitive.Had the ruling been the other way, almost every industry would have been impacted- Uber, App Stores, Advertising…etc are all 2 sided markets.In essence, Credit cards have had a huge impact to our lives this century for reasons that are not appreciated enough."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It’s often forgotten, but prior to credit cards, many Main Street retailers like e.g. pharmacies maintained hundreds or thousands of credit accounts for customers individually, necessitating their own back offices, accounting, and collections headache.This article is a great history of how the modern credit card came into being https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/magazine/19..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Debit cards are a very similar product with enough under-the-hood differences that they deserve their own moment in the sun. In particular, due to a quirk of U.S. interchange regulation, they basically fund most of the fintech industryBasically, the Durbin Amendment caps interchange on debit cards at a far, far lower rate than credit cards; they also have different networks (not MC or Visa) that can be run at least for in person transactions. However, the limit does not apply to banks with less than $10 billion in assets.This is why some online banks can offer lower fees and sometimes even debit cash back (1% is the most I&#39;ve seen though, so not competitive with credit). But its also why ever fintech under the sun pushes debit cards so heavily--the debit card is issued by a (small, non Durbin-covered) partner bank who then shares revenue with the fintech company.At the end of the day, credit cards are still significant better for customers. You can have multiple cards with different benefits while keeping all your money in one place, and you can prevent overdrafts because you don&#39;t have random subscriptions taking out unpredictable amounts of money in the middle of the night and causing a check to bounce the next day. You are no longer obsessing over &#34;early payday&#34; features or ACH speeds.Credit cards also provide a nice hack to allow cash deposit for those with only online banks--you can often use a big bank&#39;s ATM to make a payment towards the credit card, allowing you to get rid of ordinary amounts of cash."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Helion hasn&#39;t published the triple product results for their latest Trenta reactor, but for the previous Venti they achieved a triple product of ~10^19 keV.s/m^3 at an ion temperature of 2 keV. The Trenta reactor has achieved an ion temperature of 9 keV. For D-T fusion, you need a triple product of about 3x10^21 kev.s/m^3 at 10 keV. For the D-He reaction that helion intends to use, they need to achieve a similar triple product at 50 keV. So it looks like they&#39;re still 2-3 orders of magnitude off from where they need to be to achieve ignition. Their neutron production rate is comparable to industrial fusors at ~10^11 n/s, which while useful as neutron sources are nowhere near producing net power. Compare this with tokamaks that have achieved a triple product around 1.5x10^21 keV.s/m^3, or about half of what they need to achieve ignition.While it&#39;s possible that helion has made improvements to ion density and confinement allowing them to achieve a significantly higher triple product and close the gap to power production, I see no reason why a company looking for investment would hide such a result, especially while putting out press releases celebrating other milestones. I doubt they&#39;re anywhere near the point where an economical plant could even be considered, though I&#39;d love to be proven wrong."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The DoE is complicit in this as well (from the original article):&gt; In the letter to teachers, Education Commissioner Margie Vandeven said “an individual took the records of at least three educators, unencrypted the source code from the webpage, and viewed the social security number (SSN) of those specific educators.”&gt; But in the press release, DESE called the person who discovered the vulnerability a “hacker” and said that individual “took the records of at least three educators”This squares perfectly with my own experience. As a middle schooler I had several interactions with my school system&#39;s IT department where they baselessly accused me of hacking and malicious intent; I responsibly disclosed a method of bypassing their web content filter and they responded by going through my roaming profile and leveling charges at me of &#34;remotely hacking computer systems&#34; because of a screenshot of a terminal emulator they found. I was a good kid with a perfect disciplinary record. In retrospect it was a series of incompetent staffers covering for their inability by bullying a child.The US needs to stop using public facilities (schools, the military, etc) as white-collar welfare and hire more people that actually care. Ignorance is forgivable but when combined with a steadfast opposition to personal growth it becomes malicious. It&#39;d be better for society to fire clowns like these and administer them unemployment than to have them crowd out those that actually give a shit.*EDIT: To clarify for anybody that would read the above as &#34;government workers don&#39;t care&#34;: there are plenty that do.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Previous thread from 3 weeks ago: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28867562Recent developments:- The CS professor whose expert opinion was quoted by the newspaper article is demanding an apology and legal expenses from the state, alleging that the governor defamed and violated his free speech rights.- The governor&#39;s political fundraising committee is running ads making this a &#34;fake news&#34; issue.The email that the reporter sent, in advance of publishing the article revealing the state education website&#39;s data leakage:&gt; “I recently discovered a significant exposure of the sensitive data of more than 100,000 teachers on a DESE website,” Renaud wrote to the agency’s communications chief, Mallory McGowin. “At this point I am confident what I found is a genuine vulnerability — I have confirmed with three teachers from different districts that their data was exposed. I also have consulted an UMSL cybersecurity researcher who verified my findings. The P-D plans to publish a story about this sensitive data exposure, but we wanted to inform DESE first so that you would have a chance to mitigate the problem.”&gt; Renaud shared his timeline for publishing the story and asked for interviews with officials from DESE and the Missouri Office of Administration’s Information Technology Services Division. In a second email sent about 45 minutes later, he described the steps he’d taken in finding and confirming the vulnerability."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The governor&#39;s stance is just posture. &#34;We take these matters seriously&#34;.It reminds me of that time, a few years after I was out of college and into a job. My professor contacted me to demo my class project to her students. To give them an idea of what they can do with web development. Her assistant told me that they couldn&#39;t figure out how to run it.Of course, I took a day off from work, opened back up my school project, fixed the annoying bug. The web page required IIS to run so I could make Ajax requests. I decided to hardcode the data in json instead. So I went to school to present my project.The professor was double clicking the file and it wasn&#39;t displaying properly. I inserted my USB stick, and ran it from there instead. The coral reef restaurant website appeared on the big screen. I explained that I had to make some changes so it would work locally. Before, I was using a web server.&#34;Web server?&#34; she shouted. &#34;You are not allowed to use a web server. So you guys cheated!&#34;At first, I thought she was just kidding. I explained that Chapter 12 specifically asks to boot up IIS in order to make use of Ajax. During my time, the rest of the class stopped at chapter 10. I completed the entire book because I was just in love with learning JavaScript. So unless you get to chapter 12, you don&#39;t learn about Ajax.&#34;I&#39;ll have to report you. They board might revoke your grade. Not just you but all your group.&#34;You can only imagine how pale I became. But I understood what was happening. She had tried to run the project multiple times and failed. She couldn&#39;t debug it or figure out the issue. To save face in front of the class, she accused me of having cheated. This is the exact thing the Missourians officials are doing.No, at the end of the day my grades were not revokes. Plus I had dropped out of college and was working in the field for a few couple years already. But it goes to show you the length people would go just to save face."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to lead Sys Eng for a FTSE 100 company. Our data was valuable but only for a short amount of time. We were constantly scraped which cost us in hosting etc. We even seen competitors use our figures (good ones used it to offset their prices, bad ones just used it straight).
As the article suggest, we couldn&#39;t block mobile operator IPs,  some had over 100k customers behind them. Forcing the users to login did little as the scrapers just created accounts. 
We had a few approaches that minimised the scraping:Rate Limiting by login,Limiting data to know workflows
...But our most fruitful effort was when we removed limits and started giving &#34;bad&#34; data. By bad I mean alter the price up or down by a small percentage. This hit them in the pocket but again, wasn&#39;t a golden bullet. If the customer made a transaction on the altered figure we we informed them and took it at the correct price.It&#39;s a cool problem to tackle but it is just an arms race."</p>

Works like a charm and I can actualy see what it&#39;s doing and where it&#39;s going wrong. (though it&#39;s not scalable, of course)We use it for data-entry on a government website. A human would average around 10 minutes of clicking and typing, where the bot takes maybe 10 seconds. Last year we did 12000 entries. Good bot."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s somewhat refreshing that the underlying bug isn&#39;t from some C or C++ utility, but instead a Perl program using eval: https://github.com/exiftool/exiftool/blob/11.70/lib/Image/Ex... Another instance of &#34;avoid eval as much as possible&#34; for languages that have it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like this article could have been far more useful with the following points being explicitly mentioned, or at least summarized:  - the problem appeared in GitLab 11.9.0
  - the problem seems to have been fixed in GitLab 13.8.8
  - the vulnerability uses ExifTool, so to exploit it, a user needs to be able to upload images
  - if an update is not (yet) possible, DjVu format file uploads can be blocked to avert this vulnerability
  - this vulnerability isn&#39;t relevant for GitLab instances that just have 1 user, or are not publicly accessible on the Internet

Now, i&#39;m not saying that the above is entirely true, but after reading something like the above, one should be able to figure out how to best act:  - if you have a public GitLab instance with open registrations, consider updating it immediately (with backups in place, of course)
  - if you have a private GitLab instance with many users in your own corporate network (that somehow isn&#39;t updated yet) - this is a good reason to put updating it into your agenda today, even if your users aren&#39;t necessarily hostile
  - if you have a private GitLab instance or one with registrations closed (e.g. you&#39;re the only user or people that you trust use it), mark this down and update whenever possible, however it&#39;s probably not necessary right this moment

Of course, i can&#39;t say the above with 100% confidence, because the article itself lacks this actionable information to aid in decisionmaking and so i&#39;m left to piece things together on my own, because of which i could be wrong.On an unrelated note, DjVu is a pretty interesting file format, though sadly i&#39;ve only seen it be used very sparsely, on some Russian forums for tractor manuals or something: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DjVu"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;..Bowling said he discovered a way to abuse how ExifTool handles uploads for DjVu file format used for scanned documents to gain control over the entire underlying GitLab web server&#34;Ah, the good old &#34;File upload vulnerability&#34;.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s encouraging seeing all the work going into making tagged unions a natural part of TS. I&#39;ve tried to introduce them multiple times, and have been shot down by my team on every attempt. I think they still come across as &#34;hacky,&#34; and more JS-minded people who are totally cool validating with if-else everywhere still can&#39;t appreciate the benefits of annotating data in this manner. I hope TS eventually arrives at a standard, low impact way to create and manipulate such structures; maybe more people will be on board then. It looks like we&#39;re moving in the right direction."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very nice!The very, very related thing I found myself wishing I had just today is the ability to destructure discriminated union fields which only exist on one component type of the union.As an example, with the following type system:    type Output = OutputExists | OutputDoesntExist;
    interface OutputExists { exists: true, url: string };
    interface OutputDoesntExist { exists: false };

The ability to destructure like:    const f = ({ exists, url }: Output) =&gt; {}

Such that, at the time of destructuring:    exists: true | false
    url: string | undefined

I believe, with this PR, if we re-structured the types above to:    interface OutputDoesntExist { exists: false, url: undefined };

That destructuring would be possible, with all the control flow analysis necessary to make it useful. Today, even that wouldn&#39;t be possible, so definitely excited for this change.But, I&#39;m curious if anyone knows if this change can extend to situations where a field isn&#39;t even defined in one of the unions, and the compiler can just insert an undefined type for those fields. Or, maybe this would have some unresolveable side-effects I&#39;m not considering."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I&#39;m wondering: with all the bells and whistles and insanely complex things TS now supports, why does it still fail to catch seemingly simple mistakes?For instance, it&#39;s sooo easy to write a React component taking in another component as a prop and some props for that other component, to rendering it. But somehow lose the type safety of the props being passed in. Like, you write some generics and the compiler stops complaining inside your component. But if you go back out and then try to pass some weird props instead, it doesn&#39;t care. I feel it&#39;s too easy to write code that looks tyoe safe but subtly isn&#39;t."</p>

[1]The tools and vision they created after, just amazing coming from a small scrappy startup crew. Which, IMO, is totally wild given the offerings clearly tend to target bigger Enterprise who have bigger teams/apps/ops demand.Then to walk away from $50MM barely older than drinking age. [2]Seriously congratulations to them and the Hashicorp team.

We&#39;re a small startup, and I haven&#39;t had the time (or motivation) to learn what Docker, Kubernetes, containers, etc are. Seems overly complex.But, virtual servers I can understand. I&#39;ve been using Vagrant since 2013 and it ... just works. We&#39;ve built our own custom box to standardize our development environment as well.If there is one company and person I&#39;d like to mimic, it&#39;s Hashicorp and Mitchell. Work to build an amazing product or products, get it ready for a sale or IPO, and then transition into an IC to continue doing what I love: hacking.Congratulations on the success!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was the person who first deployed Python at Goldman Sachs. At the time it was an &#34;unapproved technology&#34; but the partner in charge of my division called me and said (This is literally word for word because partners didn&#39;t call me every day so I remember)    Err....hi Sean, It&#39;s Armen.  Uhh.... So I heard you like python.... well if someone was to uhh.... install python on the train... they probably wouldn&#39;t be fired.  Ok bye.

&#34;Installing python on the train&#34; meant pushing it out to all the computers globally in the securities division that did risk and pricing.  Within 30mins every computer in goldman sachs&#39;s securities division had python and I was the guy responsible for keeping the canonical python distribution up to date with the right set of modules etc on Linux, Solaris and Windows.Because it was unapproved technology I had a stream of people from technology coming to my desk to say I shouldn&#39;t have done it.  I redirected them to Armen (who was a very important dude that everyone was frightened of).The core engineers from GS went on to build the Athena system at JP and the Quartz platform at BAML.//Edit for grammar"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m seeing a lot of people speculating about which bank this might be; I think the point is that it&#39;s all of them. I could loosely describe a previous job as implementing Morgan Stanley&#39;s Walpole and integrating more source code management into Minerva (even though that system wasn&#39;t actually Python-based).Having a global view on everything is large banks&#39; value-add, it&#39;s why they haven&#39;t been outcompeted by their more nimble competitors. Being able to calculate the risk of the whole bank isn&#39;t just a cool feature, it&#39;s the core value proposition of this platform.Being able to just upload your code and run it is really cool, and if you squint it looks a bit like what the outside world is trying to set up with serverless/lambda-style platforms - just write a function, submit it, and there, it&#39;s running. (But it&#39;s worth remembering that Python is not a typical programming language; python build, dependency and deployment management is exceptionally awful in every respect, this isn&#39;t as big a pain point in other languages). Obviously there&#39;s a tension between this and having good version control, diffs, easy rollbacks etc. - but because Minevera is already designed to do all that for data (because you need that kind of functionality for modifications to your bonds or whatever), doing it this way strikes a much better compromise than something like editing PHP files directly on your live server.What this article calls data-first design has a lot in common with functional programming. I hope that as the outside world adopts more functional programming and non-relational datastores, Minerva-style programming will get more popular. It really is a much better way to write code in many ways. The difficulty of integrating with outside libraries is a shame though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"BAML Quartz was conceived by a bunch of front-office quants who had not the first idea about the software needs of a big bank beyond the front office. There was an arrogant assumption that front office software is obviously the most complicated/difficult variety of software within a bank and therefore any system designed with front office requirements at the forefront would, of course, be perfect for universal use.This assumption was challenged at the time by various groups - I was closest to the Equities Operations software team (although not part of it) who absolutely dug in their heels and refused to use Quartz. The assumption was explosively invalidated when people started implementing in Quartz applications that fell under Sarbanes/Oxley regulations and Quartz picked up a severity 1 audit finding - because Quartz was explicitly designed for &#34;Hyper Agility&#34; (literal quote from the quartz docs) - and anyone-can-change-anything-at-any-time does not make for applications that the regulators trust.There was an interesting trajectory of Python hiring during my time at BAML. I joined just as Quartz was getting started and we managed to easily hire tens of python devs in London because it was easy to sell the fact that BAML was making a strategic investment in Python and therefore their (at the time relatively uncommon) skills would be highly valued. But as Quartz matured, Python developers generally came to dislike it (for reasons see original article) and it became hard to retain the best ones. And after a while Python 2.x became a massive embarrassment and, as Python became a more common skill in the marketplace, it became harder to hire good developers into BAML."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The first thing that jumps out is Sweden has a national identity system, BankID. The APIs appear to be protected using those credentials. With that in mind I have two questions:1. Who owns the data?2. Should public funds be used for the creation of private APIs that manage the data?The answer to (1) has consequences for (2).I think many HN readers, including myself, and certainly these parents would argue that the data is the property of the parents. If you see the data as being the property of the parents then you would see the APIs as being the means for retrieving and manipulating your data - data that&#39;s protected by this national BankID identification.It appears the school system believes the data is their data, and not the parents&#39; data. Therefore retrieving the data through any other means than the &#34;official&#34; app is a potential data breach.So who is right? Think about the data we manage on behalf of our customers, for example. Who owns that data? What rights do our customers have in accessing and managing that data?This is a really interesting case and hopefully will force the answer to these questions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; In some cases, people’s personal information could be accessed from Google searches.SEO providers should take a note here.&gt; It warned parents to stop using the app and alleged that it might be illegally accessing people’s personal informationIf your API allows data extraction, it probably isn&#39;t a fault of any client. Perhaps they meant that creators could steal credentials. A problem with any software.I think this digital child managing system sounds moderately dystopian to be honest. I would have hated to give my parents access to anything like this. Kids will of course learn from how their parents behave...An open API is a must in my opinion, but the rest of the App should be open source too.That said, I don&#39;t really see the Swedish strategy as a model for other countries to follow. You don&#39;t need to give children chromebooks to learn. These are skills they have already mastered far better than their parents. They will learn about domain specific apps and there are indeed some really good ones, but such platform can also limit creativity because they are essentially sandpits. Depending on age that might be appropriate, but kids may have greater ambitions than their parents."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good tips... but in reality if you&#39;re working full-time (especially in a software related role), you may find yourself depleted before you get to the keyboard.It took us 5 years to finish our game (everyone started from 0 knowledge on how to make games, so it was a rocky road), and for the last 1.5-2 years my life was absolute hell.I&#39;d push hard at work for 9 hours a day, eat, then push hard on the side project for 8-9 hours a day, sleep, wake up, and just keep going. One day a week maybe I&#39;d just sleep. Not having &#34;pure energy&#34; for the side project meant that everything suffered.We had to learn-by-trial virtually _everything_, I don&#39;t recommend ever doing a big project that way.If you want to finish a game, choose a small game. Start doing game jams. Practice _finishing_. You can do more and more later.Or, go for it, do it our way, all in to win (win is subjective, the pride is real, the monetary result didn&#39;t really do anything meaningful for so much investment). I wouldn&#39;t do it this way again, but I understand people who do.All that said, the joy of doing something for us by us is not something I&#39;ve encountered in my 15 year career yet. So... if you&#39;ve never built something (and truly finished!), but you want to try... go for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not discussed in the article: You have to have the support of the people in your life this will impact. For example, the 7-9am timeslot for working, as listed in the article, will impact my family, as that is when I&#39;m getting the kids up and off to school. OK, so I could move it to 5am to 7am, but that would mean I&#39;d need to go to bed earlier, which eliminates important evening time with my wife. Similarly, I could do it from 8pm to 10pm, but that also affects my relationship with my wife, and my social life in general.This isn&#39;t to say that people with a family can&#39;t do these things, but that you need to acknowledge the impact it will have on other people, and plan with them to make it work. For example, I often make the time for my wife to work on her novels between 7pm and 9pm. I get the kids to bed and do some cleaning, while she writes, and we still get to connect before sleep."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here are my side project tips:1) As the article states, work on your side project first in the morning before your work. You will be too tired after work. Yes, this means your not really giving 100% at work. Hopefully your good enough at your job that this is OK.2) Create little task lists, with short little tasks... Then knock those tasks out one by one. If you find yourself procrastinating about some task do another little task first, then later make a quick spur of the moment decision to go do the procrastination task.3) It&#39;s OK to dream about the best case scenario, but also have realistic side goals: &#34;worst case scenario, I&#39;ve built a cool engine for my next project.&#34;4) DO create the right amount of tests (too little and your going to be creating buggy crap code, too many and you&#39;re bogged down updating your tests constantly)... get a feel for what your right amount is.5) Don&#39;t type so much, think more... think through designs... use paper, be messy and redraw... all of this is faster than building the wrong thing.6) I think its OK to be quirky. Make the thing YOU want to make. This is another way to monetize: your mental health is worth a lot and personally I find bringing shit that I want to exist into the world just the way I want them to be is a good trick for staying happy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, what a fascinating article. It still blows my mind that annually his organization made seven times more than the Sinaloa Cartel. I think the last paragraph says it all:&gt;What gave traditional organized crime its strength in the past—the violence, the control of territory, the ethnic loyalty and defined hierarchies—are the heart of its weakness in the present. Tse had a better system. Instead of ethnic loyalty, transnational and inter-organizational co-operation. Instead of territory, logistics. Instead of hierarchy, metrics. Instead of centralized control, connections. Tse Chi Lop is easily the most significant criminal in Toronto’s history, and he represents, in an entirely diseased way, a perverse triumph of the city. His vast criminal organization flourished through open-mindedness and entrepreneurship, by creating markets and exploiting them in a spirit of eager globalization and cosmopolitanism.Imagine how much money criminal syndicates could make if they took notes from this guy and all worked together."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a National Geographic documentary series called Drugs, Inc. [1] that I find fascinating.Let&#39;s set aside what an abject failure the so-called War on Drugs has been in the US and the violence of the drug trade and just appreciate the market economics for a second.One episode listed all the stages coca leaves took to becoming crack cocaine. Processing in jungle labs, transportation to smugglers, further processing, flying to Mexico, entering the US and distribution. And each stage there is loss to law enforcement, rival gangs, theft, etc and that loss rate is reflected in how the price jumps at each stage.In another, it detailed how meth (IIRC) entered the US primarily in Phoenix. As a result, Phoenix has (so the show said) the cheapest meth in the US. For every 1000 miles you radiated away from Phoenix, the price doubled.To me it was fascinating to see people who generally had little education, came from terrible backgrounds and grew up amidst crime and violence talk about the math of distance and price and how it impacted his distribution organization. It&#39;s sad to see someone who actually has a talent for hustling and basically sales be lost to the drug world.This is yet another reason why I think the &#34;are you a felon?&#34; question should basically be outlawed in the US.Additionally you  see how organizations have evolved to insulate themselves from disruption (from rivals or law enforcement). Most people know very little and certainly not the big picture. Merchandise frequently changes hands.I don&#39;t know what the solution here is. I fully support legalization of recreational cannabis in any world where alcohol consumption is legal. I certainly don&#39;t think we should be sending people to prison for possession.At the same time, you have cities like Seattle, Portland and San Francisco that are literally being destroyed by non-policing of drugs and small property crime.But the US prison industrial complex is and always has been a direct attack on the poor and minorities.[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drugs,_Inc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From https://luau-lang.org/typecheck&gt; Luau’s type system is structural by defaultI think that makes it the second (production-ready) language to have a primarily-structural type system, after TypeScript/Flow(/and Closure to some extent) for JS. I wonder if it will follow in their impressive footsteps or if it will tread new territory.One of the things that Flow gets right that TypeScript doesn&#39;t yet support is switching to nominal type-checking between class instances. In TypeScript you can assign an instance of one class to an instance of another as long as they have compatible fields. Compare:Flow: https://bit.ly/3jZx4rBTS: https://tsplay.dev/mZaL1NTypeScript doesn&#39;t have any understanding of prototypes or prototypal inheritance, which is a big gap considering that it&#39;s a fundamental aspect of JS.I&#39;m really hoping Luau will come to do the right thing with tables and prototypes. Perhaps it already does, but unfortunately there doesn&#39;t seem to be a Luau playground to try in the browser."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If any of the Luau devs are watching this, please flesh out the metamethods. I&#39;d switch almost everything to Luau if they were improved.They&#39;re the biggest PITA right now as designed in PUC-Rio, and I see that while you&#39;ve improved upon __eq, other metamethods are still lacking.In PUC-Rio, boolean equality operators FORCE a boolean result, regardless of what you return. Ideally they would allow returning any result type, which then can be coerced to boolean later (e.g. by an `if` statement), just like the arithmetic operators do.Further, `__neq`, `__ge` and `__gt` do not exist. They should.The lack of a proper metamethod design means that binding to e.g. Kiwi[0] is impossible without some incredibly fugly hacks. It has been a long-standing annoyance with Lua in an otherwise beautiful little scripting language (that I use frequently).This looks quite nice - lots of attempts in this space but nothing that attempts to match Lua to this degree.[0] https://github.com/nucleic/kiwi"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Heck yeah.I don&#39;t know what this fork changes, but I love how many game engines will take lua and expand it to fit their exact needs like this.Very few scripting languages make it as easy to do as lua.This is an interesting related project:https://moonscript.org/It compiles down to lua, and really beefs everything up. Interface is super nice too. You just put `require &#34;moonscript&#34;` at the top of the file and you&#39;re done, now just write your code in moon script."</p>

They went the extra distance to get a permission/license from the US government specially to offer full Github to developers from Iran. Many other companies didn&#39;t do something similar.[1]: https://github.blog/2021-01-05-advancing-developer-freedom-g..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most people probably say this just to be like “I know Nat, look at me.” I don’t know how to phrase this to avoid that:Nat is an incredible person. I’ve been lucky to get to know him over the past couple months. Not only is he super chill, but he’s also not afraid to ask basic questions. Many of you might roll your eyes at that, but it’s a real problem: when you’re organizing something, you feel pressured to know everything, or else you’ll lose people’s confidence. So all the people who try to act confident also rarely ask basic questions.Hackers are the opposite. We’re always focused on breaking down problems into the most basic components, and then building up complexity once we understand the system.When Nat reached out to me, I didn’t know what to expect. But I certainly didn’t expect him to be a fellow hacker that happened to be famous. I think it’s incredible that someone can go so long without losing that spirit — imagine suddenly having a boatload of money. Most of us would probably take things easier.Another surprise is how incredibly chill he is. When things go seriously wrong, he’s totally cool about it, in a way that’s hard to put into words. I learned the phrase “No stress, friend” from him, and I’ve used it a few times to soothe other people. As cliche as it sounds, sometimes it’s the one thing in the world you need to hear.I wish I could tell a certain story to underscore the point, but Nat’s stories are his to tell. I hope he writes a book someday — nothing fancy, just a raw thought stream of all his experiences.And I wish I could share his future ambition. It’s so exciting that I can hardly contain myself. It might not work out, but that’s true of everything.I don’t know if anyone will see this. But I just wanted to write a little note to say how rare Nat is. He actually cares — deeply — and also cares about you. Most leaders don’t.If someone reading this has the opportunity to work with him on his new project, I encourage you to leave your cushy job on that basis alone. It’ll be fun in a way you won’t experience elsewhere."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"No, it is not. Neither is Roblox or Fortnite, or VRchat. A single game or world is NOT the metaverse, what is so hard to understand about that for journalists and companies?The metaverse is the immersive internet, as a successor to our current one that is more 2D oriented around photos/videos/text today. It&#39;s a paradigm shift in how we interact, but most importantly there will be many of these virtual worlds/spaces interconnected together to form an actual network that nobody outright owns. To get to this future, we need protocols/standards to allow virtual worlds to talk to one another and agree that users can hop back in forth between them seamlessly, across all platforms.More specifically, the way we use the web today to navigate from webpage to another is how we we traverse the metaverse. The core problem that needs to get solved right now is interoperability, to enable the &#34;web of 3D&#34;.Look to WebGPU, WebAssembly, and WebXR as cornerstone technologies here. Our startup is building the &#34;3D/VR web&#34; in this way, and our current focus is getting proper HTML5 exporting from the native game engines, currently Unreal Engine. We&#39;re also building out a suite of tooling to empower developers and creators along with our hosting/discovery platform that includes advanced texture compression + asynchronous asset fetching to enable 3D/VR websites that load as quickly as a regular 2D page. If you&#39;re a developer and are interested in our work, you can join our Discord here:https://discord.gg/zUSZ3T8"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“What is so hard for people to understand” says HN commenter: “the metaverse clearly means [my definition of the metaverse] why can’t people see this?!!”Well, Zuckerberg didn’t give a clear definition, the term itself is made up, and it doesn’t currently exist (otherwise, what would we be building?).So no you don’t know what it means or how it will turn out, and neither does Zuckerberg. He might have a vision of what he’d like it to be and how he’s going to make money out of it, but he’s very probably very wrong.It’s obvious a deeply immersive experience will eventually arrive but it seems far from obvious how it will be used, much like predicting the rise of Tik Tok in 1990 based on email and usenet.The best way to predict the future is to make it. Hackers built much of the early internet, so let’s go build the early metaverse and at least make something insanely experimental and magical and beautiful before the next Zuckerberg comes alone and devalues it."</p>

You have the very very last computer on earth running
an ancient version of Backblaze (version 1.5.2.390) that
NO LONGER WORKS (too old, needs updating).You are paying for a service you are not using.
You have two choices:1) Upgrade your Mac OS X 10.5 computer called &#34;rlmmbp&#34;
    to the latest Backblaze.  Just visit our homepage
    and download it and install right over the top of
    what you have already, here is a URL:
    https://secure.backblaze.com/update.htm
    (Will take less than 5 seconds, totally free,
    you are already paying!)2) Do nothing -&gt; in 7 more days I will delete that
     machine&#39;s backup and all of the files in the backup,
     and you will be paying for an unused license.
     (I can provide instructions on how to cancel your
     billing if you need them.)If you have any questions, feel free to contact me

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an interesting moment to reflect on the wacky nature of IPO vs ICO valuations.  Backblaze and Filecoin are, roughly speaking, in the same business (providing bulk file storage).  Backblaze is looking to raise ~$100 million at a valuation of about $0.7 billion.  Filecoin raised $250 million in their ICO, and the coin has a current &#34;market cap&#34; of about $7 billion.  Backblaze owns about 1.8 EiB of storage, Filecoin has about 13 EiB &#34;pledged&#34;, so if you consider those measurements comparable the $ of valuation per EiB is similar.  Businesses generally get valued more on what they bring in than what they own however, and Backblaze takes in ~$65 million/year revenue (~$175K/day).   I&#39;m not entirely clear what would be analogous to revenue for Filecoin, but they &#34;mine&#34; ~330K coins per day, which at current prices is about $21 million (or $7.8 billion per year?).  Now here&#39;s where it gets crazy... based on the current average reward if Backblaze dedicated all of their storage to Filecoin mining they could (theoretically) generate about $2.5 million a day (or $900 million/year, about 13x what they bring in now).Backblaze did look into farming Chia at some point[1], don&#39;t know if they&#39;ve done similar experiments with Filecoin, but it definitely seems like there is a profound disconnect between these two worlds (which could be the result of some other factor, like the USD value of Bitcoin).[1] https://www.backblaze.com/blog/chia-analysis-to-farm-or-not-..."</p>

Great, talented coworkers who I could constantly learn from, management chain from bottom to top of former engineers, so they understood when you would say, &#34;I worked on this for a week but have no results because it didn&#39;t work&#34;.  Plenty of resources to do what you needed to do, and lots of autonomy to do what you thought was right.  Very little process and upper management actively moved to eliminate what little process there was.  Unlimited vacation time that was real -- management took long vacations to set an example and would actively encourage everyone to do the same.  And of course a great paycheck which included 10%+ raises because they made sure that new people didn&#39;t make more than veterans.I&#39;ll be the first to admit it&#39;s not for everyone.  As they say, they are a sports team, not a family.  Perform well and be rewarded handsomely, perform poorly and get cut with a big check.

That doesn&#39;t mean we never have disagreements, but they tend to be technical disagreements about the best approach to reach the same goal. Before the pandemic, and hopefully after it, the kitchen was the center of the company: casual questions turned into great discussions, explanations... there&#39;s a big whiteboard wall in the kitchen, and it got used a lot.That goal, incidentally, is to drive down the cost of good portfolio analysis until it&#39;s within everyone&#39;s reach. We&#39;re succeeding: there are clients who have programs where people start their investments with $50/week.Our folks are reasonably diverse in terms of background and talents.

It’s able to mill wood and aluminium, up to ~20mm thick.As with all my other projects, I think they should be executed in the open where other people can learn from my mistakes and get inspired to build their own things! Therefore I’ve spend a lot of time writing a free complete tutorial of the build, documenting every step with text and detailed images, creating a complete bill of materials (including STL-files for the 3d-printed parts) etc. I don’t want any dependencies on DIY-websites, so I’ve hosted it on GitHub, where anyone can clone it locally.I built this machine to gain more knowledge about mechanical engineering, electrical wiring, stepper motors, GRBL, CAD, CAM etc. Also, I guess I can build new fun things with the machine? Overly-engineered birdhouses maybe?Setup:* It’s running on an Arduino Uno, CNC-shield and GRBL.* 40 parts are 3d-printed (all the red parts in the video)* It’s based on Ivan Miranda’s blueprints, but I’ve adjusted some parts and structured the bill of materials.* It uses 2x 19:1 geared NEMA17 stepper motors for the Y-axis and 1x for the X-axis. The Z-axis is using a standard NEMA17 motor.* HTD5M belts and pulleys are used for X-axis and Y-axis. GT2 belt and pulleys are used for the Z-axis.If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

Ideally a whole house and most of the furniture...If anyone has any ideas on how to accelerate build times of open hardware, that&#39;s something I&#39;m trying to solve. Creating high quality instructionals is a huge amount of work and I think instructionals should be automatically generated by computer vision and have interactable elements, ideally AR, but even just highlighting wiring diagrams on hovering would be hugely helpful. Even if things are well documented, replication is still insanely pyrrhic without economy of scale or universal fabrication.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This bit really caught my attention:&gt; In contrast, this website runs on an off-the-grid solar power system with its own energy storage, and will go off-line during longer periods of cloudy weather. Less than 100% reliability is essential for the sustainability of an off-the-grid solar system, because above a certain threshold the fossil fuel energy used for producing and replacing the batteries is higher than the fossil fuel energy saved by the solar panels.This, in particular, is an amazing take:&gt; Less than 100% reliability is essential for the sustainability of an off-the-grid solar systemSaying that sacrificing uptime is a good thing for achieving a particular goal is a take that&#39;s so wildly out of line with what most of the industry believes is refreshing, because it really makes you think. What would the world look like, if instead of being obsessed with SRE we simply assumed or accepted that there will be downtime, and treated it like something perfectly normal. Maybe a nice message at ingress/load balancer level, telling everyone that the site will be back in a bit.I have no illusions that any company would want something like that, or that it&#39;s even feasible for many industries, e.g. healthcare, though the Latvian &#34;e-health&#34; system is an accidental experiment of this at the cost of around 15 million euros of taxpayer money: https://www-lsm-lv.translate.goog/raksts/zinas/latvija/par-e... .However, if companies have working hours, why couldn&#39;t websites? What a funny thought.Edit: on an unrelated note, it&#39;s wild how different setups can be.For example:&gt; The web server uses between 1 and 2.5 watts of power...While at the same time, i have two servers with 200GEs (essentially consumer hardware) running in my homelab, with a TDP of 35W each, though with the UPS and its inefficiencies, as well as the 4G router, the total energy consumption that i have to deal with is around 100W. Granted, i also use them for backups and as CI nodes, but there&#39;s still a difference of 20 - 50 times more power usage between one of my servers and one of theirs. I guess one can definitely talk about the differences between x86 and ARM there as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As they describe being open to ideas and feedback: maybe using static compression could help. The concept is to pre-compress files (have foo.html.gz available next to foo.html) so that the web server does not have to compress on-the-fly. nginx supports it[0] and gzip_static does not appear in their nginx config[1].It might not make a difference if nginx has a in-RAM cache of the compressed files. Otherwise, it has the potential to be pretty significant assuming most requests are made using &#34;Accept-Encoding: gzip&#34; and assuming the web server does not prefer other compression algorithms (eg. Brotli).[0]: https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_gzip_static_module.h...[1]: https://homebrewserver.club/low-tech-website-howto.html#full..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The way the last administration rolled this out was certainly with a political narrative, but my guess is it originated with people that weren&#39;t thinking at all about politics.The simple story is that core infrastructure is of strategic national importance, and an elevated risk that infrastructure is compromised can never be worth whatever the benefits are of using a particular supplier&#39;s equipment.  There is no practical way to 100% ensure that every piece of software, and every chip, in every piece of equipment is clean.  Chips are especially scary (the push to have domestic chip fab by the US and other countries is about more than just supply chain).This is true when it comes from what are considered trustworthy suppliers as well, but you&#39;re dealing with probabilities.  I think that regardless of whether this move fits into a political narrative about China, or &#34;economic warfare&#34;, the practical basis is that for some types of equipment, the risk is just too large and the ability to mitigate too limited, in general.Unfortunately this was figured out with Huawei/ZTE after the fact, but tbh I don&#39;t think the specific company matters at all, it just happened to be they were in this business at the time &amp; based in the wrong country."</p>

All authorizations are temporary - between three and eight years.This is not just about security in a narrow definition, but in a large part about ensuring that mastery of strategic functions remains with European firms.Like armaments, telecommunication infrastructures are not a normal market."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I could put on my conspiracy hat... Perhaps this is related to Canada&#39;s detention of he Huawei executive. Someone put their foot down and said Chinese hardware is spying on us, and perhaps they forced China to give up how.At it&#39;s core, the world absolutely cannot trust China. Because Huawei is a de facto company owned by the Chinese government, it stands to reason that the distrust must be extended to Huawei. The product may be good, but China has very little credibility anymore, and should absolutely not be trusted."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thank you, whomever did this!  I asked for it in a comment recently.This video basically is making fun of a common situation of Google at the time, where a person wants to serve up some data for analytics, but the sysadmins expect the person to follow a process intended for much more complex and high availability services run by teams of skilled engineers.It parodies SRE as a BOFH sysadmin, even though in general SRE are quite easygoing and helpful.It helped poked fun at a number of overly stuffy processes and also helped push people to make hosting modest datasets (like this 5TB one) easier."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Background: https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2021/10/30/5tb/This video was hugely influential on changing the way Google does internal tools and operations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a Googler, it&#39;s often easier for me to setup a GCP consumer account, AWS, or Heroku account to demo something, compared to using anything internal. I remember the most annoying situation was like 10 years ago when me and other engineers ported Quake 2 to run in Chrome, we were in a time crunch to demo it multiplayer, and I ended up setting up an AWS account to serve it. But then I left it running and forgot and ended up getting a few hundred dollars billed to me because the Quake2 server was chewing CPU."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is really cool.  I&#39;m 30 right now, and only just recently finished my bachelors and have been looking to get a PhD, but it&#39;s really hard to find a program that will let you work full time while doing it. It doesn&#39;t help that a part of me does sort of feel &#34;too old&#34; to do this sometimes.  The PhD system in the US is really tailored around the assumption that you haven&#39;t entered the corporate world yet.Anyway, it&#39;s really inspiring that someone almost three times my age pushed himself through the program. I guess it&#39;s important to remember that you really shouldn&#39;t give up on your dreams."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is very inspiring. I too am young and been in the work force for several years, but unlike the other comments in this thread I am
not settled down as an older student returning to school.I am willing to give up a high paying salary to return back to school as a PhD student and I am
not tied down with a mortgage or anything else.I find mathematics simply too interesting to not learn at the highest level. Working in industry will simply not teach me the material I want to learn. I’m considering going back for either a  PhD in Math or a math heavy PhD in CS. I read math textbooks for fun and worked with tutors to ensure my proofs are done correctly. I can do this for hours on end without external motivation. I taught myself a lot of math and can see myself doing this as a career. I want to do research.Most people my age say the same things in the comment sections in this thread (tied down to a mortgage, make too much money to return). I’m glad generalizations like these don’t apply to me and can’t wait to get back to school"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a university student in my last year of undergrad, I&#39;ve been tempted to go work as a software engineer, even though I&#39;m interested in doing research. The opportunity cost just seems too large to give up. Working as a SWE will allow me to earn a massive income in my 20s, during which I have few defendants and a lot of leisure time. While many of my peers are planning to do graduate school right away, I feel like my quality of life would simply be better by going to work in industry right now.With that said, I still love learning and diving deeply into topics like math and the history of science. I hope that I can one day retire off my savings as a SWE and return to graduate school (maybe in my late 30s or 40s). Has anyone done this before? Is there a stigma against graduate students (both Masters and PhD) who are not in their 20s?"</p>

I read a great book on this back in the 80&#39;s and can&#39;t remember the name. It was about the early days of CAD and its origins.Like, the control points on splines were called &#34;ducks&#34;, which were weights attached to spring steel suspended from the ceiling of the studio, which caused the steel to bend into particular shapes computed mathematically beforehand by the design engineers. These curves were used to guide model making. It was a fascinating book."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I did this after seeing this before on HN. There were a few processes that were manual that benefitted from the technique in the article.Learn from my folly: I even called them “do nothing scripts,” referencing this article. However; I was judged by peers for not writing the full automation versions as they didn’t appreciate the idea of gradual automation (programmer hubris?). Saying “do nothing scripts” in meetings did catch the awkward attention of leadership.As a description, “do nothing” communicates a lot. As a brand, “do nothing” can use some improvements.My short prescription of turning “do nothings” into “do some things” into “do all the things” didn’t help. We had some new people join the team and they had fun turning the do nothing scripts into a document. * Sigh *I still build these type of process description scripts still. I usually don’t advertise them to peers until they do some of the things nowadays."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My experience in corporate IT convinced me that even if an entire release could be automated down to a single press of a giant red button (and even if undoing the release could be another, single button), then culturally our organization would still figure out a way to turn the pressing of that button into a six hour ordeal requiring the participation of twelve people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The idea here can be generalized to a primitive programming construct: The magic function &#34;wish&#34;, which can do anything you want, just give it a string description.For example:    wish(&#39;copy these files to this host&#39;, files, host)

You can augment this further by allowing the program to specify a return type from the wish, and magically the wish will produce the type you want. So for example:    data = wish(Path, &#39;the path of the data files I need&#39;)

Of course, the wish is actually implemented by sending a request to some human user. In my &#34;wish&#34; library for Python http://rsyscall.org/wish/ you can have a stack of handlers for wishes, just like exception handlers.  If later you want to automate some wish, you can specify a handler which intercepts certain wishes and forwards the other ones on (by wishing again, just like an exception handler can re-raise)."</p>

Basically, all videos start half decent but for some reason end in a big noisy mess, weird sounds, spoiling food, questionable product placements, zero creativity and always incentivize more watching and trapping viewers in the infinite ‘next video’ loop.Instead, one of the goals for my videos will be to take a step back and inspire to create, zero commercial interest, not too much distractions and something parents can trust.Still in the process of figuring out all the parameters, camera, editing, setup etc but its a lot of fun learning new skills. I have a million ideas for the content already so enough work to be done. If there is little to no ‘success’ in terms of viewers, i really don’t care since i enjoy all aspects of it and im building a nice catalog of creative videos to watch with my kid later.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hah this thread is perfect. I just finished building my new four axis robot arm design. It’s all open source. Three months ago I started playing with a new planetary gearbox concept, where the first stage is in the middle with second stages on both sides. The first sun is driven by a shaft that goes through a hole in the second stage sun. The result is a very balanced joint design with parallel outputs. A good configuration for weak materials like plastic. And then the gearboxes and the frame are all integrated together, so this is not something where you assemble a gearbox and bolt it to the frame. The gearbox members and the frame members are unified.I’m very happy with it so far! Video here:https://twitter.com/tlalexander/status/1455320442642714625?s...It’s open source, CC0 licensed. Please fork the design files here!https://cad.onshape.com/documents/d663661f8c0c34e7a29bbfa6/w...EDIT: you may prefer to watch the project and wait to fork it until I have fleshed out a few more things. In that case feel free to star this git repo and I will update it as I make progress.https://github.com/tlalexander/brushless_robot_arm/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Does a history of enforcement help in cases like this? The article itself says that Truth Social is &#34;antithetical&#34; to Mastodon&#39;s values, but that there&#39;s nothing they can do about the usage of their software other than license violations. It sounds like they have a bias to enforce their license in this case.If Mastodon has a weak history of enforcing their license to other organizations, does it weaken the case? I&#39;m wondering if selective enforcement in the software-licensing world hurts the authority or credibility of a license, in the eyes of the law.My wondering was somewhat inspired by the way Nintendo aggressively polices the appearance of its video game trademarks on places like YouTube and basically the rest of the internet. I hear an argument is that if they don&#39;t aggressively enforce their trademark policing, their legal position wouldn&#39;t be as strong if they want to pursue a big violation in the future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In terms of &#34;antithetical values&#34;, the machine learning project ml5js.org actually did something about this.  They bound their open-source license to a Code of Conduct¹, which forbids the use of their ML software for (1) discriminating against marginalized communities, (2) building tools that disingenuously manipulate public opinion, (3) building tools of mass surveillance and prediction to repress the rights of people, and (4) building tools that control weapons, including tools that automate the deployment, operation, and targeting of weapons.Reported violations of the Code of Conduct are sent to a Steering Committee, made up of members of the community, who determine if the reported project is in violation of the Code of Conduct.  If so, the Committee takes steps to remedy the situation (e.g. realigning project with the Code of Conduct, or removing ml5.js from the project) — and if no resolution is found, the project falls out of compliance with the terms of the software license.It&#39;s an interesting experiment.² Software is a tool to help us solve problems and reach desired outcomes.  Licenses are also a tool to help us solve problems and reach desired outcomes.  When desired outcomes exclude certain things (e.g. discrimination of marginalized communities, manipulation of public opinion, autonomous weapons, values antithetical to that of a community), it seems a Code of Conduct can also be a worthwhile tool to solve problems and support the outcomes that the community is working towards.  (Of course, wisdom and governance are crucial and not to be taken for granted.  Shout out DKP servers³ for showing some light there.)¹ ml5.js Code of Conduct: https://github.com/ml5js/Code-of-Conduct/² Analysis from KE Mitchell on ml5.js licensing: https://writing.kemitchell.com/2021/01/12/ml5js-Takes-a-Stan...³ On Dragon Kill Points and governance systems in World of Warcraft: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=958945"</p>

The head of a company with a privileged view of the US residential real estate sector says that the market is &#34;unpredictable.&#34; Not the good kind of unpredictable where you can&#39;t figure out how heavy the money bags that get dropped at your door will be. No, it&#39;s the bad kind of unpredictability where you can... lose money.Reading between the lines, I conclude that Zillow sees a major shakeout in real estate on the horizon. They&#39;ve already been hit with losses and see a lot more where that came from. In an effort to get ahead of whatever is approaching, the company is making an abrupt exit from the home flipping business.Zillow was founded in 2006, as the last US housing market bubble was furiously inflating. It has seen a complete cycle of boom/bust. If anybody knows the US residential real estate sector, it is Zillow."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"General grumpiness about this particular design decision aside, it appears that since the T2 Macs, the main SSD was being used to store core system firmware. On T2 I think it&#39;s BridgeOS that sends the EFI image to the Intel side to boot it, and it does the firmware verification and loading.This setup has a benefit; namely, it is now impossible to brick the system with a bad BIOS/EFI flash, and you&#39;ll never need to use a hardware SPI flasher to recover. Just like the iPhone, you can enter Boot ROM DFU mode, which can&#39;t easily be overwritten, and restore all of the firmware on the system that&#39;s writable.This is great for restoring systems to a known good firmware state, including SSD, EFI, BridgeOS, RecoveryOS. On a normal system, there is plenty of non volatile storage that is difficult to recover or reset.The primary argument against soldering the SSD, or really any other part, down like this tends to be that &#34;Oh, now you can&#39;t just save money by upgrading it yourself|replacing it when it breaks&#34;. On the other side, these machines are engineered as appliances that should achieve a certain degree of reliability. The SSD is reasonably considered to last the &#34;lifetime&#34; of the product, and should it fail, I don&#39;t consider the inability to externally boot to be a huge problem, since whatever failure damaged the SSD is statistically likely to compromise the reliability of the rest of the board. Any failure is grounds for &#34;rework&#34; of the board on a hardware level if necessary,up to and including repair/replacement of the onboard flash, and not just a simple workaround in my opinion. Note that they don&#39;t force you to actually USE the internal SSD - you can still netboot or USB boot I think. It just has to work.Trivia:
-At least on T2 systems, the flash memory itself (the NAND chips) on the mainboard can actually be swapped between units after a DFU restore by unsoldering them and transferring them.The person that did this on YouTube notes that a common reason for SSD failure on T2 machines is due to SSD power regulator circuitry being located close to the intake vents on the side of the MacBook Pro. They recommend that users of these machines open them and clean the dust out often, since dust buildup on the actual power regulator combined with moisture sometimes causes a short circuit, sending high voltage to the SSD and damaging it.This kind of failure (high voltage parts close to low voltage ones, close to liquid damage prone areas, without any underfilling) is documented by Louis Rossmann. It is, however, not always feasible or possible to entirely prevent."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is good. The backing of stablecoins is a very real issue. As the Treasury points out, there&#39;s a very real possibility of a run. Two stablecoins have crashed so far, SafeDollar SDO, and $TITAN.  They went all the way to zero.Can Tether survive a net outflow? Probably not. They don&#39;t have the collateral.Dai is really a derivative of Etherium. Dai is backed by Etherium at 150%. So
value in Dai is at risk if the price of Etherium drops more than 1/3.  Etherium dropped by half back in May 2021, but recovered. DAI could have crashed at that time if it faced a net outflow. It didn&#39;t, though.The real question is what happens in the next recession."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; To address risks to stablecoin users and guard against stablecoin runs, legislation should require stablecoin issuers to be insured depository institutions, which are subject to appropriate supervision and regulation, at the depository institution and the holding company level.&gt; To address concerns about payment system risk, in addition to the requirements for stablecoin issuers, legislation should require custodial wallet providers4 to be subject to appropriate federal oversight. Congress should also provide the federal supervisor of a stablecoin issuer with the authority to require any entity that performs activities that are critical to the functioning of the stablecoin arrangement to meet appropriate risk-management standards.&gt; To address additional concerns about systemic risk and concentration of economic power, legislation should require stablecoin issuers to comply with activities restrictions that limit affiliation with commercial entities. Supervisors should have authority to implement standards to promote interoperability among stablecoins. In addition, Congress may wish to consider other standards for custodial wallet providers, such as limits on affiliation with commercial entities or on use of users’ transaction data.AKA StableCoin operators should be banks. (Stable Coins will be bank notes)?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting to read this with an eye on the authors&#39; mindset.  Their understanding of stablecoins seems largely centered on Tether (and to a lesser extent, BUSD/USDC).  A lot of their understanding is incorrect when applied to algorithmic stablecoins like Dai, eg. there is no central issuing authority; Dai is minted in exchange for Ethereum (and other cryptocurrencies), not fiat currencies; the effect of a run on Dai is unlikely to spill over into the mainstream financial system; a &#34;custodial wallet&#34; in DeFi is not a company but just an Ethereum address, i.e. a hash of a public/private keypair.Overall I get the sense that the government is still people/organization centric and cannot wrap its head around a future where reality is determined by computer code and people are bit players in the script."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was a pretty interesting thing to mitigate - we added some support around it to GitLab after it was reported to us, which shipped in the latest security release: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/commit/3fb44197195b57... (you can actually see it in effect on that commit&#39;s examples, which is quite meta). These characters have valid use-cases in right-to-left languages like Arabic, Japanese etc, so it had to be configurable for project-owners if they have legitimate use-cases for it. Our focus was on making sure that repository maintainers could see these characters in code reviews.The homoglyph attack is interesting but it really should be noticed as part of a code review process, as it requires adding the imitation function calls at some point too. It&#39;d also likely be pretty frustrating to end users if we were to highlight every single unicode character that looks like the latin alphabet.It&#39;s certainly a good lesson in not copy/pasting random snippets from the internet and pasting them into a root shell, however :D (we do always highlight the bidi characters on GitLab snippets, though)Aside: this was a royal pain in the arse to figure out if I had live examples in the specs, because vim also just rendered them &#34;correctly&#34;. I ended up checking the files in Windows Notepad on another machine to sanity check them.Thanks to the authors for responsible disclosure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As I previously noted on a related post:Interesting paper. Note, however, that the general problem is already known and there are a number of pre-existing works that discuss it. This is typically called &#34;underhanded code&#34; or sometimes &#34;maliciously misleading code&#34;. I&#39;m surprised that they didn&#39;t use the normal term for the problem nor cite the previous work on it - maybe they didn&#39;t realize this was a widely-known problem? Previous works on underhanded code didn&#39;t discuss Bidi to my knowledge (though other attacks on text like this have exploited Bidi).
Here are a number of other materials about underhanded code:The Obfuscated V Contest (http://graphics.stanford.edu/~danielh/vote/vote.html) was created by Daniel Horn in 2004 and is the earliest “underhanded” programming contest that I found. It was a contest to create source code that looked like it did one thing, but actually did another.Underhanded C Contest (http://www.underhanded-c.org/) has run in many years. Per its FAQ, &#34;The Underhanded C Contest is an annual contest to write innocent-looking C code implementing malicious behavior.&#34;My PhD dissertation &#34;Fully Countering Trusting Trust through Diverse Double-Compiling&#34; discusses how to counter the &#34;trusting trust&#34; problem &amp; includes a section about maliciously misleading source code. See: https://dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/The JavaScript Misdirection Contest announced the winner on September 27, 2015 http://misdirect.ion.land/My paper &#34;Initial Analysis of Underhanded Source Code&#34;, (by David A. Wheeler, April, 2020, IDA document: D-13166), discusses underhanded code and the effectiveness of several potential countermeasures. It also includes a number of citations to other works on underhanded code.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Cambridge research clearly shows that most compilers can be tricked with Unicode into processing code in a different way than a reader would expect it to be processed.Unless I misunderstand the premise, this in not right. The compiler is not &#34;tricked&#34; into doing anything different - it interprets the code the same way as it always did. It&#39;s like saying &#34;rm&#34; command &#34;can be tricked into&#34; deleting important files. The rm tool doesn&#39;t know which files are important to you, and the compiler doesn&#39;t - and shouldn&#39;t - know what you consider to be &#34;correct&#34; code. It would correctly compile any code that is syntactically correct - if there are strings inside that look weird to you, it doesn&#39;t matter to the compiler.The entity that can be &#34;tricked&#34; here is the reviewer of the code - who, indeed, might probably be tricked into accepting code that does something different than they&#39;d think it does (though it&#39;d require a very clever attacker to for the code to both do something nefarious with Unicode and still look innocent and not weird to the reviewer). Fortunately, this is quite easy to fix - just don&#39;t accept any patches with source code that have any non-ASCII outside small set of localization resources (proper code would have localizable resources outside the code anyway, tbh) and no Unicode would ever trick you."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m not an economist. I am a consumer, though.  And I&#39;m older, so I have &#39;habits&#39; that don&#39;t tend to change.My rent has gone up 30%.  What used to cost me 100 something in groceries now regularly goes into the 200s.I&#39;m nothing if not an observationalist, but this CPI is horse dung.For someone like my family, I wouldn&#39;t believe any number less than 20%.The sad thing is, I&#39;ve never talked to a single friend or family member that said otherwise.So what is the government reporting?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many older people saved large amounts of money in their bank accounts, and were expecting to live off the interest in their savings account once they retired. The interest they were due was effectively stolen when the central banks started giving away free money, it was a massive transfer of wealth.Many of that same generation counted on Social Security, and CPI adjustments to help save them from poverty.  The CPI numbers were pushed down to keep the costs of benefits those retirees were entitled to receive artificially low.  Another transfer of wealth / theft.Now the rest of the population has seen their crappy but steady wages evaporate on a whim, and will no longer settle for less than an actual living wage.  A rebalancing is going to have to take place, and somehow the wealth needs to be transferred back to the working class, or things will get very violent, very quickly. Once that kicks off, our near peers will funnel weapons into the US, and a civil war will make us the latest 3rd world country."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My read on this is that it seems like the equivalent of a subtweet about pay inequality.If that is indeed the case then they should be arguing for something I wrote the SEC about a couple of years ago which is to have public companies report their salary costs broken down by executive pay and non-executive management pay and non-executive non-management pay. And to report the population of individuals in each cohort.That &#39;pie&#39; of payroll costs can be split up anyway a company chooses, but the weighting of it will allow investors to understand the future prospects of a company that under pays its rank and file relative to its executives and management."</p>

It also allows you to monitor their conversations way that respects the kids&#39; privacy.Contrast this with iMessage, where literally anyone can randomly message a child using their Apple ID, and there are zero controls available to parents for monitoring or approving contacts.Look beyond messaging, and the Apple store targets kids with crappy apps filled to the brim  with creepy ads.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Probably what&#39;s going on is that someone on the board of trusties gets money from the political establishment in Florida and is worried that they&#39;ll lose it if the voting barriers are fixed and different leadership is elected.This has similarities with the shenanigans pulled by Sinema and Manchin around the Build Back Better plan. Political horse trading to advance the agendas of special interests, at great expense to millions of people.I wonder if the tech community could get involved to increase transparency around this stuff. Imagine if we had an open graph of the money flow so we could write a SQL query like (pseudo code) &#34;select * from donors where payee in (select id from trustees)&#34;. Let people crowdsource the data and then maintain a page of declarative queries so that anyone can instantly see the web of money around public officials. It could be part of a build system that automatically creates a NASCAR jacket for each official so we could see who their donors are in AR.Maybe such a thing already exists. It&#39;s traditionally been accomplished by investigative journalists and lawyers, but why couldn&#39;t it be public? It seems like it would be an effective way to end the bribe system."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a colleague who does environmental litigation. (Think Erin Brockovich.) They have a big civil case against a large energy company in a southern, “energy-friendly” state. They had an expert witness all lined up - a professor at the (public!) state university. Well this expert happened to be up for tenure and was (allegedly) told in no uncertain terms that, should they testify as an expert witness in this case, tenure was off the table.It’s absolutely outrageous that we allow those in positions of power to manipulate the justice system in such a way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Public education institutions are potentially the most politicized arenas in our nation today.Especially K-12 education, where you have to somehow bridge a new chasm between insane ideologies while also keeping a classroom full children working &#34;productively&#34; towards pointless standardized testing objectives. All of this despite most of their dopamine loops being totally burned out from hours of smartphone use before they even get to school.The whole education system is heading towards &#34;totally fucked&#34;. This UF politics issue is just 1% of the puzzle behind why everything sucks so hard now. If you personally know any teachers working in K12, lend them your ear. You would be surprised how many people are internalizing the problems and don&#39;t even know who to talk to about it anymore. The rest have succumbed to apathy or new careers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a Model 3. The autopilot was acting weird while driving on the freeway, sometime disengaging, but mostly not tracking the lane smoothly. For an unrelated reason, I opted to view my camera footage, and was shocked to find that my camera was completely blurry. I’m driving down the freeway at 75mph, being guided by a camera that couldn’t pass a standard driver’s vision test.Tesla came out to replace the camera, and it appeared that a film had been deposited on the windshield, obscuring the camera.Living in Phoenix, my car is parked outside, facing south west. During Covid, I’d go many days at a time without driving, and in the summer, the interior temperatures can easily rise over 150f. Within the camera enclosure, there’s a reflection absorbing material, which likely creates a perfect miniature greenhouse.I believe the glue in the camera housing melted/evaporated at these elevated temperatures and deposited on the windshield.Concerned that others would experience this problem, I opened a case with the NHTSA. Crickets.There could be many people driving around on autopilot, with obstructed vision, due to this same failure mode. It’s something Tesla could easily check, and something NHTSA should be investigating.For something as safety critical as a forward facing camera, you’d expect both Tesla and NHTSA would be investigating. I have no indication that anything has happened as a result of my filing. Possibly because nobody else has reported the issue - maybe because nobody else is actively viewing their camera footage? There’s no other way for a Tesla owner to be aware of the issue. Frustrating."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I drive a Tesla. If my car rear ends another car, that&#39;s my fault. Doesn&#39;t matter if I had Autopilot on or not.Imagine if you were rear ended by a Toyota and the driver said &#34;it was on cruise control, shrug.&#34; Would you talk to NTSB or NHTSA about that? Probably not.The only scenario I can imagine that&#39;d warrant investigation is if the driver were completely unable to override Autopilot. Similar investigations have been started by NTSB when Toyota had issues with their cruise control systems several years ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The driver said she was using Autopilot, that an OTA update had had a problem earlier in the day, and that she had actually had the same kind of collision on Autopilot previously!So she continued to use it? That&#39;s insane.It&#39;s worrying that there are tons of videos on YouTube reviewing Tesla&#39;s Autopilot and FSD where the cars do something incredibly scary and dangerous, and the drivers just laugh it off, go &#34;well, it&#39;s a beta!&#34; and continue using it instead of turning off the feature that almost got them into a car accident. I don&#39;t want to share the road with drivers who think dangerous driving is a funny game."</p>

(the songs are produced in similar DAWs.) You won&#39;t be able to recreate the vocals, but you should be able to recreate the backing track almost identically. Put the original in right ear, your version in the left ear, and iterate until switching between versions sounds identical.Over 100s of hours, this will train you ears, and you will appreciate the production quality of today&#39;s pop music.This just covers the production and mixing, not the writing. Catchy pop songs sound deceivingly simple, which is the point and why they are so difficult to write."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to make music as a teenager. Spending many hours in the &#34;studio&#34; certainly shapes your aesthetics and how you approach new music. Even understanding just the basics and tiny bits of underlying techniques makes you listen differently, makes it easy to become a snob to be honest. Overall though, and generally, making things of any sort lets you appreciate the creative process as an overarching art in itself, an appreciation you can often transport to other fields, even those not conventionally regarded as artistic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Whether you like Ableton Live or not relative to other options is a matter of preference, but regardless, the folks who run Ableton are pretty cool:- run by real musicians who play shows, it came out of a scratched personal itch- so far, good new owners of Cycling 74, the bug squash numbers in the last couple of releases were stellar- totally hacker friendly, they know people release disassembled Python code for control surfaces, and basically said &#34;we can&#39;t support individual users doing this, but we know it&#39;s out there and won&#39;t do anything to stop it&#34; (this was what actually got me on the bus!)- really good educational outreach initiatives, and they give away a very capable light version for peanuts (or free with many controllers)I find their prices high, all things considered, but am happy to be a long time customer, and as a serious musician musician (university educated, etc.), I think it&#39;s great that it has become such a gateway to appreciation of instrumental music by making music creation a more accessible hobby.And the fact that I can script the heck out of such a full featured commercial product in Scheme by writing a Max/MSP external is fantastic (plug, I wrote Scheme For Max, which allows you to run lisp in your Ableton...)"</p>

Anti-bot software is nonsense. Its snake oil sold to people without technical knowledge for heavy bucks.If this guy got to experience how systemically bad the credential stuffing problem is, he&#39;d probably take down the whole repository.None of these anti-bot providers give a shit about invading your privacy, tracking your every movements, or whatever other power fantasy that can be imagined. Nobody pays those vendors $10m/year to frustrate web crawler enthusiasts, they do it to stop credential stuffing."</p>

I guess the other sides of those we don&#39;t see much. People doing actual black-hat work probably don&#39;t post about it on public forums, and most of the over-broad anti-abuse is probably a side effect of taking some anti-abuse tech and blindly applying it to the whole site just because that&#39;s simpler, often no tech people may be really involved at all."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Getting anything out of a subshell that isn&#39;t from STDOUT is impossible. So you can&#39;t define an array in a subshell and then use it outside the subshell, and you can&#39;t return an array (or anything that isn&#39;t a string) from a subshell. If you only use subshells and want to use any kind of data structure that isn&#39;t a string passed from STDOUT, you have to do it globally. And subshells are slow. So nobody uses subshells.If you use Bash for programming, you have to stop thinking in terms of the holier-than-thou software engineer, whose ego believes that a superior, &#34;clean&#34; design makes a superior program. You should embrace globals. You should switch between using or not using the enforcement of set variables or program exit status. You should stop using Bashisms and subtle, obscure language features unless you absolutely have to.Bash is not a &#34;real&#34; programming language, so do not treat it as one. Do not look for hidden features, or try to do things in cute ways that nobody else uses. There is no superior method or hidden knowledge. Just write extremely simple code and understand the quirks of the shell."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Well, because it simply doesn&#39;t work for them: returning from a function does not trigger the EXIT signal.It doesn&#39;t trigger EXIT, but it does trigger RETURN. Just trap both:    #!/bin/bash

        trap &#34;echo &#39;Cleanup!&#39;&#34; RETURN EXIT

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s an interesting bit of...abuse :) Since Bash is effectively stringly-typed, it can be used as a functional programming language, with pipes similar to function composition.e.g.: wtfp.sh    #!/usr/bin/env bash

It&#39;s the single most controversial book that I&#39;ve read about piano technique and playing that I&#39;ve found.The author, is not even a player himself (!!!). There&#39;s a great summary of reviews about the book here (https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php?topic=38247.0), if you&#39;re starting into piano, stay away, get a decent teacher."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the last section in Chapter One, titled &#34;Jazz, Fake Books, and Improvisation&#34;:&gt; In summary, the process of learning this genre consists of practicing the chords and scales sufficiently so that, given a melody, you can “feel” the right and wrong chords that go along with it.That&#39;s only scratching the surface and will not get you playing jazz. Listening to and copying the greats - Bird, Monk, Evans, Coltrane, Rollins, et al. That&#39;s how you learn to play jazz.&gt;It is clear that this genre is here to stay, has great educational and practical value, is relatively easy to learn, and can be a lot of fun.Relatively easy to learn??? Clearly the author hasn&#39;t or isn&#39;t playing jazz."</p>

Had no idea hay exchange existed, the vast majority of our sales were via craigslist and Facebook marketplace, with most being small-scale (50 bales or fewer). The rest came from word of mouth and our local 4-H group.Producing hay at this scale is extremely difficult. The start-up costs are in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and you&#39;re typically barely breaking even. This year is unusual in that supply was way down, so prices were a lot higher than normal. The only reason we can do it is that we have a relationship with someone who cuts &amp; bales a number of small fields for a per-ton fee.I could see a tool like this being useful for large-scale operations that are doing the big round bales yet don&#39;t have an established relationship with a buyer. For an operation like ours, where we are producing small ~60lb traditional square bales, I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to find anyone local enough who wants to buy at the quantity and size we have.

Dried ink on dead trees. And in the early internet age this book seller outperformed many more &#34;forward looking visionary&#34; startups.Billions and billions spent on making movies as polished as possible, yet &#34;I thought the book was better&#34; is what we always hear.The Metaverse will be programmed with text.The quarterly reports outlining its financial losses will be written in text.When journalists ultimately write its obituary, they will write text."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Metaverse is not bullshit. It&#39;s a sign of desperation.Facebook has _nothing_ for the future.* Blue app is already on it&#39;s death bed.* Instagram is already seeing a massive decline in quality and engagement as its getting close to the end of its lifecycle.* They managed to survive Snapchat, but I think that made them think Instagram is too big to fail. Thus, they didn&#39;t go after TikTok. It was a mistake.* What&#39;s App is not monetizable.* Oculus is not becoming the next PS4/Xbox like they hoped.Facebook is usually being compared to the likes of Apple, Google and Amazon. It&#39;s nothing compared to them. It&#39;s not even gonna be able to do a Microsoft/IBM pivot as it has no monetizable developer ecosystem.I personally think they should&#39;ve acquired TikTok last year when TikTok was looking to be acquired by Microsoft. They probably would&#39;ve extended their survival for another 10-ish years (lifecycle of a social media)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This thread feels like 1860&#39;s consilium on what future will look like 500 years later. The shape of the metaverse will be formed by a new generation, not by older guys (and not by fortnite addicts who play by the rules of the former) who know nothing better than drive a fancy “car” on the “road”, as if roads or a concept of physical movement or the euclidean rule would still be there for common use and not for museums. Virtual worlds up to date, like second life, were mostly just stupid copies of “real life”, which was designed after some physical limitations, or fantasy worlds of parallel earth-likes with a limited magic.If the only limitation of metaverse is Code and Content, and if that would be much easier to create, then in a blink of an eye it will turn into something absolutely inconceivable to mercedes benz drivers. What really is bullshit, is lack of imagination in people and a shitload of thought inertia. Personally, it feels like the article author has never ever been in the internet, confining themselves at a small circle of “social” networks bs. Those will live in an exact copy of their current environment, paying to bigcorps with their work hours to achieve “expensive” toys, to impress similar narrow-minded guys.

It&#39;s been passed around to relatives, but last I heard, it still works after what must be almost 40 years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The original Fisher-Price &#34;Record Player&#34; is really a kids version of a Polyphon [0] a type of record like music player that was popular in the late 1800&#39;s to early 1900&#39;s.  You can see some playing on YouTube [1]I thought it would be interesting to 3D print additional records for the thing. Was super disappointed when I bought one for our daughter last year and found that they had changed it to a digital music player that only uses the records for song selection.A lot of the modern day versions of the original Fisher-Price toys don&#39;t hold up to the originals.  For example on the xylophone they replaced the Wood base with plastic and the thing sounds like crap.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphon[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk4zjQshq14[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soQLAvqnTOQ"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not sure how common this is in other countries, but here in Germany we have quite a few &#34;water playgrounds&#34;. There are some pumps in the sand, sometimes small aqueducts and the likes, so during summer, the kids can play with water. The pumps used to be real pumps. Now they are electronic. They have a sensor to detect how fast the handle is moving and at a certain speed you&#39;ll hear a clicking sound, a valve opens and the water starts flowing.I think some children will realize how these things work. They might start to find them dumb if they find out that the strenuous repetitive movement is in fact unnecessary. At least to me it feels like a dishonest contraption and I&#39;d prefer if they simply put a button on it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When you make housing an investment, by definition, it has to become less affordable in the future.Until a country decides to stop making policy to support this notion that a basic need should be an appreciating asset and not a depreciating one like food, transportation, etc, this completely unsurprising trend will continue. It is a strange world we live in where we collectively believe that a basic need should increase in price over time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m always a bit amused at this sort of article.At it&#39;s heart it is an attempt by someone who makes their living selling a thing (real estate) to instill a since of FOMO in order to motivate you to buy something now rather than perhaps later. You can&#39;t really fault them, it does tend to work.I happen to live in the &#34;red hot&#34; Bay Area and twice wince I&#39;ve been living in my house its value has gone DOWN year over year rather than up. I have never considered it an &#34;investment&#34;, rather it is a fixed cost that I have to pay to live indoors. My parents live in Las Vegas, and that housing market, which has been largely unconstrained, demonstrated exactly what that means. Houses in Vegas for a long time depreciated after you bought them, just like cars. They did that because there was so much new housing being built that you could buy a &#34;new&#34; house for the same price as a &#34;used&#34; house. Guess what, people opted for &#34;new&#34; and used houses needed to sell at a discount if they wanted to sell.One of the truisms for years was the value of a house was intimately tied to its location. This because it was close to jobs, or schools or what not. It is my hope that remote work really takes hold and you can work just as reasonably in a $100,000 house in Missouri as you can in a million dollar house in the Bay Area. That would really create some downward pressure on prices because of simple market dynamics."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unfortunately the article is extremely sloppy with the numbers and that makes it very hard to understand what is really going on.Primarily, they keep mentioning &#34;average house-price-to-income ratio&#34; but appear to be using average home price and median income.  Both housing price and income distributions are enormously skewed.  In the Unites States average income is almost double median income and that difference has been increasing over time.  So right there, even if median house price to median income has stayed constant, you would notice the pattern pointed out.I don&#39;t doubt the central premise that housing prices are rising faster than income within household, but unfortunately the article does nothing to show it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Tangentially, the physical labor jobs I had when younger never really tired me out the way that the mental/bureaucratic/political job I have now does.Physical work actually energized me, I mean this is all confirmed today as well, we know all the benefits exercise brings on well being.There&#39;s something about desk jobs that is frankly soul sucking and literally mentally draining in a way where when the day ends, it&#39;s as if you suffer from temporary depression. Even getting motivated to do things you want to do is hard, resorting to the laziest activity is often what happens, phone, social media, television. Sometimes I can&#39;t even get myself to play a video game and I love video games.And when the night comes, you&#39;d think sleep is what you need, but that same day of desk job actually gives you insomnia, falling asleep is hard, and while you sleep it&#39;s as if all of that mental activity is still happening in your head from the work day.If physical labor work paid me as well and provided the same benefits, I&#39;d probably switch back to it honestly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This analysis is solely focused on the &#34;job&#34; aspects of pre-industrial life and includes almost none of the domestic considerations. I&#39;m not sure if it would be fair to call all non-wage time &#34;leisure&#34;. Once work was still over there were still things to clean, fix, prepare, butcher, etc.Although, I think it goes without saying that before affordable lighting and heating, we all underestimate how lazy winters were for the average peasant, whether idyllic or not (accounts I have read make it sound incredibly, incessantly dull).And I think the best evidence we have that we are overrating the quality of pre-industrial leisure time is that people developed almost no leisure activities! Common people had almost no sports, no games (beyond precursors to Bocce or backgammon), no literature! They supposedly had half a year of doing nothing, and perhaps singing and drinking was sufficient to fill the time, but you&#39;d think they would show lots of other innovations. Or even steal the activities of the rich (organized sports)!Instead you don&#39;t see leisure activities develop until the rise of the 40 hour workweek and the availability of consumer appliances.Edit: I hope people understand that the argument the article presents is largely a romanticization of poverty."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; And they worked only as many days as were necessary to earn their customary income -- which in this case amounted to about 120 days a year, for a probable total of only 1,440 hours annually (this estimate assumes a 12-hour day because the days worked were probably during spring, summer and fall).This goes against everything I&#39;ve been taught, that the plebian class basically toiled endlessly, from Feudal Times to Industrial Revolution before labor laws to today&#39;s &#34;multiple low-wage-jobs to survive&#34;.EDIT: Also odd that the author doesn&#39;t point out that ~2040 hours is the yearly hours in a modern 40-hour workweek in the US, give or take a few holidays."</p>

Users of the proprietary Nvidia driver will need to wait a little bit longer as the currently released drivers lack an important extension. However, most likely we’ll be able to enable EGL on the 470 series onwards. DMABUF support (and thus better WebGL performance) requires GBM support and will be limited to the 495 series onwards.Ubuntu 21.10 currently comes with the 470 series driver."</p>

Naturally, in a logical progression, he looked for stars which behaved as if they were in a binary systems but the partner i.e. &#34;dark stars&#34; could not been seen because its mass would be so big that  the finite speed of light couldn&#39;t &#34;escape&#34;.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A project I dream about but have neither the skills to implement nor the discipline. An entire OS written just for the RPI4. With code making use of the fact that we are running on known hardware, so we can optimize it rigorously.If you focused on supporting the official raspberry pi keyboard, mouse, and touchscreen you could circumvent a lot of the pains around driver issues. Then people could actually get up and running with your OS with real hardware, and you could start dogfooding it.I’ve heard people say that the software we use is up to 100 times slower than it needs to be. So my hypothesis is that if the software was written smarter, and used the fact that we know the hardware ahead of time, we should easily hit a 100 times performance increase across the OS.Also if it were possible, it would be cool if this OS supported a minimal boot mode, that could be configured to only run the bare minimum amount of apps required for a certain piece of software. So for example a game mode that ran the game, and the bare minimum amount of OS the game needed to run.And since we are in full on fantasy land we can take this one step further. Same basic concept, but with a RISC-V SBC, with an open GPU. Bonus points if you can get up and running with a touchscreen, keyboard, mouse, case, and SD card for $150"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You don&#39;t start by choosing an architecture. You start by understanding the problem and the pieces in the solution space. You then figure out how those pieces can work together to solve the problem. After that you can see the system as nested subsystems and interactions, which you can draw as diagrams and call it an architecture.So I see &#34;architecture&#34; more as a teaching and communication technique, applied after the fact. Altho since we&#39;re always moving between the details and the big picture, having organized abstractions (ie an architecture) in mind will help keep the design clean.The architecture evolves and sharpens as a system comes together. And this evolving architecture provides the team with a common terminology and overall direction.But you rarely start by choosing a specific architecture.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m kinda confused by the criticism of the industry and NASA not designing for Starship.The author argues that NASA doesn’t understand Tempe game changer that Starship is, but I don’t think that’s accurate. I think the risk to NASA of assuming the benefits of Starship before it’s proven are just too high.If NASA (or other industry players), assume Starship will deliver the benefits it promises, they to fundamentally alter their approach to space. But that leaves them with no backup plan in the event that Starship fails to materialize or deliver on its promises.Whereas this other approach, of treating Starship like a much better vehicle but integrating it into its old processes, gives them an out if Starship fails in some way. Because they’re still using the “old” assumptions, they can fall back to other “old space” style providers.I think once Starship has proven itself capable of deliver on its promises, you’ll see NASA changing its approach radically in the manner the author describes.So, fundamentally, I think it’s not a lack of “understanding”, but a different calibration of “risk”. This also applies to many existing space companies, and I also think this gives opportunities for new companies that have a higher risk tolerance to take advantage."</p>

RE space colonies, I believe the natural sequence of events for space tourism is: sub orbital, oribital, long term orbital (a small space &#34;hotel&#34;) culminating in orbital habitat ala O&#39;Neil Cylinders.

But the current plans call for something like 16 starship launches just for refuelling the one starship for the lunar mission. Suppose we can do the Mars trip with the same number of flights that&#39;s 170,000 launches  to transport that 100million tons?
