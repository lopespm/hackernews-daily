								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is very nice!For reasoning about tree-based data such as HTML, I also highly recommend the declarative programming language Prolog. HTML documents map naturally to Prolog terms and can be readily reasoned about with built-in language mechanisms. For instance, here is the sample query from the htmlq README, fetching all elements with id get-help from https://www.rust-lang.org, using Scryer Prolog and its SGML and HTTP libraries in combination with the XPath-inspired query language from library(xpath):    ?- http_open(&#34;https://www.rust-lang.org&#34;, Stream, []),
       load_html(stream(Stream), DOM, []),
       xpath(DOM, //(*(@id=&#34;get-help&#34;)), E).

Yielding:       E = element(div,[class=&#34;flex flex-colum ...&#34;,id=&#34;get-help&#34;],[&#34;\n        &#34;,element(h4,[],[&#34;Get help!&#34;]),&#34;\n        &#34;,element(ul,[],[&#34;\n       ...&#34;,element(li,[],[element(a,[... = ...],[...])]),&#34;\n   ...&#34;,element(li,[],[...]),...|...]),&#34;\n        ...&#34;,element(div,[class=&#34;la ...&#34;],[&#34;\n   ...&#34;,element(label,[...],[...]),...|...]),&#34;\n    ...&#34;])
    ;  false.

The selector //(*(@id=&#34;get-help&#34;)) is used to obtain all HTML elements whose id attribute is get-help. On backtracking, all solutions are reported.The other example from the README, extracting all links from the page, can be obtained with Scryer Prolog like this:    ?- http_open(&#34;https://www.rust-lang.org&#34;, Stream, []),
       load_html(stream(Stream), DOM, []),
       xpath(DOM, //a(@href), Link),
       portray_clause(Link),
       false.

This query uses forced backtracking to write all links on standard output, yielding:    &#34;/&#34;.
    &#34;/tools/install&#34;.
    &#34;/learn&#34;.
    &#34;https://play.rust-lang.org/&#34;.
    &#34;/tools&#34;.
    &#34;/governance&#34;.
    &#34;/community&#34;.
    &#34;https://blog.rust-lang.org/&#34;.
    &#34;/learn/get-started&#34;.

Jq is closer to the awk where you can do just about everything with json. Cascadia, htmlq, and pup seem closer to grep for html. They can essentially only select data from a html source.[0] https://github.com/EricChiang/pup

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hello, I’m Cameron and one of the two people working on the Bonsai web browser.We’re focused on making a web browser for programmers to improve their workflow. It helps you look up docs and search information. You can toggle it on with a hotkey and it can overlay on your IDE. Tabs are grouped by domain for easy organization. The history data structure is a tree which shows how pages are back-linked to each other and to spatial workspaces. Both open tabs and pages in your workspaces are just pointers to a node in your history tree!You can watch a 2 minute video walkthrough here https://www.loom.com/share/93c7c0012f514c37b58a42fa65badc88 or download it from our websiteHow did we end up here?Initially we wanted to make a citation manager because myself and a friend had an unconnected workflow moving research articles from Chrome -&gt; Zotero -&gt; Emacs org-mode. After talking to some other PhDs/postdocs the takeaway was that everyone has very different ways of doing research. This would mean that it would be impossible to make a citation manager that everyone would want to use.Later, a friend in industry mentioned that he had a hard time finding ‘cloud documents’ as part of his job. We then considered making a spotlight application to find and organize these documents. It turns out that this already been done and it seems that people actually just pull up their documents once at the beginning of the day anyway.We now think that the main problem is that web browsers are actually not currently suited for doing research. The current mixing of research type browsing with web-documents creates a mess and makes people think they want a ‘cloud file search’.What’s different?Instead of an add-on solution to Chrome which would create more noise, we are creating a fully functioning, organized way of managing information overload and keeping you on task as you go through your work day.What’s next?We are fixing up our Linux and Windows versions for public use."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Love it, this is the most innovative thing in the browser space for a long while. It&#39;s baffling to me how boring most &#39;new&#39; browsers are - most propositions are &#39;like X but with less friction on these 2 or 3 things&#39;.I hate that it&#39;s only for Mac so far, but glad to see others are on the way. I&#39;ve been thinking about picking up a cheap older mac for development work, though, and this is one more reason in favor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks really great, something I could use and would pay for when polished but there&#39;s definitely a few issues for me at the moment:* Why go fullscreen and modal? I want to drag in links from docs, email, other browsers, have it side by side while reading PDFs etc. etc. this stops me from doing any of that* Please let me change the shortcut! I already have Option-Space bound.* Let me put the browser window anywhere I want when it&#39;s in the single page non-fullscreen mode, don&#39;t levitate it to where you think I want it* Unless I&#39;m missing something the process of opening a page then adding it to a workspace seems to be three clicks - open page, hit + (plus) button, select workspace, select workspace/inbox - need to make this one click, maybe just show the inboxes? This also seems clunky, I&#39;d much rather browse, drag that page to the workspace/inbox, continue browsing and adding further pages, then arrange all the pages in the workspace after i&#39;ve added all the links. Seems a faster workflow."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Be careful when companies market themselves as Swiss or that due to them being located in Switzerland means there is some extra layer of security or privacy.Sure, it&#39;s a more stable country than many other countries in the world, but not much different from most EU countries for example. And privacy wise there is no difference.Be also aware of the fact that many companies market themselves as Swiss, but all it means is they have a head office in Switzerland due to tax reasons. In one example, it&#39;s a cloud storage company, they say on their marketing page and their about page that they are based in Switzerland and under Swiss law, but if you look at the legal pages the company you sign up with are actually based in Bulgaria. Their servers are based in Texas, USA and Luxemburg, Europe and their development team in Bulgaria."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The ProtonMail guys always said that unless they were 20 miles  from the littoral, in the sea side, they had to abide by national laws. So it was bound to happen.What makes me sad is how flimsy their entire premise (not necessarily &#34;promise&#34;) turned out to be: all it took was some minor rascal in France to hug the wrong tree (so to speak), and ProtonMail is in the open saying they can&#39;t even protect the IP address of their customers. From there, all it takes is for somebody to change a law in Switzerland and end-to-end encryption of the messages themselves will only be &#34;by default.&#34;I think there is a market for datacenters in open seas."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The expectation that Proton would be able to disobey the legal requests of their local authorities with impunity is unrealistic. Protonmail makes certain claims about privacy, particularly about encryption. They don&#39;t make any claims that they have the intention, or ability for that matter, to defy local authorities at their peril. Like Grugq said in one of his presentations (paraphrased): &#34;Don&#39;t expect your VPN company to do your jail time for you&#34;. I&#39;m neither for nor against Protonmail. I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve been dishonest. I think people have an unrealistic expectation of the service they offer. They offer additional privacy, not legal indemnity."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I run an Alexa top-2000 website.  (Mangadex is presently at about 6000.)  I spend less than $250 a month.I have loads and loads of thoughts about what they could be doing differently to reduce their costs but I&#39;ll just say that the number one thing Mangadex could be doing right now from a cursory glance is to reduce the number of requests.  A fresh load of the home page generates over 100 requests.  (Mostly images, then javascript fragments.)  Mangadex apparently gets over 100 million requests per day.  My site - despite ostensibly having more traffic - gets fewer than half that many in a month.  (And yes, it&#39;s image-heavy.)A couple easy wins would be to reduce the number of images loaded on the front page.  (Does the &#34;Seasonal&#34; slider really need 30 images, or would 5 and a link to the &#34;seasonal&#34; page be enough?  Same thing with &#34;Recently Added&#34; and the numbers of images on pages in general.)  The biggest win would probably be reducing the number of javascript requests.  Somehow people seem to think there&#39;s some merit to loading javascript which subsequently loads additional javascript.  This adds a tremendous amount of latency to your page load and generates needless network traffic.  Each request has a tremendous amount of overhead - particularly for dynamically-generated javascript.  It&#39;s much better to load all of the javascript you need in a single request or a small handful of requests.  Unfortunately, this is probably a huge lift for a site already designed in this way, but the improved loading time would be a big UX win.Anyway - best of luck to MangaDex!  They&#39;ve clearly put a lot of thought into this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve done things at scale (5-10K req/s) on a budget ($1000 USD) and I&#39;ve done things at much smaller scales that required a much larger budget._How_ you hit scale on a budget is one part of the equation. The other part is: what you&#39;re doing.Off the top of my head, the &#34;how&#34; will often involve the following (just to list a few):1 - Baremetal2 - Cache3 - Denormalize4 - Append-only5 - Shard6 - Performance focused clients/api7 - Async / background everythingThese strategies work _really_ well for catalog-type systems: amazon.com, wiki, shopify, spotify, stackoverflow. The list is virtually endless.But it doesn&#39;t take much more complexity for it to become more difficult/expensive.Twitter&#39;s a good example. Forget twitter-scale, just imagine you&#39;ve outgrown what 1 single DB server can do, how do you scale? You can&#39;t shard on the `author_id` because the hot path isn&#39;t &#34;get all my tweets&#34;, the hot path is &#34;get all the tweets of the people I follow&#34;. If you shard on `author_id`, you now need to visit N shards. To optimize the hot path, you need to duplicate tweets into each &#34;recipient&#34; shard so that you can do: &#34;select tweet from tweets where recipient_id = $1 order by created desc limit 50&#34;. But this duplication is never going to be cheap (to compute or store).(At twitter&#39;s scale, even though it&#39;s a simple graph, you have the case of people with millions of followers which probably need special handling. I assume this involves a server-side merge of &#34;tweets from normal people&#34; &amp; RAM[&#34;tweets from the popular people&#34;].)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many manga fans have a love/hate relationship with mangadex. On one hand, it&#39;s provided hosting for countless hours of entertainment over the years. Their &#34;v3&#34; version of the site was basically perfect from a usability point of view, to the point that the entire community chose to unite itself under its flag.On the other hand, directly because of the above, their hasty self-inflicted take down earlier this year nearly killed the entire hobby. Many series essentially stopped updating for the ~5 months the site was down, and many more are likely never coming back again.The decision to suddenly take the site down for a full site rewrite feels completely inexplicable from the outside. (A writeup the above or the previous one[1], both of which read like they were written by a Google Product Manager, especially don&#39;t help as they conspicuously avoid any comment to the one question on everyone&#39;s mind: &#34;leaving aside the supposed security issues with the backend, why on earth also rewrite and redesign the entire front end from scratch at the same time?&#34;)[1] https://mangadex.dev/why-rebuild/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I launched my former bitcoin casino in 2011 (it&#39;s gone, but it was a casino where all games, even roulette tables were multiplayer, on a platform built from scratch starting in &#39;08), I handled all web requests through a server in Costa Rica that cost about $6/mo. Where I had a shell corporation for $250/year. Once the front end -- the bullet containing the entire casino code, about 250kb -- loaded, from Costa Rica, and once a user logged in, they were socketed to a server that handled the gaming action in the Isle of Man. Graphics and sounds were still sent from the Costa Rica server. I didn&#39;t have a gaming license in the IoM, though - that was around $400k to acquire legally. So I found a former IoM MP who was a lawyer, who wrote a letter to the IoM gov&#39;t stating that we didn&#39;t perform random calculations on their server, thus weren&#39;t a gambling site under IoM law. Technically that meant that no dice roll or card shuffle leading to a gambling win or loss took place on that server. So the IoM server handled the socketed user interactions, chat, hand rotation and tournament stuff. Also the bitcoin daemon and deposits/withdrawals. But to avoid casino licensing, I then  set up a VPS in Switzerland that did only one thing: Return random numbers or shuffled decks of cards, with its own RNG. It was a quick backend cUrl call that would return a fresh deck or a dice roll, for any given random interaction on the casino servers. The IoM server would call the Swiss server every time a hand was dealt or a wheel was spun; the user was still looking at a site served from a cheap web host in Costa Rica. And thus... yeah, I guess I handled millions of requests a day over a $6 webserver, if you want to count it that way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People tend to severely underestimate how fast modern machines are and overestimate how much you need to spend on hardware.Back in my last startup, I was doing a crypto market intelligence website that subscribed to full trade &amp; order book feeds from the top 10 exchanges.  It handled about 3K incoming messages/second (~260M per day), including all of the message parsing, order book update, processing, streaming to websocket connections on any connected client, and archival to PostGres for historical processing.  Total hardware required was 1 m4.large + 1 r5.large AWS instances, for a bit under $200/month, and the boxes would regularly run at about 50% CPU."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s the point of this post? OP is serving a file at 50req/sec. There is not even mention of a dB query. How is that able to relate to any kind of normal app?I guess that the post was written as an answer to the mangadex post [1]. Mangadex was handling 3k req/sec involving dB queries. It was not just a cached Html page.50req/sec for a Html file is super low which shows that a $4 month server cant do much actually. So yes this is enough for a blog, but a lot of websites are not blogs[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28440742"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve spent a bit of time in Australia. When I compared the caliber of people who worked in tech and venture to those in mining and law enforcement, it was night and day. There’s a TON of smart people at companies like Woodside, and lots of smart people at the Australian Federal Police (to the extent where the US and other countries rely on them for help in tricky technical situations). The tech and VC crowd seemed to get off on the size of a funding round, or how tight they were with the founders of Atlassian, or if they knew some guy from America with a “successful exit,” or other complete nonsense.With a dynamic like that, the law enforcement people are always going to point to the tech and venture people and say to politicians, “are you going to take orders from these clowns, or are you going to listen to us?” And now that you’ve got the climate activists antagonizing the mining companies, who are responsible for a very significant percentage of the economy, you’ve got two extremely savvy and powerful groups working together.If Australian tech people want their government to take them seriously, they’re going to have to act in a manner that is as professional as those at the AFP, and they’re going to have to hit people with an economic hammer that can match the force of mining. Yes, it’s not fair that things are this difficult, but that’s life."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"“Young men get little help, in part, because schools are focused on encouraging historically underrepresented students. Jerlando Jackson, department chair, Education Leadership and Policy Analysis, at the University of Wisconsin’s School of Education, said few campuses have been willing to spend limited funds on male underachievement that would also benefit white men, risking criticism for assisting those who have historically held the biggest educational advantages.”So this is a direct result of the move away from color blind policies, to race based policies.&gt; Keith E. Smith, a mental-health counselor and men’s outreach coordinator at the University of Vermont, said that when he started working at the school in 2006 he found that men were much more likely to face consequences for the trouble they caused under the influence of drugs and alcohol.This is exactly what black students report as racism in school.Seems like evidence that race based policies are just racist.&gt; In 2008, Mr. Smith proposed a men’s center to help male students succeed. The proposal drew criticism from women who asked, “Why would you give more resources to the most privileged group on campus,” he said.
Funding wasn’t appropriated, he said, and the center was never built.Obviously white men are not in fact privileged on university campuses.“Female students in the U.S. benefit from a support system established decades ago, spanning a period when women struggled to gain a foothold on college campuses. There are more than 500 women’s centers at schools nationwide. Most centers host clubs and organizations that work to help female students succeed.”Men are failing because it is the policy not to support them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of this is driven by narratives—A narrative that college isn’t worth it anymore. A narrative that (white) men are uniformly privileged and life is just easy for them. And a narrative that those men aren’t wanted by society any more.I’m not convinced that all those men need to go to college, but they clearly need something. They need to feel like they’re part of society. Nothing good can come of an entire generation that feels lost, without purpose, and unwanted."</p>

We have to assume that there are problems of a similar nature in their cloud service, which is way more of a problem considering the number of orgs that depend on the JIRA SaaS offering.Maybe the founders could have used some of that time spent planning a tunnel between their side-by-side $100M houses, or engaged in Twitter rants, to actually bother delivering value to customers. It’s only a matter of time before this product suite is disrupted, and it might represent one of the most obvious low-hanging opportunities in our entire industry.I still remember being in line at a WWDC a few years back, overhearing someone ask a developer, “where do you work?” When the developer responded with “HipChat,” the other person immediately chuckled and said, “oh — Atlassian... I’m sorry” — and then everyone around them also started laughing. It’s amazing that this company continues to fall up, and that the founders have taken on roles as the ruling digital gurus of Australia (shows you why it’s so easy for the government to run circles around the local tech industry and pass whatever laws they want)."</p>

Do you have plans to support this? I don’t mean to ask this as a FUD spreader, I just am curious how you differentiate from Discord aside from being open source, and similarly, how you intend to ensure your offering stays open source in perpetuity?"</p>

Landscapes, vistas, animals, architecture etc all would be welcome.- high latency Twitter, where no post is viewable until at least 2 weeks after it&#39;s published. Bickering threads become impractical. People learn to post stuff that will be worth caring about later.- Clearly just for entertainment and not information Facebook alternative, in which GPT bots produce a significant fraction of posts, impersonating users and making stuff up.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I understand the points about having to comply with laws. But what is is unjustifiable is my view is that their marketing does not match the reality. They probably did some A/B testing and saw that keeping vague promises about not tracking users increases conversion rate. You, as an HN reader, being in the top 0.1% of the population in terms of tech-savviness, may be able to read through the nonsense and understand how little it means when they say &#34;by default, we do not keep any IP logs&#34;. But the other 99.9% of the population won&#39;t understand it, and that&#39;s why their marketing strategy works: they are selling a level of privacy that does not exist to customers who do not know better without technically lying.Their threat model and all threat scenarios should be front and centre on their front page and sign up page. That is if they care about user privacy not just the bottom line. They have a choice between better-informed customers or more money, and so far, they have chosen the latter.What this and the new Apple debacle have proven to me is that privacy is not a product that can be purchased. If you want real privacy, you have spend a lot of time learning how to preserve your privacy. No matter what Apple and ProtonMail and similar companies tell you, you cannot buy privacy off-the-shelf."</p>

If anything ever happens to sci-hub or library genesis, there&#39;s enough people out there with backups that a replacement can be set up fairly quickly, albeit without the proxy functionality to obtain new papers.However, the more the merrier, so if you&#39;ve got some spare hardware and bandwidth to share, I&#39;d encourage you to contribute to the seeding effort if you&#39;re able. At current market prices of ~$30/TB, it costs ~$2400 to have a copy of the full collection sitting on your desk."</p>

Maybe in 2018 it was good enough. But in 2021 it&#39;s not. Come on, Protonmail, you&#39;re supposed to be leading the way  -- don&#39;t make me figure it out myself.Replace immediately with &#34;By default we don&#39;t log IP, but may be required to by local law enforcement. We recommend everyone connect through Protonmail through Tor. This month, 60% of our users connected through Tor&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m aware that this is a very silly sounding question, but I’m very confused about what’s going on here.If the subject of this investigation had been using ProtonVPN to connect to ProtonMail, would this have (in a marginal way) protected their anonymity? If ProtonMail can be compelled to begin logging, surely the same must be said of ProtonVPN right?It’s interesting how many “privacy focused” companies tout being based in Switzerland as some big badge of honor, which a layman consumer such as myself is supposed to be really impressed by due to the overall reputation of “Swiss privacy laws.”In practice, I’ve never been to Switzerland. I don’t know any person that has had any legal issues there, let alone someone that’s litigated a digital privacy case there. I do not speak German or French, and don’t know where to start when it comes to looking up specific cases or court proceedings, so I’d be extremely slow on the uptake of the actual ins and outs of how the Swiss privacy model works from a practical standpoint.The “based in Switzerland” thing strikes me as a bit of a black box bit of marketing speak. How much time, energy and money did ProtonMail expend fighting this surreptitious logging mandate? Does “Swiss privacy” actualy mean anything if ProtonMail is happy to hand over your IP address when spooked?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Disclaimer: I have a ProtonMail account that I pay for.I have seen a ton of disturbing pieces about ProtonMail. Every time I&#39;ve looked into them, they seem to be maliciously motivated and usually not true, or otherwise twisting of the truth. This has been a confusing thing for me because why is there a small subset of people so vehemently against them?In this case, I&#39;m not surprised. They say quite clearly they can be compelled to collect IP addresses - including in the linked tweet. This seems like a pretty clear cut case of them being compelled to provide an IP address. What the authorities can&#39;t do, is read that person&#39;s email. And that&#39;s what I and others pay for.I&#39;m not sure what there is to be upset about here? Other than perhaps France prosecuting this individual to begin with? If we had faith that ProtonMail wouldn&#39;t hand over anything to the government, why would anyone even care about having encrypted emails?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Amen to this. Two case studies from the UK I&#39;ve been thinking about recently:1) Visiting London and spending time in South Kensington - walking back to hotel at night, only about 30% of houses had any lights on. Suggestion is the others are effectively uninhabited, and a search on RightMove shows properties sell for £20-£30m for a 4/5 bed. This isn&#39;t normal Londoners, it&#39;s outside investment.2) Cornwall, where I live - an insane house price rise over lockdown as city dwellers aim for the beautiful bits of the country. Literally no way now you could afford your first home round here on minimum wage, and some towns have a high (&gt;50) % holiday or second homes.It&#39;s an untenable situation. I think my generation (I&#39;m nearly 50) are probably the last to be able to afford their own home on anything other than a massive wage.Round here in Cornwall the jobs are things like surf instructor, supermarket worker, barperson, etc. That&#39;s not gonna stretch to the local house prices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is desperately needed. And not just in the major cities; this is happening in every Dutch town. Amsterdam may have prices beyond absurd, but the whole nation is burdened by this problem.In the street I live in the capital of the northern province of Fryslân (Frisia) most homes are owned by their inhabitants, but in the past few years we&#39;ve seen several houses being bought by small-time investors (who already own their own home of course, are financially well on their way, and are looking for ways to save their saving from low interest rates and inflation), who charge renters four times what my fellow homeowners and I pay for mortgage.You never get to know the renters, because they are really only here for as long as nothing better comes along (like buying a house or social housing), and who can blame them?Meanwhile maintenance of these houses is minimal, because the market won&#39;t really reward proper upkeep at this point; they can always sell the house for an insane price tomorrow.It&#39;s really upsetting to see my younger colleagues stuck renting a flat, while I own my house having even paid of the vast majority of the mortgage simply because I had the luck of buying it in 2013 (a major dip in the market where paying less than the listed price was common).For the good of society we need to put a stop to this type of speculation on the housing market."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A finer point often missed on HN is how different publishing is across fields. In physics i have always been able post preprints to the web/arXiv and leave them up indefinitely. Their scientific content is identical to the journal formatted version and they show up in search often before the paid version. This is true even for the historically worst offenders (i.e. Elsevier)Last I heard the situation in chemistry was still completely different. The ACS is also known for bullying cash strapped college libraries into exorbitant and unnecessary journal subscriptions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yes, everyone uses scihub (and author websites, etc) from time to time.A related question is &#34;who pays the per-paper fee&#34;.  Well, not me, and none of my colleagues.  However, I&#39;ve learned that the fees do get paid, but not by individuals. Rather, it&#39;s libraries that are paying, to fulfil interlibrary loan requests for papers in journals with high subscription costs and low readerships.  If the number of requests times the price per request is lower than the yearly subscription cost, this can be the only way to stay within budget.Where I work, research grants let me cover journal &#34;page charges&#34;, but they do not let me subscribe to journals, nor contribute to the library budget.  This has always struck me as crazy, for the yearly cost of many journals is under the cost of publishing a single paper.  Heck, we have researchers publishing in the journal of whatever, paying several tens of thousands of dollars per year ... and our library cannot afford to subscribe, so we can see our work.Yes, you read that right: in many cases, authors have to pay to publish, and then pay again to read.Some progress is being made, though. Many granting agencies now encourage researchers to publish in open-access mode. That would seem great, except that they did not increase grants to compensate for the extra cost.  Money spent on those fees is money that cannot go to support graduate students.As others have noted (here, and in dozens or hundreds of similar discussion threads), things are different from field to field.  I work in a field where it&#39;s just as important to read old papers as new ones. That means that the solution of authors posting to their websites is not always viable.  Probably a third of the papers I read (in support of teaching) are from people who died long before the web got started."</p>

Do people enjoy enriching copyright monopolists by paying hundreds of dollars for 24h access to one paper that may or may not have dubious methodology?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is pretty amazing when you think about it. When I was a child, 200 years seemed like an eternity (I was born near the US bicentennial, and the founding of the US was like ancient history to me). Now, nearing 50, 200 years ago is just about 4 of my lifespans. In just 4 of my lifespans (and I don&#39;t even feel that old), we went from rudimentary electric motors to all the amazing technology we have at our fingertips today. Truly astounding."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well, sort of. Faraday invented the first thing that would sort of rotate given electrical power. It took another 33 years before someone built something that had useful torque at the output shaft. Along the way, coils and commutators had to be developed. It also took a while to realize that generators and motors are basically the same.Rotating electrical machinery was considered a solved problem and kind of boring until about 20 years ago. Then people started using semiconductor switches to drive electric motors. Classic theory assumed you were driving motors with a sine wave. Motor controllers tried to make motors happy by providing a sine wave, or something close to one. Gradually it was realized that motors could be purpose designed for chopped waveforms. This broke all that beautiful closed-form math and charts on polar graph paper that goes back to Tesla. You have to simulate to design a modern electric car motor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; At heart, Faraday was an experimentalistThis is often repeated, but I think it&#39;s a misleading label. Faraday doesn&#39;t get nearly enough credit for his theoretical prowess -- probably because he didn&#39;t develop his theories mathematically. But I would say his mental model of nature was far more accurate than most of his peers, mathematical or not, and that understanding is what guided him to groundbreaking discovery after groundbreaking discovery. He developed his experiments to confirm his own theoretical predictions, often predictions that no theoretical physicsts were making at the time; for example, the Faraday effect (that magnetism can rotate the polarization of light in a material), Faraday&#39;s law (the electromagnetic one), and Faraday&#39;s law (the chemical one)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"About 10 years ago my wife and I got two recues. A female greyhound and a male lurcher (who basically looked like a greyhound). My wife used to try to get our dogs to howl, because she thought it was funny. It turned into something they would do on command. Anyway, about 8 years ago my wife discovered the song &#34;Werewolves of London&#34; by Warren Zevon. At the appropriate parts of the song, she would command our dogs to &#34;sing&#34;, and they&#39;d both howl. Yes, hilarious. Anyway, about 7 years ago the greyhound got osteosarcoma, a painful bone cancer, and we had to put her to sleep. The lurcher was extremely lonely, so we rescued another greyhound. My wife didn&#39;t put the Werewolves song on again, because it made her feel sad. Fast forward about a year, and we&#39;re both in the house doing whatever, and I put on a playlist, not realising the song was in it. As soon as the first bar of the song played, the lurcher jumped up onto the armchair at our front window, frantically looking into the park out front, howled, and ran around the house &#34;searching&#34;, presumably for Pasha. Tears, obviously. But also the realisation that a dog can recognise a song, years after last hearing it, in a sea of thousands of other songs. And within the first few seconds of it playing. Honestly, I was astonished."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many pet owners have seen this behaviour, and what I find note worthy too is that that trauma can be easily detected when the animal doesn&#39;t react according to intention.Anecdotically, I adopted a mistreated dog this year. He&#39;s a really good boy, and shows the exact same behaviour the paper states regarding accidental interactions in general. But if you are for example brooming and slightly touch him, he immediately hides and may even piss himself. It seems to me that he was beaten up with some kind of stick when he was just a puppy.

This is madness.I expect police and three letter agencies to use their own hacking tools and budget. I will not pay the bill on a multiple levels to be monitored and classified.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem here is similar to what happens with the War on Terror.1) It is noted that governments could, in theory, be spying on everything. Widely dismissed as silly.2) There is a trigger event (eg, 9/11). Inside government, a standard slips. They start spying on everything.3) Years later it becomes public knowledge. It is too hard to monitor what is going on now though, so it is difficult to tell who specifically should be outraged about what.4) The situation persists because it is convenient to the people in charge.5) (TBD) It gets turned on political dissidents. I&#39;m expecting everyone will agree on this point in 5 or so years, at the moment that is probably maybe more a partisan observation.Apple&#39;s partnering up will follow the same pattern. There just isn&#39;t enough transparency about what closed source software does."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s an interesting thought experiment for anyone who disagrees that the proposed system is problematic.Let&#39;s say the police installs a new device in your house. This device could be capable of seeing or hearing anything that happens in your entire home. However, the police claim that the device is only watching a specific door in your house and forwarding encrypted low resolution photos to their servers &#34;just in case&#34; some criteria is met and they need to take a look. Nevermind that it would only take a policy change and an OTA update that you have no visibility into, or chance of blocking, before it&#39;s watching your entire house in real-time and sending practically anything to their servers. After all, they did release a carefully worded statement regarding what the device supposedly does.But hey, you have several other doors to enter or exit your house from so what&#39;s the big deal right? You could seal that door and never be subjected to the system _as advertised_.Would you trust the police in that scenario, regardless of whether you have anything to hide?"</p>

Let them be, let them express and find themselves.I am the shave every day suit kinda guy and will remain so, but if someone chooses to be different or wants to complain about new woke culture values , fine by me.There&#39;s not more or less trans and gay people these days, they are just more visible and have a voice, as they won&#39;t be burned at a stake anymore, metaphorically speaking."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some weird random anecdote about Back Orifice 2000 (BO2k) that nobody asked for:We were goofing around in high school with this. Putting it on computers in school and messing around. We sent it over to a classmate. Her father was teachter and we figured she might open it on their home PC. (we were 14 at the time, by the way).Anyway, we made a fake hotmail address in the name of another classmate. These two people didn&#39;t share any classes and were not in eachother little social circle. We sent a couple of emails back and forth pretending to be the other guy but lost interest along the way and nothing happend.Now for the strange part; forward 18 years or so. I&#39;m in the city, I run into the person who we were sending the messages to... with the person who we were pretending to be. Married and 3 children together.I&#39;d like to think we brought them together in some strange way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi party people, this is Sir Dystic, author of the original 1998 Back Orifice.  Great to hear all of you reminiscing about my software!One thing that I did not predict when I released BO:  The distribution ZIP contained three files, a readme.txt, the BO server and the BO client.  In retrospect, the BO server should probably not have been distributed with the original .EXE extension as a LARGE portion of people apparently downloaded the ZIP, unzipped it and just double clicked on the BO server, immediately infecting themselves.Keep disturbing shit please...--oo] ooM [oo--.."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh man, yeah also adding to the list of people that abused their highschool computer labs with this.  We had so much fun, but we eventually drew the ire of the school IT admin.  After class one day the teacher took us aside with the admin and asked if we had installed BO on the computers, which we of course denied... they &#34;believed&#34; us, heh, but gave us a stern warning that whoever was doing it should stop.  We would have all probably ended up with felony charges these days.The next year, so 1999, we actually got approval to attempt to change our grades as an exercise.  We actually managed to do it by sneakily copying a floppy one of the teachers used to store their grades with a program called Integrade. We took it home, reverse engineered the password protection to disable it, changed our grades on the copy, re-enable the password protection with the original password, and turned that in as our proof. Our teacher was impressed and super sketched out/nervous at the same time. I guess they never considered we&#39;d succeed and get access to the whole class&#39;s grades..."</p>

As Nassim Taleb has often pointed out, the same things that make a system &#34;efficient&#34; also can often be viewed as making it fragile.  &#34;Just-in-time&#34; means &#34;no buffer&#34;.  We have, for decades, been doing as much as possible to make all our economic systems as efficient as possible, which is to say with no extra capacity.Thus, if it had not been the pandemic, it would eventually have been something else.  Sooner or later, there is always a shock to the system.  If you have made sure that every step in a long complex chain is optimized to have very little slack, the thing you have optimized for is fragility."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Old article May 5th of this year, which in that industry is a long time. 
Nevertheless the situation since did actually get worse as predicted. Not only is it chip shortage we should call it component shortage. A standard 10k 0406 package resistor is sold out around the world. Many high quality, high density capacitor you can&#39;t get. The same goes for the standard semiconductor parts like diodes, MOSFET or TVS. 
Semiconductor sales rep give you now +50 weeks lead time for the many ICs meaning no real forecast at this point. 
They generally tell you 2022 will be tough maybe Q4 will ease up.Many of the major semi companies are running at fairly high capacity, but supporting elements like IC package build capacity, sometimes materials can&#39;t keep up as well.We looked at some boards to redesign, but when you are short hundreds of parts it gets nearly insurmountable to manage a hardware redesign. Interesting and challenging allocation period, definitely worse than 2003-2005."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"  Searching for the text &#34;strcmp&#34; finds a static string that is referenced in the sub_ED7D94 function. Looking at the strings output, we can see some interesting string references, including auth_admin_ssh_special and auth_admin_internal. Searching for auth_admin_internal finds the sub_13DBEC function. This function has a strcmp call that is not present in the 6.3.0r19b firmware:

  The argument to the strcmp call is &lt;&lt;&lt; %s(un=&#39;%s&#39;) = %u, which is the backdoor password, and was presumably chosen so that it would be mistaken for one of the many other debug format strings in the code. This password allows an attacker to bypass authentication through SSH and Telnet.

They returned in 2014 and added a separate backdoor that allowed them to directly access NetScreen products, according to the people and the document.Can we have more technical details regarding this?

Australia has for a long time now been pursuing policies which seem on their face to feel more at home in China.  I suspect for most Australians though, they&#39;ll just go along with this and there will be a greater proportion of tech-savvy people who find a way to dodge this and exclusively connect via VPN.It&#39;s becoming more and more commonplace for people outside the US to connect to the Internet exclusively via a VPN egress in the US, creating &#34;US-based&#34; online accounts, and operating online as if they were a US person.  It seems in the future this may be necessary just to experience the Internet with even basic expectations of free access and anonymity.As long as they continue to play ball geopolitically with the rest of the West, nobody is going to call them out, but the last decade in Australia has seen a significant curtailing of human rights.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Personally I found most of those examples to be not great. I think they would be improved better names overall, more well named private methods and most importantly well structured companion test classes proving the behavior.I really dont want to read another developers comments on their mental state while I am feverishly debugging their code during a 3am page.The number of times I have been misled by an outdated comment. I generally open git blame to see if the comments predate any code now. Tests on the other hand almost never lie.Readmes or comments explaining why something exists vs what it allegedly does are generally much better. If you can’t write expressive code why would you assume your English is much better?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Speaking of source code comments, antirez (of Redis fame) wrote a fantastic article[0] about that topic some time ago and I still recommend it to colleagues whenever they make the hollow statement that &#34;code should and can be intelligible on its own, without any comments&#34;.[0]: https://web.archive.org/web/20210226004600/http://antirez.co... (I still don&#39;t understand why he deleted his blog)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For the first example with conditions, I much prefer rolling the &#34;why&#34; of the comments into boolean variable names where possible e.g.   // We still have burst budget for *all* tokens requests.
   if self.one_time_burst &gt;= tokens {
      ...
   } else {
      // We still have burst budget for *some* of the tokens requests.

becomes something like   (I&#39;m   missing context   but you get the idea):   enoughBudgetForAllTokenRequests = self.one_time_burst &gt;= tokens

   if enoughBudgetForAllTokenRequests
      ...
   else
      ...

I don&#39;t see this often though. I see the commenting pattern a lot where the comment usually duplicates the &#34;what&#34; of the conditional code, and it&#39;s often ambiguous if the comment is talking about the condition or a whole branch.I think a descriptive variable makes the code easier to skim, it&#39;s more precise and less likely to become inaccurate. For a big complex conditional, you can break in up into several well-named boolean variables you compose together (but obviously comment the bits that can&#39;t be covered by a concise variable name)."</p>

Even if you don&#39;t do anything wrong and you agree that the stuff they are watching for is bad and should be prevented, there is something eerie about always being watched and controlled.The iPhones should mind their own business and leave the police work to the police.That being said, I would be O.K. if the scan is performed on the device upon physical access by the authorities. You caught someone, You have enough evidence to investigate the person, you are allowed to search his/her home then maybe it can be O.K. to run a fingerprint scan on the phone to look for evidence."</p>

Rather, Apple’s senior execs publicly doubled down and basically labeled those of us who thought this scheme to be insane, as a bunch of uninformed idiots...You can change a product decision in a day, but it takes a LONG time to change a culture that thinks these sort of insane product decisions make any sense whatsoever.

Very, very, very handy for- Just exploring some code.- Quickly pull up as reference code w/ decent navigation without having to checkout locally or navigate forward/back in the source tree in GitHub.- When reviewing PRs and wanting to check out some surrounding code that is not part of the actual PR.- If you want to quickly commit something really small and trivial in master/a branch/a PR without having to do the whole stash/checkout/pull/change/commit/push rigmarole (like if you&#39;re in the middle of doing something else).Things that are very annoying:- Some of the most used VSCode hotkeys are browser hotkeys, like Ctrl+T, Ctrl+P, Ctrl+Shift+P etc. The functions aren&#39;t even rebound to anything else, they&#39;re just not available via hotkeys.- Some extensions are not available, especially ones that (partially) may rely on some kind of local binary. I understand that, but that also sometimes rules out extensions that could partially work. Example: none of the Zig extensions work because they reference tooling binaries, so I can&#39;t even get syntax highlighting of Zig code. You could argue that&#39;s an extension packaging issue, however. That&#39;s fair.- The PR reviewing UI needs a lot of work, because right now it&#39;s not as good as the normal GitHub UI, so currently, for larger PRs, I need to have both UIs open.I hope in the future you can save a gist or something with custom settings/hotkeys/extensions to load.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"After reading the article one thing that struck me was the &#34; internal candidates who were rejected after interviewing with the hiring manager were half as likely to exit as those rejected earlier in the process.&#34;Working at a fortune 100 top 10 company I&#39;ve applied for multiple higher level positions after 5 years and multiple high marks on my reviews and not gotten 1 recruiter call. I did get with one recruiter and he told me one of the positions was actually only posted for someone internally and they didn&#39;t even interview anyone else. My resume looks good according to them its unclear why im being passed over. Ive not even gotten an interview and if i did i think i may feel like staying and trying to continue to pursue opportunities possibly.Its essentially soured me on company though - they have all these &#34;raise my hand&#34; type crap saying i want to be considered as a viable candiate for opportunity. They have multiple manager tools to flag people for opportunity which my manager has done for me. Yet here i am - ready to move up - put my 5 years in doing excellent work - and left hung out to dry when I&#39;m ready. So I&#39;m on the verge of moving elsewhere and my boss being &#34;shocked&#34; I&#39;m looking elsewhere and saying if I find anything else let him know and he&#39;ll see what he can do - well that ship has sailed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think hiring externally is often over valued in many organizations today.There is a number of reasons for this, but one is that if you hire someone external they are more under your control than an internal hire who already has ideas of how things should work and relationships and therefore has their own amount of political clout. A new hire has no reputation to lean on so must be a bit more cautious at first.Another reason is that there is a “grass is greener” mentality. You know what you like and don’t like about an internal hire. You don’t know what you like or dislike about the external hire yet, not really. Additionally, someone from outside may have the silver bullet to solve X,Y, or, Z problem that no one else can seem to solve. You know your internal candidates don’t have the quick easy solution you want, but maybe this new person will!** hint: They don’t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Required reading for every technical leader: https://randsinrepose.com/archives/shields-down/&gt; Resignations happen in a moment, and it’s not when you declare, “I’m resigning.” The moment happened a long time ago when you received a random email from a good friend who asked, “I know you’re really happy with your current gig because you’ve been raving about it for a year, but would you like to come visit Our Company? No commitment. Just coffee.” ... Your shields are officially down.&gt; Your shields drop the moment you let a glimpse of a potential different future into your mind. It seems like a unconsidered off-the-cuff thought sans consequence, but the thought opens you to possibilities that did not exist the moment before the thought existed.&gt; Every moment as a leader is an opportunity to either strengthen or weaken shields. Every single moment.As a CTO of a young company, I start many mornings thinking about my team&#39;s shields. Am I asking them to focus on projects or parts of the stack they don&#39;t find interesting, or being less proactive than I should be in unblocking their needs? And most importantly, am I staying true to our values and providing them the transparency they need? Because if we get to the point where the OP article is, where team members want to find a different team, there is no other tech team they can transfer to, so their shields being down becomes a critical vulnerability! There&#39;s a balance, of course, and some weeks are just too chaotic to be perfect at this, but I try as much as I can. I like to think that this is also the type of environment that makes people the most creative they can be - it&#39;s a win-win for everyone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Is GateBoy a perfect simulation of a Game Boy?&gt; Actually no, for complicated reasons. The Game Boy chip has a handful of logic gates that operate independently of the master clock and whose exact behavior depends on things like gate delay. These gates create glitches that depend heavily on the physical placement of the gates, the silicon process used to make them, and other weird things like temperature and voltage.This is fascinating, I previously would have assumed that a gate-level simulation would necessarily be perfect by definition."</p>

The amount of efforts that the author put into this project makes my jaw drop.This project reminds me of a question I&#39;ve had in my mind, though.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"“We conclude that piracy and similar competitive shocks push firms to innovate to stay ahead of imitator products, and that this effect is moderated by their existing patent portfolios.”I guess it’s good to study that this is the case, but isn’t this exactly why companies fight piracy and attempt to patent and then enforce those patents? That is to reduce competition and make it easier to extract value from what they’ve produced?Basically, isn’t the premise that if privacy was rampant and patents didn’t exist then more people and companies would be able to innovate on the technology without fear of a lawsuit? I think of how stagnant the Eink space is, and how much broader usage might that technology get if it wasn’t encumbered by patents (just one example)?I guess I just don’t find this surprising."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Second, we build a dataset that matches the financial information of publicly traded software firms with (1) R&amp;D expenditures and patent, copyright, and trademark counts, and
(2) a unique dataset of pirated software.&#34;That&#39;s fine, but they&#39;re measuring what can be measured easily and calling it &#34;innovation&#34; (at least in the headline), rather than anything meaningful. Having more patent filings doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re &#34;innovating&#34; more. Nor does spending more on &#34;R&amp;D&#34; which is mostly just an accounting convention.At two companies, I worked on getting more patent filings, because that was seen by management as The Thing To Do. In both cases, we would ask the engineers &#34;what have you done lately?&#34; and then decide if any of that might be patentable. Usually this involved paying a bounty to the &#34;inventor&#34; if a patent application was filed, and another if the patent actually issued (4-8 years later).In one case for awhile (Google Maps), they were actually paying people a bounty for submitting an idea for a patent, even if no application was filed! I was on the committee that decided if the idea was (1) great, file for sure, (2) pretty good, maybe file, (3) OK but don&#39;t file, or (4) so bad you don&#39;t even get the idea bounty.  (*Full disclosure: I&#39;m pretty sure this system isn&#39;t in effect anymore.*)

I&#39;ve written elsewhere [1] about the dubiousness of software patents, so I don&#39;t need to explain how they have nothing to do with &#34;innovation.&#34;[1] https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2399580"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"S. Korea gaming industry once suffered a lot from piracy in 90s. This was a main driver of their rapid transition toward online gaming. In fact, one of the earliest graphical MMORPG was invented by Nexon (a year before UO). Coincidentally, Nexon is also the inventor of loot box which becomes their dominant business model. And I think not many people prefer this over old fashioned game packages.So yeah, piracy could corner industry to &#34;innovate&#34; their product and business model in order to survive. But it&#39;s not guaranteed to be in a societally beneficial way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am sorry but as an application developer, I think this is all wrong. I&#39;ll thank my infra team today for not being assholes like this guy.1. Application developers are your users. If we application developers took offense every time a user tells us that things are not working, we&#39;d be pretty pissed off all the time. Educating and empathizing with your users is part of your job.2. Talking about how it was better before: QA teams sure do buffer a lot of crap. They also cost a bunch and slow down time to release. Yes agile is causing problems. The bureaucracy and stiffness of organizations before agile was no nirvana either.3. By your own affirmation you treat applications as black boxes that should be deployed using a runbook that should just work. This is ridiculous. Application&#39;s ownership is shared between everyone who works on it.4. And yes, as developers, networking or physical drive space are things that we tend to abstract away. Maybe if the infrastructure people were involved in development discussion earlier, they&#39;d be able to raise their hands and say: wait a minute, you&#39;re going to blow up our logs.This all feels like someone who used to not do anything suddenly being asked to take part in what&#39;s happening...EDIT: apologies for the strong language and sounding like an asshole myself, but I certainly feel irritated when someone takes the time to write a 5000-word article complaining about whiny developers who thought they could own ops but actually don&#39;t know anything and scream for help when they themselves are the cause of all evil."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the article: ”Often they have not even bothered to do basic troubleshooting, things like read the documentation on what the error message is attempting to tell you.”This has been the bane of my work happiness for a while now. I keep having to tell junior devs to actually _read_ the fine error message, just in case it actually _contains information about the error_, you know. Not that it seems to help much, it’s like they can’t get the concept into their heads.This is 100% a problem with younger, bootcamp-”educated” devs, in my experience. I know the common wisdom on social media is ”no one reads text anymore”, but if that includes aspiring developers, it might be tough to replace the current workforce when that day comes…"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think some of the article is framed wrong.  It&#39;s written as competent ops guy/team vs. incompetent developers.  But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s actually what&#39;s going on.  I&#39;m sure there are competent developers saying the exact same thing about their relatively incompetent ops people.We built a couple relatively simple applications for an enterprise client.  It took their ops teams months to get both applications running in K8s, even though our deliverable was a fully functioning container.  They were largely incompetent as far as we could tell.But, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth being unkind or judging them.  Every time they asked us a question we made an effort to point them in the right direction.  There were other times it was a problem we couldn&#39;t help with, we kindly let them know that.I think the reality is that the demand for competent IT and developers outpaced supply a long time ago and it&#39;s not getting better.  Those of us who know and care about the difference should make competent co-workers and executives part of the job evaluation.  Or, accept incompetence around you as a reality, help and avoid as wisdom dictates.But, complaining that it exists and framing it as competent ops vs incompetent developers is both untrue and unhelpful IMO.The latter part of the article that talks about the pace of features, complexity, and the lack of time is spot on though IMO.  I think the article would have been better focusing here and avoiding the IT vs devs angle."</p>

As a result there are federal laws regarding communication of results and scheduling follow-up exams that apply to mammograms only and no other radilody or other medical test. To comply with these laws radiologists set up a uniform grading system with highly specific jargon. As a result the formatting and language used in mammogram reads by radiologist will be much more consistent than, say, a chest x-ray screening for lung cancer. This makes mammograms the ideal studies to be tackled by AI"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This type of evaluation (both the meta-evaluation and the underlying studies themselves) are the exact sort things AI enthusiasts should want researchers to do. It cuts through the hype, and gives everyone a clear assessment of where the technology currently stands.Clearly there is room for improvement. Maybe this study will also spur the development of new types of systems which augment human/radiologist decision-making."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this headline is bad. When you read the abstract you find that what this is really saying is that there are essentially no studies that are fit for purpose to evaluate AI systems for breast screening in general and those that are the closest to being suitable show the worst results. That&#39;s the real take-away here - we&#39;re not even at the point where we&#39;re collecting good data about AI accuracy, let alone actually producing accurate AI.I would suggest these two things might be linked - the only way you get publishable results is by failing to do rigorous studies."</p>

You know that Nextcloud, GitLab and others make money through their enterprise offerings and probably aren&#39;t too interested in selling their users&#39; data or finding other alternative ways of monetizing their platforms.When a seemingly random company pops up and just rehosts a number of these FOSS platforms, you tend to be skeptical of their motivations or offerings, seeing as they make bold claims about otherwise insignificant platforms, especially given how often you hear untrue statements about privacy nowadays and even moreso if you don&#39;t know or care about their history: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDesktop.orgPersonally, i applaud their efforts and attempts at popularizing these tools and platforms (as someone who self hosts OpenProject, Nextcloud, GitLab, Rocket.Chat and many other pieces of software that i use myself), however i fail to see where their target audience lies: the majority of people who don&#39;t care about their privacy will simply stick to the larger cloud offerings of Google or Microsoft office components and something like GitHub for their code, whereas the more privacy conscious folk are more likely to self host software or will need lots of time to build trust with them.I do hope that they have a sustainable existence and a net positive impact on the industry, though!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When the Caldor fire (now 210  thousand acres, 328 mi^2!) was smoking up Placerville, the downtown Home Depot had, at the main entrance, a big stack of 20x24x1-inch #9 furnace filters, box fans, and rolls of tape, with one all constructed sitting on top, running, black with trapped smoke.Kudos to HD for not jacking up prices.It is best to make them with a four inch thick filter, which HD does not stock, and higher than a #9, likewise, bought online. You can stack a #8 in front of a #17, to make the ~$100 #17 last longer, and stack two box fans (one intake, one exhaust) to get more suction. Maybe stack #8/fan/#17/fan, to keep the fans clean.But the single one-inch #9 filter cleared the smoke from my whole house in no time flat! Don&#39;t let &#34;best&#34; stop you from doing &#34;good&#34;.An advantage you have from high airflow is that particles that make it through the filter once are likely to get trapped the next time around, or the 20th. Atomizing some water ought to make filters momentarily stickier, until it dries.Fan blades getting dusty can cut airflow in half! (Same on laptop cooling fans; use a vacuum cleaner on your laptop air path.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Heres my set up:- 20 inch box fan- 20x20x4 MERV12 filter. The 4-inch pleating is key here, to reduce the air resistance on the box fan.- 1 inch dust pre-filter. This is course, low air resistance, and is for increasing the life of the more expensive MERV12/HEPA filter (so it doesn&#39;t get clogged with easy to filter dust).- Both filters are on the intake side of the box fan. This means you don&#39;t need a bungee cord because the intake has negative pressure, the filters just &#34;stick&#34;. It also means you keep your box fan flowing with only cleaned air.Heres a pic of my setup: https://imgur.com/a/O4I6UdxAnd here&#39;s a graph this morning from my air quality sensor, after turning on the fan/filter: https://imgur.com/a/c5GMNcCThe peak at ~30ug/m^3 PM2.5 is approximately 100 AQI. The fan was on the other side of my 900 sqft house from the sensor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I built a &#34;four filter fan box&#34; this year when the smoke started rolling in (off MERV 13 filters, I think?), and have also gone about getting the measurement devices to verify that, yes, it really does work!  I used a round fan, and a lot of tape to seal things to the fan, though it appears this might not matter as much as I thought.  The filter area is sufficient that the fan doesn&#39;t really struggle - fan motors burning out from a single filter (as someone else reported) is a well known failure mode, and a good reason not to just strap filters flat to a fan.  They rely on the airflow to cool, and it&#39;s easy to screw that up.Air quality (in terms of PM2.5 and PM10, the stuff my testers measure) coming out of the fan is very good - far lower than the room, and the filter will start pulling down air particulates in a room fairly quickly.  If the room is around 5ug/m^3 PM2.5, the output from the fan is sub-1, and it moves enough air to do quite a few air exchanges per day.  It really does make a difference.I&#39;m using a couple Temtop meters to measure air quality, and while they&#39;re Chinesium, they do seem to work fairly well.Also, if you ever wondered: Use your stove&#39;s vent fans!  The air quality difference in PM2.5/PM10 between cooking without those running, vs cooking with them on, is HUGE!  I&#39;ll see spikes in the kitchen up well past 100ug/m^3 PM2.5 after browning meat, which is worse than it is outside in heavy forest fire smoke!https://www.sevarg.net/2021/08/28/temtop-air-quality-sensors..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I once had tea with some bedouins in Jordan’s Wadi Rum around 2015 or so and these pictures could have been of that tea. The tent looked the same.They were really nice people who just stopped some travelers for tea and a chat. They weren’t selling anything and wouldn’t take any gives or thank yous. Frequently when traveling you’ll get some fake hospitality experiences that end up just “gift shopping” but this experience was neat to me as they seemed just interested in travelers.I wonder how frequently they do that as the road wasn’t super busy, but also wasn’t abandoned. We maybe spent half an hour and no else came by."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Intereseting way of milking goats:https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZaZgfe2Gyk0/XqHI23JcnqI/AAAAAAAAW...The animals are in a line bunched up close and alternating facing so that one animal has its head on the shoulders of the two animals next to itself and looking towards their rear.I haven&#39;t seen that before. More peculiar is that I can&#39;t see them eating anything. Normally when animals are milked, it&#39;s lunch (or dinner) time. They line up in front of their troughs and they&#39;re milked while they eat. Typically there&#39;s some kind of divider or railing to keep them more or less still also. Otherwise you need to have really well disciplined and calm animals or you&#39;ll get lots of hooves in milk pots and so on.It&#39;s also very interesting to see how they dried their cheeses on top of their tents. These look like small, lactic cheeses. If they had a good source of salt they would probably be very high on salt both to help preserve and sanitise them and also to replenish the salt lost by the people to the heat of the desert. Anyway that must have been really strong cheese: sun-dried, very salty, goat&#39;s milk cheese. Yum."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These photos are of stunning quality. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve seen any 19th century photos that come close, even with retouching and postprocessing. But also the lighting is incredible. Like it looks more like something associated with a more modern (ie post-WWII) technique.I didn&#39;t see any mention of the provenance of these photos.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My main technique from my engineering undergrad days was extremely effective and yet very simple and easy to describe and/or implement. It is:1. Attend the lectures and take good notes. Don&#39;t write things down that are obvious or that you already know.2. Before any exam, go back over the dozens of pages of notes and condense them down to 3 or 4 pages, omitting details that will be brought to mind by the things you are writing down.3. Go back over the 3 to 4 pages, condensing them down to a single page, compactly written.4. Go back over the single page, condensing it down to a single notecard.The act of condensing requires you to internalize the knowledge enough to know what you have memorized and what you must still note down. And the act of repeatedly writing down the hard parts commits those to memory too.By the end, the notecard has a handful of difficult to remember formulas and a bunch of keywords that prompt your memory to recall the salient details. In the US at that time, a single notecard was often allowed during exams, so the final work product was also that card.(My recall 20 years later is excellent, so this is not cramming.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"1. attend every lecture without fail2. take legible notes by hand on everything that goes on the chalkboard3. do all the homework, and do it on time4. make sure you understand how to get the solution to every homework problem5. review notes and all homework problems as prep for the examI found this meant reliably getting at least a B in the courses at Caltech. Getting an A required considerably more work.My high school technique of not bothering to do much of anything and still getting an A took a year and a half of abject failure at Caltech before I wised up. Fortunately, Caltech&#39;s freshman year was pass/fail, evidently they were familiar with people like me :-)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a former middle school teacher, I found that the evidence-based techniques that the author mentioned, such as &#34;spacing&#34; and &#34;retrieval&#34;, were underutilized in classrooms due to teachers not knowing about them, as well as how tedious it can be to implement them. I founded a nonprofit called Podsie (https://www.podsie.org) to help with this problem, and we created a free tool that&#39;s essentially like &#34;Anki for classrooms&#34; so that teachers can help their students study more effectively in their classes."</p>

Just don’t collect data, then your privacy statement is very very simple. Only complicated agreements require complicated 5,000 word privacy declarations."</p>

However, the DPC gets about ten thousand complaints per year since 2018 and this is the first major fine. The DPC also proposed an initial € 50 million fine and was forced by the other European data protection authorities to move towards € 225 million, which is still only 0.08% of the turnover of the Facebook Group. The GDPR foresees fines of up to 4% of the turnover.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Regarding questions in the comments: Assuming allotments in .dk works roughly as in .se, they are designed not to be actual homes.You&#39;re not allowed to use them as your listed place of residence; authorities require you to have a &#34;real&#34; residence as well. This can of course be circumvented by claiming you live with a friend and listing yourself at their address, but it&#39;s illegal and measures will be taken accordingly if you&#39;re found out - you&#39;ll surely lose your allotment, if nothing else.Allotments are concentrated to specific areas, typically on municipal or county land rented by a co-op consisting of the inhabitants. Nowadays, most co-ops have installed municipal utilities (water, electricity) but not plumbing for human waste, which means most of them still have outhouses. Outhouse waste management is of course also heavily regulated. Often these utilities, at least water, are turned off during winter.The permanence of allotments is fleeting; many of them are continually moved or chopped off in order to make room for actual residential buildings. They are however very popular among apartment dwellers who move out to their cosy little allotment houses at the first sign of spring.Regarding the OP, nice work! Looks great."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice little house!
I did exactly the same, with the same costs, and lived there happily for several years during my studies at University. It was a great time and a good place for a single young man with a dog.I used a wood burning bath stove with a 100 liter copper tank to store heat for the night. It worked great. The 100 liter of water kept heat for many hours and the tank surface radiated it slowly into the room. This was much more convenient than a simple wood stove. I had only to add wood one time per day in autumn and two times per day in winter."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recommend Schmidle’s recent book “Test Gods” if you are interested in Virgin Galactic and test piloting. Schmidle is not an engineer and I would have enjoyed a deeper dive into Virgin Galactic’s design choices, but it is a great book about (among other things) the tensions that emerge when a complex technical project is overseen from a distance by utterly nontechnical, PR-oriented upper management. The company’s communications and business strategies make a lot more sense knowing that the people calling the shots do not comprehend in the slightest how their product works.For many reasons (some alluded to in this article, many more in the book), SpaceShipTwo is an inherently risky experimental test craft—with death always waiting on each side of a narrow envelope—and it always will be. Management is willfully ignorant of this. Engineering leadership has done what they can to make the vehicle safer (at the cost of performance), but the intractable issue is that any one mistake by a pilot is likely to be fatal (and already has been, in the 2014 accident). Voices like Stucky and Ericson who wanted to acknowledge the inherent danger of the vehicle (which doesn’t mean grounding it) have been ignored and ultimately removed. The company’s business requires the vehicle to be understood to be safe by the public. The chickens will come home to roost."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Brilliant well written article. Not without bias, but you can see through the words on the page and into the immense pressure that team at Virgin Galactic must have been under to get their boss into space and to beat Bezos, all for the inflated ego of one man. Branson did put his life on the line to achieve that accolade though, which was a gutsy move."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “ A private program can’t afford to lose anybody,” Branson said.Worth noting that Virgin Galactic is currently the only private space program to have killed anyone so far. This quote is from before the fatal 2014 crash, but the FAA makes it pretty clear that a virgin galactic had a cavalier attitude towards crew safety[0] back then too. Combined with this article, that paints a picture of Virgin Galactic as a genuinely unsafe company that is going to kill a lot of people if it’s not stopped. Manual processes, no safeties, high pilot work loads, and rockets do not mix well.0 - This was caused by a design that explicitly assumed that highly trained test pilots were incapable of making mistakes.  The design required manual activation, had no failsafes, and the pilots were not told that activation at too low a speed would cause the vehicle to break apart. A breathtakingly bad design for a spacecraft."</p>

At the beginning of the audit, Mozilla assured that this WebSocket server is only part of the staging build. However, later it was revealed that Mozilla would like to reuse this connection for communication with a browser extension in the future. Thus, Cure53 decided to report this issue.&#34;A classic one.Also interesting:&#34;On Linux and macOS, a helper shell script is called by the privileged daemon which sets up WireGuard and network configurations. This script is extremely critical for security and should normally get most of the security attention. However, prior to the test, Mozilla has announced that it will be replaced soon and, as such, does not warrant substantial reviewing efforts. This - in Cure53’s opinion - is rather unfortunate in relation to its criticality. Cure53 therefore recommends that the upcoming changes get comprehensively reviewed in terms of security before they are shipped in production releases.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For me, Erlang was the ladder to functional programming. Once I’ve mastered Erlang to be able to write gossiperl (http://gossiperl.com, not maintained in a long time), all immutable programming became easy. Maps, flat maps, recursion, no side effects, all became clear.After Erlang, I’ve enjoyed Scala a lot. Especially Akka.I do tons of go now and when I need actors in go (not very often because channels are rather straightforward), I use proto.actor: https://github.com/AsynkronIT/protoactor-go.Erlang is awesome. I can definitely recommend the “Designing for scalability with Erlang/OTP”: https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-for-scalabili.... This is the book which finally made me “get it”."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I gotta say I really enjoy these blogs. This and the Go one are really well done. Stylistically I love the look and the art is great too!Then the content is enjoyable, and the length of the posts seems just about right too.Where do I subscribe?Also, technically speaking, having shipped Erlang a few times in 3 different products (although all of them were between 2000 and 2010), that I&#39;ve had the least amount of trouble developing them the REPL experience is (was?) awesome with all the Emacs integration. The ability to basically shell into a remote node and poke around live was extremely handy.People didn&#39;t like the binary logging but it seems systemd forced it down their throats anyway later. Also, I provided really easy tools to read the logs using the runtime, so they didn&#39;t care much in the long run.It was really easy to write pipe drivers for programs written in Haskell, Python and C++. I even used the Java integration back then.OTP was like a dream come true, and when you&#39;re building out an SNMP MIB, MNesia made that so stupidly easy - I couldn&#39;t believe how much faster I was going than the folks trying to plug into NetSNMP.I wish I was still working on that project sometimes. It was my favorite."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found this to be an accurate write up, though my experience has been Elixir, which inherits all of the traits of Erlang (to my knowledge), most notably the BEAM / OTP.Side note: That&#39;s a really cool graphic that looks to be Joe Armstrong, Robert Virding, Mike Williams with telephones? Where&#39;d that come from?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve gotten into networking and very much enjoy seeing how others approach the problem space at the scale level! It&#39;s gotten more important with not just the explosion of online threats, smart home devices etc., but also just because there is more and more value to be extracted from a high bandwidth WAN link via your own private services. That said I definitely strongly recommend against using anything UniFi based for routing/gateway tasks at this point (author mentions their AIO custom hardware UDM thing). They have significant issues now in WiFi and even switching, but at least remain kind of workable there. But the company has been an absolutely depressing development dumpster fire for years now and the trajectory still appears aimed straight down. And for whatever reason routing/gateway in particular is an area that only ever briefly got much oxygen there. So for a greenfield situation I&#39;d be wary.There are lots of enormously better solutions for that. Personally I&#39;ve dumped all my UniFi gateways (including some of the &#34;next generation&#34; ones I had for testing) and moved to OPNsense running on decent SuperMicro 1U edge systems (excellent value, quiet, regularly available dirt cheap on ebay and the like). But there are many great options there including VyOS, OpenWRT, or even just running straight OpenBSD if that&#39;s what you like. Router/gateway is one area where I thinking devoting real metal, preferably with higher reliability hardware and extra remote management options (like IPMI), is worth it. It&#39;s an important linchpin for a typical network, and while virtualizing it is possible and definitely desirable at large scale it&#39;s not where I want to add more moving parts without a team behind it. Everything else can go tits up while I mess with it or there are odd interactions and as long as the gateway/routing is still solid odds are I can recover without much disruption or having to physically be there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For anyone who wants to go a similar route I can highly recommend OpenWrt as the OS. Not only does it run on cheap routers, but also on big x86 machines and even in VMs and/or containers. For example, I run OpenWrt on my desktop in a LXC container to manage networking (Wifi, bridging firewall for bridging VMs into the network, general firewall, etc.) through the nice webui. It gets direct to access the WiFi adapter and the host gets access through a bridge connected to the container via a VETH interface.It comes with nice addon packages for stuff like Wireguard, all kinds of tunnels/VPN, adblockers, runs containers and a ton more. I even run it on a VPS as container with it having exclusive access to the &#34;physical&#34; NIC. The parent OS isn&#39;t directly accessible at all. Makes firewalling a breeze. The only open ports are for the Tor relay and Wireguard, through Wich I connect to the webui/ssh and do everything else.Of course, my router also runs OpenWrt..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really glad to see this write-up. I love my current PiHole setup, but replicating it for family/friends (especially with my blocking so many sites they might want) hasn&#39;t seemed doable. I would be having to help them constantly with blocked sites, etc.,.My setup could be even better if either Fios or Orbi provided a half-decent router, but just using PiHole as my DNS server has been awesome. When my Pi (SD card) crashed and I had to revert to my old router setup, it was shocking how slow everything was. I&#39;d become so used to pages loading in a blink, waiting a second or two while ads loaded seemed to take forever.If you have any unused SFF computer gathering dust, give PiHole a try (runs on any of the major linux distros). Initial setup takes under an hour. You can customize the backend out of it with blocksite lists; I&#39;m blocking so much my wife and kids can&#39;t even install new iPhone apps. Amazon Devices, Rokus, Google, nothing gets to call home unless I allow it. I have it forcing all Google/Bing searches to use their clean filter; worrying my kids might google &#34;porn&#34; is a thing of the past. There are easy to find tutorials out there, just be sure to filter Google images, as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; People even discovered more of the Internet, such as things like &#34;file transfer protocol,&#34; where they could get lots of stuff no one had ever seen in the form of files. Programs such as &#34;finger&#34; let a person see who had been online, which, again, blew people&#39;s minds. People were so excited by the World Wide Web, they never wanted to go back to AOL or Compuserve or Prodigy.This person&#39;s explanation for why AOL died does not match up with my memories. I remember regularly using AOL&#39;s built in web browser (which was just a wrapper around IE) to surf the web. The reason my family switched away from AOL was because we could get faster internet through our cable company. It had nothing to do with FTP, fingering, or &#34;discovering the world wide web&#34;.&gt; The business people decided that there should be a way to make something like AOL, even though everyone thought Web sites were amazing and didn&#39;t want to go back.Again, this just doesn&#39;t line-up with how I remember things. I remember people liking the sense of community AOL had (the chats, IMs, forums, etc). It was other factors (faster internet, etc), that led to AOL&#39;s downfall."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of people I know have online lives that live within or around facebook and nothing else.They get their news from facebook as the news/media organisation posts updates to their feeds, which they can share with others via WhatsApp or messenger. No need to visit the news sites it&#39;s all there.They get their local second hand marketplace through Facebook Marketplace, no need for eBay et al.They get their local community updates, gossip, business recommendations etc. through Facebook Groups. No need for nextdoor or neighbourhoood specific websites/forums.They can find local businesses through the Facebook as the businesses have a Page that describes what they do, testimonials from previous customers, bit of a social feed to add some personality/&#39;blogging&#39;. Contactable through messenger. The businesses don&#39;t need to setup a website, Facebook offers all the tools.You never have to leave, especially on iOS/Android if you use the facebook app. Even links to external sites are rendered in a webview, so no need to look at URLs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems like I completely mis-remember things...IIRC, in addition to being an &#34;online portal&#34; to online content, it was also an ISP. Back in those days, most internet access was via a Dial-Up modem. If you wanted to get online, your computer had to make a phone call. Where we were, dialing outside of the region defined by our prefix (the 3 numbers after the area code) was considered a &#34;long distance call&#34; and was like 10 cents per minute or something. Connecting to the internet ran up your phone bill ~ fast! if you did not have a LOCAL ISP. IIRC (which is questionable), AOL had toll free numbers, but they&#39;d charge you for your time online - so your internet bill came from your ISP only and not from ISP + Phone Company. Part of AOL&#39;s marketing gimmick &#34;first 1,000 hours free!&#34; or some such amount of time to get you to sign up.This was nearly 30 years ago, and I didn&#39;t really understand how it all worked back then, and my parents paid the phone bills (not me!) so my recollection may be full of partial-truths or downright falsehoods. But point being - I think the article really understates AOL&#39;s role in being an ISP (especially for rural folks who didn&#39;t have local ISPs)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Mac App Store gives a hint at what would happen if there was any choice.  The amount of software actually available for the Mac is far, far greater than what’s listed in the store.  Furthermore, while some quality and notable apps are still in the Mac App Store, many well-known apps are not there.  The number of lousy apps is also extremely high every time I go to search or just look at the front page, to the point where Apple does itself no favors by even drawing attention to most of the apps on that store (and it gives the impression that “most” Mac software must be like this).If they simply listed all major Mac apps, e.g. linking to their web sites or download links or whatever, they would hugely increase the value of the Mac platform and bring enough direct benefit to developers to be worth some kind of fee (and of course Apple gets $99/year anyway).  Instead, they tried to port the same clueless, greedy, review-burdened scheme to that store, layering completely unnecessary requirements on top (like poorly-thought-out sandboxing).  And since developers had a choice, they mostly said No."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a question about monopolies and market abuses.Apple released their phone in 2007, the App Store in 2008, and in-app payments in 2009. During that time their marketshare was fairly small, and it didn&#39;t start to really grow until they expanded availability to the Verizon network in 2011.Right at launch of the App Store, Apple announced its sales commission would be 30%. Then they extended that same fee to in-app purchases a year later. At the same time they set the rules that third-party app stores were not allowed, and that third-party payment processors could not be used.I&#39;m mentioning all of this history to make this point: Apple made these rules when they were not a monopoly by any definition. They released these products, with these rules, into a free market and let the market (both users and developers) decide which products to use and which products to develop for.Now, obviously, between 2007 and 2021 the iPhone has been a wild success. Its platform has grown in users and developers every year.So in terms of the framing of &#34;market abuse&#34;, at what point between the launch of these rules and now did Apple cross that threshold between free-market competitor who can legally control their own platform to monopolist abusing its power?I&#39;m asking this question not just to make a point, but because I think it will be instructive for future companies to understand where in the growth curve the rules they started with can potentially cross over into being &#34;abusive&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is a German movie about the system that is used to gather TV ratings. It&#39;s a special box that some users get which reports what they are watching. Small sample size goes into a big statistic (not sure how accurate the portrayal of the system in the movie is). These boxes are given to the people who pay the German public TV fee, which excludes i.e. students (they don&#39;t have to pay) and some other groups. This group of critical people figured that out and started to hack into these machines to fake ratings. They faked the ratings away from stupid trash TV towards some higher quality stuff, documentaries, culture, ...
Obviously in the movie then the country saw a renaissance, everyone got smarter, yadda yadda, you get it.I feel like this is similar.
All tech savvy people block ads and analytics and at least the known tricks they use against us. So the internet only tracks the defenseless people and is then built to serve them (and or exploit them).Maybe we should engage in large scale AdWords fraud. Send come fake traffic away from Facebook and over to Wikipedia."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I expected these numbers to be higher. However, an even more interesting metric is the 88% block in Firefox.Firefox may not have a great market share, but based on these numbers it&#39;s market share may very well be eight times higher than your analytics report. This can change the argument of &#34;it&#39;s only 3% of our users so we don&#39;t need to test on FF&#34; to &#34;it&#39;s a quarter of our user base, we should at least test it&#34;, depending on your target audience. I&#39;ve seen tons of people claim general Firefox usage is negligible based on public data from websites such as statcounter, but these metrics prove that those statistics are unreliable and should not be used.The best you can do is use server side UA inspection, though you can&#39;t really distinguish bots from real users that way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am amazed at how non-techy people use the internet. I teach college and I will sometimes have students go to some web site. I am amazed at how few use adblocking and just accept all the ads and popups and overlays and crap. Even more than that, I will see them using something like google docs and google will put an overlay for some new feature and they don&#39;t click the X to close it. They just type away with that overlay in the corner. That drives me crazy. I don&#39;t know how they do it."</p>

Can they create a fake social media account or email account registered to you, and impersonate you for the sake of entrapping someone else? Like hey uncle, love your new car, got any hot accounting tips? I don&#39;t even see anything in these laws that says the person whose data they&#39;re accessing has to be the target of the investigation.Imagine if at any time in any chat, even with your partner or parent or child, you couldn&#39;t know whether you were actually talking with them or a government agent, perhaps because someone they know is tangentially suspected of a crime - without the matter even being brought before a judge.

The laptop&#39;s internal display went wonky late last week but an external display still works fine. It&#39;s annoying to reboot -- the GPU drivers aren&#39;t loaded yet when the boot disk passphrase prompt is shown, so the external display doesn&#39;t show the passphrase prompt (and importantly: whether unlocking succeeded). It&#39;s within a 1-year warranty for parts &amp; labor. I&#39;m currently talking to with System76 support staff to ship it back for repair. The process has, so far, been easy and straightforward.In the past they had pushed a driver update that disabled the laptop display when multiple monitors are connected. I had recognized the problem since their system drivers are open source and was able to recommend &amp; review a PR to fix [0]. It was nice to see that patch go in.[0]: https://github.com/pop-os/system76-driver/pull/182"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Mildly related: I&#39;m curious what are the latest advances in consumer irons and ironing boards. Something that improved them in the last 10-15 years, even incrementally.For example SSDs became much more common and affordable over the past 15 years and their parameters also improved. Are there similar improvements in household appliances like irons? Where would one look for an industry overview?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting, but something about this article is weird. Overall it doesn&#39;t feel like it&#39;s in the Wikipedia style and some parts are very editorialized, e.g.&gt; As extreme ironing has branched off, the conditions can gain in extreme activity. For example, a branch of ironing has been developed that includes both bungee jumping and well-pressed clothing. Bungee ironing is what some would call the ultimate in the thrill of extreme ironing.[8]That citation leads to https://averyj12.weebly.com/extreme-ironing.html, which was clearly copied wholesale from Wikipedia (all its links and citations go directly back to Wikipedia).Looking at the history, there have been a lot of edits since that text was added in 2007, so it&#39;s surprising that someone hasn&#39;t rewritten it since then."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a long case history in front on the NRLB about whether or not employees can use employer&#39;s resource (ie notice boards, email system, slack) for organizing. In general the rule has been that if employees can use something for general non-work purposes (e.g. setting up a baseball game on the weekend) then the company can&#39;t stop them from  using it for organizing.However the specifics (e.g. what if there is a policy about what topics are OK, but some OK topics are non-work, or what if there is a general work-only policy that is selectively enforced against organizing) have gone back and forth depending on the administration.Apple&#39;s behaviour is probably a result of a 2019 ruling [1] which opend the door to this kind of thing. Given that the administration has swung back to being fairly labor friendly, it&#39;ll be interesting if this gets to the NRLB to see if they find a way to make this illegal.[1] https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/labor-board..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really think employer hosted employee activism is just ... always a problem.It&#39;s a minefield, and one with slack where the employer has all that data, what was said, and who... that&#39;s just a mess for EVERYONE.&gt;But that rule has not been evenly enforced. Currently, Apple employees have popular Slack channels to discuss #fun-dogs (more than 5,000 members), #gaming (more than 3,000 members), and #dad-jokes (more than 2,000 members).I would find those more acceptable if I were an employer, even an employee.Edit:  I had a bad typo in this post where I said &#34;employee hosted&#34; and intended it to say &#34;employer&#34; now fixed, thus some of the responses."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In many ways I think this blog post really makes quite compelling arguments and honestly opened my eyes a bit.One (perhaps mad) idea for more secure access to a machine deep behind many levels of NAT where you, the sysadmin, have lawful access but are fed up with having to have a 12 KB ~/.ssh/config file in order to access it because of your university&#39;s overbearing IT department^W^W^W^W network topology, would be to &#34;just&#34; run an onionsite with onion services authentication [1], preventing it being publicly accessed without the pre-shared key. If your onion service just redirects to ssh (presumably with certificate-only auth) I can&#39;t help but think that this is almost an example of security by obscurity done right.[1] https://support.torproject.org/en-US/onionservices/client-au..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently had to do some basic sysadmin stuff over tor and I disagree with OP.Two things that failed mieserably, fetching a file that was just shy of 5M, and a reverse SSH tunnel.The SSH tunnel was unusable, it would only last for minutes at the most. I wish I could use mosh but that requires UDP.The file transfer was actually done with curl and the file was often incomplete.This was all done within Europe where we have the highest concentration of tor nodes.So no, I don&#39;t think tor is appropriate for sysadmin tasks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Most of the dissonance comes from the fact that a job is much more than the core activity.When we speak of pottery as a hobby, we think of handling clay, sitting in front of a pottery wheel, choosing a fitting glaze, then admiring our finished work. The focus is on exploring and enjoying the process. You have complete control over the process and you can do as much or as little as you like because there is no delivery pressure. Sounds fun!But a pottery business is a different beast. Now, the act of making the pottery is a much smaller part of the overall workload. You have to deal with marketing, sales, payments, inventory, and communications. Your pottery time is no longer about exploring, but about replenishing inventory or handling custom orders in time to avoid bad reviews. You can&#39;t just make a piece and be done with it, you have to carefully pack it, handling shipping, drop it off, and hope that nothing goes wrong. If it does go wrong, you now have to deal with the fallout and handle angry customers. Most customers are fine, but it only takes 1 irrationally outraged customer to ruin your day.Hobbies, by definition, can&#39;t be a job. You can try to make a job or business that includes your hobby, but it&#39;s a superset of the hobby with numerous other activities that you may or may not enjoy.I do actually know a lot of people who enjoy running businesses. You might say that businesses are their hobby and delivering results to customers is their passion. Not surprisingly, they&#39;re doing quite well in both business and the mental health department. Lucky."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first half of the article resonates with me. I didn&#39;t use to have hobbies and I used to feel like a machine just going to work, coming back, sleep, rinse and repeat. I love programming but after writing nth CRUD app in flavor of the month framework / technology, it just isn&#39;t that fulfilling anymore. I picked up couple of hobbies - teaching Sanskrit and playing guitar and my life has improved drastically. I no longer derive meaning only from work. Both hobbies are just hobbies and I do it for fun only with no intention of monetizing them. In fact, I couldn&#39;t monetize them even if I wanted to. Sanskrit is too esoteric to have any commercial value of any kind. And I truly suck at guitar. Nobody&#39;s ever gonna pay me to play guitar. But whatever I can play, gives me pleasure, so I do it. My dad asks me why I waste so much time in useless hobbies when I could be investing that time working towards next promotion and pay raise. I reply to him, they are not useless if they make me happy and content."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Doing what you love&#34; is a total new-age garbage scam, only possible because we (most of us on HN) collectively live in the wealthiest, most powerful empire the world has ever seen, and nearly all of the important work (food, defense, fuel, manufacturing, etc.) is done by lower class citizens who don&#39;t know what an API is. Sure, the management of the empire requires critically talented minds, but how many roughnecks know what C++ is, and how many executive vice presidents know how to operate an oil rig?Don&#39;t do what you love, do something that allows you and your family (or you and your community if you&#39;re not up to the task of having a family) to build resilience, and then love your life outside of the work you do to provide for it. If that&#39;s making 200 Gs per year for 10 years slinging Javascript and then getting out of debt with the bank, do that. Don&#39;t worry so much about &#34;loving your career&#34;, I promise you no migrant farm workers harvesting your berries love their career, and yet I doubt they wake up with internal mental crises because they haven&#39;t achieved self-actualization at work."</p>

My change in perspective has reduced my anxieties and anger significantly. &#34;This too shall pass&#34; and all that. The more of my self image is focused on superficial things, the more I will take things personally. What we are angry about tends to be a reflection of ourselves more than the current state of affairs.If I see myself as a busy professional I might be much more aggravated by someone at the grocery store holding up the checkout line with EBT (since I am busy they must be lazy!). If I see myself as a social climber I will always be worrying if people are using me for something (since I am using them!). If I identify with my wealth I might develop some neurosis regarding the sight of the homeless (since they represent ultimate failure!).I don&#39;t believe in reincarnation but it is a helpful thought experiment to think about what benefits and drawbacks your particular incarnation of life holds and how those might be different if you were incarnated elsewhere."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nothing trains you to not take things personally like being put through the ringer of modern day online dating. Forcing myself to deal with rejection hasn&#39;t been a very pleasant experience, but I&#39;m absolutely sure I&#39;ve improved because of it. As soon as you can truly and honestly accept that in the vast majority of cases, you do not have the power to change people&#39;s perception or attraction to you, it&#39;s not only liberating: you also realize that effort is better placed where you have a decent chance of actually changing the outcome.Once you understand and feel confident in what you have to offer other people, if they do not want it, what else is there to say? Nobody wants everything, and nobody can offer everything. A single human, or ten humans, is not representative of humanity. There&#39;s nothing to be sad about, it&#39;s just an interaction among millions, and you just need to find new interactions.It&#39;s based in insecurity, the need to affirm our value through other people. This is of course fundamentally human and is practically impossible to get rid of, but you don&#39;t have to assign the same value to every single human you come across in your life. You don&#39;t like every human being in the world, so why would you expect every human being to like you?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have mixed feelings about this.Younger me learned a lot of problem solving skills and most importantly spent a lot of time learning how to read by playing RPGs and games that required lots of reading. My reading skills would not have been as advanced if i wasn&#39;t playing text heavy games that had a lot of plot like Square Enix games and the CRPGs of the time.Modern games though are clearly designed to get you as addicted as possible and to play as long as possible to an extent that made the old school 90s RPGs grinds look tame and mild. (the grinds in those games basically existing to make sure you had to play long enough to not be able to return it to the store or beat it via rental)Modern UX of games is designed so that you dont have to really read or understand the game mechanics even to be able to play and get into that feedback loop. To the point where when a game comes along like Dark Souls that asks you to learn the game systems to beat it, gamers go gah gah over &#34;how hard&#34; it is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People talking about the benefits of games reminds me of people talking about the benefits of, say, a glass of wine with every meal: it&#39;s worth looking into but at the same time it&#39;s the sort of thing that obviously doesn&#39;t scale linearly with the amount/intensity of consumption.I similarly have mixed feelings as well, but for slightly different reasons. I&#39;ve read about studies that say that musical training (which is often believed to translate to improvements in other cognitive aspects of life) doesn&#39;t actually correlate to said improvements, and I suspect that the same might be true for games (e.g. solving game puzzles doesn&#39;t necessarily mean you get better at school math or whatever)This line of reasoning is also supported by research on correlation between games and violence (i.e. the consensus is that no such causation relationship exists).All of these suggest (to me) that gaming is just its own activity without much impact on life other than opportunity cost itself.However, there are some aspects of gaming that can affect overall well-being, specifically aspects related to repetitiveness (e.g. grinding). Repetitiveness is something that does come up in a lot of disciplines (e.g. its soothing effect in autist kids, or repetitiveness as tool in the context of meditation, etc).The &#34;addictive&#34; aspect isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing either, IMHO. Games are, almost by definition, supposed to be engaging. But that addictiveness may come in a form of trade-offs, for example, back in the day of grindy RPGs, delayed gratification was basically the entire point of grinding. The one aspect that I think is justly vilified is monetization strategies that tie to addictive elements of gameplay (especially the gacha variety) and this is something that I&#39;d actually commend China for trying to address via regulation."</p>

It&#39;s maintained, there is an active community and an healthy enterprise behind the project. IHMO  this is that matters more than the programming language used.* SabreDAV supports WebDAV and this is that we are using at Nextcloud for our webdav/caldav and carddav support.* KOrganizer does run on Windows but it require to be built from source. I have been told that a better Windows support is being worked on for the entire PIM suite and I hope that at some point exe can be distributed. Technically there is nothing that makes it impossible to use on macOS, we just need more helping hands to help with fixing the platform specific issues. There is also a modern alternative to Korganizer being worked on called Kalendar.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Classical music is one of the hardest genres to surface through existing music apps.Where an app may have an &#34;artist&#34; field, classical music will have &#34;composer&#34; and then for the performers it will have &#34;orchestra&#34;, &#34;conductor&#34;, &#34;principal soloists&#34;. For an opera all of those are primary fields that could be considered &#34;artist&#34;.The variations of the data is huge, only last week I had to correct Tchaikovsky in my own data and looking at the variations I see online:    P. I. Tchaïkovski
    Peter Ilyitch Tchaikofsky
    Peter Tchaikovsky
    Petr Ilitch Tchaïkovski
    Piotr Ilic Tchaikovskij
    Piotr Ilyitch Tchaikovski
    Piotr Tchaikovski
    Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (this one is arguably most correct)

This is something everyone gets wrong, and yet whomever gets it right is going to help make it easier for people to find and celebrate classical music, and to expose more people to classical music.Even if today you know that you love Beethoven&#39;s Symphony No 3... finding the best performance and recording is almost impossible, and if you do happen to stumble upon it on a streaming service getting back to it later (if it wasn&#39;t the only one in your recents) is difficult.I&#39;m really glad someone is investing in this, and it needs to be a different app / interface to handle this difference in metadata and in weighting of the fields. Capturing the intent of &#34;oh, this person really just wants to search Gould as a principal soloist and weight the search that way&#34; is far easier when you have an app that can provide a classical music perspective and filter over an existing library.PS: Plex does this really badly too... whatever you do, don&#39;t let the Plex Music Agents decide the metadata, Verdi disappeared and had the metadata for Veridia which I believe is a rock band."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Primephonic is no longer available for new subscribers and will be taken offline beginning September 7. Apple Music plans to launch a dedicated classical music app next year combining Primephonic’s classical user interface that fans have grown to love with more added features. In the meantime, current Primephonic subscribers will receive six months of Apple Music for free, providing access to hundreds of thousands of classical albums, all in Lossless and high-resolution audio, as well as hundreds of classical albums in Apple Music’s Spatial Audio, with new albums added regularly.This is utter insanity. I understand acquiring, and &#34;sunsetting&#34; the acquisition when it makes sense, blocking new user signups, and heck I&#39;d even say its pretty cool that they&#39;re planning on releasing a totally separate experience for Apple Music classical listeners.But why shut down Primephonic before this new experience is ready? It just pisses off the already niche and hesitant customer-base you&#39;ve announced you&#39;re trying to court!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The most interesting thing about this is that Apple&#39;s pre-announcing that they&#39;re going to be launching a dedicated classical music app. Presumably it&#39;ll be very closely based on the current Primephonic app, and worked on by the same developers.This has some close parallels to Apple buying Workflow and turning it into their now-platform-standard Shortcuts app. It&#39;s still being worked on by the original developers, too.Shortcuts has been given fairly high priority in all Apple&#39;s recent OS releases, particularly as it ties into their home automation ecosystem, and it&#39;s resulted in surprising bursts of popularity. E.g. last years &#34;#aesthetic&#34; complete-homescreen-customization boom was entirely based on using Shortcuts as a hack to customize app icons.It&#39;s been honestly weird to see such a relatively high profile part of the OS being run as a mostly-independent subsidiary like that, particularly given Apple&#39;s notorious control-freak ways. Them expanding the approach like this rather than just cramming it into Music suggests that they think it&#39;s working well for them..."</p>

I love Super Hexagon and VVVVVV, and am planning to play Dicey Dungeons in the future. Looking forward to see what he makes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a friend who&#39;s been trying to go all-in on Godot but decided recently to switch over to something else, largely due to ongoing issues with its lighting system. When toying with it, he encountered poor lighting overall and some particularly counterintuitive behavior with the (rather simplistic) lighting system.For example, a simple scene with a wall intersecting the floor and a light placed on one side. In this scenario, you get weird light spilling around the edge onto the vertex where the wall meets the ground (see [0] and [1]).  There&#39;s also poor handling of multiple light sources; if you cast a shadow and place a light directly on top of the shadow area, it&#39;s impossible to displace the shadow (see [2]). These sorts of things are very noticeable, and part of the recent work that they&#39;ve just released was supposed to address this. However, these examples came from the most recent release, which made my friend begin considering other options with more robust lighting.[0] https://imgur.com/rsxjV5u

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve recently checked out Godot and it turned out to be easier than I expected. I followed this series of tutorials [0] (I found it most palatable at 2x speed, occasionally going to 1x for critical parts).Took me about an hour altogether to get pretty productive at making a non-trivial game. The engine is cool and takes care of a lot of routine things, like physics, collisions, and organizing things hierarchically.[0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvPTSZl2WCc"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think a lot of this is because our profession does not have an accepted universal bar everyone can jump over to be considered ‘qualified’.  Every technical interview feels like rolling the dice in proving I am a competent developer.  Giving me 50 minutes in a high pressure situation in an environment i am unfamiliar with and people I just meet will never product my best results, and then add to the fact that I could be asked any question, and my ability to answer is it being ranked against other candidates.  Maybe someone else _just_ did a similar question in another interview and it’s fresh on his mind.  Maybe someone spend their entire career focusing on just this type of problem given in the interview, but the question in the interview is only partly related to the actual job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We made the interview process very simple and traditional in our current organisation. 30 minute chat, judge whether the person can do the job or is a good fit, if yes then offer a year contract with 1-3 months of evaluation period. Changing a job is risky also from the candidate&#39;s perspective so if the person is pretending, the lies will catch up. Most of the scenario it has worked pretty well.Sometimes, people who you think are not capable to do the job, often outperform expectations too. It is all about taking a risk on a person and giving them respect and a chance. We could have done leetcode, or pair programming session. It takes more energy and effort to do it from both sides and probability of finding a good candidate is more or less the same."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very few firms want to hire juniors, while nearly all firms desire senior-level talent.This manifests inflated job vacancies because so many firms have an evergreen job posting for &#34;Senior Full Stack&#34;.  Because talent is scarce these roles rarely get filled (hiring managers expect million-dollar candidates to accept $100-200k compensation).Also, because lots of software requires specific expertise, there are vacancies that can&#39;t be filled because of a knowledge gap (novel industries / projects, etc).  For example, how could SpaceX possibly fill all their engineering roles?  Surely money is not a limiting factor, but rather the limited supply of qualified expert rocket engineers?"</p>

It would be great if you could refrain from flagging this time, even if the ruling comes as a culture shock to you.I assure you it is not clickbait. The authors of GPL software are really spending years and a fortune in court only to have all their copyright claims dismissed. The ruling passed the High Court (TGI), the Appeal Court and the CJUE."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I think is the real meat of the story:&gt; That is to conclude, by having a contract (a license is a contract), you lose your rights to pursue any IP/copyright claims (the two are exclusive in French law).GPL was written by lawyers for the American system of law and France is not part of the USA. The systems of law are different and therefore the implications of GPL-licensing code are different.I&#39;d be very surprised if France is the only country that treats software licenses like this. The basis of the USA system of law is completely different from even other European courts, let alone non-Western systems of law. Assuming you can write a license for use in the USA and enforce it the world around is quite foolish."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The Rust or Haskell compilers, for example, insist on policing whatever private understanding you might have about the meaning of your code.The thing about &#34;private understandings&#34; is that they&#39;re just another way of saying &#34;we expect ceaseless, flawless vigilance&#34; (as one writer put it), not to mention &#34;flawless communication and training.&#34;Languages which impose weird restrictions tend to do so because it allows them to offer (nearly) ironclad guarantees about something else.There are certain programming idioms that work brilliantly in Haskell. Those same idioms would be utterly miserable in the presence of unrestricted mutation.Or to take the author&#39;s other example, Rust forbids shared mutable state, and it keeps careful track of ownership. But I can freely use native CPU threads without worrying about anything worse than a deadlock, and I can bang directly on raw bytes without worrying about anything worse than a controlled runtime failure. And this remains true even if team communication occasionally fails or if someone makes a mistake.Sometimes I want to rule out entire classes of potentially dangerous mistakes, and not just have a &#34;private understanding&#34; that nobody will ever make certain mistakes.As always, it&#39;s a matter of using the right tool for the job. If you need to write a high-performance, heavily-threaded network server that parses malicious binary data, Rust is a great tool because of those restrictions. If you need to do highly exploratory programming and invent new idioms to talk about your problem domain, Common Lisp is awesome. And if you need to build libraries where everything has a rigid mathematical structure, Haskell is a great tool.In my experience, Commony Lisp is a deeply opinionated language, and its most dramatic opinion is that &#34;your code and your data should have identical representations and structures.&#34; And for the right problem, that restriction is extremely powerful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was younger I used to write a lot of Common Lisp. A lot. And I also had this idea that Haskell/OCaml/Scheme were strict, ivory tower totalitarian languages, while Common Lisp was this incredibly powerful, expressive, liberating tool. For building organisms, not pyramids, like Sussman said. And the S-expressions were aesthetically appealing to me. But at the time I was working mostly on smaller commercial projects and solo open source projects.Maybe it&#39;s cognitive decline from no longer being a teenager, or the experience of working on larger, O(100,000) line codebases with large teams, but nowadays I find a high degree of dynamism just exhausting. I don&#39;t want more expressive power, I want fewer nightmares.A common problem I faced with Common Lisp is I&#39;d write some module, then go on to write another module that depended upon the previous one, and get an exception through from the first module. Usually a type error. And I&#39;d have to go back, context-switch, fix that, and climb back up to the other level.With ML/OCaml/Haskell that is far less common. Being able to look at a module and say, &#34;this is done and it&#39;s correct&#34;, is a very powerful thing. Confidence, rather than safety, is the primary benefit of static typing for me.And I find that I no longer use the REPL. I&#39;ve been working on a compiler in OCaml and for some reason Dune won&#39;t run utop (lol) so I&#39;ve just not been REPL&#39;ing and it&#39;s not been a problem. The code typechecks. Things work on the first run. If I change something, I get notified what needs updating.The problem with interactive development is that it&#39;s like unit testing: it can prove the presence of bugs but not their absence. Type systems can eliminate large classes of bugs ahead of time.Just so this is not entirely negative or depressing: there&#39;s something beautiful about how maximalist Common Lisp is. It&#39;s a big, messy language with every programming paradigm (and you can invent new ones) and different naming conventions in the core language itself. I was learning new things about Common Lisp years into using it productively. And I compared the experience to moving to a huge stately home, that has a room for the piano, a vast attic, a wine cellar, all manner of things, and then trying to move back to a shoebox apartment. Where do I fit the piano? CLOS, the MOP, the Lovecraftian beauty of LOOP and FORMAT: it&#39;s like a wild garden next to the (comparative) spartan minimalism of practically everything else. And it&#39;s beautiful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; These &#34;big idea languages&#34; tend to assert a kind of &#34;programming ideology&#34; over reality, and tend to, in my opinion, distance you from the thing you are trying to do, often, they claim, &#34;for your own good&#34; ... &#34;You want to give HOW many objects a mutable reference to this value?&#34; complains the Rust compiler. &#34;Are you insane? You are a Rustacean, you don&#39;t do that kind of thing!&#34;I agree with the spirit of this line of thought: in general I favor pragmatism over zealotry, and I think it should be up to the programmer to determine how a tool should be used, not the tool itself.However when we talk about something like the safety constraints imposed by Rust, it&#39;s more about citizenship than it is about the compiler being overly opinionated.  By baking those constraints into the language, I can have confidence when I use third party code that it reaches at least some standard in terms of memory safety and thread safety.  Much in the same way as a strict type system, those constraints free me up to not have to think about certain types of issues.If I am writing code which only I will consume, I&#39;m also free to use escape hatches to sidestep these constraints when I know they&#39;re not relevant.I&#39;ve written tens of thousands of lines of Rust by now, and I&#39;m still not convinced the Rust model is the right one in terms of achieving its goals, but I think the approach is &#34;reality based&#34; with respect to avoiding some of the problems which can occur while developing software in collaboration with others."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Microsoft used to release a &#34;checked&#34; build for each version of Windows on MSDN/Visual Studio Subscription downloads. [1] This was a build with the same compiler optimization settings as the release build, but with debug-build-only assertions and checks included. In the checked build kernel, the system uptime had 49 days artificially added to it [2], precisely to help developers find out problems like this.At one point when I was on the Windows team at Microsoft, there was an internal push for us to selfhost (dogfood) checked builds of Windows, since they theoretically provided better bug telemetry than &#34;free&#34; builds (release builds, which are free of debug-only code). &#34;Slows your dev box down by just half!&#34; was the basic pitch of that campaign in a nutshell.[1] I don&#39;t know if this was ever done for Windows 95. It was done for Windows XP up to Windows 10 version 1511, but it appears to have stopped since then, at least according to my quick search.[2] https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/sysinfoapi/nf-s..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ve been watching this project for a long time and personally am very excited. The fact that it’s #1 on HN today (congrats!) makes me think I’m not the only one.There are also a lot of valid concerns in these comments about privacy and use of algorithms. A lot of it depends on what you’re looking to gain by adopting a new service/switching away from something else and individual concern.Personally, I’m looking for a place to store personal photos: friends, family, travel etc. Critical needs
- easy sharing ideally not locked into Apple’s ecosystem
- not to have my photos mined for advertising and social graph data (most important)
- ideally around for the long haul but in my mind this is for sharing, not backupI’m not particularly concerned about warrants, government surveillance etc. Again for me this is about sharing so the expectation of true privacy is low. Any photos I considered sensitive I would store elsewhere.For me, the biggest point of confidence I have in this project is that they charge money from day 1 and don’t have a forever free plan. I’m excited about projects that offer the benefits of “social” but where the software, not my data, is the product."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The monthly storage costs are too high. For the price of 1TB from you (15€), I can buy more than 2 TB just about anywhere else.Commercially, Apple and Google are both 2TB for 10 CHF and Amazon gives you unlimited as part of a Prime membership. Storage providers like Backblaze and Wasabi both charge around $5/TB and that&#39;s really the table-stakes price. For the more DIY-inclined, Hetzner sells a 2TB OwnCloud instance for 9.90€/month.I&#39;d prefer to buy software from you than storage. It&#39;s out of the question for me to pay you per TB but I&#39;d consider paying a flat rate for software I then host myself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’d love for something like this to exist (a fast, clean, well-designed mobile and desktop app for backing up my photos with E2E), but I’d only switch from one of the big providers if it were FOSS and I can bring my own backend target (e.g. S3, SMB, FTP).In a perfect scenario I could generate my own private key to plug into my client devices and just have everything push to private S3 (and then from there  archive to the cheapest, coldest glacier tier after it’s been synced to my home storage).This to me would not be that complicated to build, but would essentially provide E2E Photostream and a backup of last resort in the cloud.Obviously (as is the problem with all FOSS) you have the dilemma of how do the developers get paid, which I’m sure is why you went down this yet-another-paid-cloud-provider route instead of what I’ve suggested above.All that said - I like what you’re trying to build, I could see it being useful to some, but providing E2E photo storage as a direct-to-consumer service is IMHO just asking to be held liable later for what your users store there should you gain any considerable traction."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Was listening to Ben Evan&#39;s podcast earlier today and he had a stat from the Apple / Epic trial that shook me a bit - in a given month in 2016 something like 0.05% of Apple users were spending in excess of 450 USD on in-app purchases.  And that was 54% of App store revenue.This is basically addicts gambling.  Its the sort of numbers you see at Casinos and online casinos, and ... i dunno. It saddens me.  Yes the vast vast majority of players have a &#34;bit of fun&#34;, most never pay for anything, but all the profit comes from the addicts.Even in IOS App Store.  Which really did look like it was trying to avoid that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Happy to chat about it, HN, since otherwise I&#39;d just be playing more Genshin Impact.My capsule review of the game nobody asked for: if you like Breath of the Wild, you&#39;ll likely enjoy it a lot. It is not as pure of an exploration game at BotW is, and the emergent game mechanics that made BotW such a joy, a toy which produced its own unique stories with every player, are mostly absent. The exploration doesn&#39;t tie in closely with the plot like it does in BotW.But, other than that, it&#39;s an extremely, extremely effective game. Excellent art and music design; the graphics compare favorably to anything I&#39;ve ever seen in an AAA game if you like this anime-inspired visual style.I find the combat similar to single-player WoW with more interesting strategic choices (regarding party comp, etc) and less interesting tactical choices. Harder encounters are fun puzzles to solve.While the actual story in the game is nothing we haven&#39;t seen done better before, the character interactions are an extremely interesting Chinese take on Chinese/Japanese/Western fantasy tropes. Someone could get an East Asian Studies thesis out of it fairly easily. It&#39;s amusing to &#34;read&#34; with that cultural commentary lens on; the localization is also surprisingly well done (including both English and Japanese, to the extent you credit me with being able to perceive that).The metagame about how to progress as quickly as possible, and where to invest your resources / how to harvest them efficiently, also pushes my buttons very effectively."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Gacha games are named after the onomatopoeia describing vending machines in Japanese malls and arcades which dispense toys and trinkets for, typically, 100 to 200 yen (about $1-$2). The pool of trinkets is displayed prominently on the machine; which trinket you get is effectively randomized. If you had your heart set on a particular one, you might spend much more than $1 on getting it, and some children (and adults!) very much do. Many very successful games have a monetization strategy which descends from a variant of this.I am sorry to say this as someone who usually agrees with &#39;patio11 on everything, but both gacha and the &#34;monetization strategies&#34; inspired by it (be they hawking in-game currency or trying to mine email addresses) sound like a terrible idea.I don&#39;t want gacha, or any of these monetization strategies in my ideal consumption model. I want to look at a toy in the store and buy it while knowing what I am getting. This gacha model sounds like it&#39;s incentivizing gambling from a very young age.Am I too close-minded? Idealistic? Missing some crucial part of the article? I&#39;d like to hear, because nothing seems good about this at the moment."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi, author here.  I&#39;m a little hesitant to wade into these comments, but I&#39;ll try to answer a few questions I see popping up, and some that I just made up.1. Why do I have to compile the thing myself?Because packaging on linux is a nightmare.  For a long time, Linus Torvalds did not offer linux binaries for his &#34;subsurface&#34; diving program, but did offer them for Windows and Mac.  Now there are linux subsurface packages, but Linus doesn&#39;t do them himself.  If Linus can&#39;t be bothered to make linux binaries, you know the situation is messed up. I figure, if the game is good enough, then someone (besides me) will make packages.  If that doesn&#39;t happen, well, I guess the game isn&#39;t good enough.  And I&#39;m ok with that.2. Why don&#39;t the devs do this or that?&#34;The devs&#34; is mostly just me. I do what I feel like, this is my hobby project that I do for fun.3. How does this compare to Artemis/Empty Epsilon etc.?It&#39;s more properly 3D than Artemis or Empty Epsilon.  It has a much nicer Lua API for making mission scripts than Artemis&#39;s XML based system.  It doesn&#39;t have as many mission scripts as Artemis or EE. It feels a little more &#34;millenium falcon&#34; than &#34;Enterprise&#34;, mainly due to the turret gun, I suppose.  I think the planets, especially the gas giants[1] in SNIS look cooler than anything in Artemis or EE.4. Why does the game design suck?It&#39;s hard to make a cooperative bridge simulator that&#39;s fun at every station all the time. Back in 2012, I heard about Artemis, and thought it was a cool idea, and it seemed like a neat project, so I started working on my own interpretation of the genre. It&#39;s hard to know how things will turn out without just trying it.  It came out the way it came out (so far).  A lot of the fun in this type of game has to come from the participants. With the right participants with the right attitude, it can be pretty fun. Some parties are fun, some are dull. Alcohol sometimes helps.5. Why doesn&#39;t it run on Windows or Mac?It used to run on Macs, but then support for OpenGL on Macs became problematic.  Maybe someone could get it to run on Macs again, but not me.  It will run on Windows using the Windows subsystem for linux, however, the graphics will be software emulated, which is generally not good enough.  Trying to compile natively on Windows would be a big job.  It uses pthreads extensively, and some other various linux-isms here and there.  Windows and Mac were not a priority for me because I don&#39;t have either of those machines, and I was mainly interested in playing the thing with my friends. Besides, Windows and Mac already have enough games.6. Can you run the game remotely, or does it have to be on a LAN?Maybe. I&#39;ve never seriously tried to run it remotely.  I have tried it once or twice, with the server running on a digital ocean server in New York, with my clients running in Virginia, and it worked better than I expected it to.  It does have a voice chat feature built in (added after COVID appeared), and that seemed to work.  But my test was limited to about 5 minutes of messing around, and only a couple of clients.  Each client will require about 100k/s of bandwidth.  This can be greatly reduced by reducing the number of objects (asteroids and NPC ships) floating around in the simulation, but I haven&#39;t really experimented much with running this thing other than on a LAN.7. Will it work on a Raspberry Pi 4?Yes and no.  Some stations will work. SCIENCE, COMMS, and ENGINEERING seem to work alright.  More graphics intense stations don&#39;t work so well (MAIN SCREEN, NAVIGATION, WEAPONS, GAMEMASTER).[1] https://github.com/smcameron/gaseous-giganticus"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is actually better for most consumers. The SLC cache was increased nearly three fold and the controller is a superior one (it now uses the same one as the 980 PRO). TechPowerUp[0] has a much better post on this, and you can clearly see there that the new one is better in most cases than the old one.The only ones disadvantaged by this change are people who constantly write &gt;42GB which I would think are video editors. (The old version would get a speed reduction to 1500MB/s after overflowing the SLC cache (42GB), the new one goes down to 800MB/s after overflowing (115GB))P.S.: Not defending this, just clarifying because most posters here seem to believe it&#39;s a straight up downgrade. Should also be worth noting that Samsung changed the product box, product number, firmware version and the spec sheet for this change. So they&#39;re significantly better than the others who have done similar moves. That said, I still believe that they should have called this the 971 Evo+ or something, as it&#39;s genuinely different.[0]: https://www.techpowerup.com/286008/et-tu-samsung-samsung-too..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to work in their SSD vertical on the software side. For what it&#39;s worth, SSD/memory business unit is their pride. They never used to cut corners and do rigorous testing to ensure their customers aren&#39;t screwed over. Even when a bad batch of SSDs were shipped by mistake, they would recall/refund all of them proactively. When ever a new model is released, they would first ship limited units to a set of SSD enthusiasts including gamers in Korea. One such time, there was a BSOD reported by a single tester in some edge case - &gt; they sent a lot of team members in person to chase and fix that issue.So I really doubt they would do anything stupid to get some quick bucks at the cost of reputation.On the other hand, their smart tv division is absolute garbage and employees themselves wouldn&#39;t buy Samsung TVs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The reporting is this case is a little dramatized IMHO. As you can read here [0] they actually use the controller from the 980 Pro and more dense NAND, Billy Tallis from Anandtech filled in some missing technical detail. You actually gain performance in the random 4K case, which is important in day to day operations but you loose sequential write speed if you exceed the SLC-Cache of 115GB.This differs quite significantly from WD silently changing the Blue drive from TLC (okay with Cache) to QLC which nets you write speeds lower than HDDs after the cache is full. Crucial did TLC-&gt;QLC on the P2 too, but you could get those drives for 30% less up until a week ago.(edit) forgot to mention ADATA who switched the controller of their SX8200 Pro [1][0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28320640

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very few things surprised me as much as rail design when I was studying structural engineering. Surface tension and fluid dynamics were both trippy too, but I expected those things to be complicated and while surface tension blew my mind due to the relative simplicity of the proof, and fluid dynamics blew my mind because it was somehow 100x more complex than I estimated.Walking into rail design was hilarious. I worked on motorcycles and did some car stuff. I figured it was obvious, and sorta dismissed this assignment as a joke. Nope. My dismissive intuitions were just flat out wrong. It kinda leaves an impression on you to sorta avoid saying you know for sure before putting in some amount of work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another way to think of how this works is to look at crowned pulleys:https://woodgears.ca/bandsaw/crowned_pulleys.htmlIn the train&#39;s case (if we ignore the gap between the wheels), the pair of wheels work like a crowned pulley, and the track finds center like a belt."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Motorcycles turn at speed by a similar principle, though the cones arrangement is a bit flipped around.I usually demonstrate it with two solo cups put mouth-to-mouth, to make a pair of facing cones that represents the motorcycle tire.  The starting condition is that you&#39;re above parking lot speeds, and the bike is stable and is dynamically inclined to stay perfectly upright.  To go left, you turn the bars right to upset the stable bike onto the left cone, and it goes left.  To go right you turn the bars left and it upsets the bike onto the right cone, and goes right."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A better headline - users willing to give up privacy for convenience.Reality - there was a period where the icloud backups created backups that apple did not have access to. Critically, this mean that if you had any of a wide variety of things happen - unless you were very good about key management - your content was lost for good. ALL your photos (which could be heartbreaking) etc.It turns out this is NOT what people want. They want apple to have access to their content, so when they have a device stolen and don&#39;t have a super long recovery key properly saved, they are not hosed.Same issue BTW with bitlocker on windows. People DO NOT save those recovery keys, even if they should. Microsoft added a way to force a backup into an account admins and others would have access to, thank goodness, because otherwise users there would be hosed as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m continually surprised that people can&#39;t seem to understand E2EE. For whatever reason they assume it means a message is encrypted forever and unreadable by anyone.There is zero guarantee from any E2EE system that the data is encrypted at rest by the sender and receiver. In fact in most cases, the data is not encrypted at rest because people want to do silly things like read messages.The exact same vulnerability exists  on every platform that&#39;s automatically backing up local data to the cloud. Even if you disable cloud backups you&#39;re still stuck if whoever you&#39;re messaging has left them enabled.The only meaningful way around this hole when it comes to messaging apps is row-level encryption on the backing store. This has a lot of problems of its own and potential holes when it comes to indexing and searching."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to work with tungsten carbide cubes during my PhD thesis. They&#39;re used in multianvil high-pressure synthesis. With the right setup you can reach almost 20 GPa of pressure. Not as much as with diamond anvil cells, but you have more reasonable sample sizes (a few milligrams). And thats still like the pressure pretty deep into Earth&#39;s mantle.I also used the opportunity to snap a neat picture of a polished WC cube: https://imgur.com/C2YiMqb.jpgI always had fun handing them over to students because everyone is surprised by the sheer weight of these things.Tungsten carbide is actually quite dangerous after it has been subjected to a lot of stress (Such as being stuck into a 1000 t press for a high-pressure synthesis). They have the mean tendecy to explode into super sharp pieces when you&#39;re not expecting it, so wear goggles."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">" &gt; I struggled a lot with deciding to buy a cube. It felt wrong to spend so much money on a featureless hunk of metal.When I bought my cube, I used it as an exercise to fight back against my frugality.But it wasn&#39;t meant to be: it was delivered to the wrong address and I received a full refund.Then my neighbor delivered it to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got one as well, around the same time actually, as a gift. I also fell into a strange fascination with it and find it fun to hold in the exact same ways as the author. Folks tend to get me 1&#34; element (or sometimes non elemental but interesting in another way) cubes as gifts now which works out as it gives a great range of price to choose from while maintaining surprise with the guarantee I&#39;ll enjoy it.I&#39;ve had my sites set on something this size https://midwesttungsten.com/tungsten-cube/ for a while now. (about as much as I would feel safe setting down or handing to people considering the hard edges and chance of accidents) I&#39;ve more than had the spending money to do it for a long time but much like the author I&#39;ve just had a hard time justifying it. I suppose it&#39;s still less ridiculously than what many spend on car hobbies or whatnot. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll eventually get something of the nature.I&#39;ll also add I was extremely surprised others enjoyed it as well. Of all of my desk toys/models/prints it&#39;s generated the most talk amongst friends and coworkers.I&#39;d like to experience a sizeable amount of iridium some day  as well.Edit: One of the most fun gifts I&#39;ve received (beyond the tungsten cube) was a 1&#34; magnesium cube. Apart from being a ridiculous fire/blinding risk capable of easily melting through the tungsten cube if set off it is even lighter than  an equivalently sized aluminum cube."</p>

For example, when Mr Boudin ran on his platform of less punitive justice, San Francisco already had one of the lowest incarceration rates in the country. In 2019, 106 adults were in prison for every 100,000 people, one-fifth the rate in California and the nation. If the rest of the country behaved like San Francisco, the prison population would decline by 80%, says James Austin of the jfa Institute, a think-tank that evaluates criminal-justice policies.This seems like a very reasonable hypothesis"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interestin things about Ada:- language designer have a document where they explain their choices, the Ada Rationale:
http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/rationale12.html- there is an annotated version of the standard, and it&#39;s freely available as the standard:
http://www.ada-auth.org/arm.html- A language test suite was developped at the same time of the language:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Conformity_Assessment_Test...The last point was also in retrospect not sot good for the language ecosystem: buyers wanted a 100% on this test suite before considering your Ada compiler, which means dev had hundreds of compiler bugs to fix and no paying customers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked with Ada a lot during the 90s (and even maintained the Linux port of GNAT early on). This document does not address one thing that I am curious about. What does the modern, idiomatic Ada programmer do about memory management? Are library implementers still required to use Unchecked_Deallocation? I don&#39;t see how a language where Unchecked_Deallocation is used can be considered safe at a time when we have modern choices with automatic memory management.Edit: I guess another way to put this is, &#34;Can a non-trivial project be developed in modern Ada without using Unchecked_Dealloation?&#34; Because I don&#39;t see how I can consider a library safe if it is allowed to call Unchecked_Deallocation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I went to a college that taught CS in ADA, and I never took CS because I tested out of 101, but I ended up fixing attempts at the problem sets for about half my dorm section (this was okay as long as and they documented it).Well anyway, I found it to be very easy to pick up just by reading, hard to make semantic errors, and easy to modify without breaking things. The pace of learning for the entire cohort, mostly non-CS students, was, I think, much faster than e.g. C++ and possibly more complete than e.g. Python. It’s pedantic and exact, but it uses real english language keywords and modifiers.I went to a different school later where I did the same thing but it was taught in C++. It seemed like many students would get by purely by repeating patterns that they didn’t understand. And I started to catch myself in that trap as well, realizing that I had a lot to learn.But I wasn’t going to be a programmer; I was going to be a theoretical physicist cogitating on the deep mysteries of the universe. Fast forward…. D’ohhhh."</p>
