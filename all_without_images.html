					<h3><a href="https://boilingsteam.com/7000-windows-games-working-on-linux-with-proton/">Valve&#39;s Proton Has Enabled 7000 Windows Games on Linux</a></h3>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I LOVE Proton. About 85% of my Windows games just... work. And probably 75% of the 15% that fail initially only require a little tweaking to make work.My only complaints are that steam uses arbitrary numbers instead of human readable labels for emulated AppData folders. It can be time consuming to locate a save game file. Also Streaming cross platform isn&#39;t a pleasant experience yet but it&#39;s getting better and I really appreciate the feature. My final gripe is that when adding media to a Steam chat on Linux the file open dialog does not cache the last folder you visited and doesn&#39;t support multiple files. This compounds the first problem I listed making it EXTREMELY time consuming to share multiple game files with friends quickly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Proton is the reason I moved from a Windows + MacOS machine to GNU/Linux full time. I understand the concern that some hardcore enthusiasts might have about it making devs lazy when it comes to developing native ports but to be honest I don&#39;t care. I am just glad to have a simple method of gaming on GNU/Linux. Proton plus Lutris and the slew other tools that have come out in recent years has made the transition to GNU/Linux very easy and has opened the door for many who were curious but scared of the learning curb."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My problem with Proton is that they are not strict enough with their ratings. I see a game has &#34;platinum&#34; or &#34;gold&#34; support and think &#34;great, this will work well!&#34; but then I discover it crashes after alt-tab and multiplayer doesn&#39;t work at all, which I consider critical bugs.To me, the levels should be:* Paltinum - the game works as well as it does on officially supported platforms* Gold - the game works almost as well as on supported platforms but with minor niggles that don&#39;t significantly affect the experience* Bronze - the game works in some form, but major things might be broken. It would not ship in this state on official platforms.However, the project is a great start and I look forward to what they do next!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have deep aversion to &#34;Open source projects should run office hours&#34; title.Maybe &#34;Office hours may be a good idea for open source projects&#34;? This would not suggest obligation.In general, fact that someone created or maintains or supports open source projects should not be considered to create any obligations beyond lack of malice and abuse.I am not obligated to support any bugs, create any features and it is perfectly fine to delete all my repos at any time (unless I declared otherwise).I am also not obligated to support anything, help with anything, there is no guarantee of uptime, office hours, resolving issues or anything else.If you want obligations, guarantees or anything like that - feel free to hire a given developer.Many such things are good ideas and some people may decide to promise them (if you describe something as secure then you declared to handle security issues timely). But I reject idea of being obligated to do any of above."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think a lot of the comments are concluding from the title that open source maintainers should be working on the projects during office hours.That is not what the article is suggesting.From the article -&gt;&gt;  anyone can book a 25 minute conversation with me on a Friday to talk about the project. I’m interested in talking to people who are using Datasette, or who are considering using it, or who just want to have a chat.&gt;&gt;A challenge of open source is that it’s easy to be starved of feedback. People might file bug reports if something breaks, but other than that it can feel like publishing software into a void.&gt;&gt; Hearing directly from people who are using your stuff is incredibly motivational. It’s also an amazing source of ideas and feedback on where the project should go next.I think that&#39;s really a fantastic suggestion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve had massive success with this in ML. My twitter DMs have become almost-daily office hour sessions with people trying to solve hard ML problems. The last fellow was so happy he venmo&#39;d me $250 after I merely asked for &#34;pay whatever you thought that was worth.&#34;Apparently putting &#34;DMs open&#34; in your twitter bio is an excellent way to meet new people. Also, tweet (often!) about what you&#39;re working on. Post lots of questions, notes to self, and screenshots or videos.To get followers, you&#39;ll need to go inject yourself into conversations. That seems to be the most reliable way to get noticed.We also run an ML discord server and do informal office hours for people working on various ML products. It may sound cheesy, but I try to emulate what pg would do in a YC office hours session. It seems to keep them pretty focused.So, yes! Glad to see office hours are becoming mainstream. Try it out; you&#39;ll probably be surprised."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The competitive advantages of owning both the application and the data are so high that don&#39;t see widespread BYOC ever happening without government intervention.I&#39;d like to see an enforced separation in law between commercial application providers and storage providers. So, if someone writes an app like Google Docs, they can&#39;t just store the data opaquely on their own cloud servers. They legally have to integrate with a separate storage provider. And that storage provider has an obligation to make my data accessible and manageable by me.This wouldn&#39;t be a panacea, but it at least makes it theoretically possible to write a replacement client for Google Docs that could be a drop-in replacement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This idea suffers from the same problem federation does. It&#39;s harder to move a whole ecosystem. Makes it harder to innovate. Leads to centralized platforms outperforming these BYOC/federated/open options.

They were already gifted many billions of dollars in the past for this same basic purpose but they pocketed the money.  They can just use the free money they&#39;ve already been given.  Instead, the funding should go to existing munipical fiber ISPs to expand their coverage.

[...] the FCC defines [...] Alternatively, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) defines&#34; why is this the federal government&#39;s job again? the internet is clearly not an enumerated power. is this the interstate commerce clause that keeps on giving in action again? i think decentralizing federal power would help alleviate a lot of the existential dread vis a vi corruption that many americans are feeling.all in all, this reeks of regulatory capture to me. if we&#39;re gonna have a serious discussion about internet infrastructure, i think the starting point is how we classify ISPs and where in the city-state-federal hierarchy the responsibility lies. changing a 25 to a 100 is a cool bullet on a resume, but i dont think this is the low handing fruit here.[0]https://help.netflix.com/en/node/306"</p>

					<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26345235">Ask HN: Do you think Agile/Scrum is beneficial for software delivery?</a></h3>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26345235">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just don&#39;t get it why developers like Scrum.
The whole thing was designed to give non-technical people more power over the ones who spent a lifetime honing their craftmanship. Standing around a table in the morning like assholes is not my idea of fun. Same for the &#34;product owner&#34; concept. If I develop something, I am the owner. I generally hate being micromanaged and being assigned microtasks that gives &#34;them&#34; total control over my workday while I have no idea what &#34;they&#34; are doing the whole day. 
Scrum was the reason why I left my last company and I&#39;m much happier now in my new company, where we do not have any process at all, just a common goal. Instead of standups, the team gathers for a coffee in the morning. If I want to spend 3 days learning a new framework that might do the product good, nobody cares. The only thing that counts is the endresult. That means we are beating the product into submission until its good, even if it means rewriting the thing three times and missing deadlines.
So no more Scrum for me. Never."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think you need to separate Agile from Scrum to be honest.Agile is at is core just some suggestions for teams to work well together. There are no stand ups or sprints or whatever.Scrum was created by one of the creators of the agile manifesto as a way to see consulting/training around the &#39;Agile&#39; idea (timeframes may differ a bit, but they were linked). There is an interview/article by one of the creators of the agile manifesto (Kent Beck maybe?, will try to dig it up and edit the answer if I find -&gt; was Robert C. Martin, see below) where he explains a bit the story and compares it to Agile (and basically says scrum has nothing to do with the original agile manifesto)On a personal level, I hate scrum. The stand ups, the sprints, the retros or grooming or whatever they have nowadays. It is literally one of the first questions I ask in an interview about their processes and excuse myself from the process if I see if they follow it. It may work for others, but for me personally, I hate it with a fervour.Though I agree with the Agile manifesto though, unfortunately it isn&#39;t very &#39;manager&#39; friendly so you usually get scrum instead.Edit: link to a reference to the article, can&#39;t find the original but found this: https://www.aaron-gray.com/a-criticism-of-scrum/#scrum-strai..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What’s so funny to me is what you’re describing is the nightmare that’s become scrum as opposed to actual agility. Agile is about ditching managers, bureaucracy, and estimates in favor of empowering the team itself.Agility is just what it says: a philosophy of flexibility and adaptiveness.Heirarchies, heavy processes, etc are by definition inflexible. They are not agile. You do not do agile. You are agile. You are agile because your company has a culture that is agile and you cannot achieve that unless the company is structured to be flexible.I think actual agility is really, really a great way to build software efficiently... but unfortunately most programmers will only experience the cargo cult forced upon them by certified scrum masters... and this is just as bad, perhaps worse, than old fashioned waterfall.More than anything, working in an agile environment is a very pleasant thing to do from a human standpoint. But most companies are incapable of the kind of equality and empowerment necessary to achieve agility, so they will force the terrible cargo cult version upon us."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As someone who&#39;s just written about the &#34;small web&#34; [1], this warms my heart. The lite version is probably a little too bare-bones for most people&#39;s tastes, but it sure is tiny -- great for people on very slow or flakey connections. Some numbers:HTML homepage transfers 34KB (94KB uncompressed) over 6 requests. HTML search results page transfers 133KB (248KB uncompressed) over 31 requests.Lite homepage transfers 13KB (11KB uncompressed, ha) over 4 requests. Lite search results page transfers 21KB (43KB uncompressed) over 5 requests.In all cases, all requests are to *.duckduckgo.com, which was very good to see from a privacy perspective. Nice work, DDG![1] https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Up until not long ago, Google search result pages worked well without JS, and if you sent a suitably old UA header, you&#39;d get the &#34;original&#34; version without mangled URLs or any of the other bloat. Then in 2019 or so, in what I consider to be an extremely hostile move, they started redirecting (using meta tags) to a horrible dumbed-down mobile-ish version and using styles-removed-by-JS to &#34;hide&#34; the actual content of the &#34;full&#34; version (which has the &#34;modern&#34; mangled URLs) if you managed to reach it anyway, so all you&#39;d see was a blank page. It&#39;s almost like they were deliberately trying to make something that only worked in the latest version of Chrome or whatever few other &#34;modern&#34; browsers exist today, and decided to force non-JS users to a worse experience than they had had for the past decade or more. Nothing a filtering proxy can&#39;t fix (and I brought back true URLs at the same time), but I was absolutely incensed when that happened.I don&#39;t think a search engine should ever require JS to be usable. The existence of search engines[1] predates the existence of JS, and of course the HTML mechanism of form submission and displaying a list of links predates both of those.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JumpStation"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some problems that Fukushima had: 1950s vintage design, active cooling system, backup power at sea level in a seismically active area.  This kind of failure was not just predictable, it was predicted.People travel to Japan from around the world to learn how to build earthquake resistant structures.  Their nuclear engineers are top-notch.  It was the bureaucracy that failed, not the talent.In short, the problems were human not technical.  People get complacent and greedy.  They use every procedural tool they have to delay upgrades, maintenance, and improvement.  I think that is at the core of most nuclear skepticism.  Does anyone honestly think the United States has institutions sound enough to safely manage nuclear power over multiple decades?  Or will they neglect basic maintenance and upgrades?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The key thing to remember is that power sources like coal and other fossil fuels have a very real health cost. A large number of people die every year. However a nuclear accident is much more &#34;exciting&#34; news and sticks in people&#39;s mind. People dying of cancer, asthma and other conditions are not as direct or as dramatic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The real trouble with the light water reactor is not the nuclear part but the steam turbine it is attached to.Unfortunately people have a way of driving while looking in the rear view mirror and much of the discussion around nuclear energy revolves around issues of the 1970s.In the 1970s coal burning power plants were the cost king of power plants.  There was some concern about making them cleaner,  but by the 1980s gas turbine power plants with 10 times the power density (e.g. 1/10 the capital cost)  were becoming widespread and people quit building coal plants.(A big literature got left behind about how to drive a gas turbine from coal,  on paper it would be lower capital cost than a conventional coal plant,  but the technology never got developed at full scale.)Even if the heat was free it would be hard for a steam turbine based power plant to compete with gas turbines.Now it should be possible to build a nuclear power plant based on the brayton cycle using helium or carbon dioxide or some similar gas as a working fluid.  You then need to use helium or sodium or lead as a coolant because the pressure would be too high with water.Fast reactors are the best developed option,  followed by the prismatic HTGR,  then the thorium reactors.  Pebble-bed HTGR looked pretty good until an expose came out that a German pebble bed reactor had a difficult time...  Turns out pebbles that slide past each other just fine in air will get stuck on each other and crack in helium.When Bill Gates and others go around saying we have to get over the safety issue they are continuing the stigma.  Nuclear power is not going to get out of it&#39;s funk unless it has a cost story that looks good when everything goes right -- which is not the case with the LWR."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;d add to this list:Chunk extensions. Most people know HTTP/1.1 can return a &#34;chunked&#34; response body: it breaks the body up into chunks, so that we can send a response whose length we don&#39;t know in advance, but also it allows us to keep the connection open after we&#39;re done. What most people don&#39;t know is that chunks can carry key-value metadata. The spec technically requires an implementation to at least parse them, though I think it is permitted to ignore them. I&#39;ve never seen anything ever use this, and I hope that never changes. They&#39;re gone in HTTP/2. (So, also, if you thought HTTP/2 was backwards compatible: not technically!)The &#34;Authorization&#34; header: like &#34;Referer&#34;, this header is misspelled. (It should be spelled, &#34;Authentication&#34;.) Same applies to &#34;401 Unauthorized&#34;, which really ought to be &#34;401 Unauthenticated&#34;.

They&#39;re basically require implementing a custom string type to handle correctly; they&#39;re a baroque mix of characters &amp; &#34;opaque octets&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been searching for a while for a good way to know whether a client has disconnected in the middle of a long-running HTTP request. (We do heavyweight SQL queries of indeterminate length in response to those requests, and we&#39;d like to be able to cancel them, rather than wasting DB-server CPU cycles calculating reports nobody&#39;s going to consume.)You can&#39;t actually know whether the outgoing side of a TCP socket is closed, unless you write something to it. But it&#39;s hard to come up with something to write to an HTTP/1.1-over-TCP socket before you respond with anything, that would be a valid NOP according to all the protocol layers in play. (TCP keepalives would be perfect for this... if routers didn&#39;t silently drop them.)But I guess sending an HTTP 102 every second or two could be used for exactly this: prodding the socket with something that middleboxes will be sure to pass back to the client.If so, that&#39;s awesome! ...and also something I wish could be handled for me automatically by web frameworks, because getting that working sounds kind of ridiculous :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another thing to note about custom headers is that when used in an XHR (eg: X-Requested-With), they will force a preflight request (with the OPTIONS method). If your webserver isn&#39;t configured to handle OPTIONS and return the correct CORS headers, that will effectively break clients.Best to just never use custom headers.I&#39;ve written more about this here: https://developer.akamai.com/blog/2015/08/17/solving-options..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"To respond to some of the comments.It is not that there is anything intrinsically wrong with these functions. You can technically use all of them and I have been using all of them, safely, for decades.The issue is they are huge traps to the point that in a larger piece of software one can say &#34;well, it&#39;s just not worth it&#34;.You can go much, much, much further than that.In couple embedded projects I worked some of the rules were:* dynamic allocation after application has started is banned -- any heap buffers and data structures must be allocated at the start of the application and after that any allocation is a compile time error,* any constructs that would prevent statically calculating stack usage were banned (for example any form of recursion except when exact recursion depth is ensured statically),* any locks were banned,* absolutely every data structure must have size ensured, in a simple way, beyond any reasonable doubt,etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here&#39;s an anecdote about what happens when you design a product in the opposite way.I own https://www.executeprogram.com, which has interactive in-browser courses on various software development technologies. Currently they all cover languages, more or less: TypeScript, SQL, various JS topics, regexes. (Disclosure: it costs money after you finish your 16th lesson.)Almost all (maybe literally all) of our competitors are amenable to binging. It&#39;s true of books, video learning platforms, and most/all other interactive learning platforms.Execute Program is very intentionally non-bingeable. When you start a course, you get 5 lessons on the first day, then it stops you and tells you to come back tomorrow. On the next day, you get some brief reviews of yesterday&#39;s lessons, then a few new lessons, then it stops you again until the next day. That cadence repeats until you finish the course. You can&#39;t binge/cram even if you want to.(A bit more technical detail: it&#39;s a spaced repetition system with exponential review intervals, similar to those used for language learning in e.g. WaniKani and Anki. But it also has a lot of fine-grained knowledge of its own course structure, so it can use reviews to intelligently unlock different lessons depending on how the user performed on their reviews.)Occasionally, we get support email from new users who don&#39;t like this. They want to cram a whole course in a day. But cramming is a very time-inefficient way to learn, so this is self-defeating! Since launch, we&#39;ve had good success adjusting the app&#39;s behavior and internal explanations to reduce these complaints.However, we still get emails from long-term users who appreciate the time limitations. Generally these fall into two categories:1. Users like that an enforced break before the reviews provides tangible evidence that &#34;yes, I genuinely understood yesterday&#39;s lessons&#34;. If we allowed cramming, that reassurance wouldn&#39;t exist; it&#39;s too easy to succeed at a review when you just finished the lesson 30 seconds ago.2. Users like that the usage limits remove a source of anxiety and worry. You do your reviews and lessons, you finish, and then you wait until tomorrow. There&#39;s no temptation to think &#34;I really should&#39;ve done 10 lessons today instead of 5; I&#39;m so lazy&#34;.It&#39;s still possible for a very dedicated user to do all of our courses in parallel within their first monthly billing cycle. (Median course start-to-finish time is 8-18 days depending on the course.) So this scheme doesn&#39;t make users pay us more than they would otherwise. And they&#39;re spending the same amount of wall-clock time that they&#39;d spend if they crammed all of the lessons in one day. That makes it pure win: they memorize the topics more deeply, they worry less, and they get those benefits for no extra time expenditure. The only exception I can think of would be people who think &#34;I must get exposure to all TypeScript syntax and semantics before tomorrow morning, even if that significantly reduces my ability to remember what I learned.&#34;Obviously I&#39;m very biased here, and the goals that we&#39;re optimizing for don&#39;t even exist in most other product spaces. But I thought it would be nice to have a counterexample to &#34;engagement at all costs&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t like the current trend of social media apps burying users under push notifications, calls to action, and other engagement hooks.However, there&#39;s a second, parallel problem adding fuel to the fire: The more we talk about overindulgence in social media (or Netflix, or video games, or fast food) as an act perpetrated by evil corporations on us helpless individuals, the less sense of individual agency we give ourselves. I&#39;m not suggesting that we let social media companies off the hook, but battling this problem is going to require more than simply shaming them in Medium posts. We have to start reminding people that they are in control of their decisions, and that they can take steps to reduce their social media usage to healthy levels.I know the common refrain is &#34;Delete Facebook!&#34; but that&#39;s the equivalent of abstinence-only education. We need to start talking about how to configure Screen Time on iOS, or how to use Facebook&#39;s built-in tools to hide content you don&#39;t want to see. We also need to encourage people to take control of their feeds, muting users and topics who draw them into unproductive discussions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A tangential point about the horrifying power of euphemism: I&#39;ve done some consulting work with some large biopharmaceutical companies in the past and found myself consistently shocked at how effective euphemism was at making people comfortable talking about, and doing, very questionable things. E.g. &#34;Maximizing treatment&#34; = &#34;extend how long a patient requires our medication&#34;. This was at a senior level and these were, on the face of it, warm, caring people having a very comfortable and open conversation. I had always assumed decisions that directly disadvantaged the consumer would look different, with some sense of secrecy or at least awareness. Nope, one level of language abstraction is apparently all it takes.There are countless other examples out there. I just finished &#34;Cruel Britannia&#34; regarding the torture practices of the British over the last century. They were particularly adept at it. Euphemism is such a powerful tool for doublethink and systemic abuses of power."</p>

Not that you can figure that out easily - their website doesn&#39;t list upload speeds. Or maybe it does - the website is terrible to navigate, slow and I got 404s off their main internet landing page.Anyhow at the risk of this turning into a multi page rant about comcast I&#39;ll cut back to upload speed. I see it as upload is for creation and download is for consumption. What do the cable companies want people to be doing?If you look at the popularity of twitch/youtube/(things I&#39;m too old and unhip to know about) it is a direct threat to cable/traditional content creation. I&#39;d wager the current state of affairs holds a lot of people back from getting into content creation, especially poorer/larger families who have to share a limited connection."</p>

The current max a residential customer can purchase is 1 gig down, 25Mbs up.  The monthly non-discount rate is $180, with $110/month possible with certain promotions.

Is it big business lobbying politicians to prevent them from having to compete? In South Africa we have dozens on ISPs and as an economy we&#39;re probably not far off from one US state.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of my pet meta-theories about Hacker News is that the frustration expressed over several apparently different stories really has a single source: Hacker News likes the internet of 10-20 years ago a lot more than the average person.One place this shows up is a frequently-expressed sentiment that the internet is a less magical, less weird, and more corporate place than it was 10-20 years ago. Part of this may be because SEO has diluted the voices of individual creators. But part of it is also because way more average, everyday, tech-unsavvy people are on the internet now.Another example is the periodic highlighting of somewhat garish HTML-based websites. I like these too! My own personal website falls in this category! But as far as I know, the generic internet user likes the generic slick-graphics-and-whitespace style, and so go the websites that want to attract them.More relevant to the topic at hand, many comments in this thread argue that targeted ads are unnecessary for a functional internet, since the internet of 20 years ago seemed to work just fine without targeted ads. But, again, it&#39;s less clear to me that general internet users -- that is, mostly people who never experienced the internet of 20 years ago -- have the same preference.It&#39;s funny, because I&#39;m to a large extent on HN&#39;s side on this one. But my enthusiasm is tempered by my sneaking suspicion that the other side is a lot bigger, and my side is actually powered by more elitism and nostalgia than I thought."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This captures my feelings on the issue:&gt; That framing is based on a false premise that we have to choose between “old tracking” and “new tracking.” It’s not either-or. Instead of re-inventing the tracking wheel, we should imagine a better world without the myriad problems of targeted ads.I don&#39;t want to be tracked. I never have wanted to be tracked. I shouldn&#39;t have to aggressively opt-out of tracking; it should be a service one must opt-in to receive. And it&#39;s not something we can trust industry to correct properly. This is precisely the role that privacy-protecting legislation should be undertaking.Stop spying on us, please."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something I didn&#39;t know was a thing, that I really shouldn&#39;t be surprised about, is that website owners actually jump through some hoops to further sell out the users privacy. FB has the &#34;Conversion API&#34; where they enable website owners to basically &#34;manually&#34; track you by attaching an ID to users and sending &#34;events&#34; to FB via their API, in lieu of try to do so with a tracking pixel. Literally, it&#39;s an API to subvert people trying _NOT_ to be tracked with ad blockers and hostfiles etc. FB isn&#39;t even the only company that has an API like this, apparently, it&#39;s pretty established and developers/site owners are more than happy to narc you out if it means they can extend their advertising reach a little."</p>

Why? because, as we are seeing with all of the woke craziness, when you don&#39;t stand up for everyones ability (including views you do not like) to freely speak, the censorship will end up being turned against you.The key things with all of this, is that if enough people were to collectively have the courage to push back against this craziness it would stop...people recognizing that there is a problem is a good first step."</p>

I&#39;m not american, and and havent read that book. I watched the movie, through, and it seemed to me to be a very anti racism message.I think instead of banning, schools should work provide  context to kids and teens that read this books, of how society was when they where written, so people don&#39;t forget the past, but are able to make better decisions to the future."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can&#39;t be certain, but I suspect the real problem was that the original contract was signed without requiring the technical data rights and/or delivery of the technical data. This is a common mistake made by the DoD, and can lead to extraordinarily high costs later.Just look at the notice: &#34;The deliverables will include all technical data related to the heat exchanger disassembly, all technical data related to the cores, all technical data related to the stack up, vacuum brazing, and installation of the cores on existing units. The deliverables will also include all technical data related to the tooling needed...&#34; It&#39;s clear they don&#39;t have the technical data.Here&#39;s how this can happen: the government asks for proposals, and the prospective contractors say &#34;we&#39;ll create it for you for cheaper if you don&#39;t require the technical data &amp; its related rights&#34;. The government program manager (PM) is under a lot of pressure to &#34;get it cheaper&#34;, and this is cheaper in the short term, so the government PM agrees. The PM will be around for a few years, then leave. Later on, the contractor is the only one who can make the parts (because they&#39;re the only ones with the technical data &amp; the technical data rights to do it). The government procurement system is all about competition, but now there is no possibility for real competition. Thus, the parts will cost 10x or more, and the government PM who approved this is long gone (probably with a promotion), and the contractor is happy with incredibly large profit margins.I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s what happened in this case. But it&#39;s very very possible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reverse engineering seems like a good skillset for the DoD to nurture, anyway. Yes, the US is going to be at the cutting edge of weapons design at least through the medium term, but the leadership isn&#39;t arrogant enough to think that all engineering innovations will come domestically. If the US acquired a next-generation Chinese fighter, wouldn&#39;t it be handy if someone had the expertise to tell you exactly how its parts were made and machine replicas if needed?So, the tinfoil hat interpretation of this story would be, of course the Pentagon has the original blueprints in quintuplicate, but it&#39;s identified reverse engineering as a key strategic advantage China has over the US (pretty reasonable so far, right?) and has announced this as a way to shuffle some money into building up domestic RE expertise in the defence industry."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Your whole blog resonates deeply with me. All this corporate grifting and women&#39;s empowerment months will do jack shit until we figure out how to make workplaces and lives more equitable for mothers and allowing for gaps, breaks and destigmatizing time off for parents of both genders.Instead, we talk about how sexism is the biggest problem. Sure, sexism might be annoying, but in the west, it is hardly something that creates a genuine barrier for women.Startups have it worst, and everday I count the number of years I have to work in the high stress places I want or do a startup if I want to have two kids before 35. No one talks about planning around fertility. When I mention it to someone that I want to take time off for a couple years to have children in silicon valley, they look at me as if I&#39;m an alien. As if wanting to be pregnant and not working at the same time as being sleep deprived and wanting to spend time with my own baby when they are at their youngest is some strange outlandish fantasy.All careers are built this way. PhD to tenure, startups, generally high stress professions. I wish the world wasn&#39;t so male centric, that feminists actually cared about finding structural solutions instead of forcing women to become copies of men to achieve gender parity. But they care more about power than actual equality where we acknowledge that women have different needs and desires, that those needs and desires are equally valuable and not inferior to desires men have, that the two genders have different strengths and capabilities and it is equally important to reward both. And maybe not wanting to outsource your baby to a nanny during their most vulnerable years is not a heretical thought.I wish we had more focus in allowing people to transition back from taking a few years off to raise young kids, and it wasn&#39;t automatically assumed that you would be a worse founder or professor or software engineer just because you have 2-4 years you didn&#39;t commercially work. Hell, I want to take that time to contribute to open source, something I don&#39;t get to do much usually and I&#39;m looking forward to it because I am willing to face the  consequences. But I wish more women could be less scared of their career prospects for choosing to have children."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree completely with the premise that most people don&#39;t appreciate just how fleeting fertility can be, but I think rather than freezing eggs, the solution is for people to normalize having children at a younger age and designing work and home life around children existing and even being present in certain work contexts.Obviously freezing your eggs is something that you can do as individual without society&#39;s input, and my preferred solution is a cultural overhaul...But economic productivity is only useful insofar as it leads to better lives for people, economic activity that increases well-being by one unit is pointless if it requires us to spend more than one unit of well-being (by say, freezing our eggs and not becoming grandparents until we&#39;re 80) to achieve it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not so sure freezing eggs is sound advice.Lord Winston, who is professor of fertility studies at Imperial College London, warned that it was &#34;a very unsuccessful technology&#34; and said: &#34;The number of eggs that actually result in a pregnancy after freezing is about 1%.&#34; He later clarified he was referring to live births.https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51463488#:~:text=Lord%20Wins....“It’s not like I would discourage egg freezing. Women should be doing it because it’s the best option they have, but it is not an insurance policy,” says Christos Coutifaris, past president of the ASRM and a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Pennsylvania. “Insurance policies usually guarantee a payoff. In this case, there is no guarantee.”

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;The service will, eventually, be available as a paid option...&#34;How my viewpoint has shifted over the years. 10-20 years ago this would have instantly turned me off, but now this is the most exciting line in the entire thing to me. As long as we all expect free, we can&#39;t expect privacy.@Brave team, who I rather expect will be reading this, I can&#39;t believe that Cliqz doing tracking on me to improve its results for free will be in my interests if it&#39;s free. But if I&#39;m a paying customer, you might be able to convince me that you&#39;re doing some semi-invasive tracking but not actually selling it to anyone, because it wouldn&#39;t be worth losing me as a customer.I&#39;m actually excited about the idea of a search engine that I pay for. Been waiting for DDG to do it but last I knew there&#39;s still no option there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my understanding what Cliqz did, at least in the beginning, was to buy clickstream data and then build an index on top of that. So in a sense they just scraped Googles&#39; search index, as almost all users rely on Google for finding stuff on the web. The clickstream data gives you both the search query and the website(s) users visit after searching, so it&#39;s pretty easy to build a search index from that, at least for popular searches (it might be more difficult for the long tail of search queries).A lot of the clickstream data you can buy comes from browser extensions btw, and often gets collected without users knowing about it (looking at you, &#34;Web of Trust&#34;). I think their reliance on such data was the reason Cliqz acquired Ghostery, which also collects a copious amount of &#34;anonymous&#34; data from its users. On one hand it&#39;s a neat idea since you&#39;re basically standing on Googles&#39; shoulders, on the other hand it&#39;s at least questionable for a &#34;privacy-first&#34; company as the generation of the search index is based on personal data mined from (often unwitting) users.That said I don&#39;t know how their system evolved, so maybe today they have another way to build their index."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Brave has a long way to go to build real trust. Too many reckless stuff: hijacking links, suspicious url-rewriting, crypto-token stunts, forgetting to communicate with users about serious privacy leaks with their faulty TOR window... also it looks like they care about privacy only in their PR brochures."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Killing TurboTax&#34; is essentially a meme until we meaningfully simplify the tax code.There is no software development team on earth who could catch up with the full capabilities of TurboTax without some sort of fundamental shift in the business. I really hate to say this as someone who makes a living out of it, but dealing with the current amount of complexity in the tax code with a piece of software that a non-expert could use is virtually impossible.For the happy path (i.e. single individual, no dependents, no investments, no retirement, rents home), you could certainly build an application that handles these scenarios. The moment you factor in individuals who are bringing stock sales, multiple investment properties, ownerships/K1s and other complex scenarios to bear, its a different hellscape altogether.Also don&#39;t forget that most states have their own independent tax codes as well, which further complicate matters. There&#39;s difficulty multipliers all over this problem domain, and you can be certain that the lobbyists employed by Intuit, et. al. are encouraging this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sunde understands the value of propaganda, so it&#39;s fairly obvious he expected this outcome. He wanted to highlight the undemocratic and corrupt nature of one of the most critical parts of our global infrastructure, and he did it.Ironically, this was a better proof of transparency than what most &#34;problematic&#34; people would subject themselves to. If any vanilla oligarch wanted to be in those circles, he would just pay some squeaky-clean individual to be his stooge, and then make it known, after registration, who the real power is. Sunde could have configured himself as a freelance consultant to his friends, and he would not have appeared on any radar. This would have made his business work, but it would not have advanced the perennial conversation about ICANN&#39;s original sins, which have become more and more untolerable with the years.ICANN were pretty stupid to just veto his admission. That&#39;s not how you deal with institutional critics. They could have simply brought him in, then informally and formally vetoed anything he wanted to do. They have experience with people who tried to blow up things &#34;from inside&#34; in the past, so clearly they&#39;ve developed countermeasures ready for that scenario. Or they could have given him something, enough to behold him, so he&#39;d have an incentive to stay in the tent and piss outside rather than the other way around.This attitude proved Sunde is fundamentally right on the subject matter, like him or not as a person."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Over the phone, ICANN explained that the matter was discussed internally. This unnamed group of people concluded that the organization is ‘not comfortable’ doing business with him.It&#39;s the height of arrogance that they didn&#39;t even feel the need to come up with any better excuse, just this.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We&#39;re all complaining about how js is a bad language, tooling is a mess, and how the web is fundamentally built for documents and makes it hard to create app-like experiences. Now, Google comes and creates a whole new UI toolkit from scratch, couples it with a very beautiful SDK and component framework and offers a far better programming language than js could ever be but we&#39;re still nagging. I was also pretty disappointed with the demo at flutterfolio.com that is supposed to show how great Flutter 2.0 for the web is. It&#39;s not that good but it&#39;s gonna get there eventually, given the hype around wasm and &lt;canvas&gt; technologies. Not to mention that Flutter is already better and easier to use than the existing native tools for both Android and iOS. I believe Flutter is an extremely ambitious project and I appreciate that Google is really trying to give an answer to the problem of cross-platform UI development."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Google Pay switched to Flutter a few months ago for their flagship mobile app, and they already achieved major gains in productivity and quality. By unifying the codebase, the team removed feature disparity between platforms and eliminated over half a million lines of code.from pay.google.com&gt; Starting April 5, you won&#39;t be able to use pay.google.com to send and receive money from other people. To send and receive money, use the new Google Pay app."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m currently 5 months into developing a mobile app for a startup with flutter and my experience so far is very underwhelming.Flutter as a framework is not the worst but far from best, it&#39;s very OO while trying to use reacts vdom model which just wants to be functional.The biggest limitation of the platform is Dart - it&#39;s a horrible language that should have died once TS and ES6 became mature enough. And I&#39;ve used dart back when it was supposed to be a JS killer shipped with browsers, used dartium to build a MVP for an app using Angular Dart durgin the betas.Back then Dart was miles ahead in terms of tooling and JS the language didn&#39;t even have async/await - so I was singing it&#39;s praises. But the language stagnated and it&#39;s fundamentals with a nominal type system and a closed object model make the language so inflexible and full of boilerplate it&#39;s incredible. It&#39;s very much like Java (the language, without the powerful ecosystem) and people prefer Kotlin for frontend for a reason. C# is similar but they figured out that they need to build a lot of things in to the language to reduce the boilerplate so they are adding stuff like Records and pattern matching.If you look at state management patterns in flutter there&#39;s probably 5-10 competing approaches all lacking in their own way and all severely hampered by how unexpressive dart is. Or how you deal with serialisation/immutability/etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Blog author here!  Thanks to HN for warning me about sscanf at exactly the right time – within a day of me trying to load some ASCII STLs and noticing it was slow...Linked deep in the Twitter replies [1], there&#39;s an open glibc issue about this, dating back to 2014:https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17577C doesn&#39;t have any requirements on the complexity of sscanf, so it might not be a bug per se, but it&#39;s certainly... a pitfall.[1] https://twitter.com/impraxical/status/1367194430835425283"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the really embarrassing part for Rockstar is that they didn&#39;t bother to investigate what took 5+ minutes to load in their star product, a simple profiling would&#39;ve made the issue obvious. So either they knew and they didn&#39;t care, or they didn&#39;t know and they didn&#39;t care.That being said both for GTA and for TFA the issue is a very similar sscanf call:     sscanf(data, &#34;%f&#34;, &amp;f);

I already posted a similar comment in the GTA story but I really want to emphasize it: scanf is almost never the right tool for the job, and it&#39;s definitely not the right tool in this situation. Just use strtof. That&#39;s literally what it&#39;s for. String to float. There. Done.Scanf is crappy and if it were up to me would&#39;ve been deprecated a while ago. I can sort of see using it for a quick one-off &#34;script&#34;, for instance to parse user input, but seeing it in the middle of a program will always raise a huge red flag for me.Use strtok_r if you need to split a string, then parse every entry individually. It&#39;s more robust, more flexible (you can parse custom types and formats that way) and allows for much better error handling and diagnostics. And of course it&#39;s also usually vastly faster.Scanf is an antipattern in my opinion. I literally never use it and I&#39;m better off for it. The last time I interviewed for a C coder position I managed to answer the full C test quizz except for the one question regarding scanf. That&#39;s how much I don&#39;t use it.I think it&#39;s even worse for developers who come from higher level languages and (reasonably) expect to be able to deserialize data easily. You simply can&#39;t do that in C, the type system and general philosophy of the language won&#39;t let you, but scanf may convey the illusion that it&#39;s sort of possible. Don&#39;t believe its lies."</p>

They were constructing a lens system to go into a satellite which could purportedly read the issue date on a dime lying on the sidewalk. It was something like $15M. The implication was that the government had found something even better, and gone with that instead. If Google is publicly giving up on a particular, unpopular technology to buy some PR, I strongly suspect that they&#39;ve already figured out something which will work &#34;better&#34; behind the scenes.There&#39;s a lot of confusion over what this story is actually saying, and, given the obscurity with which Google deals with it&#39;s tech, I don&#39;t think this is going to get cleared up, leaving room for a lot of speculation. But one thing is absolutely certain: There&#39;s no possible way that Google is going to make a change to their biggest money maker that would make them LESS money.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I hope this gives rise to another, smaller viable party outside of Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Perhaps I&#39;m jaded, perhaps hopelessly biased - but I can only see this as a net negative.Okta&#39;s open source packages receive a pitiful amount of attention (for example: https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-js/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%...) with forks almost becoming a requirement. Auth0 by contrast has been &#34;on the ball&#34; for a long time with their offerings. Okta&#39;s interfaces have been disjointed and inconsistent, confusing to users on a scale only surpassed by Jira, while Auth0&#39;s have always been pleasant to use from a user and developer perspective.From a personnel perspective, the two companies couldn&#39;t be more different, with Auth0 embracing a remote-first-class culture with creative interview processes, and Okta (pre-covid) being very much the opposite. I interviewed with both, and the process at Auth0 had me walk away with respect, while contrasted with Okta that left me reminded that tech hiring is broken.I&#39;ll hold my breath for a short time that Auth0 is allowed to operate independently. Sadly I feel it&#39;ll be inevitable that they&#39;re eventually swallowed up by the mothership."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate this. We moved from Okta a few years ago after we were basically received almost no actual real support for a bunch of issues, even though we were paying a premium cost. Nobody cares about issues on their Github, the kicker was a when we received a support response as suddenly something was no longer working after an update, we got help in the form of &#34;We have no plans to address this anytime soon.&#34; when asking for an ETA.We ended up switching to Auth0, after we had a few calls with them. We shaved a decent amount off our costs with Auth0&#39;s Enterprise plan, and their webtask based rules worked. While the migration sucked for a bit, in the end we were much happier."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really not a fan of this.Okta as a business are a pain to deal with, and unless you meet their minimum spend requirements (which are not told to you up-front) you&#39;re screwed.I&#39;ve rolled out a ton of commercial products where we started with 1-2 users or a few units of compute, and on the basic little/no support options.When those products succeed, and we can demonstrate that not only does it meet our needs on paper, but it actually works, and whatever flaws that exist are not big enough to stop us wanting to use it more.AWS, Atlassian&#39;s Jira and Confluence, Sendgrid, Mailchip, Duo, and a bunch of others all started being used in orgs where this kind of thing is super low friction and easy to spin up, we plug in a credit card to get us off the ground.Okta? Well they&#39;ll tell you the pricing up-front, that&#39;s great - what they don&#39;t tell you is that after the trial period, you can&#39;t just give them a credit card, no you need to go through the sales process. It&#39;s not until you&#39;re talking to their salesperson that you find out you can&#39;t just start with a few licenses, no, you need to meet their minimum spend figure per month.Well, that idea was dead."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been trying out the latest master builds of pipewire recently and have been pretty impressed with it:* My bluetooth headset can now use the HFP profile with the mSBC codec (16 kHz sample rate) instead of the terrible CVSD codec (8 kHz sample rate) with the basic HSP profile.* Higher quality A2DP stereo codecs, like LDAC, also work.* AVDTP 1.3 delay reporting works (!!) to delay the video for perfect A/V sync.* DMA-BUF based screen recording works with OBS + obs-xdg-portal + pipewire (for 60fps game capture).For my use cases, the only things still missing are automatic switching between A2DP and HFP bluetooth profiles and support for AVRCP absolute volume (so that the OS changes the headset&#39;s hardware volume instead of having a separate software volume)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; including the raw Linux ALSA sound API, which typically allows only one application to access the sound card.If the raw in that sentence is not meant as a special qualifier and this is meant as a statement about ALSA in general, this is wrong. I recently read up on this to confirm my memory was right when reading a similar statement. In fact, ALSA had just a very short period where typically only one application accessed the sound card. After that, dmix was enabled by default. Supporting multiple applications was actually the big advantage of ALSA compared to OSS, which at the time really did support only one application per soundcard (without hardware mixing, which broke away at that time). I&#39;m not sure why this seems to be remembered so wrongly?&gt; Speaking of transitions, Fedora 8&#39;s own switch to PulseAudio in late 2007 was not a smooth one. Longtime Linux users still remember having the daemon branded as the software that will break your audio.This wasn&#39;t just a Fedora problem. Ubuntu when making the switch also broke Audio on countless of systems. I was active as supporter in a Ubuntu support forum at that time and we got flooded with help requests. My very own system did not work with Pulseaudio when I tried to switch, that was years later. I still use only ALSA because of that experience. At that time Pulseaudio was garbage, it should never have been used then. It only got acceptable later - but still has bugs and issues.That said, PipeWire has a better vibe than Pulseaudio did. It intends to replace a system that never worked flawlessly, seems to focus on compatibility, and the apparent endorsement from the JACK-developers also does not hurt. User reports I have seen so far have been positive, though I&#39;m not deep into support forums anymore. Maybe this can at least replace Pulseaudio, that would be a win. I&#39;m cautiously optimistic about this one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just tried it on NixOS, had no idea it was so fleshed out already! Thought it&#39;d be full of bugs but was pleasantly surprised, it just worked. No issues with compatibility, extremely low latency and has JACK and PulseAudio shims, so everything works out of the box, including pro audio stuff like Reaper and Ardour. And thanks to the JACK shim I can patch around the outputs with qjackctl. This is compared to JACK, which I never managed to properly combine with PulseAudio."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We recently tried to build a relatively simple PowerApps application - under the assumption it would save time over pumping out a React boilerplate form.  Never again.We wanted it to be able to integrate with our backend which lives outside the MS ecosystem.  No problem we thought - that&#39;s what custom connectors are for.  Except they don&#39;t work with any of the automated form generation functionality.  So we pretty much have to build the form entirely manually.Low code becomes high code all of a sudden - except it&#39;s worse than just coding and learning a new framework.  You can&#39;t just input your code anywhere you want, or import your dependencies, etc... You have to hunt around in a zillion different (laggy as all hell) interfaces to find the right location where that code can live.  Or maybe it&#39;s not code - but a toggle somewhere... OMG... kill me.Good luck if you are trying to learn the lower level aspects... since all the tutorials, blogs, youtube videos - all assume that your data all lives in Sharepoint or some other MS resource - and that your connector actually works as advertised.If you can code - and your stack doesn&#39;t already entirely consist of the MS ecosystem.  Just roll your own."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just read the overview document (docs/overview.md in that repo), and I have to say I&#39;m blown away.Excel is one of the world&#39;s most popular programming environments, because it has such a low barrier to entry, but it&#39;s limited: the input is always a grid of numbers, and the output is always a grid of numbers, which limits how useful it can be to people outside number-crunching professions.Visual Basic (especially the original, pre-.NET incarnation) let you create Real Windows Apps with all the inputs and outputs that entails (images, copy/paste, files, sliders, textboxes, databases) and let you use a fairly simple and forgiving language to wire them together... but the barrier-to-entry was still a lot higher than Excel, even if it was lower than C++, or even Visual Basic.NET.This PowerApps thing seems like an elegant middle-ground between the two - rich inputs and outputs (images, sliders, text-boxes, databases), with a simple, predictable language to wire them together. The inputs and outputs aren&#39;t quite as rich as Visual Basic, but the shift from native apps to web apps has changed people&#39;s expectations since the days of VB6, so that&#39;s probably an advantage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the overview document:&gt; Microsoft Power Fx is the low-code language that will be used across the Microsoft Power Platform.The emphasized part above is all you need to know to understand that Microsoft Power Fx is NOT a low-code general purpose programming language, as is mistakenly stated in the README document. It might be general purpose in the Power Apps context, but it&#39;s a moot point from the larger perspective. Generally, Microsoft Power Platform and, thus, its subset Power Apps, present a much stronger lock-in risk than Azure and some other products and services."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Also wanted to share my overall positive experience with Clickhouse.UPSIDES* started a 3-node cluster using the official Docker images super quickly* ingested billions of rows super fast* great compression (of course, depends on your data&#39;s characteristics)* features like https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/engines/table-engines/merget... are amazing to see* ODBC support.  I initially said &#34;Who uses that??&#34;, but we used it to connect PostgreSQL and so we can keep the non-timeseries data in PostgreSQL but still access PostgreSQL tables in Clickhouse (!)* you can go the other way too: read Clickhouse from PostgreSQL (see https://github.com/Percona-Lab/clickhousedb_fdw, although we didn&#39;t try this)* PRs welcome, and quickly reviewed. (We improved the ODBC UUID support)* code quality is pretty high.DOWNSIDES* limited JOIN capabilities, which is expected from a timeseries-oriented database like Clickhouse.  It&#39;s almost impossible to implement JOINs at this kind of scale.  The philosophy is &#34;If it won&#39;t be fast as scale, we don&#39;t support it&#34;* not-quite-standard SQL syntax, but they&#39;ve been improving it* limited DELETE support, which is also expected from this kind of database, but rarely used in the kinds of environments that CH usually runs in (how often do people delete data from ElasticSearch?)It&#39;s really an impressive piece of engineering.  Hats off to the Yandex crew."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it&#39;s an unfair comparison, notably because:1) Clickhouse is rigid-schema + append-only - you can&#39;t simply dump semi-structured data (csv/json/documents) into it and worry about schema (index definition) + querying later.  The only clickhouse integration I&#39;ve seen up close had a lot of &#34;json&#34; blobs in it as a workaround, which cannot be queried with the same ease as in ES.2) Clickhouse scalability is not as simple/documented as elasticsearch.  You can set up a 200-node ES cluster with a relatively simple helm config or readily-available cloudformation recipe.3) Elastic is more than elasticsearch - kibana and the &#34;on top of elasticsearch&#34; featureset is pretty substantial.4) Every language/platform under the sun (except powerbi... god damnit) has native + mature client drivers for elasticsearch, and you can fall back to bog-standard http calls for querying if you need/want.  ClickHouse supports some very elementary SQL primitives (&#34;ANSI&#34;) and even those have some gotchas and are far from drop-in.In this manner, I think that clickhouse is better compared as a self-hosted alternative to Aurora and other cloud-native scalable SQL databases, and less a replacement for elasticsearch.  If you&#39;re using Elasticsearch for OLAP, you&#39;re probably better to ETL the semi-structured/raw data out of ES that you specifically wan to a more suitable database which is meant for that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; SQL is a perfect language for analytics.Slightly off topic, but I strongly agree with this statement and wonder why the languages used for a lot of data science work (R, Python) don&#39;t have such a strong focus on SQL.It might just be my brain, but SQL makes so much logical sense as a query language and, with small variances, is used to directly query so many databases.In R, why learn the data.tables (OK, speed) or dplyr paradigms, when SQL can be easily applied directly to dataframes? There are libraries to support this like sqldf[1], tidyquery[2] and duckdf[3] (author). And I&#39;m sure the situation is similar in Python.This is not a post against great libraries like data.table and dplyr, which I do use from time to time. It&#39;s more of a question about why SQL is not more popular as the query language de jour for data science.[1] https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sqldf/index.html[2] https://github.com/ianmcook/tidyquery[3] https://github.com/phillc73/duckdf"</p>

The more widely vegan &#34;meat&#34; is available, the more likely it is to be adopted by average people and not just dedicated vegans.Reducing the demand for real beef is probably one of the best things we can do in the short term for the environment, due to the amount of land required for cattle farming, and due to the surprising amount of methane emitted by cattle.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"He&#39;s kind of totally wrong about the phones and thus the speed being THE killer feature. First of all, Symbian phones, which were the market leader smartphones when the iphone was released were pretty fast. So were feature phones (i.e. dumb phones).What iphone was a LOT better at than everyone else was UX. Of which speed is one component, of course. It&#39;s funny how much people never get it although it happened in front of us, it happened to us. At the time I was working at Nokia Research and I remember my girlfriend telling me how his boss got this wonderful phone that you can take photos with and you can view them, etc. The funny thing is that I had such a phone since 2001. I have been working with smartphones for 6 years then, she knew it, she listened to me when I told her or others what I was doing (and then listen to others responding &#34;yeah, but phones are for making phone calls&#34;). She saw me browsing the net on my phones (a 9210 communicator and then a 9500), send emails from the beach, etc.Still it somehow didn&#39;t register. Because it looked like something that she&#39;d never use. And then the iphone that did a lot less made her and basically everyone understand what a smartphone is. (Even though by then symbian smartphones were pretty common, most people didn&#39;t use them as smartphones.)So no, it&#39;s not simply the speed. It&#39;s the UX. And even if we talk about speed, it&#39;s still not the speed, but it&#39;s the perception of the speed, which a lot has been written about: delay (lagging) matters a lot even if speed on average is OK."</p>

How would I ever hope to find it if I needed that exact document?Obviously such huge archive cannot be categorized and annotated by small team, so it would make sense to crowdsource the labeling process.

It&#39;s extremely important to be accurate with this kind of thing. The discussion below is all based on assuming that that title is literally true.The HN guidelines specifically ask you not to rewrite titles unless they are misleading or linkbait: https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html.I&#39;ve changed the URL from https://www.mitpressjournals.org/action/showPublications, which doesn&#39;t explain anything, to the press release which, although it&#39;s a press release, sort of does. Nevertheless it&#39;s hard to figure out what exactly is being announced here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To MIT Press, thank you. But without an announcement, I fear that this is just a one time, brief thing.Springer did this awhile ago for a weekend, not its entire catalog but many books were free to download. It was wonderful, but brief. From down thread, https://mitpress.mit.edu/blog/mit-press-launches-direct-openI think it is important for folks to recognize how hard this must have been and how many heated verbal battles were exchanged inside of MIT over this. Thank You. And thank Aaron, always a champion in spreading the world&#39;s knowledge to the most people possible.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems slightly weird to me that university presses and learned society journals aren’t generally open access. I thought the point was to aid the university’s research. Surely it helps the name of the university to have important widely accessible journals with the university’s name on them. Maybe the presses tend to have been spun off as commercial enterprises, or maybe the university really loves the income. Or maybe they are really expensive to run for some reason. I know the press at my university has a pretty large building but I’d figured a lot of it was a warehouse. Maybe it’s full of salespeople negotiating with librarians.I don’t think there’s much hope of the commercial journals owned by Elsevier or Springer opening up, but I do hope that the trend of journals flipping (where the entire editorial board resigns and forms a similarly named open access journal) will increase.Perhaps another problem is that in those fields that are already closest to open access (say because they use the arxiv), there is less incentive for people to jot publish in commercial journals as everyone who matters will have already read the preprint in the arxiv."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"More background from the point of view of Frogware:The Sinking City is Being Delisted. Here’s Whyhttps://frogwares.com/the-sinking-city-is-being-delisted-her...Without wishing to take sides, here&#39;s what seems to be at the root of the dispute, from Frogware&#39;s POV:On June 27, 2019, The Sinking City was released on Xbox One, PS4, and Epic Games Store. That was a great day for us. And once the game was released, we received a letter from Bigben/Nacon that the milestones that were previously approved are being canceled, meaning that we would not receive any profit from the sales of the game. A retroactive cancellation on not delivering a product on time that is already out in the market is not acceptable. That was when our legal battle began.We filed a lawsuit against Bigben/Nacon on August 2019 and, incidentally, only then we started to receive income reports, though incomplete and undocumented. So it was not possible for us to see if the revenue was correctly calculated or even how many units we sold. At some point we received a statement claiming that one of the console manufacturers hasn’t paid royalties for more than 5 months, while actually the same console manufacturer paid our royalties from other games without any delay in the same period of time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was working near some game publishers many many years ago, and the case when they would crack the game in order to publish/republish/rewrap installer, localize to some local market or release some critical patch, when the original team was not responsive, not experienced in certain tech issues, had no resources allocated, was drown in bureaucracy, or even was not existing anymore, was not so uncommon.The case when this is breaching original contracts is the well the separate issue. Often times the publisher and developer have different views of the world, - relationships in this industry have always been tense."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hadn&#39;t heard of this before, so maybe I am missing some context here, but something seems fishy:&gt; Steam is one of the listed platforms of commercialization in the contract between Frogwares and Nacon. But since the release of the game, Nacon’s unlawful actions have forced Frogwares to defend its property and react in front of the French Justice for lack of payments, attempts to steal our IPs, etc which we made a public letter about back in August 2020.Here&#39;s the previous statement from Nacon:https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/750130/view/30584784...I can&#39;t find any of the details about Nacon&#39;s unlawful actions, and it seems Frogware is being intentionally vague. Doing some digging, it seems like this is almost a complete retread of a legal battle they had before:https://twinfinite.net/2019/09/frogwares-games-delisted-alle...It seems like they may have a history of playing a copyright game with publishers - take their money to develop a game, then use legal trickery to take back the property outright.In this case Nacon may have felt they had a &#34;mechanic&#39;s lien&#34; on the code and felt justified stealing it back outright (probably a bad choice in the long run). But regardless, I don&#39;t get the sense that Frogwares is completely being on the up and up about the relationship with their exes.Update: Frogwares has a much more detailed list of grievances here: https://frogwares.com/the-sinking-city-is-being-delisted-her... Some seem petty and some seem serious. But it still leaves questions. How much did Nacon already pay Frogwares? Does Frogwares plan on paying it back?&gt; The agreement is, therefore, terminated without further formality. Moreover, on July 17, 2020, Nacon attempted to oppose the termination in court, but the judge rejected the demand, and the contract is now terminated in the eyes of the law.Maybe French law is much weirder than ours, but this phrasing would be highly suspect in the US. You would get a really affirmative ruling that you are still bound by contract or not."</p>

Bitcoin has trained our collective neural network to do this.The huddled masses can take their new superpower and apply it to stock, crypto, commodities on the commodity exchange, and all kinds of speculative assets, especially the virtual kind.It&#39;s taken a gambling-friendly society with feverish lust for winning (think for-profit fantasy sports, online poker, day trading, Vegas et al) and turned us into a giant decentralized casino."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll admit, I didn&#39;t read all four articles. I got about half way through the first one and was just wondering &#34;I still have no idea what this is all about.&#34; Fortunately, the Wikipedia article on the author has a brief summary.In particular, I thought this quote from the Wikipedia article really summarizes the differences between older and younger generations: &#34;there is a profound difference between using a racial epithet in the course of a discussion about that racial epithet&#39;s use, and using a racial epithet to diminish or to wound someone.&#34;For &#34;socially conscious&#34; people in my generation (Gen X), I think nearly all of us would find calling someone a racial epithet abhorrent. At the same time, while I understand culture has shifted and I wouldn&#39;t do it now, I still find it quite bizarre that the mere utterance of the epithet, even in a sentence like &#34;You should never call someone a &lt;racial epithet&gt; because that is extremely offensive&#34; is considered itself racist by younger people.I recall hearing about a young popular YouTuber about a year or so ago who was accused of being racist simply for singing along to the lyrics of a popular rap song. Even more strange to me was that his defense (which was true if one looked up his Instagram video) was that he did NOT utter said epithet, in that he was singing along with the lyrics but when it got to that word he just skipped it and didn&#39;t say it.I understand culture changes, but it still bothers me that we&#39;ve gotten to the point where we completely disregard intent and focus instead just on the syntax of what was said. To be clear, I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s indeed what occurred in Mr. McNeil&#39;s case, but I certainly have seen it in other examples."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; 1. Yes, I did use the word, in this context: A student asked me if I thought her high school’s administration was right to suspend a classmate of hers for using the word in a video she’d made in eighth grade. I said “Did she actually call someone a (offending word)? Or was she singing a rap song or quoting a book title or something?” When the student explained that it was the student, who was white and Jewish, sitting with a black friend and the two were jokingly insulting each other by calling each other offensive names for a black person and a Jew, I said “She was suspended for that? Two years later? No, I don’t think suspension was warranted. Somebody should have talked to her, but any school administrator should know that 12-year-olds say dumb things. It’s part of growing up.”&gt; 2. I was never asked if I believed in white privilege. As someone who lived in South Africa in the 1990’s and has reported in Africa almost every year since, I have a clearer idea than most Americans of white privilege. I was asked if I believed in systemic racism. I answered words to the effect of: “Yeah, of course, but tell me which system we’re talking about. The U.S. military? The L.A.P.D.? The New York Times? They’re all different.”&gt; 3. The question about blackface was part of a discussion of cultural appropriation. The students felt that it was never, ever appropriate for any white person to adopt anything from another culture — not clothes, not music, not anything. I counter-argued that all cultures grow by adopting from others. I gave examples — gunpowder and paper. I said I was a San Franciscan, and we invented blue jeans. Did that mean they — East Coast private school students — couldn’t wear blue jeans? I said we were in Peru, and the tomato came from Peru. Did that mean that Italians had to stop using tomatoes? That they had to stop eating pizza? Then one of the students said: “Does that mean that blackface is OK?” I said “No, not normally — but is it OK for black people to wear blackface?” “The student, sounding outraged, said “Black people don’t wear blackface!” I said “In South Africa, they absolutely do. The so-called colored people in Cape Town have a festival every year called the Coon Carnival where they wear blackface, play Dixieland music and wear striped jackets. It started when a minstrel show came to South Africa in the early 1900’s. Americans who visit South Africa tell them they’re offended they shouldn’t do it, and they answer ‘Buzz off. This is our culture now. Don’t come here from America and tell us what to do.’ So what do you say to them? Is it up to you, a white American, to tell black South Africans what is and isn’t their culture?”I fundamentally don&#39;t understand why the Times didn&#39;t explain this early on. Not necessarily release these statements verbatim, but certainly provide some of this context."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Related to Xiaomi, the company is also doing some sketchy things in the smart home space under their brand &#34;Aqara&#34;.  I use HomeKit in my apartment and opted for Aqara branded wireless buttons and temp/humidity sensors because of the attractive hardware and good reviews.  The devices require a wi-fi connected hub, not too strange for things that use Zigbee, so I gave that a go.Well, on cursory examination, the Aqara/Xiaomi hub was talking to a bunch of Chinese servers constantly.  I didn&#39;t dive too deep into what all they were actually for.  When I blocked the device from phoning home with my router, all the connected devices stopped working!  None of the buttons or sensors would work, the RGB light on the hub couldn&#39;t even be changed.  As soon as it lost the ability to ping its servers in China, the thing actually started strobe light flashing blue.  Re-enable the outside network access on it, starts working again.  This was totally antithetical to why I use HomeKit in the first place, so I removed the hub and paired all the Aqara accessories with a generic open source Zigbee hub (ConBee II) and added it to HomeKit with HomeBridge.In the future I plan to give brands more scrutiny before investing time/money in them and granting them unfettered access to my LAN..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This paragraph stood out to me:&gt; The intention here seems to be that aigt is the timestamp when the ID was generated. So if that timestamp deviates from current time by more than 7776000000 milliseconds (90 days) a new ID is going to be generated. However, this implementation is buggy, it will update aigt on every call rather than only when a new ID is generated. So the only scenario where a new ID will be generated is: this method wasn’t called for 90 days, meaning that the browser wasn’t started for 90 days. And that’s rather unlikely, so one has to consider this ID permanent.If we assume that Xiaomi aren&#39;t literally trying to spy for a government and are in fact just poorly calibrated on what&#39;s legitimate to collect for product analytics purposes, this paragraph highlights why that&#39;s still incredibly dangerous despite &#34;good intentions&#34;.I remember the UK government investigation into Huawei concluding that not only was their security posture insufficient for critical infrastructure, but their engineering practices were likely a decade away from being at a point where they could start to claim good security practice.This paragraph seems to suggest a similar problem at Xiaomi. This should have been caught at a security review stage during design, it should have been caught at the code review stage, it should have been caught by automated tests, it should have been caught by QA, it should have been caught once live by data tests, it should have been seen once live by analysts, it should have been fixed at so many different points. The fact it wasn&#39;t suggests that these stages either don&#39;t exist or are insufficient."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I truly don&#39;t understand, from a security and privacy perspective, why would anyone outside of China would voluntarily choose to run closed-source software from a company that&#39;s subject to domestic laws and regulations in China. The MSS is no joke.https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=china+mss...This is the same reason that Zoom is banned at my workplace and many other partner companies.You&#39;ve actually got two problems here. One is the commercial advertising/for-profit related data sharing problem described in the article. The second is that Xiaomi, as a company with that collected data resident in China on its servers, is obliged to provide a pipeline for a copy of their database to the MSS upon request."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Throwaway because I don&#39;t want my co-workers to know.I was poor. My father left home when I was a kid in middle school. My mom worked part time cleaning houses and left us when she found a new husband. I dropped out of high-school in the 9th grade and went to work. Low paying jobs. I lived with my aunt on the bad side of town.Fast-forward 35 years. Today, I make about 200K per year. I got a GED, went to trade school, then got into college (full Pell Grant because I was so poor) and came out with a few degrees.Everything I own is fully paid for. House, cars, etc. because I&#39;m always afraid I&#39;m going to be poor again. Of course, I only own modest things. Nothing fancy.If you have never been poor, you may not realize how awesome Small houses and Toyota Corollas are.My fears about being poor again drive my wife and kids crazy. They think I&#39;m nuts and say I need counseling. I probably do.Anyway, people think I&#39;m &#39;privileged&#39; now because I earn a lot of money, but they have no idea that I used to sleep on the floor and eat in soup lines.I made it and you can too. Poverty has no color. It impacts everyone. You can&#39;t tell just by looking at someone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great write-up, and as someone who spent time being poor-ish, it really resonated.What I realized from my own life experience: the US sawed the bottom rungs off the ladder in the 1950s when it suburbanized. There is no affordable housing or transportation in 95% of the North American land area, and virtually every societal problem we deal with either stems from this or is made worse by it. Then the healthcare disaster is the cherry on top.The US is a great place to live and work with tremendous upward mobility —— but only if you can stay above the event horizon which is reliable car ownership and insurance coverage (health, home/renters, auto). If you fall under that, you will need help or a lot of good luck to get back out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"His point on housing is so important, and its adjacent to a lot of other poverty-related issues.It&#39;s one of the reasons advocates for the poor often seem to speak a different language to their opposition.If you live in median-and-above-land, you think of all costs existing on a spectrum.  Fancy dinners for $100 on one end. Rice and beans for pennies at the other. This is true for clothes, smartphones, furniture... lots of things. There&#39;s a spectrum with options all along it.It is not true for housing, transport and a lot of other, unavoidable expenses. Housing is the extreme example. Say an average smartphone is $350. $700 buys a luxury phone. $175 gets you an decent phone. Say median rent is $1500. Going above $3k will get you a palace and $750 probably doesn&#39;t get you anything. Quality, below median prices is on an extremely steep curve.Household economics are just completely different below and above a certain threshold... and this has gotten more pronounced over the last generation or two.Ireland has/had a whole literary genre of stories about miserable poverty-stricken childhoods. They paint a very vivid picture. If you compare it to poverty today, besides being less harsh, it&#39;s quite different.  They had housing. It was basic, often insecure, but they did have housing.Food was scarce. That&#39;s no longer the case. Stuff though... they had no stuff. No bed, no mugs, no shoes, no pencils. Getting these things was an epic mission and served as a landmark. That is all changed now. Stuff is extremely abundant. Basics like housing and transport are almost as scarce as they were in the bad old days.The upshot of all this is that we underestimate how poor poor is."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seen the GTA post already and the sscanf behavior is very surprising as one would expect it to parse the given string until the given format is satisfied or \0 is hit. Seems like this is not the case. Found this: https://stackoverflow.com/a/23924112&gt; sscanf() converts the string you pass in to an _IO_FILE* to make the string look like a &#34;file&#34;. This is so the same internal _IO_vfscanf() can be used for both a string and a FILE*. However, as part of that conversion, done in a _IO_str_init_static_internal() function, it calls __rawmemchr (ptr, &#39;\0&#39;); essentially a strlen() call, on your input string.Looks correct. Call flow:https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/21c3f4b5368686ade28d90d...https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/21c3f4b5368686ade28d90d...https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/21c3f4b5368686ade28d90d...https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/83908b3a1ea51e3aa7ff422..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found this while making a collection of what C implementation does what at https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26298300 .There are two basic implementation strategies.  The BSD (FreeBSD and OpenBSD and more than likely NetBSD too), Microsoft, GNU, and MUSL C libraries use one, and suffer from this; whereas the OpenWatcom, P.J. Plauger, Tru64 Unix, and my standard C libraries use another, and do not.The 2002 report in the comp.lang.c Usenet newsgroup (listed in that discussion) is the earliest that I&#39;ve found so far.There have been several assertions that library support for strings in C++ is poor.  However, note that the fix here was to switch from the Standard C library function sscanf() to a C++ library.* https://github.com/fastfloatOne might advocate using other people&#39;s libraries, on the grounds that they will have got such things right.  However, note that this is RapidYAML, and the bug got fixed several years after GTA Online was released.  Other third-party parsing libraries have suffered from being layered on top of sscanf() in other ways.* https://github.com/json-c/json-c/issues/173* https://github.com/kgabis/parson/commit/96150ba1fd7f3398aa6a..."</p>

Friends knew whether they would disturb you or not.Not only that but it was pretty much the singular form of instant communication that almost everybody used. Now I have people I reply to on multiple platforms such that we&#39;ll even branch off in separate conversations per platform, I only talk to on X, Y, or Z platform, etc.I&#39;m not one to &lt;Old man yells at cloud&gt; typically but this is one aspect of social media that I think we&#39;ve lost over the past decade and it really sucks."</p>

This is my post.I’m not strictly allergic to proving that I live in a certain place, so long as the evidence is securely deleted afterward. I’m very opposed to the idea that they can share all of those records with any of their partners or sponsors as they see fit. For example, “proof of residency 3” includes financial or medical records. Suppose that Large Corporation donates $1,000 to Little League. Per the privacy policy, Little League could share those financial or medical records with them. Nuts to that."</p>

If they run into some situation in a few years and find this desirable, you&#39;re data is going to be part of the package.What they really should be doing is outsourcing this to another company that is specifically dedicated to identity verification (like Personia.io) and NOT collect any of the underlying documentation.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Surprising how much press &#34;cancel culture&#34; gets these days as if it&#39;s a new thing or as if it&#39;s a new thing being pushed on society by the left. We&#39;ve always had cancel culture. Some might remember the Dixie Chicks. How about the Rachael Ray ad that Dunkin Donuts pulled merely because it looked like an Arab scarf? Jerry Falwell came to prominence entirely based on his pushing of cancel culture. When I lived in North Carolina, one of the things that was repeated all the time was that a newspaper editor would lose his job for publishing a story with a positive spin on free trade. You can go back further to McCarthyism, Turing being prosecuted for being gay, and on and on.Cancel culture remains a thing. Apparently now that folks aren&#39;t just being cancelled for supporting gay marriage, the free exchange of ideas is suddenly important. The outright hypocrisy of so many on this issue is the biggest story.Edit: Forgot to mention this extreme example of cancel culture:https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/professor-who-wore-hijab-...A professor was cancelled because she wore a hijab. There was no outrage at all from the usual suspects."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I genuinely wonder what cancel culture is going to look like in the next 5-10 years and beyond. Just about everyone I speak to about the subject agrees that cancel culture is bad but very few people seem willing to confront it. I sense that people hope the rest of society will come to its senses and we all stop being so judgemental.But as much as I loathe cancel culture and it&#39;s chilling effects on the free exchange of ideas, I can&#39;t help but admit that it seems to work. From a detached and objective standpoint, an ideology that utilizes cancel culture is really good at stamping out opposition. You are free to think and believe whatever you want in private and then you self-censor in public out of fear. It takes a certain critical mass of people to affect change and cancel culture excels at keeping individuals from speaking out because the consequences have the potential to ruin your life.So all that being said, I genuinely wonder if cancel culture is here to stay, because the next ideology to come along will also realize how powerful of a tool it is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find it almost funny how the media/culture/etc. seems determined to build a group of people that will react negatively to so-called &#34;cancel culture.&#34; They seem to think that people will gladly follow the ever-growing list of arbitrary rules indefinitely.If I were a betting man, I&#39;d predict a resurgence in punk attitudes in about 2025 or 2030. At some point, the dam will break and people will stop caring. I already get a sense that the 13-19 generation is a bit tired of it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There’s a UX defect with Messages right now where if you delete some conversations in succession, randomly will a modal popup and ask you if you want to report the contact as spam.Some Apple articles will tell you not to worry if you’ve accidentally reported someone as spam, but it actually does something. It’s not a pedestrian crosswalk button.I found this out the hard way when my wife could no longer send or receive messages nor sign into Messages and we had to contact Apple support. I’ve accidentally reported tons of people as spam because of this stupid Messages experience, and I can only guess that I’ve reported my own wife so many times from clearing all of my Messages conversations that they disabled her Messages account.The support tech had the gall to tell me they’d reactivate her account as a one-time exception, and I practically wanted to kill the guy over the phone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Now that I work for a big evil corporation, I have some insights on why these inexplicably evil things happen. Fun at parties, I know. Not excusing it, just shedding light for anyone interested in the systems perspective.&gt;It appears as though charges from Apple are specialThis is exactly right. You offer branded cards because interchange fees are expensive. You want people who buy your stuff to pay you by ACH. That&#39;s not practical at the point of sale, but it is practical if you frame it as the monthly payment on your store-brand credit card. Charges at the store on the store-brand card are always special. That&#39;s why the cards are offered.From a merchant&#39;s perspective, anyone who buys something is really taking out a loan. In most cases such a loan will be settled by the customer&#39;s card issuer, less the interchange fee. In the case of a branded card, it will be settled by the customer directly and in full. In either case, if this doesn&#39;t happen on time, the customer&#39;s account with the merchant is now in arrears.Most of the time this happens, the &#34;customer&#34; is farming stolen credit card numbers for resalable goods. You are never going to find these people, let alone rehabilitate them and settle up. So the &#34;hey, you did a lot of chargebacks to us, what the hell?&#34; state is not user friendly. It&#39;s scorched earth. I would be cautious about signing into any other Apple accounts on devices that have been associated with yours."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a similar terrible experience with Apple Card. Still having it actually, as months later they haven&#39;t resolved it.The product was great until it wasn&#39;t. The amount of hours I&#39;ve lost to try and fix this, including talking to numerous people on the phone, is absurd. No one can figure out how to unlock, pay, or even close my account. Linking Apple Id&#39;s to Apple Card accounts is crazy. Shocked when I realized that was going on.Here&#39;s a *long* screenshot of my support history https://breckyunits.com/appleCard.pngSmall pain in the big scheme of things, but sad to see Apple not really innovate behind the fancy UI. I&#39;d vote they nix this thing and leave consumer cards to Stripe and PayPal and others who are more focused on building better financial products for consumers. Don&#39;t pull a GE and get mixed up in finance Apple, you&#39;re better than this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is definitely the most reasonable case I&#39;ve heard made from this argument, and it&#39;s changed my stance on the issue.That said, I feel the cryptography project handled this poorly. I encountered the issue when one day, installing a Python Ansible module the same way I did the day before required a compiler for a different language that I&#39;ve never used before and that is hardly used, if at all, in the rest of my stack. The Ansible project seemed to be taken by surprise, and eventually  I found the root upstream issue, where the initial attitude was &#34;too bad&#34;. Some people making those comments worked for Red Hat / IBM, Ansible is heavily backed by that. What company cares more about Linux on S390 than Red Hat / IBM? I would suggest none. So the fact that they had this attitude and community reaction to me suggests the problem is not one of expecting free work for a corporation on a non-free architecture. It was IMHO a combination of a lack of forethought, communication, and yes, perhaps a change that is overdue and will just be a little painful. The suggestion to maintain an LTS release while people figure out how to proceed is the right move."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I do think that we&#39;re going to see more of this. This is just a relatively early example. Rust and LLVM bring things to the table that make them inevitable if we as an ecosystem, on the whole, value privacy and security. This is where the rubber of the ethos hits the road. C for all it&#39;s good work and history, is a leaky mess and the source of so many zero-days, especially the bad bad state actor level ones.If we are to move to a more abstracted and safer system, the ideas behind LLVM are just going to be a fact of life in years to come. The solution to this is to either fund greater LLVM integration (or similar that isn&#39;t on the scene yet) or accept the status-quo. I choose the former, but I sincerely hope the future direction leaves as few out in the cold as possible through the effort of smart people. But protecting hobbyists is a stretch goal in my mind compared to improving the security and privacy of the global interconnected world we&#39;re in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Don&#39;t know about crypto. But any open source package, ported to a new environment (one not explicitly tested by the maintainter) is going to have issues. That&#39;s the nature of software.E.g. I just added pnglib to an embedded assembly. Has a display among other things. Wanted to put compressed PNG images into (limited) flash, then decompress into (plentiful) RAM at boot.Of course pnglib didn&#39;t build for my environment. Never mind it has a C library. There are 50+ compile switches in pnglib, and I was setting them in a pattern that wasn&#39;t part of the tested configurations. It didn&#39;t even compile. Once it compiled (after some source changes) it didn&#39;t run. More source changes and it would run until it hit some endianness issues. Fix those, and it would do (just) what I wanted, which was to decompress certain PNG image formats with limited features, once.No problem. That was my goal, achieved. But at no time did I blame the maintainers for not anticipating my use case.I would say this: maintainers, flag compile-time options that aren&#39;t tried both ways in your test environments. To give me some chance of estimating how hard my job is going to be."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is absolutely unbelievable (and unforgivable) that a cash cow such as GTA V has a problem like this present for over 6 years and it turns out to be something so absolutely simple.I do not agree with the sibling comment saying that this problem only looks simple and that we are missing context.This online gamemode alone made $1 billion in 2017 alone.Tweaking two functions to go from a load time of 6 minutes to less than two minutes is something any developer worth their salt should be able to do in a codebase like this equipped with a good profiler.Instead, someone with no source code managed to do this to an obfuscated executable loaded with anti-cheat measures.The fact that this problem is caused by Rockstar&#39;s excessive microtransaction policy (the 10MB of JSON causing this bottleneck are all available microtransaction items) is the cherry on top.(And yes, I might also still be salty because their parent company unjustly DMCA&#39;d re3 (https://github.com/GTAmodding/re3), the reverse engineered version of GTA III and Vice City. A twenty-year-old game. Which wasn&#39;t even playable without purchasing the original game.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Holy cow, I&#39;m a very casual gamer, I was excited about the game but when it came out I decided I don&#39;t want to wait that long and I&#39;ll wait until they sort it out. 2 years later it still sucked. So I abandoned it. But.. this... ?! This is unbelievable. I&#39;m certain that many people left this game because of the waiting time. Then there are man-years wasted (in a way different than desired).Parsing JSON?! I thought it was some network game logic finding session magic. If this is true that&#39;s the biggest WTF I saw in the last few years and we&#39;ve just finished 2020.Stunning work just having binary at hand. But how could R* not do this? GTAV is so full of great engineering. But if it was a CPU bottleneck then who works there that wouldn&#39;t just be irked to try to nail it? I mean it seems like a natural thing to try to understand what&#39;s going on inside when time is much higher than expected even in the case where performance is not crucial. It was crucial here. Almost directly translates to profits. Unbelievable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is why I come to HN,  I was going to skip this because I thought it was about video games, but really glad to have read it, and loved every line of the article.So much to get from this.Even if you don&#39;t have the source, you can make a change if you are annoyed enough.If you don&#39;t like something, and the source code is out there, really go contribute.Performance matters, know how to profile and if using an external dependency, then figure out their implementation details.Algorithms &amp; Data structures matter, often I see devs talking about how it doesn&#39;t matter much but the difference between using a hashmap vs array is evident.Attentive code reviews matter, chances are they gave this to a junior dev/intern, and it worked with a small dataset and no one noticed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My observation is that much of industry does not care about any of these technical or security issues.In theory microservices are technical artifacts, but what they tend to be are cultural artifacts.Microservice adoption is often driven by cargo culting, or (better) a considered decision to work around a lack of organisational cohesion.What microservices let you do is ship your org chart directly, and also map back from some functionality to an owning team. You know who to page when there&#39;s a problem and it&#39;s easier to tell who is late delivering and whose code is slow. In cultures with &#34;lax&#34; technical leadership (aka no everyone uses same thing mandate, I&#39;m not judging) it lets teams use their favourite tools, for better or worse.Other org related things are the ability to have independent (per team) release schedules. Separable billing. Ability to get metrics on performance, cost and failures that can be used as indicators of team performance and promotion material. Microservices can also act as &#34;firewalls&#34;, limiting the impact a bad hire or team can have across your codebase.None of this is intended to be negative judgement; microservices can (among other things), help teams feel a sense of agency and ownership that can be hard to maintain as org size scales up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO this is a confused take on modularity. I think isolation and security are related concepts, but not what modules are for. Those things have to follow module boundaries, but they&#39;re not the goal of modules. For me, modules are about understanding; in order to use this code you don&#39;t need to read all of it, you just need to understand the interface. Modularity is for humans, not computers.They do often follow Conway&#39;s law, but that&#39;s not a desirable thing. Most modules are outside of that kind of context -- they&#39;re in libraries written by people you don&#39;t communicate with at all!I&#39;m interested in people&#39;s opinion here. I&#39;m also planning an article on the relationship between services and modularity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found this to be surprisingly interesting and novel - usually I expect to see really low quality content when it&#39;s a post about microservices, whether for or against the idea. This boils it down to isolation, which I myself have written about in a similar vein[0].&gt; at this point security people simply don&#39;t believe that any of the following (each one the very best technology available at the time) is totally safeTo be fair, we don&#39;t think anything is totally safe :) that&#39;s the point. Actually a lot of those things listed are why Chrome is so secure. I think this is a bit pessimistic about process isolation, which is actually quite powerful, but I get the point - there&#39;s no gap like an air gap.I prefer to think of monoliths and microservices as being completely unrelated ideas - they aren&#39;t on a spectrum of &#34;big to small&#34;, they&#39;re just two totally different ways of approaching software development. I might put &#34;monoliths&#34; closer to SOA, in that they both describe a very basic approach to a problem, whereas Microservices is not &#34;small services&#34; it&#39;s about bounded contexts, patterns, organizations, etc.Anyways, I appreciated this post.[0] https://www.graplsecurity.com/post/architecting-for-performa..."</p>

So, like:1. Search for something (either using / or *).2. Type ”cgn” in Normal mode (i.e. change next search match) and replace what you searched for with whatever3. Hammer on ”.” (i.e. repeat last command) to replace other matches.This replaces, like, 97% of uses of :s and is a much more convenient way to do search/replace, especially if you use * to search for the word under the cursor.

It will include key stakeholders/users/integrations, key technologies/protocols, key services/components and the high-level system landscape with key internal and external systems.Notice that a good diagram for this mixes a lot of different views and formal notations.The key idea is that you should strive to provide a skeleton on which your audience can place their understanding and fill in the blanks that they are interested in based on you explanation.If you try to put everything there or follow a formal model like UML you will drown out the key concepts in the noise of the details."</p>

It seemed that it was going to take forever to run, so I just wrote a short Go program to do the same thing (load two JSON files into a map[string]interface{}, cmp.Diff them) while it was going:https://gist.github.com/jrockway/73982949b3d2ce9b443528042c4...My program runs in less than 10 milliseconds (/usr/bin/time reports 0.00 seconds), and graphtage takes 5 minutes and 17 seconds.  I&#39;m 317,000x faster!  (Not including the time to write the program; if you do that, then it&#39;s about even assuming graphtage took 0 seconds to write.)Graphtage prints the entire file in JQ colors, with diffs inside fields colored red and green, which I love:    ...
    &#34;hostIP&#34;: &#34;10.136.13̟9̟2̶1̶.139̟1̶&#34;,
    &#34;podIP&#34;: &#34;10.244.1.18̟6̟7̶&#34;,
    ...

(My terminal can&#39;t display the dots under the numbers and the strikethrough, but it looks great on HN!  I really love it.)My program produces relatively boring line-by-line diffs:    -               &#34;hostIP&#34;:    string(&#34;10.136.121.131&#34;),

    +               &#34;podIP&#34;:     string(&#34;10.244.1.186&#34;),

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s insanely cool to see a non-IM use case built out on top of Matrix appearing (almost) out of the blue - congratulations :)The implementation currently freestyles a bit on the event format for the messages, which is somewhat our fault on the Matrix team for running horrifically late on MSC1767 (https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc176...) which proposes how to do rich custom event formats (e.g. blog posts) which are still renderable and visible to more generic Matrix clients (e.g. Element).  As a result, if you join a Hummingbard conversation via another Matrix client currently you can&#39;t see all the messages (or vice versa). However am hoping that Hummingbard might be a trailblazer for actually exercising MSC1767 in the wild and knocking it into shape, which would hugely benefit the whole Matrix ecosystem :)In terms of licenses, it depend on how you want the project to be used.  If you want folks to run it for personal use as a decentralised social network, I&#39;d personally go GPLv3 or AGPLv3.  If you want commercial folks to be able to build on it too, then Apache is probably the best bet.  copyleft + proprietary dual licensing is another option, but means you&#39;d need any contributors to agree to the dual licensing (could be tricky), and could be seen as not being in the spirit of the GPL.  that said, IANAL, YMMV.(At the risk of going somewhat off topic, another exciting Matrix client also appeared today: https://github.com/pixlwave/Watch-The-Matrix - the first native Matrix client for Apple Watch. https://youtu.be/Jh9iewrBdGQ)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What does it look like to actually write a program ontop of Matrix? Eg i have a key value store that i&#39;d like to use Matrix (or IPFS/etc) for the P2P layer. Is it a lot like IRC channels that you connect to, pushing data into them and getting data out from other clients in the same channel?Ie is it a series of messages? Or is it something more advanced; with built in conflict resolution or other P2P-y features?"</p>

It&#39;s all a _tiny_ bit blurry, being a long time ago, but I remember how he talked about three different perspectives for investing in stock:First, the &#34;company perspective&#34;. An investor would buy stock in a company they believed in. Maybe they had good products, or good management, or something else. The idea was looking at the how well the company would perform.Second, the &#34;stock perspective&#34;. An investor would ignore the underlying company, but look at the stock itself. It didn&#39;t really matter if the company was doing good, but only if the stock itself had good potential. The idea was looking at how well the stock would perform.Finally, the &#34;game perspective&#34;. An investor would not really care about the stock, but only about the behavior of other investors. Day trading would be the example here, profiting mainly on marketplace dynamics, no matter the stock. The idea was looking at how to be a better player than the others.Then he talked about how the game perspective was the only model that really matched the marketplace, and how the stock market had evolved from being place where people would invest in companies, to a place where they would play a game with other peopl."</p>

Top poker players are still gambling, but have an excellent understanding of the risks. Their skill doesn&#39;t turn them into investors. Gambling is taking a high risk bet. Whether the expected pay off is high enough to justify the risk and whether you can afford to lose the bet is a separate issue."</p>

The answer touches on the lottery.We care about not just the average case, we care about what might happen.Regarding Kelly criterion, there&#39;s a good reason why people don&#39;t used exactly the amount it says.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the hardest thing about being a parent today is the constant shame and confusion about the “right” way to do it. We don’t live in a hunter gatherer society anymore, we just don’t. There’s lots of wisdom in that way of life, and sure we could learn from it — but there’s enough anxiety as it is, parents don’t need more of it.We have three kids and we sleep trained them. (Not a pediatrician, standard disclaimer.) This article calls it an ‘extreme’ practice. For us, ‘extreme’ was the sleep deprivation we experienced with baby number one as we tried every ‘no cry’ method in the book. The baby cried and cried and cried. Once we started sleep training, there was a bit of crying and then - a sleeping baby! Through the night! Total amount of crying went from hours to zero. The kid became happier — they weren’t sleep-deprived anymore. And neither were we. I no longer felt like I was going to drop the ball due to extreme exhaustion.Babies two and three had the benefit of our experience, and they barely cried at all. The third one would lay down eyes-open and fall asleep. “So it actually does happen! — I thought the books must be lying.”By all objective measures our kids are happy, healthy, and well-adjusted. But that doesn’t mean we still don’t get the stink eye from people who think it’s a cruel practice.Just raise your kids with love. Be compassionate, and patient. Find a doctor you trust.

When you don&#39;t know whether a site will suddenly break or not, standard users will be implicitly trained to say yes to all dialogs.- Domain &#34;homogenizing&#34; (spoofing) services will win. Trackers that offer a widget you can install on your server will win. Facebook et all will still know where they sent you, and will be able to track you server side. If mozilla provide a centralized whitelist, then SSO providers who also provide trackers will win. Essentially, the big players will find a way, the little players (who users weren&#39;t worried about anyway) will still lose.- The web will break. SSO will be broken for a good couple of months on over 50% of websites using it - possibly more. &#34;This only works in Google Chrome&#34; will become more and more popular. Potentially, Firefox doesn&#39;t have the market share to make this work.Those of us who will stick with Firefox regardless are in for a world of pain, and not a lot of gain. I guess it&#39;s necessary to move the web on, but the pessimist in me doesn&#39;t see that happening any time soon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think what you want is essentially an entirely fresh browser session for every website you visit. Pretty mind-boggling to what lengths we need to go in order to prevent companies from tracking us. That said most tracking companies seem to have devised strategies to construct fingerprints from data like IP addresses, user-agent strings and any other meta-data they can get their hands on, so the next step will probably be to restrict what kind of information can be learned about the browser environment via JS (e.g. getting exact screen resolution).Also, data exfiltration via browser extensions is still not a solved problem, there are very popular extensions (Ghostery for example) that are highly privileged in the browser and often collect a ridiculous amount of data. Really can&#39;t get my head around why browser vendors still allow that while being so strict on all other forms of tracking."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This needs to be bypassed to use SSO, to bypass it the SSO providers site will need to ask for Storage Access, in some cases the user will be asked for permission…“After the user has granted access, Firefox will remember the storage permission for 30 days.”So lay users will get used to just clicking through and blindly granting the permission.The end result will be an additional step for trackers, and a bunch of headaches for all the legit services that get broken from this change.I’m all for less tracking but this doesnt seem like a good solution."</p>

It reminds me of the passage from &#34;Programming Sucks&#34; by Still Drinking [1]  Every programmer occasionally, when nobody’s home, turns off the lights, pours a glass of scotch, puts on some light German electronica, and opens up a file on their computer. It’s a different file for every programmer. Sometimes they wrote it, sometimes they found it and knew they had to save it. They read over the lines, and weep at their beauty, then the tears turn bitter as they remember the rest of the files and the inevitable collapse of all that is good and true in the world.

  This file is Good Code. It has sensible and consistent names for functions and variables. It’s concise. It doesn’t do anything obviously stupid. It has never had to live in the wild, or answer to a sales team. It does exactly one, mundane, specific thing, and it does it well. It was written by a single person, and never touched by another. It reads like poetry written by someone over thirty.

Google makes it seem like private browsing mode gives users more control of their data, Amanda Bonn, a lawyer representing users, told Koh. In reality, “Google is saying there’s basically very little you can do to prevent us from collecting your data, and that’s what you should assume we’re doing,” Bonn said.&#34;It doesn&#39;t seem like the complaint is that Chrome collects data on you in &#34;Incognito&#34; mode, rather that websites (e.g. Google Analytics) still collect on you in &#34;Incognito&#34; mode."</p>

Or if I got warnings when it took such actions?I think us tech folks need to, collectively, stop defending companies reasoning and explanations for the world they created, and start standing with and for a world which matches common folks expectations. It really seems like a better world.---EDIT: Ask what the layperson would think tracking is!

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I work on a 3-person DevOps team that just finished migrating ~20 services from GCE vms running docker-compose to GKE.It&#39;s taken us a little over a year. Partly because K8s has a steep learning curve, but also because safely transitioning services without disrupting product teams adds a lot of overhead.The investment is already yielding great returns. Developers are happy. Actual quote: &#34;Kubernetes is the biggest quality-of-life improvement I&#39;ve experienced in my career.&#34;The same is true for me as a DevOps engineer. I never have to write a script to orchestrate a rolling deployment ever again. I&#39;ll never have to touch Puppet or wrangle OS upgrades. I no longer need to use Terraform to scale out a service.Now that we&#39;ve completed this transition, one of my goals for the next year is to get the team to a place where we spend 75% of our time on higher-level projects -- working on developer tools and Kubernetes extensions and setting site reliability standards, instead of the firefighting and operational work that has traditionally taken up so much of our time. Couldn&#39;t be happier about this change.... That is until management decides we&#39;re overhead and fires us to free up budget for feature developers. ;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I understand their rationale. We manage thousand Kubernetes clusters and end-users can find lots and lots of creative way to shoot themselves in the foot:- I can store anything in a secret? Let&#39;s have thousands of cat images. Etcd then stops working because we have over 2GB of funny cats in the key store.- I can run a root Pod? Lets mount the docker socket and start building images with it. Oh and by the way, I never clean those up and my Node simply fills up. Also I add some additional docker networks that break Pod to Pod networks.- Istio is nice - why we don&#39;t add automatic injection for Pods in all namespaces? Including kube-system? And then they brick kube-proxy and the cluster stops working.- I can use validating webhooks for better security? Lets watch on all resources. To keep it more secure lets set the failure policy of the webhook to Fail, so we never admit any modification without the apiserver to make a call to out webhook. Whats that? My single replica webhook has was evicted from the Pod (we didn&#39;t add any resource requests and limits) and now it cannot even be created or scheduled because kube-controller-manager and kube-scheduler cannot update their lease and they lost leadership and now are idling, effectively bricking the entire cluster.Google would reduce the pain points with this change, however they would still face countless other issues with Kubernetes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember trying out docker sometime back in late 2013. Something about it never fully stuck with me. I always felt like the final boundary for a piece software should be the process, not the computer. Plopping an entire VM into a zipfile and saying &#34;here&#39;s your software&#34; felt like lazy engineering to many of us at the time (and still today).For our current stack, the answer has been to make the entire business application run as a single process. We also use a single (mono) repository because it is a natural fit with the grain of the software.As far as I am aware, there is no reason a single process cannot exploit the full resources of any computer. Modern x86 servers are ridiculously fast, as long as you can get at them directly. AspNetCore + SQLite (properly tuned) running on a 64 core Epyc serving web clients using Kestrel will probably be sufficient for 99.9% of business applications today. You can handle millions of simultaneous clients without blinking. Who even has that many total customers right now?Horizonal scalability is simply a band-aid for poor engineering in most (not all) applications. The poor engineering, in my experience, is typically caused by underestimating how fast a single x86 thread is and exploring the concurrent &amp; distributed computing rabbit hole from there. It is a rabbit hole that should go unexplored, if ever possible.Here&#39;s a quick trick if none of the above sticks: If one of your consultants or developers tells you they can make your application faster by adding a bunch of additional computers, you are almost certainly getting taken for a ride."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have thoughts, and I agree but also disagree a bit.We are in the dark-ages with respect to streaming sockets, and I am the architect of one of the worlds largest WebSocket and streaming services.First off, unseating the operational benefits provided by request response is a huge challenge. It&#39;s possible, and I&#39;ve done it. One of these days, my co-authors and I will present an OSDI paper with the broad strokes. It&#39;s very easy to list a lot of the challenges with scaling WebSocket, but each of them can be solved.I believe we will have a nicer world with QUIC --&gt; Http/3 and the up and coming WebTransport discussion. SADLY, that will result in a decade long &#34;caniuse&#34; issue, so we should expect to see WebTransport polyfills to arrive...Second, HTML over WebSockets is nice, but what is better is reactive data binding over the socket. Let the browser maintain a DOM tree that templates over a JSON object, then reactive-ly update and it&#39;s an amazing experience. You have minimal data transfer, and minimal rendering updates. There is a great deal of power in having your UI be a stateless function over a giant JSON object.Finally, the big challenge is dealing with the server state in a meaningful way. The exceptionally nice property of using request response for everything is the shared-nothing stateless nature of the web server. It&#39;s exceptionally forgiving in both operational and developer issues.It&#39;s very easy to fuck up the implicit state tied to the connection, and this requires discipline to get right. It&#39;s very easy to ship unreliable software that then has issues based on the connection.Now, I&#39;m a HUGE believer in that we need to use streams for everything, but it requires a mind shift. The key thing to tackle is dealing with the server side state, and this is where I have my shitty idea of a programming language for board games. In essence, I am building a DIY database such that people connect directly to the database and get that sweet giant JSON object along with a stream of updates.The DIY part is related to the fact that I invented a programming language to transact on the JSON object such that you get all the benefits of durability with the mental model of working within a single machine.http://www.adama-lang.org/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems like X Windows protocol over HTTPS with JSON as the wire encoding.It&#39;s sad to think how much effort is spent reimplementing technologies because the IPv4 address space wasn&#39;t large enough.If IP address space were larger, we wouldn&#39;t have needed to rely on Network Address Translation (NAT). NAT became a poor-man&#39;s firewall and effectively blocked peer-to-peer connections making it difficult to host a server at home. This incentivized early ISPs to offer only asymmetric connections that pushed users towards a consumer-only service that crippled early Internet protocols. With the World Wide Web being &#34;the&#34; reason people got on to the Internet in the first place, early NAT-enabled routers focused only on HTTP tunneling, so completed protocols that required inbound connections were finally killed off.Who would have thought that a small IP address space could result in a mass protocol extinction event from which only HTTP and HTML would survive...."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seams really optimistic and kind of glosses over the subject of scaling out websocket connections apart from this.Anecdotally, the typical single Rails server process seems to be perfectly happy supporting nearly 4,000 active connections. And you can easily swap in the excellent AnyCable to bump that up to around 10,000+ connections per node by not relying on the built-in Ruby WebSocket server.That&#39;s not a lot of connections on it&#39;s own.  If you are implementing a chat service you&#39;ll still need some form of pub/sub (or something) to glue all of that together when users connect to disparate nodes.AlsoHow about client-side validations? Easy. On every input change, round up the form values and send ’em down the WebSocket.That&#39;s just server side validation.As a disclaimer, I haven&#39;t used any of the HTML over WS frameworks the author discusses, but I&#39;ve spent a fair amount of time dealing with scaling socket connections.  It definitely makes the question of scaling horizontally more challenging.  I feel like this article really glosses over that aspect."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I read about Taler a few years back, and I&#39;m excited to see that it is still under development.In my opinion, for those of us who aren&#39;t anti-government, Taler represents an ethical future of digital spending:It is interoperable, so unlike our current Visa situation, the free market should be able to bid down payment fees to a fair rate. It&#39;s insane to me that Visa and Mastercard have basically positioned themselves as exclusive middlemen on the vast majority of digital transactions, in an age when so much commerce necessarily is digital.It offers privacy that Visa / PayPal / etc cannot.It makes income traceable in a way that bitcoin does not, to facilitate lawful taxation.It is inherently scalable in a way that bitcoin arguably is not (bitcoin has offchain scaling mechanisms, sure, but if you&#39;re being honest it&#39;s a stretch)It&#39;s not introducing a new currency or coin that will be endlessly speculated on, unlike most every crypto solution out there (even stablecoins rely on eth or others for transaction fees)"</p>

Firmware and drivers always end up more difficult to deal with than expected.The Fairphone company was surprised by difficulties upgrading and patching android without support from their BSP vendor, causing many months delays of updates _and_ years shorter support life than they were planning for their earlier models.I purchased the Purism Librem 13 laptop from their kickstarter, and they had great plans for firmware and drivers, but also great difficulty following through. The trackpad chosen for the first models took much longer than expected to get upstream linux support, and it was never great (it turned out to be impossible to reliably detect their variant automatically). They finally hired someone with sufficient skill to do the coreboot port _months_ after initial units were delivered, and delivered polished coreboot firmware for their initial laptops _years_ after they started the kickstarter.So, why should we have confidence in the firmware and drivers that Framework will deliver :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interestingly it was very clear at around $10MM ARR that DO was on a trajectory to IPO. You can thank Moisey Uretsky for a fantastic product idea and his brother Ben for CEOing it for so long. Congratulations to everyone who was involved in building DigitalOcean, it was an INCREDIBLY wild ride in the early days, lots of chaos but through all the chaos and disfunction, I think everyone involved knew this day would come.Personally I&#39;m really proud of the work we did, and I&#39;m overjoyed to have been part of building a business that is going to be a public company.  Thanks to the HN community for being so supportive over the years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love DigitalOcean. The simplicity of their UI, friendly CLI tooling and (as a hosted k8s customer) the frequency of updates to their offerings.BUT:1. Their web UI stability is terrible (constantly hangs and errors out)2. Their hosted DB IOPS aren&#39;t competitive with other PaaS providers. There&#39;s also no way to scale DB size dynamically without upgrading to a new price tier which is overkill.3. Their Kubernetes Control Plane scaling is obfuscated. I had to contact support to realize that the control plane nodes are somehow tied to the size of your node pool when you create the cluster? That&#39;s not documented anywhere and was the cause of many control plane timeouts.4. No ALIAS dns record, no way to serve Spaces from an apex domain. (I know this is a vendor specific implementation but it&#39;s table stakes imo)Again, I&#39;m a (mostly) happy DO customer and wish them the best but if they really want to be seen on the same level as AWS or GCP in terms of some parity, they need to include some of these QoL features."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Congrats to DO.Really like the direction DO is going. Which is something in between millions of small VPS firm and giant like AWS. It also forced Linode to React. And proved the space in Cloud Hosting exist, which company like Vultr and UpCloud are now joining. And I think their features are finally close to hitting the perfect spot. With all the essential like DBaS, Object Storage and K8s.They have also ( finally ) introduced AMD EPYC CPU, ( no more explicit mention of Intel CPU on their homepage ). Which is good for their margin since price / core count are cheaper.So DO today is something I would like as an AWS competitor in 2016.  And they are finally here. I am not sure if there are any other low hanging fruit at all. Or what features I would want for a company competing at this space. It will be things that people dont see, like CPU performance, SSD Performance, Services Reliability, Interconnect, Better Network, More Locations, security improvement....There are only two suggestions I could think on top of my head right now.First is the pricing structure and list. It is getting very messy and AWS like. SSD Storage variant should be a simple calculable option, not an extra line on pricing table that tries to bombard me with extra information. And I know Basic Droplet are burst-able CPU resources, but not showing they are vCPU ( a Single Thread ) and calling them CPU doesn&#39;t really rhymes with me.Second is Full BareMetal Monthly option. Something like vultr [1] is offering. I am not sure if below $100 is feasible. Basically it  should be something that offer much better price / performance at a monthly payment that pushes people with low spending to metal for baseline load with headroom as insurance. Pushing up Average User Spending.  It should also be attractive to small business. ( Although arguably Linode and Vultr has yet to expand or launch Metal seems to suggest otherwise )[1] https://www.vultr.com/products/bare-metal/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here&#39;s a crazy idea: Don&#39;t use analytics at all but focus on your product. If your success relies solely on &#34;improving conversions&#34; by tracking your users and then changing the position and color of your &#34;Checkout&#34; button then maybe try setting yourself apart such that customers want to buy your product even despite an obnoxious purchasing flow. Only then start optimizing it.More serious thoughts: Google Analytics introduces performance overhead for your website and now you have to explain to your users which third party is responsible for processing their data on top of yourself. Why introduce those headaches? Are the insights from Analytics really valuable enough to justify the cost? I personally haven&#39;t seen it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After a recent story on HN about all the horrible tracking Disqus started to do after being acquired by an ad-tech company, I ditched it and Google Analytics on my semi-dormant personal website.  The process of fixing it got me interested in working on my site again and I ended up upstreaming the patches into the Hugo theme I use[1], so now everyone with that theme can benefit easily.  I ended up using GoatCounter[2] after examining several alternatives in the market, predominantly because it was free for personal sites, but also because it was very no-frills which is all I really needed.  I also appreciated that I could control retention rate and other configuration that might affect my visitor&#39;s privacy to collect as minimal amount of information as possible.I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with having basic site analytics, but I appreciate that there are now alternatives to Google Analytics that don&#39;t try to do the pervasive tracking that&#39;s become commonplace online.[1]: https://tristor.ro/blog/2021/02/05/ditching-google-analytics...[2]: https://www.goatcounter.com/"</p>

Amazon has installed a mailbox at their facility, this mail piece specifically says to use it.AND this mail piece says &#39;BE DONE by 3/1&#39; when workers have until the end of the month to vote (context: amazon must stop anti-union mandatory meetings etc during voting).This could be a legal violation &amp; is a big deal. I think at a minimum breaks the spirit of the NLRB mail-in voting ruling.HN seems to consider big tech = oppressive surveillance. I&#39;ll let you draw your own conclusions.This is also the latest in a long list of extreme tactics some aren&#39;t mentioned in this article. To name a few:Amazon also fired an activist who was speaking out. It&#39;s been reported Amzn has been penalizing pro-union employees with baseless and unfair management penalties/&#39;strikes&#39; and purposeful last minute over-time demands as punishment. Digital surveillance. Management basically stalking associates in break rooms, asking if they are only there to organize and attorneys and consultants drawing graph person relationship research charts to map their employees. A big propaganda push online &amp; a pretty successful press drive - most of these articles Amazon gets many inches of positive talking points.https://www.vox.com/2019/3/22/18277322/amazon-fired-warehous...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Full disclosure: I&#39;ve always been anti-union for my own personal approach to life. I do see the value in unions, I&#39;ve just always, to this point, been a go-it-alone-and-fight-my-own-battles kind of person. I don&#39;t want to be beholden to a union or their rules any more than I want to be beholden to an employer beyond my contractual obligations for which I&#39;m paid.That said, people should take note of what happened when Walmart used these tactics. Employees then went on to suffer such things as zero hour contracts, contracts where time was just shy of the legal requirement to give them benefits, pay was no more than the minimum required in any given state/province and people became slaves to their jobs because they couldn&#39;t afford the time off to find other jobs because then they wouldn&#39;t be able to make ends meet or there were no other jobs so Walmart had zero incentive to pay any more than absolutely required to by law. etc. etc. etc. because humanity is only afforded if legally required [which I personally find disgusting].These are tactics to prevent a coalition of employees from having their rights heard and maintained... even with this coalition someone is fighting to maintain and win your rights(!!!!!) There&#39;s something very wrong with anyone having to fight for their rights to be given, but that&#39;s another discussion. In a commercial environment that allow employers to behave this way, where the only advantage to winning your rights is in a coalition of the workforce holding employers to account, unions absolutely must not only be allowed but must also be protected.Its okay if you&#39;re bullheaded enough or within your means enough to walk away if your rights aren&#39;t given fair consideration and honoured, but if you&#39;re in a position where you&#39;re a prisoner to your job, i.e. can&#39;t afford to take time off to find another job/other income, or there are no other jobs in your area and you don&#39;t have the means to leave etc. you don&#39;t have any bargaining chip.No employer should ever have the privilege of keeping you prisoner, nor preventing you from having a means to bargain for your very right to fair treatment.Amazon needs to be severely reprimanded for this and taught a lesson about what it means to honour employees&#39; rights."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a Shopify partner through 3 years, paying 20% of my revenue to Shopify, and every time I have been in contact with &#34;partner support&#34; it has been, to put it mildly, an underwhelming experience.You have to argue your way through an army of outsourced supporters who are equipped with nothing but the public Shopify docs, until you get to a real employee who concludes it with a &#34;sorry, but we can&#39;t help&#34;.Some of my issues:1. If you&#39;re not American, you will be forced to hand over 3% of your 80% revenue cut to PayPal. (Unless your MRR cut is &gt;$30k)2. Sometimes Shopify just kills features, which merchants and partners rely on. Sure, we get a notice that the API will change - but how does that help, when there is no alternative way to achieve the removed functionality? I was lucky enough to get through to someone who knew someone at the dev team, but the response was once again &#34;sorry, you&#39;re not a priority&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They don&#39;t understand the model where SaaS businesses use Shopify as a billing channel on top of their own subscription model, it&#39;s all or nothing - they assume that anything in the app store can only use Shopify billing if the user installs via Shopify, which is fair but their billing API has glaring issues:- App Charges get added to clients bills, you&#39;re not getting paid right away (60+ days in some cases) vs getting paid instantly- If someone doesn&#39;t pay their Shopify bill, tough shit you&#39;re not getting paid- Got fraudulent accounts billing via Shopify? They can use your app then never pay anything - fun- Want to do refunds? Too bad there&#39;s no way to do it via the API you have to manually email Shopify then they apply an App Credit (not even a refund) for the customer, then you email them back- Uninstalling the Shopify App cancels billing, so you lose complete control of your normal downgrade process- Payments come via PayPal bi monthly :(There&#39;s plenty more, but you&#39;re basically losing all the upside of Stripe in exchange for the App Store promotion of your app."</p>

Looking through NginX documentation at http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html I don&#39;t see anything (e.g. under proxy_hide_header) to say it&#39;s sometimes not applied, and there doesn&#39;t appear to be any option to prevent this blind forwarding.I would never have expected the backend to receive invalid HTTP from NginX, but more importantly it&#39;s not uncommon for backends to send an extra header or two to tell NginX how to serve the response, with NginX removing those headers before serving.How do you even handle this properly?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hiii everyone, this is my first time posting here! I have read Hacker News sometimes but only thought about sharing my own post after seeing Manara&#39;s post (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25849054) last month. I asked them if I can share this here and they said it was a good idea. :)I’m a 19-year-old Gazan female who participated in Manara last year and got internships at Google and Repl.it. I’m so excited I will spend this summer at Google in Europe! I got lots of questions about my experience when people heard about it on Facebook so I wrote this blog post to let other young engineers in Palestine and the Middle East know how they can get into amazing companies like this too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I interviewed Dalia and a few other people referred to us by Manara at Repl.it. It was such a pleasure meeting kids that are so smart and have an insane drive.We have a really high bar for hiring at Repl.it, Dalia and the other youngsters from Palestine performed better than at least half the experienced engineers I&#39;ve interviewed in the past. We extended an offer to one Dalia&#39;s classmates and he started yesterday as an intern with high potential for full-time, as our internships usually are since we invest a lot in them.It was such a pleasure meeting you Dalia, wish you all the best. Hope to work with you in the future (maybe when we can offer US visas).P.S. We&#39;re still hiring"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"First of all - big props to Dalia. She clearly worked her behind off to earn those offers.Second - this definitely, to me, proves that Manara has a good business model. I actually don&#39;t think the fact that the Manara students are from MENA is all that important though. However, I do think that their extremely hands-on, and intensive &#34;bootcamp for FAANG interviewing&#34; model is clearly an advantage for early career technical candidates.Thinking back to my college days (in the US, mid 2010s) - we were not given any sort of class that focused on professional interviewing. The college career center was also very general, and not knowledgeable about the specifics of passing the coding interviews. The best advice I got was a recommendation from a guest lecturer to read &#34;cracking the coding interview&#34; (which to be fair, was better than nothing).As a result, the people from my school who did the best right out of the gate, were largely people who already knew people already in a FAANG roles and who could rely on that person for a referral, interview advice and practice feedback. Our school was not in SV (or anywhere close), so realistically, that was not an option for most of us. Additionally, I always applied for internships at FAANG companies while I was still a student - but never even got called in to interview - so it wasn&#39;t like I could practice that way either. I ended up doing fine for myself by accumulating a good base of practical experience from local non-FAANG companies before graduating, but I really believe my peers, and aspirational novice engineers of all backgrounds would have benefited greatly from having a hands-on course like Dalia described. I especially would love to see efforts like that extending out to under-served communities here in the US as well (native american reservations, appalachians, rust belt cities)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not much better if you end up being a GCP customer.My company has gone through 4 reps in 3 years. Every time we get a new GCP rep they just want to talk to us about &#34;expanding our use of GCP offerings&#34;. The only thing they want to talk about is starting to use BigQuery - not my business at all.I signed up for a Google Cloud Security summit, and afterwards a sales rep reached out me. It was obvious from the start they had no idea I was a gsuite or GCP customer. They then directed me to a NEW account manager (#4) even though I had been working with a different one. I had worked with the prior account rep going over our architecture to make sure everything was kosher (sustained use discounts etc). I even made them a schematic of our architecture on GCP at their request. Once I provided that to them I was met with radio silence.It&#39;s really insulting, and to me obvious they don&#39;t care about my company at all. We&#39;re looking at other options.I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if somehow this post leads to me getting an email from another rep &#34;Wanting to start over and doing things right&#34;, which will inevitably devolve into the discussion of how can I use BigQuery."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Title should maybe be switched to &#34;Google Cloud vs AWS Onboarding Comparison for YC companies&#34;.Not to say that isn&#39;t a useful article on its own, but it&#39;s hard to draw too many meaningful conclusions for the rest of us when the first line of the AWS bullet points is &#34;reach out to dedicated YC email&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to be a huge fan of GCP and bet on it to power my startup, and have come to greatly regret it.Recently, I needed to increase a CPU-limit quota from a small number (like 16 vCPUs to 64 vCPUs) - nothing crazy. In the past, the quota increase system was more or less automated and would only take a few minutes to process.This time, however, GCP denied my quota increase and forced me to schedule a call with a sales rep in order to process the quota increase. It was the biggest waste of time and kind of goes against the entire point of instant cloud resizing.It also feels like the velocity of new features, instance types, etc has slowed down dramatically in the past year. Also, while I&#39;m ranting, Google Cloud SQL is probably the worst cloud service I&#39;ve ever used  (and it costs an arm and a leg for the pleasure!)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The saddest thing about all of this IMO is they have been working on this for 14 years, and how much money was spent/wasted? Now, read about Skunkworks - they were able to build the SR71 (without supercomputers) in less than half that time and for a fraction of the cost.This isn&#39;t just planes, this seems to be everything nowadays. Fission was discovered in 1938/1939 and we dropped two bombs on Japan in 1945. No chance we could do something like that in this toxic environment of today.I know Peter Thiel is not popular here, but his conversations about technological progress seem to be spot on: we just cant build cool shit anymore. I really did want a flying car, and all I have is 140 characters and promises of AI that never come true.Maybe, you could say there are some exceptions like CRISPR, but that is TBD."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Putting aside the good-plane/bad-plane discussion, this program is the poster child for one of my pet wishes: that the costs of government programs would be expressed in $/tax-payer.  There are about 100M tax payers in the US; this program is expected to cost about $1,500,000M; so the F35 program is expected to cost about $15,000 per tax payer.  True: that&#39;s over 50 years; still, un-discounted, that&#39;s $300/year/tax-payer.The Covid bailout last year was about $60,000 per tax payer (https://www.covidmoneytracker.org/).  How much of your $60,000 did you see?I&#39;m not arguing for or against these programs; I&#39;m arguing for expressing them in comprehensible terms.  $6,000,000,000,000 societal total; or $60,000 for you.  Do you expect to receive $15,000 of value from the F35 program?  I&#39;m not sure I won&#39;t: perhaps it&#39;ll keep oil/energy prices stable and I spent well more than $300/year on energy..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“The F-35 has failed” is a strong statement that depends on what your definition of success is. Did it fail because it couldn’t replace the F-16? Did it fail because it’s expensive and bloated?Do those things even matter?I’m not defending the F-35 but anyone deeply and intimately familiar with the platform knows and understands that it is a Ferrari. You don’t bring your Acura TSX to a Formula 1 race track to win a race. Just like you don’t bring your Ferrari to the farm to haul material (not anymore anyways).The F-35 may be a Ferrari; but the thing about Ferraris is that their technology trickles down. Now we have electric cars with carbon fiber shells. The same is true for the F-35. The technology inside it has and will lead to the resurrection and long standing use of older planes like the B1 and U2. Where the airframe is solid but the tech and stealth is not. It will also lead to revolutionary new planes which are cheaper to make and build.Through the F35s use of distributed computing and treating hardware components and their software as services, we’re not going to be doomed to the same fate as the F16 where we can’t find hardware. Instead, we’ll have more component oriented aircraft systems where each aircraft is no bespoke and can use from a menu of technologies.So did the F35 fail because we spent too much? Depends on how much it saves us later.Did it fail because it didn’t replace the F16? What if it makes the F16 viable again? Did it still fail?Some may see this as a slippery slope. What matters is the objective outcome that comes from this project. Not the success criteria some folks have perpetuated or thrust upon the project."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lots of nostalgia about Fry’s here. Well, I have a different take. Fry’s was my first job, and my first introduction to wage slavery. They never at any point cared about employee health or well-being. Breaks were the state minimum. Pay was the state minimum. The entire staff (and there were hundreds back in the day, when the checkout line would back up into the store even with 20 registers open) shared one 7x7 beige break room. It looked like something from Prison Architect, just an old tube TV with bent bunny ears (you weren’t allowed to turn it on though, it was for training) and the stale smell of cigarette smoke. Knowledge was irrelevant, it was all about sales. SPIFs (bounty-style sales commissions) and revenue ruled the day. Aside from that, the owners didn’t care; cliques and in-groups ruled hiring and firing in the absence of leadership. Stores were always falling apart even when they were new. I don’t think anything over 7’ up was ever dusted; even 20 years ago, it was so thick in some places you couldn’t see the paint. The repair bar employees would regularly rifle through customers’ hard drivers and keep the juciest pictures.Just another cynical retail empire, pumped hard and drained dry by its owners while the foundation rotted from below. May they build condos on its grave."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m not surprised, but this makes me feel incredibly sad. I built my first PC using parts from there. I’m going to miss it.But once Fry’s pivoted to be a consignment store that was mostly empty and selling pallets of bottled water and perfume, it was obvious the business was about to die.Curiously, Microcenter has managed to live on and seems fairly robust. I can’t help but think Fry’s tried to sell too many different products and had a massive amount of floorspace to keep up. Whereas my local Microcenter just sticks to electronics and the store is much smaller and feels cramped in comparison."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I graduated college in 1985 and moved cross country to Sunnyvale for work. Fry&#39;s was a supermarket chain, and at the time there was one and only one location that was trying out carrying computer stuff, on the east side of Lawrence Ave I think, before they moved to the west side of Lawrence.They weren&#39;t yet fully committed to it. Half the store was produce and such -- milk, eggs, lettuce, etc, and the other half was rows of TTL parts, memory chips, diodes, capacitors, and resistors. It blew my mind. I bought a 68000 CPU, 128KB of DRAM chips (64Kx1 density back then), a perf board, wirewrap wire and a wrapping tool, EPROMs, sockets, and built my first computer all from parts I bought at that Fry&#39;s.About 60 seconds away from Fry&#39;s was Computer Literacy -- a really great bookstore that, as the name implies, had nothing but computer related books. It wasn&#39;t 20 copies of &#34;Computers for Dummies&#34; books. The vast majority of inventory were single copies of the most arcane stuff -- all sorts of college level CS textbooks, and you could ask the desk to order just about anything if you knew the title of it.I sent a lot of money and time in both locations. Silicon Valley felt like a magical place back then."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve always wanted to write a book. I have helped write 3  different deeply technical books (and one solutions manual), but I wanted something fun, interesting, and valuable.So I wrote &#34;Everyday Data Science&#34; which is a collection of stories, tutorials, jokes, math, and code all written to inspire people to analyze their personal data.In general, I was also inspired by the challenge to &#34;make $100 online&#34; which I have done in the past month since launching. It was daunting, and I felt quite vulnerable, but overall I&#39;m pleased with what I&#39;ve made.I wrote up this quick post to give you an idea of the process I followed to write the book, and some of the content.I&#39;d love to know your thoughts and am open to (nice) feedback :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"@andrewncThe book looks very intriguing! Before buying it, I wish I could read a bit more about what one could expect from the book. Let me explain :)&gt; This book is for people as untechnical as my Mom or as technical as my Applied Scientist friends working in big tech.&gt; ODEs On A DietDo you present an intuitive explanation of ODEs? Would both your mom and an Applied Scientist find it informative? If yes, I would love to read! A few pages from this chapter would really help in making a purchasing decision.&gt; a solution to Multi-Armed Bandit problems which are significantly more efficient and only takes a few lines of extra code.Does the book include code samples? As someone wanting to learn about, e.g., ODEs through code, I would love it code samples were present in the book.I understand that $7.99 is not a lot in the US, but it is not the case in a few other parts of the world. Given that there are no refunds, having more information about the book would be valuable for international customers.BUT... the books looks great, and big congratulations on publishing it!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you like stocks and are careful with the way you spend your money, you know how much time goes into buying shares of a stock. It’s tedious and I don’t have 24k for a Bloomberg terminal. Which led me to the idea during xmas break to spend the time creating my own terminal. I introduce you to “Gamestonk Terminal” (probably should’ve sent 1 tweet everyday to Elon Musk for copyrights permission eheh).In summary, the Terminal (https://github.com/DidierRLopes/GamestonkTerminal) has 7 distinct menus:
- Discover Stocks
Top gainers; Sectors performance; upcoming earnings releases; top high shorted interest stocks; top stocks with low float; top orders on fidelity; and some SPAC websites with news/calendars.- Market Sentiment
Scrolling through Reddit main posts, and most tickers mentions; Extracting stocktwit sentiment based on bull/bear flags; Twitter in-depth sentiment prediction using AI; Google mentions over time.- Research Web pages
List of good pages to do research on a stock, e.g. macroaxis, zacks, macrotrends, ..- Fundamental Analysis
Read financials from a company from Market Watch, Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, and Financial Modeling Prep API.- Technical Analysis
The usual technical indicators: sma, rsi, macd, adx, bbands, and more.- Due Diligence
Some features are: Latest news of the company; Analyst prices and ratings; Price target from several analysts plot over time vs stock price; Insider activity, and these timestamps marked on the stock price historical data; Latest SEC fillings; Short interest over time; A check for financial warnings based on Sean Seah book.- Prediction Techniques
The one I had more fun with. It tries to predict the stock price, from simple models like sma and arima to complex neural network models, like LSTM. The additional capability here is that all of these are easy to configure. Either through command line arguments, or even in form of a configuration file to define your NN."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The biggest thing you pay for in the Bloomberg Terminal is the chat function, which lets you talk to other people who also have $25,000 a year to spend on a Bloomberg Terminal.But this is still pretty cool :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is it just me, or is the feel of the comment on this post different than other HN posts? There are a lot more snarky jokes. A little more combative. It feels like why I stopped reading Reddit. I hope it doesn’t metastasize to posts on other topics."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For the non-lawyers: as the article indicates (but doesn’t really explain), this is a ruling on a request for temporary relief (called a “preliminary injunction”). This is not a final judgment. It can (and presumably will) also be subject to appeal. Nothing remotely final about this. The judge has simply said: “CA, you can go ahead and enforce your law for now.”Now, this does also mean the judge would quite likely ULTIMATELY rule in CA’s favor. But it is not a guarantee. And, as I said, then there’s appellate and Supreme Court review.For reference, the 4-element test/standard for a preliminary injunction generally accepted in US courts is set out here:“[G]enerally a plaintiff seeking preliminary injunctive relief must satisfy a four-factor test: (1) that he or she is likely to succeed on the merits of his claims; (2) that he or she is likely to suffer irreparable harm without preliminary relief; (3) the balance of equities between the parties support an injunction; and (4) the injunction is in the public interest.”https://www.americanbar.org/groups/litigation/committees/wom..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m hopeful as the judge seems to understand the ISP strategy:&gt; Mendez reportedly was not swayed by ISPs&#39; claims that a net neutrality law isn&#39;t necessary because they haven&#39;t been blocking or throttling Internet traffic.&gt; &#34;I have heard that argument and I don&#39;t find it persuasive,&#34; Mendez said, according to The Hollywood Reporter. &#34;It&#39;s going to fall on deaf ears. Everyone has been on their best behavior since 2018, waiting for whatever happened in the DC Circuit [court case over the FCC&#39;s repeal of net neutrality]. I don&#39;t place weight on the argument that everything is fine and we don&#39;t need to worry.&#34;"</p>

I would never work for a platform that promotes this or want to subject someone to being monitored like this.Can you really not ask the client questions before submitting a proposal either?Is all this just taking advantage of freelancers who don&#39;t know how to market themselves, or am I missing something?For all the freelance projects I&#39;ve found myself, some detailed discussion was required beforehand to check what the client really needs, and I aim for terms that don&#39;t lead to being micromanaged (like fixed price projects based on results not time) so I can&#39;t see the appeal."</p>

I&#39;m sure many people find their next job through LinkedIn, but it baffles me why LinkedIn would even exist today, being an social network, communication platform, a portfolio, and all of them in a very awkward position, and not being very good at any of them.

Top rate I’ve paid I think is some close to or just over $100/hour, so it’s definitely not just for low-end stuff.I’ve learned (the hard way) about being very, very clear with deliverables and expectations. Based on the average response I get on Upwork, it would seem the median buyer is much more susceptible to contractors blowing smoke. So one has to be careful.But overall, as several hundred thousand dollars client over the years, it’s been a godsend."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"D3.js is, to me, one of those tools that makes things possible rather than making things easy (although I only use javascript once every year or two so it&#39;s always a slog). This is big: it&#39;s like a zero-to-one step, rather than incremental progress.This fall I made an interactive visualization of the fine-grained plate tectonic model I have built for the Himalaya and Tibet for a research project[0].  The model building process (i.e., finding the relative motions of the plates) is largely solving a system of linear equations, so it&#39;s not immediately apparent what the results really mean and whether they are acceptably realistic.D3.js allows me to explore and understand my own scientific results so much more thoroughly than the static quiver plots that I was making in Matplotlib--being able to pan and zoom a globe (not just a projected map!) and see the tectonic plates move through time is phenomenal. Being able to share the results so trivially as a web page is a huge force multiplier as well.Thanks so much, Mike![0]: http://rocksandwater.net/blog/2020/11/tibet-blocks-js/"</p>

Some people just have unbelievable drive.In other news, I’ve enjoyed using D3 over the years, and always jump on visualization projects as a result. Here’s my favorite thing I’ve made while I was learning D3:  https://www.jwilber.me/permutationtest/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don’t think it’s bad advice but having shipped multiple (really bad) games, I think it misses the two biggest/best pieces of advice I’ve gotten:
1. GDDs are probably a distraction if you’re a solo dev - prototyping and grayboxing a lot and looking for the fun mechanics without any art/music/story to get in the way or distract is essential 
2. If you’re truly just starting (and don’t already have a sense of fun), absolute best way to start is to carbon-copy a game you find fun, then start adding/tweaking elements. 
This both builds the mindset required to make games, and helps you get into the “fun iteration” loop quickly without getting bogged down in writing a lot of interesting technical systems that don’t end up contributing to the game in a meaningful way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve written some learnings after shipped my first game: https://ruoyusun.com/2018/06/15/guide-for-non-game-dev.htmlAs a professional software dev, I&#39;ve noticed that while both game dev and software dev are &#34;writing code&#34;, they are done in a very different way.As a software dev, the value proposition is more or less clear before you start writing code. As a game dev, you can only start to see your value proposition after you have finished your code - that&#39;s why game code, especially as an indie without clear distinction between prototype and production phase, tend to become spaghetti really quick - and that&#39;s fine. If you spend too much time to make the code look nice, then you are not spending enough time to make the game actually fun.Software usually has some logic behind it - it has to make &#34;sense&#34;. A game doesn&#39;t necessarily have to make sense - it needs to &#34;feel right&#34; and &#34;fun&#34;. That means your nicely designed abstractions actually won&#39;t be reusable - copy &amp; paste is much more pragmatic. You can start to look to refactor after your game is actually successful (or fun at least) but even then you will realize that most of the code is not reusable.A big part of your game code is actually &#34;content&#34;, instead of &#34;systems&#34; - meaning they are closer to a &#34;script&#34; than a well architectured software code. So you write more if-else and less inheritance and encapsulation (unless you are writing your own engine, then in that case, your engine code is actually close to software projects).And if you hate writing UI for software, you&#39;ll hate writing UI for games even more."</p>
