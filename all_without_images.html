They could conquer the world, but their licences were not open enough at the critical time, and technically inferior but open Linux ate their lunch, along with the dinner."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t understand how the &#34;everything is a file&#34; could apply for everything in practice. For example, Linux has ioctl(), which in practice are like a side channel. Granted, Linux doesn&#39;t apply this API philosophy too thoroughly.I guess the &#34;everything is a file&#34; might have multiple meanings. For example:(1) Everything is represented by a (file) descriptor(2) Same as (1) and the descriptor has a file-like API (think read(), seek(), write(), etc.)(3) Everything is an &#34;byte addressable blob of bytes&#34;Meaning (1) is OK. But it doesn&#39;t tell nothing about the API the (file) descriptor itself would use. It could be a fixed set (like meaning (2)), or be variable depending on something else (like the (file) descriptor type).Meaning (2) looks like too restrictive and inefficient to me and is the one I really have trouble accepting as a general OS primitive.Meaning (3) surely can&#39;t be used for everything in practice, right? It&#39;s just to generic like &#34;every computer architecture can be emulated by a universal turing machine.&#34; And it also seems too inefficient. But it could be very useful if the blob of bytes had an API like (2) or any other, including having an API depending of the &#34;file type&#34;.Is option (3) that folks are meaning when talking about &#34;everything is/should be a file&#34;?EDIT: formatted the meaning list correctly."</p>

    Please do not ask further questions about this, as doing so may result in your account being banned by the admins.

    Please do not discuss this incident on Reddit publicly or privately (e.g. on private subreddits and/or in private messages, chat etc.), as doing so may result in your account being banned by the admins.

I fully understand and agree that the platform is privately owned, etc. etc., but this is getting strange(r) -- and quite normalized."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"HN is also penalising threads that discuss this. This post has 74 upvotes in 27 minutes and 11 comments at time of writing. Ordinarily it would significantly outrank most of the other posts on the front page, but it doesn&#39;t seem to be able to break past #15. Either this is because HN users are flagging it, or because something else is going on. As Reddit is a YC company it&#39;d be really nice to hear an explanation.This exact same thing happened with the previous threadshttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26554697andhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26556187There are some awful transphobic comments in those threads, but they appeared _after_ the threads had been penalised."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The irony is that I almost certainly would have zero idea who this person was or the existence of this controversy were it not for this crackdown.On one hand I can empathize with people seeing someone they know have negative press about them shared on a site they run and wanting to do something. But I thought the point of professionalism was refraining from this kind of behavior and applying rules consistently even when there is a personal connection. This kind of special-case behavior in favor of people with ties to the site is likely counter productive."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wish there was a solution for those of us who develop web interfaces for embedded products designed to live on LAN, often without any internet access and no well defined domain name.I&#39;m all for HTTPS everywhere but right now for my products it&#39;s either: https with self-signed certificate, which basically makes any modern browser tell its user that they&#39;re in a very imminent danger of violent death should they decide to proceed, or just go with good old HTTP but then you hit all sorts of limitations, and obviously zero security.I wish there was a way to opt into a &#34;TOFU&#34; https mode for these use cases (which is how browser dealt with invalid HTTPS certificates for a long time), although I realize that doing that without compromising the security of the internet at large might be tricky.If somebody has a solution, I&#39;m all ears. As far as I can tell the &#34;solution&#34; employed by many IoT vendors is simply to mandate an internet connection and have you access your own LAN devices through the cloud, which is obviously a privacy nightmare. But it&#39;s HTTPS so your browser will display a very reassuring padlock telling you all is fine!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That makes a lot of sense. HTTPS adoption is now very high[1], and this might push it a little bit further for sites that don&#39;t redirect to HTTPS automatically. I&#39;ve been using Firefox in the experimental HTTPS-only mode, and the web is quite usable without cleartext HTTP.[1] https://transparencyreport.google.com/https/overviewIt&#39;s not a big change from security perspective though. HTTP requests shouldn&#39;t be getting cookies any more, and the redirect isn&#39;t revealing anything new (not until we get DoH + ESNI). You still need HSTS preload to defend against active downgrade attacks.An interesting side effect of the change is that sites won&#39;t have have a working HTTP redirect any more. Inevitably, there will be sites that let their HTTP versions rot and break, which will eventually force all other web clients to default to HTTPS for web-compatibility."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26549307">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an example of a common antipattern in software: some piece of software fails to correctly implement something (here, modern HTML autocomplete=&#34;cc-exp-year&#34;), and another piece of software goes through all kinds of contortions to work with incorrect or incomplete implementations with the result that it now behaves undesirably with a third piece of software. Specifically, 1Password has to do complicated guesses of what to fill where because many sites don&#39;t set autocomplete properly, so inevitably it will guess wrongly sometimes.Other examples are problems with lock files and file versioning (because programs tried to roll their own when the operating system didn&#39;t provide them), and the complexity of parsing &#34;HTML soup&#34; and emails with all kinds of bizarre invalid syntaxes.I can&#39;t offer a general solution, but if password managers simply refused to autofill to any field other than the one with the matching standard autocomplete attribute, web developers might start doing the right thing. (Do Safari, Chrome and Edge already do this? Only they have the clout to make it happen.) The user could still fill out a text box lacking the standard autocomplete attribute by right-clicking and manually selecting the correct field. Password managers should also get cheaper because their vendors would not need armies of developers adding workarounds for popular sites.Somehow this kind of nonsense has become culturally acceptable in the software industry. If the car industry worked this way you&#39;d have to take your car back to the dealer once a month to be patched to take account of constantly changing fuel formulations. Standards exist for a reason."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a similar 1Password moment. I was buying airline tickets; entered my name, my wife’s name, address, declined insurance, declined hotel offer, scroll scroll scroll... Then I let 1Password fill in my payment details, which it did perfectly fine. But... what it ALSO did, on a field now well off the top of the screen, was change my wife’s first name to my full name.I caught this when I got the confirmation email. I called the travel website, and they said since it was within 24 hours I could just cancel the tickets for free, or if I liked I could pay an outrageous fee to the airline to change the name on the ticket.  Unsurprisingly I chose the former.So, nor harm done, but if we’d gotten to the airport and my wife couldn’t come on holiday because I didn’t have a ticket for her... could have gone badly. :P"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve put &#34;temporarily&#34; in the title because the post now says the money has been refunded. The article is worth leaving up because, unlike the typical riler-upper, it touches on a phenomenon which is interesting in its own right. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to leave up a title that implies that there&#39;s an uncorrected injustice to get angry about. If anyone has a better solution, we can do that instead."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What&#39;s interesting about acquisitions like this is that the actual value that is being transacted is the userbase and their data, along with the inability for either of those to easily move elsewhere.No one wants to buy the actual chat application itself, because they could build equivalent technology on their own. But users are locked into platforms so heavily and for such long time periods that they themselves give the platform almost the entirety of its value (not to single out Discord, since we all know this is how a lot of acquisitions work in practice). [As an additional caveat, I will add that Discord has definitely built something that its users love, and I don&#39;t want to undermine the absurd amount of UI, feature refinement, and scaling work they&#39;ve done successfully. It isn&#39;t negligible, but it is also not &gt;$10B of software engineering.]I&#39;ve read many discussions where someone says something of the form &#34;I wish I didn&#39;t have to use X, but my friends and family all use it, so I&#39;m forced to&#34;, and I think upon consideration of this statement that there is something deeply wrong with the way network effects and protocols function on our Internet such that this can even be a common scenario. We really do have quite a crisis of non-interoperability that generalizes towards a complete lack of user control, be it software, hardware, data, or anything in between.With that said, if Microsoft does purchase Discord, it might not be as bad as some foretell. While we can point to something like Skype as a failure, we can also point to something like Github, which has been doing very well post-acquisition, and in my opinion hasn&#39;t gotten worse at all. It&#39;s quite possible they wouldn&#39;t want to profit off of Discord individually, but rather use it as another tool to expand their general ecosystem horizontally. On the other hand, they could also do the exact opposite and start harvesting data and maximizing advertisements en masse, lest my post become too optimistic in tone, since this is still HN. Lastly, remember that this is still just a rumor that various news outlets have picked up on and is nowhere near guaranteed.For those looking for alternatives due to this, or just because they&#39;d like to own their own data for once, I think Matrix is likely to be the best general solution in this product space, both with respect to similar app functionality as well as quality constraints (real encryption, decentralization, FOSS, etc)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Introducing Microsoft Teams for Gamers, a new platform that empowers gamers to get the best out of their gaming sessions. Game, meet, chat, call, and collaborate in just one place.Discord Meet Now is now available in Windows 10 taskbar so you can meet with a simple click. No sign ups. No downloads required.Would you like to try Discord in the new Microsoft Edge, &#34;the browser recommended by Microsoft&#34;?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Discord would be crazy to not take this deal. They could go public, but they have no clear monetization path to ever reach that valuation.For Microsoft, however, it holds incredible strategic importance to their Xbox division. If suddenly the #1 gaming voice and text chat on PC is fully cross-compatible with Xbox and Xbox services it puts Sony at a huge ecosystem disadvantage. When added to the context of Microsoft&#39;s acquisition of Bethesda and their shift in strategy to Xbox as a service it makes perfect sense."</p>

If you haven&#39;t heard of them before, they&#39;re simple first-person videos where the filmer walks around some area with a stabilized video camera - no talking, just walking. I&#39;ve really missed traveling and watching video walks while exercising has been a great way to satisfy that travel craving a bit and also trick my brain into experiencing some semblance of normalcy (not sure I could remember what a crowded street feels like otherwise haha).I&#39;m partial to Japan so my favorite channel has been Rambalac [1], and I recently also started watching another channel with the very creative name JAPAN 4K [2]. There are tons of other channels and places too, for example I recently watched a few in Lisbon [3] and Seoul [4] and Copenhagen [5]. They&#39;re very relaxing and fun to watch and going from place to place with no cuts captures the usual tourist experience quite well.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a great article explaining why a lab leak should always be a suspect. The alternative theory is that a virus traveled on its own (via bats or other animals) from bat caves 900km away to Wuhan where there are 2 labs researching bats. One of the labs is lesser known but is right next to the seafood market and the hospital where the outbreak was first known. [1]This article points out that a lab outbreak could have happened in the United States and many places in the world. We need to avoid demonizing China over this if we want to ever find out the truth and learn how to prevent another pandemic outbreak.[1] https://web.archive.org/web/20200214144447/https://www.resea..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My understanding of the author&#39;s central thesis is this: the US, despite its world-class virology and disease study labs, regularly has lapses in procedure that regularly lead to situations in which the public might be exposed. Given that this is happening in our own backyard, we might reasonably expect countries of similar status (like China) to experience similar lapses.That reads as reasonable to me, but raises a subsequent question: if these lapses are so common and so many countries possess the capacity for serious mistakes, why don&#39;t we see more regular outbreaks (if not full-blown pandemics) caused by labs? In other words, what makes COVID special? I didn&#39;t find a satisfactory answer to the latter question in the article.It&#39;s my (uninformed, uneducated) opinion that the severity of the author&#39;s claims don&#39;t correspond to the reality of the last few national and international disease crises (AIDS, Ebola, Zika, COVID). Which isn&#39;t to say that we should absolutely dismiss the possibility that COVID originated in a lab, only that claims that it did amount to currently unsubstantiated claims about COVID&#39;s special status among other recent pandemics."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think it is strange that, on the one hand, the tech world has been advocating for the rights of neurodivergent people – society should accept that people on the autism spectrum are different and that’s OK. But at the same time RMS has been attacked for some statements very probably stemming from his autism that, while they may seem a bit shocking and at odds with the mainstream, were not illegal or intentionally offensive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those who do not know RMS personally: &#34;I worked for RMS longer than any other programmer. ... This was an own-goal for RMS. He has had plenty of opportunities to learn how to stfu when that’s necessary. ... I can confirm the unfortunate reality that RMS’s behavior was a concern [in the 1990s], and that [Marvin Minsky&#39;s] protection was itself part of the problem. He was never held to account; he was himself coddled in his own lower-grade misbehavior and mistreatment of women. He made the place uncomfortable for a lot of people, and especially women. ...  RMS’s mere presence on the scene in this way has served to make it harder to deal with other cases of bad leaders’ bad behavior. It is time for the free software community to leave adolescence and move to adulthood, and this requires leaving childish tantrums, abusive language, and toxic environments behind.&#34; — Thomas Bushnell https://medium.com/@thomas.bushnell/a-reflection-on-the-depa..."</p>

People who try to conflate his bad behaviour and autism are excusing his behaviour and unfairly generalising about autistic people.Richard is argumentative about his bad behaviour. He&#39;s not oblivious. Plenty of people have spoken to him about it. You&#39;d think he might take a hint after being removed from his own organisation and all the surrounding commentary. He doesn&#39;t care.(Separately, &#34;techrights&#34; is run by an obsessive troll who harasses people in the FLOSS community.)"</p>

Just on the day we were about to fly back home we were instructed to turn on the Hotel TV, which was showing very eerie video footage of Eyjafjallajökull erupting. The stark emergency chyron combined with the vague video footage gave us a very unsettled feeling.Then we walked into the lobby where some 80s pop was playing, the staff was cheery and asked what we&#39;d like to have for breakfast because we&#39;d probably fly home a few hours delayed. I guess you become unflappable when you literally live on top of volcanoes :)On the Iceland Air flight home we watched a very interesting documentary about the Eldfell eruptions in 1973.

If they left under bad terms because the business was a bunch of dicks, expect to pay 10x market rate.

Usually there was reputational damage but surprisingly most times the actual business bounced back. But it was always the actions of someone in particular in those first hours that made the difference.Thinking you&#39;re fucked is unhelpful, because you start talking about resumes and expecting some deus ex machina to appear and resolve the situation (for good or ill)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Many of these WiFi-LED lamps contain esp8266 devices, which have a lot of open source alternative firmware available, like esphome[0] or tasmota[1]. You can reflash them by opening them &amp; connecting a cheap (1$) usb-to-tty adapter.If that isn&#39;t an option (for reasons like not wanting to permanently damage them or being afraid of electrical shocks) a lot of them come with tuya firmware, which you can (still) often exploit and convert with TUYA-CONVERT [2].I found the Tasmota Device Templates Repository[3] to be a really valuable resource, although I&#39;ve been using zigbee devices for lightbulbs.[0]https://esphome.io/[1]https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota[2]https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert[3]https://templates.blakadder.com/index.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think I&#39;m missing a few major points. I wonder if someone here might be able to clarify.1. The real meat of this &#34;pwning&#34; was (it seems) a google search to identify the WEB API endpoint. Then it turns out that sending POST requests to this endpoint can turn the light on/off, change its temperature, and change its brightness.2. In order to turn a light on/off using the &#34;found&#34; api, it is first necessary to connect to the lamp&#39;s network. So if I were doing this on my own linux machine, which cannot as far as I can tell connect to multiple wireless networks at the same time, my script to change the settings on the light would include disconnecting from my true wifi network, connecting to the lamp&#39;s network, sending the signal to the lamp, disconnecting from the lamp, and then reconnecting to my own network. Is that right? Is this what the bash scripts and apps mentioned in the post are doing?3. If I lived in the apartment above the OP&#39;s (say), and I were malicious, I could even now also access the lamps&#39; networks and, say, set their values to be whatever I wanted.  And there is simply no way of stopping this (S in IoT, after all)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I haven&#39;t seen mention much with these &#34;smart&#34; devices is how inconvenient lack of physical buttons is. Instead of just reaching over and adjust the volume/brightness whatever, I now have to unlock the phone, find the app and do some gestures to achieve same results, all of which now requires some mental bandwidth for these banal tasks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had to quit reading any FIRE (financial independence, early retirement) blogs because they were full of people headed down this same path: Extreme frugality, bare minimum savings, assuming their lifestyle would never change and nothing would ever go wrong.Retiring at 30 sounds great, but no one&#39;s life goes exactly to plan for next the 30-40 years until traditional retirement age. People change, expectations evolve, possessions wear out and need to be replaced. Living frugally may be fun when you&#39;re in your 20s, but it&#39;s not so fun when as you get older and your friends want to do things that require money (vacations, hobbies, dining out). Even worse when your romantic partner has different goals in life, as happened here.Many of the leanFIRE stories have their roots in people who hate their jobs so much that the only thing that motivates them is early retirement. They grind through the job the hate, counting days on their leanFIRE countdown until they can quit working and never look back.Most of these people would be much happier if they simply invested time and energy into finding a job they enjoy, or at least one that doesn&#39;t make them miserable. Even if it requires a pay cut and a later retirement date, it&#39;s much better to spend your time doing something you don&#39;t hate than it is to grind out a bad job in misery just to reach dreams of early retirement sooner."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my early twenties, I had a business mostly on autopilot that let me work maybe an hour a day. I mostly spent my time writing poetry, hiking, making friends, etc. It was great. It was not sustainable, but it was perfect for a twenty something exploring the joys and freedoms of youth.Now, I work much harder, have kids, and responsibilities. That being said, I know the work I do is meaningful, and serves many people. We have significant savings. Though living in a big city means we can&#39;t retire early. That&#39;s beside the point though: I motivate myself to work because it is meaningful. The same with kids: I don&#39;t do things because I enjoy them, I do them in the service of my kids and my family.  Reading the story in the OP, I get the sense that the OP hasn&#39;t made that transition to thinking about work in terms of serving others. A happy life is not a life of retirement, its a life of meaning. What was meaningful once (aiming for retirement), loses its meaning once it has been attained. You have to keep moving forward. This is not about &#34;Keeping Up,&#34; but about stepping outside of oneself, and learning to put others ahead, even if it requires personal suffering. (Something parents of young children know very well.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was a really refreshing and honest take on early retirement, especially among the FI blogosphere.&gt; I looked at other FI bloggers who quit work and retired.  They all appeared to be blissful. Stoic.  Confident and without reservations.  Since I ran into problems myself, I started to feel like I was defective.  Like something was wrong with me and that’s why it didn’t work so well.  Maybe it has to do with my personality (a nerdy introvert).  Or it could be because I’m not trying to sell product and make money off of my choices, like almost everyone else who blogs about FI seems to.There always seemed like a potentially strange conflict of interest with many of the FI bloggers who are ostensibly &#34;retired early&#34;, but still earn a significant amount of money from their FI blogs. Which isn&#39;t to say they shouldn&#39;t be earning that money, but it does bring up questions about some of the conclusions that they make. (There&#39;s also a bit of a groupthink or even cult-like mentality among some of them, particularly in the MMM sphere.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A different take: Microsoft, Oracle, et. al. waged a war against OSS in the 90s. They went as far as using mental illness as a weapon against the community (equating participation in the commons as an equivalent to mental illness).It’s not a coincidence the class of human that weathered the storm looks like Stallman, Linus, ESR, et. al. That’s what it took. The toxicity in these communities is a result of what was leftover. These humans grew up amongst OSS activists that also weathered the storm.They carried the flag when no one else would. Vilifying them now, at a time where Microsoft just purchased the two largest infrastructure/tooling providers for the commons (npm, GitHub) is concerning to me. Without them, the commons wouldn’t be what it is today."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Google results have gotten dramatically worse over this last decade. Google now seems to fixate on the most common terms in my query and returns the most generic results for my geographic area. And, it seems like quotes and the old google-fu techniques are just ignored or are no longer functional.There are a whole host of factors behind this, but I&#39;m certain that the switch to Natural Language Processing / Semantic Search drove this decline."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many moons ago, I put a ton of work into a (now defunct) content site that provided specific information in a small vertical. Each post took hours, but I enjoyed writing the articles, and the revenue from the ads was enough to enjoy a little extra cash every month (we&#39;re talking just about enough to cover a car payment, for context).Google decided they liked a lot of the content and started providing it in their knowledge graph. It was initially great to be validated and the link to my content at the top of the search result was pretty cool to see. But it did tank traffic, as Google scraping my content and giving it away at the top of their search result page meant people didn&#39;t need to navigate to my site.Felt pretty terrible, if I&#39;m being honest, but I also have always subscribed to understanding the risks for relying on other networks for my own benefit.BUT!!!As a regular user of search engines, I love getting the answer super fast without necessarily having to guess what sort of ad-trap I&#39;ll have to navigate to get the answer I&#39;m looking for on some random content site.As a user, when I&#39;m asking some non-critical question, it&#39;s nice to just get a snappy answer. I appreciate it.The problem of course arises when content creators stop making the content for Google to scrape and index, what then?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If Google ever started including copy-pasteable code from Stack Overflow, I might never follow a link from Google again.Which I think says a lot about how Google is used now. I don&#39;t use Google to find web pages, I use it to find an answer to a pressing question. When I&#39;m looking for something to read, I go to a content aggregator like HN or Reddit.Of course this isn&#39;t sustainable. If Google is just presenting other sites&#39; data &#34;for&#34; them, and thus depriving them of traffic and revenue, eventually there won&#39;t be any incentive to create the content Google is scraping. Long term, this seems self-defeating for Google, just as its ruinous to the sites they scrape."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Don&#39;t try to make a career out of optimizing the SQL queries to display a preference page on a line of business app at a company that no one has ever heard of. That is not the straightforward path to having other people learn you are capable of doing meaningful work.&#34;This is so sad. Optimizing that SQL might require being really clever and can bring enormous value for the company that maybe nobody heard about but might be providing some not so sexy but useful service for half of the country.I&#39;ve never heard about company that is building software that runs nearby power plant, but certainly this company is much more useful and have more positive feedback for the society than something &#34;sexy&#34; like Facebook."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like this framing.In graduate school, I worked for 2+ years before my first paper was published. In that time, I passed my PhD qualifying exam, took classes, wrote code, read papers, learned math, and so forth. Yet when I applied for internships, I received no interest from employers. I suspect this was because I had no concrete signal that I knew anything in my field.While working on my second paper, I started blogging. In the language of this article, I started generating public intellectual capital for myself. I have definitely experienced the effects of this capital on subsequent job hunts. Now I can point people to my blog to demonstrate knowledge, technical skills, and communication skills beyond the scope of my peer-reviewed work. Furthermore, there is no question about who contributed to my blog, and when I learn something new, I can externalize that quickly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I mean, what the hell is with all this 60-90 hours per week stuff going on? Am I an incredibly defective human being or something - I cannot even fathom working anything even CLOSE to that (in software/tech, maybe if you&#39;re in med school or work an an ER I can see it). There is no way in hell I could ever even be close to productive for that period of time for more than, say, one week a year or something (and even then I&#39;d need weeks to recover).  I&#39;d guess I&#39;d ask everyone, &#34;Really?&#34;. When you work those kind of hours, are you _actually_ doing value-adding or value-optimizing things, or just engaging in work theater?I&#39;ve found the most incredible thing is just to say &#34;no&#34; to things. Not doing things has this fantastic side effect of not causing more work. When you don&#39;t do more things, you don&#39;t cause more problems, which doesn&#39;t need more work, which doesn&#39;t need more staff, which doesn&#39;t require more money, which gives you less stress, and gives you happier staff, happier customers, and a happier self.I wonder if I&#39;ve totally lost my marbles if this kind of thing only makes sense to myself..."</p>

I understand that it doesn&#39;t really make sense for everyone to support webextensions, and it&#39;s a huge amount of extra work, but it&#39;s just a huge barrier to adoption.It&#39;s hard to trust the smaller browsers to keep me private online if there isn&#39;t something that gives me that same level of control over blocking. And there&#39;s a huge adblocking community built around this software that maintains lists, fixes websites, and it&#39;s just a bunch of privacy-focused community effort that is hard for any small team to replicate.But aside from webextension support, Nyxt looks really exciting, and I&#39;m glad that people are building browsers that are actually innovating in this space."</p>

The value of fine wines escalates exponentially whilst the extra utility you get from any quality improvements trends towards nothing.Much of what we value is pointless and bordering on delusional.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It’s bad that Backblaze did not do their due diligence while integrating with Facebook pixel, but the bigger problem is the tendency of third party integrations having default settings that are overly aggressive when it comes to access of user/site data.This should be a warning to every developer, when you integrate with any third party - don’t just copy the default snippet of code they recommend, read the docs thoroughly and then test/monitor what is being sent back to the third party.  And if you are writing a third party widget, be considerate and make the defaults the least aggressive possible when it comes to accessing user/site/server data."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"PSA for any devs out there implementing FB Pixels:– Facebook&#39;s pixel will, by default, attach click listeners to the page and send back associated metadata. This simplifies implementation needs, but can create unintentional information leaks in privileged contexts. To disable this behavior, there&#39;s a flag[1] you can use. After which, you can manually trigger FB Pixel hits and control both when they&#39;re fired and what information is included in them.– There&#39;s a feature for the FB Pixel called Advanced Matching[2] that allows you to send hashed PII as parameters with your FB events. &#34;Automatic Advanced Matching&#34; can be enabled at any time via a toggle in the FB interface. I believe that setting autoConfig to false as mentioned above will similarly prevent Automatic Advanced Matching from working (since it disables the auto-creation of all those listeners to begin with). When manually triggering pixel calls like above, you can use this functionality via &#34;Manual Advanced Matching&#34;[3].As a general rule, I&#39;d strongly encourage anyone implementing a Facebook pixel to also include the autoConfig = false flag. This makes it work like most other pixels, where the base tag just instantiates an object. After which, hits only occur when explicitly defined in the site code, and include specifically what details you include in it. That way you&#39;re fully aware of the scope of data disclosure happening and any need from marketing to include sensitive (or potentially sensitive) information in these calls has to be explicitly requested (and theoretically vetted) as part of the standard dev process.[1] https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-pixel/advanced...[2] https://www.facebook.com/business/help/611774685654668[3] https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-pixel/advanced..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One easy way to avoid this kind of mistake in your own product: make a clear distinction between your publicly-facing web site (&#34;corpweb&#34;) and your web app for logged-in users. Preferably, they should be served from separate infrastructure.Corpweb should be as static as possible, except for whatever third-party JS the marketing professionals think is necessary. It&#39;s their job, they know what&#39;s best.Your app should have zero third-party JS except for technical analytics (New Relic, Datadog, whatever).(This distinction can be fuzzier for free services, and for consumer stuff with non-sensitive data; Backblaze is neither of those.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Huh. Like other commenters, I’m surprised to see a multi part JOIN be the answer for “I want the results of Query A as well as the results of Query B”.If anything, I think many folks would say “whatever, make the two requests in parallel and zip them together in the application”. If not, WITH expressions to make the two independent queries and then a final SELECT to merge them however you prefer would be reasonable (whether that’s a join flavor or UNION/INTERSECT/etc.), but the super explosion JOIN just doesn’t cross my mind.I think there must be a different example that they tried to anonymize for this post, otherwise they don’t need the IDs (and probably want a sum of quantity). If the author is around, what was the more realistic example behind:“In order to audit inventory, the logistics team at the corporate headquarters requests a tool that can generate a report containing all meal_items that left a given store’s inventory on a particular day. This requires a query that includes items that were both sold to customers as well as recorded as employee markouts for the specified store on the specified day.”?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Keep your matching logic simple.With SQL, matching is (by far) the most computationally expensive bit of most queries. Your goal should be to use only sargable[1] operators, and eliminate any functions, in all your WHERE clauses and JOINs.Complicated matching criteria will force the engine to make tough trade-off decisions, which can be affected by out-of-date table statistics, lousy indexes, and a million other things, and will often force the engine to rule-out more optimized algorithms and fall back to the cruder, primitive algorithms.[1] For most queries, &#34;OR&#34; is not usually a sargable operator: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargable"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author didn&#39;t mention the reason the query is slow.I dare to challenge that the non-optimal query is something that a person with advanced SQL skills would do. A seasoned engineer knows that by joining two tables, you are looking at, worst case, NxM comparisons.The problem is that you are joining the customers table with THREE other tables - the merged result of stores, employees and markouts. No matter how hard you try, you can&#39;t escape the fact that you are joining way more rows than just stores and customers.I would call it a layman issue SQL beginners learn the hard way. Advanced SQL users know the very basics of the db they are working with."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Please test their models before you take it at face value.Eleuther has a history of claiming to replicate projects when they haven&#39;t. For example, they shipped a DALL-E repo a few days after OpenAI announced it (https://twitter.com/theshawwn/status/1348017515897659392) which was broken, and they&#39;ve walked back their GPT-3 replication claims to replicating 1.5B due to the fact that their architecture doesn&#39;t scale.As far as I can tell, they&#39;re generating a large amount of hype with grandiose claims that they can&#39;t deliver on.All I care about is whether you like their models and actually use them in practice. If you do, please let me know and I&#39;ll pipe down. But so far, I haven&#39;t heard of anyone who uses anything they&#39;ve produced, and that worries me. Has anyone?One specific claim they made: https://twitter.com/BlancheMinerva/status/134727697554780980...&#34;DALL-E is quite straight forward and already coded. We just need data to train it.&#34;No, DALL-E is neither straightforward nor was it successfully coded, especially back on January 7th.Anyway, carry on. I really don&#39;t like speaking badly of AI projects, and I hope that they succeed. The model release today is a good step forward, assuming it works. But it might be better to have the expectation of &#34;the models don&#39;t work&#34; until proven otherwise.I&#39;d also like to point out that there are some capable people doing work at Eleuther. Sid in particular is one of the best TPU hackers in the scene. I just wish they would scale down their claims, release more models, and not claim that they&#39;ve done X until actually doing X. For example, the readme says they have &#34;the ability to scale up to full GPT3 sizes (and possibly more!), using the mesh-tensorflow library,&#34; which they don&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a nice release, but the title is a bit misleading as the released sizes (1.3B and 2.7B parameters) do not yet compare to the size of GPT-3 (175B), but rather GPT-2 (1.5B) instead (although future releases may have significantly more!).Edit: title improved, thank you!"</p>

Instead of Purcell go for &#34;Engineering Electromagnetics with Ida&#34;, it is more intuitive.And th first book you should start with is &#34;Foundations of Analog and Digital Electronic Circuits&#34;Then you go for DDCA and Ida in parallel.The list does give me head scrather, this is too broad to be ever accomplished. My recommendation to redo the list is first find out what piques your interest in EE, Digital hardware, analog hardware or control systems or embedded systems and try to have a self study focus in that concentration.The way I see it with this plan you are setting yourself up for failure.Edit:Removed the ditching recommendation as I see it relevant to OP&#39;s goals."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why push yourself through a degree-style path? So much of what EEs learn in their coursework is of low utility. (I&#39;m a physicist who transitioned to working as an EE. I have never had a single EE course, and yet I find myself with no obvious deficits compared to my colleagues who have.)There are two ways to learn an existing technical-ish subject: you can spend a lot of time reading textbooks, then  do some projects (the &#34;slow-fast&#34; approach); or you can dive in to projects and refer to textbooks when you get stuck (the &#34;start-stop&#34; approach). In the slow-fast approach you will go slowly through a lot of textbooks for a long time, and then in theory you will be able to do projects very quickly once you are done. In the start-stop approach you will start a project, quickly get stuck and spend a while searching for and understanding the answer, then go back to your project.In my opinion electrical engineering, being a subject where fast feedback is generally possible, is very well suited to project-first learning. I would recommend grabbing a few textbooks (Horowitz and Hill&#39;s Art of Electronics holding pole position for a practically-oriented learner, in my opinion), reading their introductory material (table of contents, preface, etc.; enough that you know what each book has in it), and then setting all the books aside until you need them. Avoid books targeted at &#34;makers&#34;; most are fine but a sizeable fraction are written by people with no clue what they are doing, and they will actively set you back. (It is very difficult to learn from an author who does not themself understand the subject, and all the worse if they do not realize that they do not understand. Since there are plenty of better sources out there, it&#39;s little trouble to just avoid the whole class.)Trying to work on brain-computer interfaces is challenging because it blends biology with electrical engineering. The biology will naturally drive things, because you cannot really control it like you can the electronics. So learning EE in this context is about two things: 1) What can I do with circuits? and 2) What do organisms behave like and respond to electrically? Your project is then using your knowledge of circuits to solve R&amp;D problems relating to bioelectric signals.This isn&#39;t easy (I think you know that), but the benefit is that you can quit with &#34;just&#34; EE skills and still come out ahead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to build BMI systems in graduate school, from the lowest level (mixed-signal analog design for 70 uV extracelleular signals) to DSP (128 DSPs doing real time analysis) to the network (built my own ethernet MAC, foolishly!) to all the vis and RT-linux-based analysis. I left the area and switched into ML in grad school, but if I had to do it all over again there&#39;s one thing I think is missing:Optics. Optics optics optics.A tremendous amount of neural interfacing, especially in non-human primates and other organisms, is done via optics. ~All the advances in neural data acquisition over the past decade have been optical. Microscopy is the future for a tremendous amount of neuroscience and more and more people are considering it seriously for human-scale BMI.I know optics isn&#39;t always thought of in an EE context, but it should be! Many people doing amazing computational imaging and optics work are in EE departments. Computational imaging is the new hotness and can let you combine your existing CS skills with signal processing and optics to do things like build a lensless camera! https://waller-lab.github.io/DiffuserCam/If I were you I would ditch the RF part of your plan and study optics. Yeah, it&#39;s all EM, but the order-of-magnitude differences in the frequencies involved makes the underlying engineering quite different."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Before it was announced that uBiome was committing insurance fraud a few years back, my friend and I compared our test results and found that our very detailed, 10-page personalized biome reports were completely identical except for our names. So I believe they were also just completely fabricating their test results from the beginning, and some of the employees at the company must have known this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Richman was even named an &#34;innovator&#34; winner in Goop&#39;s &#34;The Greater goop Awards&#34; and at its peak, uBiome was valued at $600 million.Considering how questionable Goop is that the fraud seems about right.In the meantime the whole medical start up where they suddenly can test, for cheaper, better, etc seems to regularly come up short on the actual testing, results, or even just valid use cases.Much like Theranos nobody ever seems to explain how these kind of companies can just suddenly test for more so easily where the existing medical industry just hasn&#39;t been able to.Of all the things that the start up ... &#34;system&#34; can do well I kinda question their ability to suddenly become amazing complex medical device inventors / scientists.   I recall some folks who work in that industry and they noted that creating new tests and diagnostics and equipment is often incredibly slow and iterative.  That doesn&#39;t seem very start up-ish.   The magical breakthroughs are rare."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Beautiful times. I especially loved swapping - that is you got a list of people and their addresses from a magazine and you saved on disks your favourite demos and zines (preferable those nobody else had) and then you added some random stuff for example label off your favourite drink, wrote some poems, maybe added a dried flower and so on and then you also added postage stamps. Then you were hoping that whoever received it on the other side liked it and he or she would have sent you something else. Sometimes you would just just pass on the disks you received and just added your name to a txt file or some funny looking directory. There was also a trick to put a glue over your stamps and it was the custom that the person would send you those stamps back so you could then dissolve the postage stamp and reuse them :-)
The internet somewhat killed this unfortunately.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A big part of the problem is people just not following the guidelines. If you have a toolbar with buttons that have labels, it’s not going to fit. But if you’re following the guidelines, you don’t have labels and it fits.If you have a list with a refresh button on the bottom you have to scroll to see that button on a small screen. But if you use the standard pull to refresh control, you don’t even need the button.If you use these smart hamburger menu overlay or scroll controls, they look bad on untested devices. Don’t use hamburger menus.Most of the screenshots in this article are from iOS apps that show Google Material Design. It’s not too surprising this doesn’t work properly on Apple devices, the design doesn’t fit and you can’t implement it using the toolkit Apple designed, built and tested to work on all their devices.Edit:By the way you don’t even need to get a tiny phone to test this because most of the problems also show up when you increase the operating system font size which you’re also supposed to test."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Google Maps thing isn’t entirely about screen size (though I would hope it wouldn’t be quite so bad on larger screens—but I’m only familiar with how it looks on a small-by-modern-standards Android phone, where it’s about the same as on the iPhone depicted in this article, or even a little less); it’s about the product’s overarching philosophy, which has changed over the past decade (in a direction I strongly dislike). It used to be about, y’know, maps, but maps are now incidental, a means to a different end, ably demonstrated by their icon change a year ago from a map to a location pin. It’s all about the destinations now, and mapping has progressively deteriorated and been deemphasised.At least in the case depicted, you should be able to get it to show just the map by tapping once in the map area.(If you’re interested in more about this, https://www.justinobeirne.com has some excellent long-form content analysing all the major maps products, how they’ve changed over time, &amp;c. https://www.justinobeirne.com/google-maps-new-app-icon and https://www.justinobeirne.com/what-happened-to-google-maps are good brief starting points.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing that really annoyed me who always preferred the smaller iPhones like the SE: When Apple updated their Music app to make everything super big and bloated it basically got unusable. Especially for classical music where you could not see past the long name of the symphony to see which movement it was. And even while playing you had to wait for the running text to reach the important part.And all this was just blown up, they did not have to cram in a lot of infos they just increased the size of every UI element, made fonts bigger and bolt. It was really poor design, it felt like a phone for the elderly. Also one feature was gone that the old Music app had which would&#39;ve helped here: hold down on a song to get the overlay of the whole name...In general classical music is really poorly supported by many music services and apps but this was such a huge annoyance that I had to switch to a third party app and delete that shitty Music app."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The followup tweet indicates that the CPU has to be in an unlocked state before this is possible, which on a typical system requires there to be a Management Engine vulnerability first. Given what we currently know, this is going to be interesting for people interested in researching the behaviour and security of Intel CPUs and might well lead to discovery of security issues in future, but in itself I don&#39;t think this is dangerous.Edit to add: https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/security-... is a discussion of a previous Intel security issue which includes a description (on page 6) of the different unlock levels. This apparently requires that the CPU be in the Red unlock state, which (in the absence of ME vulnerabilities) should only be accessible by Intel."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nothing against the original post (which just says what they found), but this seems to be really overblown. Yes, of course Intel has instructions to update the micro code, since that&#39;s a thing that they do. Neither is it particularly surprising that they didn&#39;t bother to document operations that only they would ever have reason to use (in their eyes). If, as sibling comment notes, you have to be in a specific unlocked state to use this instruction, it should be perfectly safe assuming someone hasn&#39;t compromised other layers of security. So yes, this is certainly interesting, and it could be used as part of a chain of exploits to do some really nasty things, but by itself this seems like barely news?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Look up &#34;Intel VISA&#34; if you want to go down one of the many rabbitholes of undocumented x86... it makes me sad that there are whole subsystems in the hardware whose documentation is not publicly available; not from the security perspective, but from the &#34;I bet someone could do some really interesting things with this functionality&#34; perspective, like what LOADALL enabled (unreal mode, real-mode paging, etc.) decades ago.Intel isn&#39;t alone; search &#34;9c5a203a&#34; for some equally interesting stuff on the AMD side."</p>

The one that surprised me the most was marked &#34;Near Collision (2)&#34; in the video (12:25). A car really close to the Tesla doesn&#39;t seem to be picked up at all until it&#39;s too late: https://i.imgur.com/BG0gN2R.jpegYou can see in the first frame there that on the screen there&#39;s nothing in front of the Tesla, it&#39;s just the usual white background. But right out the windshield we can see the car is already very close. At the bottom frame which is a split second later, the car is finally detected and we can see the screen now shows the car. But at that point the driver manually intervened with a sharp swerve right as they were about to hit the car. Going frame by frame on Youtube the green box indicating the car was only there for 4 frames before the driver disengaged.I was aware that self driving is far from ready but I didn&#39;t know that even basic detection stuff like this is buggy. Double parked cars, people walking in the street, etc, I would expect to be problematic. But this is not really an edge case, it&#39;s just a regular car at close range with no obstructions in between..."</p>

It repeatedly tries to pull out in front of cars going 45+ miles an hour, in some cases giving the driver very little time to stop it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I built a print-on-demand system that integrates into Shopify stores. To vent a little...* I can concur that their API is unreliable. About 1 in 5 of my CI runs fail with mysterious 500 errors. It&#39;s infuriating.* The support channels are a wasteland. Do not expect help.* The documentation is super thin. At first glance it looks decent - there&#39;s the objects, there&#39;s the fields those objects have. But it&#39;s missing all the details about how those fields are supposed to work. Example: A Fulfillment has a tracking_numbers array, but there doesn&#39;t seem to be any way to add multiple tracking numbers. The docs are silent, and questions about this in the support channels remain unanswered. For years.* There are two completely different APIs (graphql and REST), which do not have equal capabilities. If Shopify is planning on deprecating one of them, they should give us guidance.* The API is inconsistent. I count at least FIVE different representations of an Address structure, each slightly different for no apparent reason. Eg &#34;country&#34; vs &#34;countryCode&#34;. This is the kind of thing that creeps into projects in dynamic languages when nobody&#39;s paying attention.* There&#39;s a lot of overengineered stuff. The Metadata API  is really unpleasant compared to Stripe&#39;s simpler approach.* There&#39;s no way to set up common shipping scenarios like &#34;$N for first item, $M for each additional&#34;.I could go on. But I will say this: It&#39;s better than Etsy&#39;s API. Though Etsy is finally working on it again, so maybe that will change."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been building Shopify apps for around 5 years now, and have 4 apps with around 15k users. I feel the pain this author feels with some additional notes..Our apps are built in PHP using the polaris.css for styling components. We have some embedded apps currently (before Shopify began requiring the session token). Personally, the embedded experience is only good for simpler apps. If your app is more complex with lots of options and settings and things to show, the embedded experience is SO SMALL. Literally 40% of the screen is taken up by the Shopify admin leaving only a small portion for your app. Makes interface design more difficult when so much of the top/left part of the screen is taken up by Shopify admin.Their API and webhooks are &#34;fairly&#34; reliable. We&#39;re consuming around 10k to 20k webhooks per hour and performing 20k to 50k API calls per hour. We rarely have issues. We are using their Amazon EventBridge integration to accept webhooks as a sort of buffer against them DDOSing our applications.The largest issue with their API at scale is dealing with the API limits of 2 to 4 requests per second. Since some things require performing multiple API calls, and we deal with massive e-commerce stores that may need to perform 100,000 tasks, it can take a long time to perform the work (we have to artificially delay the API calls to not hit their limits). Also their GraphQL API has a complex limit system based on the &#34;amount&#34; of data returned, which makes fetching data even more complicated than their REST API.My other big gripe with their API is that they have a GraphQL and REST API with different features. They support different filters, different fields they return, different types of objects... It&#39;s a real PITA to try and work seamlessly between two different APIs (e.g. data formatted differently). And neither API is 100% solid, depending on the features your app needs you will basically need to use both APIs.Generally my experience has been pretty good with Shopify. Their API changes can be scary, but at least they use versioning so they don&#39;t break the current version you&#39;re using. They are constantly adding new features too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My biggest problem with the ecosystem is how Shopify tries to deflect their own customer problems onto their partners to solve. And oftentimes, these same customers expect the partners to solve it for free.Examples:- Their default theme (provided by Shopify) has problems. Blame it on the app developer. &#34;It&#39;s the app&#39;s fault.&#34; Yes, there are some poorly developed apps, but this lumps together the good with the bad.- Customers use the app review system to hold developer hostage for feature requests. &#34;Create this feature for us and I&#39;ll edit my review.&#34;- Shopify&#39;s customer service reps says, &#34;It must be the app that&#39;s causing this.&#34; Reading the CSR&#39;s emails, it is clear that this person does not understand the (technical) issues and is only trying to close the ticket. Customer takes what the CSR says as gospel and you, as the developer, spends a lot of time trying to fight that mindset.I can&#39;t help but feel a big part of Shopify&#39;s early strategy was that the demographic of customers they were trying to attract just weren&#39;t a great type of customer, and that the partner program allowed them to enlist a lot of hungry developers willing to work for free (or next to nothing).There is definitely room for improvement. I have mixed feelings about it, as their ecosystem provided me with a way to make a living many years ago. I don&#39;t depend on them anymore, but I wouldn&#39;t argue against trying your luck out there if you&#39;re starting out. Just recognize that there is a certain culture and way of practice there."</p>

Fast forward to the post-mortem phase which also happened to be annual review time, my manager told me I am a toxic person and I made everything worse during the crisis.To make the matter worse the night when everything was fixed, I was on my way home at 3:30am and I got a speeding ticket for going 60mph over the limit. I fell asleep behind the wheel, thank God I&#39;m still alive.I left that team immediately, and exactly one year has passed and they haven&#39;t been able to find another person to replace me but what bothers me is they promoted that manager because I left and he got all the credit.In summary, I will never ever work over 40 hours for any company."</p>

I don&#39;t see why that is confusing at all.&#34;Here, yyy has correct one and three significant digits relative to xxx, but incorrect 2 significant digits, since the truncation at x2x_2x2  and y2y_2y2  do not agree even to the first significant digit. &#34;This doesn&#39;t make sense. Y has the correct one?I think you might be confused about the purpose of significant digits. SD are intended to be paired with a tolerance. If there is no tolerence quote with the number, it is meaningless to talk about significant digits. You arbitrarily defined the tolerance as +/0.5 (half a unit). That is not always true, almost never true. Consider test equipment, not every multimeter is going to be +/0.5mV, some might be +/-.3uV. It varies."</p>

But also, I think it&#39;s just unnecessary to be this specific in the first place, if you&#39;re trying to quickly explain concepts.It&#39;s actually a huge problem in maths and even Wikipedia (I feel) is pretty guilty of this.If you take a (relatively) key mathematical concept, such as the Taylor series, then the opening gambit is completely incomprehensible to anyone who isn&#39;t already knowledgeable in maths: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_seriesThis, to me, seems in huge contrast with other scientific fields.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Somewhat related, I got a new computer this week, and had to boot into windows so I could partition the HD to install linux. This was the first time in 15 years I have booted into a brand new &#34;consumer&#34; windows install (it was windows 10 pro). The &#34;setup&#34; was basically just 10 minutes of them asking in different ways if they could collect my personal data, track my location, send back telemetry etc. Office 365 is the same. I find some new thing every day that I have to opt out of to prevent them stealing my and my business data. Its like they have given up on trying to improve their products (which are basically stable) and shifted into finding more ways to steal data. As much as I dislike google for this, I realize I&#39;m the product there, with Microsoft I thought I was paying to get business tools, not to be spied on. (To be fair, I then installed ubuntu which also wanted to send my data back to canonical)Another example, I bought a car recently that defaults to stealing my personal information and sending it to the manufacturer. I had to call, and provide more information to them, to opt out (and I can only assume they are still stealing information they have deemed critical in some way)Anyway, I&#39;m reminded of all of this because I think the obfuscated cookie consents are just one facet of how hostile consumer tech has become to users. Aided by complex and ambiguous regulations, companies are able to stay within the letter of the law while making it impossible to just be left alone with your purchase and not be tracked and marketed to.If there is a regulatory solution, it has to focus on clarity and spirit, not on just more rules. I&#39;m not aware of an example of something like this working elsewhere.One idea is a heavy tax on advertising. I&#39;ve argued before that there is a lot in common between environmental pollution and the effects of advertising on the public value of the internet, and I would say this extends to tech generally. Charge a 25-40% tax on ad revenue, and make it less economic for companies to pollute."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m reading the book The Divide at the moment. It makes the argument that it takes time and the right conditions to build up an industry - infrastructure needs to be built, education and a skilled labor pool with the necessary know-how as well. To begin with, a fledgling industry in a developing country cannot compete with those of already industrialized countries - these are already so effective that they can undercut newcomers before they have time to become competitive. So the book argues that when developing countries are pressured into free trade agreements (for example by making aid dependent on this), these countries are also forced into a position where they get stuck at the low end of the production value chain, selling raw materials, while buying processed goods from others (often the same role they were forcibly assigned when they were colonies). So much like we allow children time to learn in school before we expect them to compete in the job market, we should allow developing countries to employ protectionistic policies like tariffs, in order to protect and build up their fledgling industries nationally, before fully entering the world market in a couple decades when they are ready."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it’s good to see raw producers start working up market to make their own chocolate. I think a Ghanaian chocolate brand actually owned by Ghanaians and made for export would market very well.It’s interesting to me how much tasty and interesting stuff in Africa has not been marketed internationally and there’s lots of room for them to grow and develop.For example, fonio [0], is a grain native to west Africa that I’ve never seen in the US but was eaten every day when I was there, as common as rice. It’s gluten-free and could be the next quinoa and a great opportunity to develop a new brand and export finished products rather than just commodities.One of the big opportunities of all this digitization, I think, is that it’s now easier for remote locations to get more value out of their commodities than just exporting raw and having someone else add most of the value.I’m surprised the Swiss aren’t trying to do more joint ventures to develop chocolate making capabilities in Ghana."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really hope Ivory Coast will join Ghana on this, as they did for the LID bonus case. Together they account for over 2/3 of cocoa production. So, they can pretty much reshape the cocoa/chocolate market and break out of colonialistic trade agreements for the benefit of their people."</p>

(I come from an engineering family and should have just done it from the start, but oh well.)I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s still on the platform, but about a year into my self studying I took a series of courses on edX that used this system. I think it was called Systematic Program Design, but I could be misremembering. Anyways, the courses were incredible. I completely credit them with beginning to turn me from a coder into a software dev. The system they provide just locked into my brain like it had always been there.I almost didn&#39;t take it because it used Racket, and I questioned its general applicability for that reason. I&#39;m so glad I pushed those concerns aside, because in addition to introducing me to software design principles, it introduced me to Lisp in a way that also completely changed my thinking about what programming itself could be.I&#39;ve now been a paid dev for 2.5 years. I don&#39;t really explicitly use the system from the course in my daily work, but the knowledge contained within it has molded my entire understanding of the field.The course literally changed my life."</p>

At the time I found it patronizing and silly and artificially limiting, having coded before (the design recipe, the different &#34;levels&#34; of scheme).But I saw some of the wisdom in the approach when I later tutored the class. People would try to rush into coding problems without doing real analysis of what the cases would be, and had a foggy notion of different parts of program having a &#34;contract&#34;. HTDP and the design recipe makes that muscle memory for beginners which is pretty nifty."</p>

I work with these folks through my company to help them become employed upon release.A few things, it is astounding but believable that when people are released they enter a world that is entirely unknown to them. Not only technology but their relationships and neighborhoods are completely different.In addition,They have no reliable way of getting back on their feet. They usually have zero money, no housing and no job - and there is why you have high recidivism rates. Not only that, but no one wants to hire justice involved individuals, even though significant tax credits are available for doing so - Walmart for example, takes extreme advantage of these.The training programs in prisons will train someone up to a certification, but fall short of letting them get that certification. People have completed their GED maybe 5 times inside serving sentences at different times because doing so can reduce their sentence, it doesn’t help them in any other way.Without the ability to access training for in demand skills, many of these individuals get temp service jobs as flagged for construction for example. Doesn’t make sense to me that we want to rehab people yet minimal opportunities inside are provided to break the cycle.Realize this. People serve a sent and then they are eligible for parole. Many people opt to serve their parole inside, rather than outside. I’ve been told they feel it is easier inside than out."</p>

In addition to it being hard to find work having a criminal record, by the time he got out, everybody was transitioning away from FoxPro.As is too often the case, the lure of money from selling drugs combined with not being able to find work meant he returned to prison.  He got out again in the early-mid 2000&#39;s and this time around, there were no courses offered for study.  When he got out that time, he didn&#39;t even know how to use the TV remote.One day, history will look back on how we treat our prisoners with immense shame.  Instead of trying to rehabilitate them, we leave them to rot, and politicians never shy away from an opportunity to make the lives of prisoners more miserable, lest they risk being called &#34;soft&#34; on crime."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m sure many people here have experienced frustration helping older relatives or friends use computers.  Recently though, I realized, that computers are just way too hard to use.In our pursuit to avoid cryptic black screens with command prompts, a user must now understand that their computer has Windows with all of its menus and functions, a browser window with all of its menus and functions, running a webapp, with all of its menus and functions.  Whenever functionality bleeds into other layers (&#34;how do I print this pdf file&#34;), it is a huge hassle trying to explain &#34;oh, it&#39;s not that print button, its this other print button&#34;.It makes me sad to think that people prefer their &#34;appliance computers&#34; (phones, tablets, chromebooks) over real computers, but I can hardly blame them."</p>

And no firewalls or routers would be massive, disqualifying red flags on such a questionnaire.Never mind that a KISS setup tends to bring security because of its minimized attack surface. In the minds that write and administer those questionnaires, security only comes from sufficient amounts of the right kinds of complexity.I&#39;m sure it can be done.

I use ZFS locally and it has made managing my own data strangely pleasing, and it&#39;s nice to have the same system on my off-site storage too.On the laptop-front, I find myself drifting towards a similar setup to John. I have a hefty workstation laptop but the battery life is dire and it weighs a ton, so I pretty much just run it as a headless machine next to my server now. I&#39;m planning on picking up a Pinebook Pro as an &#34;outdoors&#34; machine to just remote in. I also find myself extremely unwilling to arse about swapping multiple machines on my monitors so being able to keep my work machine separate and secure but operate it from my desktop is a nice compromise."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The idea was to create a tool to sort the named CSS colors in a way that it shows related colors together. So, next time I can&#39;t decide between a few CSS colors, I can just check them here side by side.I&#39;ve created this tool last summer, but I hadn&#39;t shared it here back then. It&#39;s a PWA that I made with pure JS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is definitely a cool way of exploring CSS colors.But, serious question: does anyone actually use CSS colors except for a handful of the basics (&#34;red&#34;, &#34;blue&#34;) for prototyping/debugging?I mean, the idea of typing &#34;background-color: lightsalmon;&#34; just feels so bizarre to me.Whenever I&#39;ve needed to come up with colors from scratch, I&#39;ll just start with an intuitive best guess -- e.g. &#34;hsl(30, 80%, 50%)&#34; -- and then iterate a couple times till I get what I&#39;m looking for.It seems like even more effort to try to select colors from the CSS palette when it might turn out that there isn&#39;t even a satisfactory one. The CSS colors are still extremely limited. E.g. the distance between neighbors like &#34;dark cyan&#34; and &#34;darkslategray&#34; is huge."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; While our log analysis, conducted from March 5 through March 8, confirmed that this was a rare issue, it could not rule out the possibility that a session had been incorrectly returned but then never used. This was not a risk we were willing to take, given the potential impact of even one of these incorrectly returned sessions being used.It is funny how they make it seem like they are super cautious. When in fact they had no other choice than do it when you rephrase the problem as &#34; there were maybe some people who got the admin right of the github account of some of our customers&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well that&#39;s embarrassing. Passing a mutable dictionary—containing callbacks that could be closed over heaven-even-knows-what, no less!—between threads? And it&#39;s re-used between requests?They are lucky this wasn&#39;t much, much worse.Why does the error reporting service need to call the web thread back anyway?Yet another case where immutable-everything would have prevented this hairball from accreting in the first place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this issue is relevant for Python programmers as well. uwsgi for many years shipped a default allocation mode for the WSGI environment which just cleared it between requests. One had to switch over to `wsgi-env-behaviour=holy` to prevent it. Holy is now the default but many people still set it to cheap because that prevented some segfaults for a while in uWSGI."</p>

However, for many workloads, isn&#39;t the network I/O going to outweigh the benefits of remote CPU cycles?I really think this is a clever hack, but I&#39;m not sure how useful it is. Is it really good for the transcoding example? I could see that being good if the remote machine has a better GPU, but I&#39;m struggling to see how this could work for other use-cases. Maybe compiling (which was one of the main use-cases behind Sun&#39;s SGE)?I do most of my work on HPC clusters, so moving compute out to remote nodes is something I&#39;m very interested in... and I&#39;d love to learn more about what kinds of workflows the authors had in mind."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried an openMOSIX cluster back in the day when it was fashionable. Cluster-Knoppix could transform a bunch of old pc&#39;s in an instant SSI cluster with almost zero configuration needed. Though I know it is not the most efficient way, I miss the simplicity of it.A shell script that simply launches a new process on the most idle node of a network would be enough to get back some of that experience. Live migration would be even better, almost perfect for that. Hope some day I can easily build a bewolf cluster out of my ARM SBC&#39;s with an experience similar to the old days of Cluster-Knoppix."</p>

Much rarer is success, which is why it&#39;s more worth the time to study. Maybe this is a controversial opinion.Maybe adjacent failures are worth study - studies of people who very nearly succeeded compared to someone who did, where subtle differences ended up being significant.

That&#39;s fine compared to rinsing me when I&#39;m not making any revenue (as with intercom).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I want to share my own reactions to the name change since this is a really interesting topic. For context, I&#39;m an African American, so many of my ancestors were slaves.  - The first time it occurred to me that &#34;master&#34; in this context could offend anyone was when GitHub changed the name (and broke my workflow).
  - My immediate reaction was, &#34;this change is by white people for white people,&#34; where &#34;white&#34; means anyone who isn&#39;t black.
  - My next reaction was, &#34;they may be changing the name for the wrong reasons, but the change is brilliant.&#34;

Let me explain a little more. Whether motivated purely by virtue signaling or by more genuine intentions, changing the name doesn&#39;t fix any of the problems that black people face. The article explains this well.What&#39;s powerful about this name change is that it pushes us to alter a habit, in my case one embedded deeply in my fingers, something that I do every day without realizing that I&#39;m doing it. Thus it is a useful reminder of the implicit bias that contributes to the lack of diversity in tech. Never mind that the old name was harmless, the change brings repeated awareness to an important topic, and it reaches a the developer community in a targeted way.So, next time you are annoyed that you have to fix a script or you accidentally type master when you needed to type main, please just take a deep breath, change the name, and remember to reflect upon whether you have are subconscious habits or biases that work against diversity in tech."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m a black American and agree with everything that this person in London wrote.It is also a common criticism of the American “left”, and is entirely accurate.For everyone perplexed about black Americans and other people of color walking away from the left, its because you/they don&#39;t see us as equals that can be bothered by the exact same things that other Americans can be bothered by: being told what to think, watching people be vicariously offended without asking if context in question is offensive, and the obsession with signaling instead of meaningful action."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Though I initially sympathized with the name change from master to main (cause I don&#39;t care what it is called), I am now more of the opinion that this kind of window-dressing might actually be harmful as it distracts from addressing the root cause. It is a bit complicated as the name change in itself is not bad, but given the context, and that it distracts from addressing real issues it actually is.Same thing with plastic recycling, in and of itself it is better than landfill, but as it allows us to feel good and look away from the real problem (plastic is cheap because most impacts are externalized) the recycling of plastic contributes more to the problem than to the solution. I know people who traveled around the world about once a year, own a big house and altogether have a pretty big impact that could easily be reduced, but they do recycle plastic and think of themselves as somewhat environmentally responsible.For the record, I do recycle plastic."</p>

It is a near essential tool for working with audio, daily, or every now and then.The genius of the application is that it does not try to be more than a waveform editor. Oftentimes, no matter if you are new to audio production or a veteran audio technician, you just need to edit some sound, and Audacity lets you get it done in a easy enough way for newbies, and in a complex enough way for veterans.Maintainers of projects like these should carry themselves with pride. Projects that stand the test of time and continue to deliver exactly what you needed is what makes the IT-world go around."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m pretty sure all of the songs I recorded in high school are gone forever, since I only backed up the Audacity files and not the entire folder. Perhaps this is for the best, but either way I&#39;m glad future emo teens will have an easier time preserving their work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well done! This looks impressive and really useful. I’ve been looking for a lightweight sprite / spark lib for a while. Clients always, for some reason, are very impressed by little charts in a table row, doing this witha normal size chart lib kills page performance. I was literally including very basic html indicators in a presentation today and client where really impressed! This really solves that issue!And even more. Really great that you van manipulate the elements as css. Most chart libs I’ve dealt with makes non-trivial customization impossible.I’ll probably be building this in as Lowdefy blocks[1].Just curious, did you consider just branding it as sparks.css / sprites.css or something? Going the spark / sprite route just sets the expectations a lot lower imo. Although congrats, you are really close to fully functional charts here! Really interested to see how far this can go.[1] - https://lowdefy.com"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cool!
I&#39;ll have to take the opportunity to mention my own charts.css[0]. It got some interest on HN last year [1] and I unfortunately dropped the ball and didn&#39;t make any revisions based on the good feedback I got. As people pointed out, I tried to give it a &#34;cute&#34; name using unicode which unfortunately makes it harder to search for.This version (OP&#39;s) is way more polished and almost certainly more widely useful. But mine had the features of (a) being generated from markdown and (b) defaulting to a list presentation of the data under different styles so the data remained accessible.Having more charting options that don&#39;t require javascript to do simple things is a good thing.[0] https://rbitr.github.io/ChartS.css/

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Worth remembering that as good as it is that Google is reducing it&#39;s abusive taxation on third party developers, the primary reason they&#39;re doing this is to try to quiet the majority of developers asking for stronger government regulations against this taxation without actually reducing their profit much, since the large companies which bring in the majority of revenue still have to pay full price.Basically, they&#39;re hoping that this will stop some app developers from demanding the right to use third party payment processors, which would likely be used many of the larger &gt;$1 million revenue publishers.The Android Police article about this cites an example from iOS, that &#34;On Apple&#39;s App Store, the 98% of developers who qualified for a lower revenue share rate were responsible for less than 5% of Apple&#39;s total collected revenue&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s also not being said here is that ~99% of apps on Google Play don&#39;t make money this way either.Due to a combination of Android user&#39;s reluctance to spend money on apps at all and the rampant piracy that Android&#39;s open model makes trivially easy, most developers only way to make money is through in-app advertising, which this change obviously makes no difference to.Google Play is mostly a pyramid scheme. Developer&#39;s can only make money from showing ads and at the same time can only get downloads if they place ads on other people&#39;s apps. And Google just happens to own all the mobile ad companies.This 15% cut ends up &#34;costing&#34; Google virtually nothing.And as for Google &#34;helping developers build sustainable businesses&#34;, the only times they&#39;ve ever reached out to me were to offer me the opportunity to have someone help me spend thousands of dollars a month on mobile ads. Never, for example, to actually take down all the scam apps that use my app&#39;s name, icon and screenshots."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Further evidence that developer pressure and legal pressure on smartphone platforms work, that they aren&#39;t a waste of time.Prolonged campaigns for better terms can make a tangible difference, and we should be encouraged by this result to advocate for even better terms. It turns out that when they have real pressure, it is possible for Google and Apple to come up with better terms.Keep in mind that the reason Google is being sued for antitrust isn&#39;t because it was taking 30% -- it&#39;s because it forced manufactures not to install or bundle any 3rd party stores by threatening to remove access to the Play store if any competing storefronts were enabled by default on consumer devices. So this doesn&#39;t change the original complaint, but it&#39;s still a very big win for smaller developers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"EGA Monkey Island is similarly beautiful.I feel EGA forced artists to work within the limitations of the available color palette, and good artists created awesome stuff (like shown in this case). Once they had VGA, some artists rushed to use every color gradient they could get away with, and this ruined their art till they got the hang of it.Something similar happened with the transition from pixel art to 3D games -- games were 3D because they had to, whether necessary or not. And many suffered from it. (Arguably, many still do!)Of course, I hold the extremist opinion that even some CGA (4 colors!) games were beautiful in their own way. I don&#39;t think more is always better, a lesson that seems to be lost on some game developers..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yeah. I never played this game, but the EGA scenes feel evocative and the VGA ones don&#39;t. Similar to the Loom discussion the other day.Mostly it feels like the EGA artist was better at dramatic lighting. For example, in the EGA version of the dead templar, the neck area is pure black for a reason: it makes the skull, the focal point of the image, stand out more. But in the VGA version they decided to paint something there, so the image became less focused."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of rose colored glasses here.Yes, looking back on the EGA graphics, there is definitely a level of skill and stylization that I took for granted at the time and have a certain nostalgia for, but when the VGA versions of these games came out they were all mind-blowing and you just kind of had to be there - no one was selecting the EGA option if they had a VGA card.I remember the VGA version of Indiana Jones in particular being awesome in VGA, on a CRT, live in motion."</p>

One worries all these new mechanical muscles (cars etc) will make horses unnecessary. The other horse reminds him that everything so far has made their lives easier - remember all that farm work? Remember running coast-to-coast delivering mail? Remember riding into battle? All terrible! These new city jobs are pretty cushy, and with so many humans in the cities there will be more jobs for horses than ever. Even if this car thingy takes off, he might say, there will be new jobs for horses we can&#39;t imagine.&gt; But you know what happened. There are still working horses, but nothing like before. The horse population peaked in 1915 - from that point on it was nothing but down.&gt; There&#39;s no law of economics that says that better technology makes more better jobs for horses.

Don&#39;t follow it&#39;s advice to kill yourself, for example).It really should be said that deep learning, in particular, is still just one technology that&#39;s very good at some things, kind of impressive but not functional at other things, and just unable to do other things (actual understanding of biology, for example, seems well beyond them). I don&#39;t think this situation has changed since deep learning began it&#39;s hype cycle (which isn&#39;t to say it&#39;s &#34;nothing&#34;, it just doesn&#39;t seem like to bring us &#34;everything&#34;, a scenario the article literally sketches).Automation has proceeded apace, automation in general has brought us enough resources right now to give minimal comfort to most people in the planet (as people have noted).But automation has generally succeeded in situations where everything is controlled - ie, factories. Self-driving cars are forever five years away given the 5% or 1% or whatever level of unpredictable variable involved. Progress on robots that can interact well with either humans or &#34;the messy real world&#34; even in very limited terms has been painfully slow and I expect this to continue."</p>

At my level, nothing I do affects the stock price, and most Googlers feel this way.Sure, I want Google to do well, and I want America to do well too. Both of them doing well benefits me.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Trying to speculate on the commercial bond market is exceedingly difficult and risky. Even the experts often take a beating. But using certain sectors of the bond market as a savings and retirement mechanism can be quite effective. Consider US tax-free municipal bonds (munies). They are safe, with defaults at a miniscule percentage of corporate bonds. And many are backed with third party insurance against defaults. Their returns are multiples of US Treasuries, CDs, money markets and savings accounts. And all distributions are tax exempt with the exception of any capital gains. Not very exciting. Sort of like watching grass grow. But it grows and grows. My own investments in this area are with: https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/overview/...edit: And by investing in munies you&#39;re also investing in US infrastructure. Munies fund all that stuff. Bridges, fire stations, schools, roads, water treatment plants, ports, electrical grids, etc, etc, etc. Might even make you feel like a good citizen..."</p>

Since people are confused, here is how StackOverflow handles of all of its web operations. If SO can run with this, so can your 0.33 req/minute app which is mostly doomed for failure. I am only half joking.StackOverflow architecture, current load (it will surprise you): https://stackexchange.com/performanceEverytime you go to SO, it hits one of these 9 web servers and all data on SO sits on those 2 massive SQL servers. That&#39;s pretty amazing.I want to be clear though, Horizontal scaling has a place in companies that has a team of corporate lawyers. Big. And in many many other scenarios for ETL and backend microservices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author is not lying. I&#39;ve been learning docker and it is certainly nice to pull and docker-compose up for local dev, but there is a lot to learn when you factor in orchestrators. And when I mean learn, I mean actually learning the nuts and bolts of a Dockerfile and not copy/pasting shit from the internet. While it&#39;s all helpful, its certainly not needed for the project we have at work, nor the &#34;microservices&#34; that our lead thinks we need even though they aren&#39;t even microservices. All we&#39;ve done is split our application into seperate mini applications that don&#39;t talk to eachother at all, essentially 4 web services. Great! Sigh.So why am I learning all this instead of just programming? Programming is what I really want to do all day, just writing code and thinking through software architecture. Because the industry tells me if I don&#39;t learn this stuff I will be decommissioned. Fun stuff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s super simple and it works for you - yeay! great!
If it will continue to work for you - double yeay!However, as soon as I read, I saw a lot of red flags:- Do you really want to copy from a development computer to your production?  No staging at all? (&#34;go test&#34; doesn&#39;t mean that you have 0 bugs)- Are you really sure that everything works exactly the same on different versions of GoLang? (Hey, a new guy in your company just installed unreleased Go 1.17, build on his notebook and pushed to production)?- That VM with systemd died at 1am. No customers for you until 7am (when you wake up)BTW. I am not saying that you should do Docker or CICD. The thing which I am saying that when you cut out from your process too much, you are increasing risks. (As an example, you didn&#39;t remove unit tests part. Based on &#34;Anything that doesn’t directly serve that goal is a complication&#34; you probably should have. However, you decided that it would be way too much risk)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Technically, what&#39;s going on here?&#34;CAID&#34; isn&#39;t a public iOS technology, and the article doesn&#39;t say what it means.Some googling returns: https://mmachina.cn/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MMA%E4%B8%AD%...Apparently it means &#34;CAA Advertising Id&#34;, where &#34;CAA&#34; appears to be the &#34;Creative Artists Agency&#34;, some sort of Chinese advertising group. (edit: wrong organization, it&#39;s actually &#34;Chinese Anonymization ID&#34;, not a group.  the group behind it is https://trackingio.com/)Searching &#34;CAA Advertising Id&#34; yields more Chinese PDFs.From what I can tell here, &#34;CAID&#34; is a partnership between Chinese industry and Chinese government to track users across apps for better tracking.The issue here does not seem to be that they&#39;ve bypassed a technical restriction, but that the developers of major apps are using a shared identifier that Apple doesn&#39;t like.In the US, the analogy would be if apps had tracking SDKs in them, that fingerprinted users across apps, in order to better target them for advertisements, and then the US government can pick up that data and do whatever they&#39;d like with it.The strange part to me, is that this actually is the situation today in the US.I don&#39;t want to shill for China, but why is this a story?  This has been a US industry since at least Doubleclick was invented.edit:It&#39;s a story because they&#39;re using the iOS keychain API to persist and share the tracking identifier.  As far as I know, this is a new technique in the wild, but has been theoretically possible since iOS launched.  It&#39;s only now being seen as necessary because of the iOS14 privacy changes.It&#39;s curious that American ad companies seem to understand Apple&#39;s intent and are opting not to risk their business by expanding their SDKs to use keychain sharing techniques, even though they&#39;re surely aware you can do this.  Chinese ad companies seem ok with risking their clients apps being banned on the app store.Apple can mitigate this by giving users control of the data and sharing related to keychain services."</p>

This was a quantum leap beyond Mapquest&#39;s page reload and reset with cumbersome arrow buttons.  This was a paradigm shift that let me explore a geography better than any book atlas.  I gave away all my atlases+ MS Window Media Player&#39;s ability to cleanly accelerate playback to 2x,3x,4x of audiobooks and tutorial videos for slow speakers.  MS Windows 7 had this long before Youtube&#39;s player had a 2x playback option.+ SQLite library : more than 10x improvement since I came from old school of writing custom formats for persisting data.  No more dumping memory structs to disk or writing b-trees in C Language from scratch.+ C++ STL in late 1990s.  Instantly reduced need to write custom data structures like linked-lists or in-house string libraries for common tasks+ VMware in 2000s : more than 10x productivity enhancement because I can play with malware in a virtual software sandbox instead of tediously re-imaging harddrives of air-gapped real physical machines+ Google Chrome in 2008 : 10x quality-of-life since misbehaving websites crashing don&#39;t bring down all the other tabs in my browsing session like Firefox/Opera.I probably have more than a hundred examples.  Some software tech 10x improvements are more diffused.  Reddit+HN websites are a much better use of my time than USENET newsgroups.  Youtube with recordings of tech conference presentations I can watch at 2x+ is a better used of my time than physically traveling to the site."</p>

Debugging JS in IE6 was like trying to build a house blindfolded with both arms tied behind your back. Firebug is when JS went from just a web augmentation toy that could silently fail and your web page would still mostly function to becoming a critical function for a web page (many will see this as all a big mistake)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here are a few that I did not see listed by others:1. Automatic device discovery and driver installation (e.g., with USB devices (also USB device categories, etc.)). Instead of trying to find a driver, things just worked.2. Automatic updates.  Keeping everything updated, largely, fell into the background.3. Graphical integrated development environments (IDEs) for software development.  I realize editors can be contentious, but tab completion of variable names, automatic identification of methods within scope, syntax highlighting, easily dropping breakpoints, etc. are, in my experience, wonderful improvements on productivity.4. What you see is what you get (WYSIWYG) text / image editors.  Thankfully, I did not spend much time in the prior era, but it was, at times, maddening to get something to format correctly.5. Ad blockers / reader modes. Again, I know these can be contentious, but, for me, these reformatting services are sometimes the only way to make some websites practically readable.I strongly second:-The rise of memory-managed languages (e.g., JAVA, C#, etc) with pretty robust default library sets, especially for string manipulation, graphics, and network operations.-Moving map software, especially for mobile GPS mapping.-Spreadsheet software.-Being able to easily search for answers to fairly technical programming problems, compiler errors, etc. along with better access to online documentation."</p>

Instead, their marketing keeps on comparing apples to oranges and just keeps on playing the privacy angle, which is intellectually dishonest because DDG and Google have completely different goals.Boy do I hope for some real competition in the search engine market. Brave and Neeva can&#39;t launch soon enough. I&#39;m so sick and tired of giving DDG changes upon changes only to switch back to Google because the results haven&#39;t improved much."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I guess the majority of people on HN already know this more or less. The problem is still this: We still don&#39;t have good alternatives to Google&#39;s products and services.1) Android: Google still owns all our phones. Even on rooted phones it hard to remove google services that god know send so many requests containing whatnot to the eeee addresses. Just install no-root firewall and you will be amazed the amount of pending requests that accumulate in 1 hour.2) Google search: I guess I can manage with DDG but when it&#39;s not that straight forward search, subconciosuly I&#39;m still thinking that let&#39;s just do a quick google search to see if i&#39;m not missing anything. And often I find better results. While adblocks makes sure I filter most of the crap.3) Gmail: Yes there are alternatives but switching emails is hard. It&#39;s a big commitment for most people to switch a 10 year old gmail address. And it still works great at filtering spam and whatnot.And same for maps, youtube and all their services.They really have a big leverage on everyone.Quiting facebook and instagram was child&#39;s play in comparison. I haven&#39;t logged in for almost an year now. Quitting google is really hard otoh."</p>

But it&#39;s a bit troublesome that it took a wealthy executive to get this anywhere politically, even after years of safe-use research and its prevalence as medical treatments:&gt; David Bronner, the top executive at Dr. Bronner’s soap company, helped bankroll the campaign, which had to overcome pandemic restrictions to gather signatures and get on the ballot last fall."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I support the move but the headline is kind of misleading. The ballot initiative was limited to directing the police chief to make these crimes the &#34;lowest priority&#34; but they are still just as illegal as before and carry the same penalties. I&#39;m not even sure this directive is binding. As the mayor (who did not particularly support the measure) pointed out, it&#39;s not like this was a high priority to begin with.A proper decriminalization or perhaps even legalization would have passed, but DC citizens lack the same rights over their own local laws that any other American living in a state would enjoy.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing that always seems to be missing from these videos (in general, because there are many of them) is step 0: how do you go about acquiring the land and the permission to build a log cabin on this land? I can&#39;t imagine that there&#39;s many countries in the world where there is no build code or other legislation regarding how or where buildings can be built. The last thing I&#39;d want to do is spend an entire year building something that I would then be legally obliged to tear down.If you&#39;re felling a large amount of trees in a forest, at the bare minimum you need the blessing of the land owner (if that isn&#39;t you). Most likely, you&#39;ll also need in addition to this a permit to fell trees to begin with, because land owners in most countries aren&#39;t free to simply fell any amount of trees they wish just because they own the land.It&#39;s obviously an impressive feat to build a log cabin from scratch, but since this step is so often completely omitted, I have to ask myself whether this is because it&#39;s considered too boring, or because there are people out there who think that as long as you go far enough into the woods, you can do whatever you want because no one will notice."</p>

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_ProennekeRichard Louis Proenneke (/ˈprɛnəkiː/; May 4, 1916 – April 20, 2003) was an American self-educated naturalist, conservationist, writer, and wildlife photographer who, from the age of about 53, lived alone for nearly thirty years (1969–1999) in the mountains of Alaska in a log cabin that he constructed by hand near the shore of Twin Lakes. Proenneke hunted, fished, raised and gathered his own food, and also had supplies flown in occasionally. He documented his activities in journals and on film, and also recorded valuable meteorological and natural data.[1][2] The journals and film were later used by others to write books and produce documentaries about his time in the wilderness."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another argument against the &#34;going dark&#34; claim is that before smartphones and the internet, the only conversations the FBI could monitor was through phonelines and mail. These were known to be easily monitored and I doubt there was much more criminal activity happening through those then than now.I would argue that the conversations that have gone online are the interactions that were previously happening in-person (at least in term of criminal activity), to which the FBI didn&#39;t have access before.There is something Orwellian with the idea that there shouldn&#39;t be a word that can be pronounced in the country that the government cannot record and listen to after the fact. The limits of what is legal or not have always moved (see homosexuality, drug and alcohol consumption, etc). So a 100% enforcement of the law is counter-intuitively undesirable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I dont understand why the US people still trust these agencies. FBI, CIA, NSA have all shown to act against the democracy in many cases. If they could be trusted, they could be trusted with a backdoor. Since they cannot be trusted, the backdoor only makes them a more dangerous enemy of the people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article&#39;s title is a little misleading, but I agree with their overarching message.Law enforcement should never be given the easy way out in terms of breaking encryption. Asking for backdoors to be installed in every device is extremely lazy police work. I&#39;m sure there are other ways of breaking encryption like the rubber-hose technique (of course with valid arrest warrant).Arguing that law enforcement should stop attacking encryption because it jeopardises privacy seems a little naive to me. What about criminals that profit from creating spyware? In fact, allowing law enforcement to actively research new ways to break encryption can be productive for improving security in the long run. Stop using weak passwords people."</p>

At least that&#39;s my feeling.That said, I was shocked to see that the example code did heap-allocations to store integers. Single integers, one per allocation, per &#34;counting bucket&#34;. I would store the count in the data pointer without a second thought, I just &#34;can&#39;t&#34; make 4/8-byte heap allocations and still sleep at night. Especially after all the concern about processing the input in large blocks for performance! Casting an integer to/from a void pointer should be pretty safe according to my gut feel. If that turns out to be false, I would dump the libc&#39;s hash API altogether, since it makes me do heap allocations to store single integers.I tried making the change locally, and the time taken (as measured with the OP&#39;s benchmarking program) dropped from 0.11 to 0.10 on my system (a Dell laptop running an Intel i5-7300). That&#39;s at least something."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is definitely the most interesting part of the article for me:Incidentally, this problem set the scene for a wizard duel between two computer scientists several decades ago. In 1986, Jon Bentley asked Donald Knuth to show off “literate programming” with a solution to this problem, and he came up with an exquisite, ten-page Knuthian masterpiece. Then Doug McIlroy (the inventor of Unix pipelines) replied with a one-liner Unix shell version using tr, sort, and uniq.http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2011/12/more-shell-less-egg..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Knuth-McIlroy comes up a lot.  Previous discussion [1].  For this example I can make a very similar Nim program [2] run almost exactly the same speed as `wc -w`, yet the optimized C program runs 1.2x faster not 1.15x slower than `wc -w` - a 1.4x discrepancy - bigger than many ratios in the table.  So, people should be very cautious about conclusions from any of this.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24817594[2] https://github.com/c-blake/adix/blob/master/tests/wf.nim"</p>

Almost none of them could get a job as a software engineer at their own company, if they had to, because they would be completely unqualified. And I&#39;m not looking down my nose at anyone: I have an undergraduate degree in CS, but I got it 16 years ago and then went to law school, and there is not a serious place on earth that would let me touch their codebase. But if I started a really valuable company tomorrow (maybe I should), I would code as a software engineer on this list.I mean, come at it from the other direction: Why are there so many software engineers who are not successful CEOs? My God, they have the secrets of for loops, S-expressions, they know about vim---and yet they aren&#39;t running Pfizer? Why not?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, talk about assuming correlation implies causation.I think the obvious lesson here is when society becomes reoriented around a new field (in this case software), people with experience in that field are going to do well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What this seems to show is that CEOs in a particular sector often have expertise in that sector. And that Tech is currently the most highly valued sector as measured by market capitalisation. To find evidence of Software Engineers being the best CEOs overall you&#39;d really need to find examples of them running non-tech firms successfully or examples of non-Software Engineers running tech firms poorly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I use this feature. On a large monitor, Firefox wastes quite a lot of space with the default layout. To be honest, I wish there was an option to make it more compact than the &#34;compact&#34; layout. There used to be an XUL extension to do this, before XUL was killed off.Seems like every time I see coverage about Firefox, it&#39;s Mozilla removing or crippling some feature I care about.Why bother using FF at this point? Most sites don&#39;t work as well, and Mozilla seems actively hostile to my use case. If I&#39;m going to use a browser that is hostile to me, I may as well get better website compatibility out of the bargain.Not surprised their market share keeps shrinking.

The wording of the bugzilla specifically says&gt;  The &#34;Compact&#34; density is a feature of the &#34;Customize toolbar&#34; view which is currently fairly hard to discover, and we assume gets low engagement.So not only do they not have telemetry for that, they aren&#39;t even attempting to make it more discoverable to test if there&#39;s a correlation between &#34;hard to discover&#34; and &#34;low engagement&#34;?I would use this but never knew this could be changed."</p>

They&#39;ve been randomly removing features, or even plain butchering their  products (eg the recent Firefox mobile update) for several years, and all they probably achieved is to lose more and more users.Yet with their tiny market share they aren&#39;t exactly in a position to lose users."</p>

It is without a doubt the best source of this information and the app being unavailable significantly affects the day to day lives of a significant portion of the South African population who use it to plan around these power outages.While the app also has a &#34;chat&#34; feature, it&#39;s really tangental to the primary purpose of the app and I expect that most users of the app, like myself, don&#39;t use that feature at all and only care about knowing when they will be without electricity.In case you&#39;re wondering why they hell we have load shedding, it&#39;s because Eskom is grossly incompetent.

This structure results in very large but sparse graphs, and there are factor graph optimization libraries that take advantage of this sparsity (e.g. g2o or GTSAM.)

I can&#39;t say it will definitely help because the vaccine rollout is so slow and air travel is so fast that this negative pressure will probably provoke more variants as long as host numbers remain high.ref: &#34;Antibody Resistance of SARS-CoV-2 Variants B.1.351 and B.1.1.7&#34; [pdf] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03398-2_reference... https://i.imgur.com/8co1IoL.jpg &#34;SARS-CoV-2 VoC B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 neutralization evasion&#34; table.https://covariants.org/variants/S.501Y.V2 https://covariants.org/variants/S.501Y.V3"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps unpopular opinion, but the US vaccination system is about the worst when it comes to preventing spread.  Instead, it seems to be attempting to prevent death.I&#39;ve always argued that preventing spread would as a byproduct prevent death, but I&#39;m obviously not studied in the field.Put shortly, I would have vaccinated college kids and working age folks first.  They are not likely to die from it, but are far more likely to spread it than elderly and severely diseased folks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I started free diving for abalone along the Sonoma coast in 2008. The first few years of diving were plentiful and majestic. But my friends and I noticed the changes around 2015. Less sunflower stars and star fish. After some red tide events, the abalone die offs were crazy. Coves that used to have abs stacked on top of each other were almost empty. Finding a 9” abalone became a chore. The thinner kelp forests meant less fish, less life. It’s been difficult to watch first hand. I get sad thinking about the reality that my children will most likely never see the underwater forests that filled my soul and gave me a deep love of the ocean. I hope we can help the system get back in balance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been diving in the Monterey, CA region since 1999 and have seen the change first hand. Sunflower sea stars are now extinct in the area; I haven&#39;t seen one in years. Some of the smaller sea star species have started to gradually recover but they aren&#39;t effective at preying on purple urchins. There is a local group culling urchins but they&#39;ll only be able to cover a small area.https://g2kr.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One reason we don&#39;t have kelp forests in Oregon is due to sea otters having been wiped out, which kept the urchins at bay.[0]Unfortunately, according to OPs article:Others have suggested bringing in another kelp forest predator, the sea otter, to help fight back the urchins. The problem with this appears to be that sea otters aren’t so interested in the skinny, starved urchins occupying the most barren areas, reports Anuradha Varanasi for Inverse. A separate study published this week in the journal the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests the otters do eat urchins but that they prefer the more well-fed residents of the coast’s remaining kelp forests to the so-called “zombie urchins” clinging to life in the denuded barrens.[0] - https://oregonwild.org/about/blog/lost-sea-otters-oregon-par..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This emulator currently has the most complete guest audio renderer implementations, as they just finished a project of doing an in depth reversing of that portion of the firmware. [0]Getting it to work with the host os(windows usually) can have minor issues with output in rare circumstances, or when a game is still not running the proper speed, but they&#39;ve ironed out the major ones.-----------------------    This is my requiem, I present to you Amadeus, a complete reimplementation of the Audio Renderer!
    This reimplementation is based on my reversing of every version of the audio system module that I carried for the past 10 months.
    This supports every revision (at the time of writing REV1 to REV8 included) and all features proposed by the Audio Renderer on real hardware.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why wouldn&#39;t one create and emulator for this using QEMU? Couldn&#39;t that be possible? Doesn&#39;t a bunch of hardware faking have to be rebuilt in C# that QEMU already does (well¿)?  Or is it too hard to introduce custom hardware/firmware (like this audio stuff) into QEMU?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In terms of single-player games, the figure is more like 85%. You can probably get an additional 5% to work with various levels of tweaking, but compatibility is remarkably good these days. Many games perform better on Linux than they do on Windows (Borderlands, Overwatch), while others give you a chance to have a flawless experience with games that are pretty busted on modern Windows (Diablo 2, Fallout: New Vegas). As another commenter mentioned, the big issue is with anti-cheat: any game implementing EAC will outright not work, full stop. That makes it about a 50/50 chance that multiplayer titles will work on Linux, with some unfortunate casualties like Rainbow Six Siege and Halo MCC&#39;s online multiplayer.With that being said, I truly and honestly believe Linux is the way to go if you&#39;re not into multiplayer. Valve&#39;s commitment to Linux is nothing short of herculean, and it&#39;s heartwarming to see them give back to the open source community in such a remarkable way. If it weren&#39;t for Proton (and DXVK), I&#39;d still be using Windows on my main computer, which made development hell. Now, I feel comfortable moving to a system where I can enjoy Overwatch, Titanfall and Team Fortress on a regular basis without dual-booting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know it&#39;s not the topic here so apologies for the digression, but the Mac compatibility on this list is somewhat misleading. Games like TF2 don&#39;t actually work on the Mac any longer unless you stay on or downgrade to Mojave. And even then, the performance and bugginess leaves much to be desired.If you&#39;re using this article at all to make decisions around a Mac for gaming, dive a little deeper to make sure the game you want to play works on Catalina+ (generally requires a full 64 bit port).Back to the actual topic: I had no idea Proton got this good. That&#39;s quite an achievement for Linux gaming. What&#39;s the state of modern GPU support?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was really annoyed when Rocket League dropped native support for Linux, but it turned out it runs much better on my potato under Proton. My only concern now is that they&#39;ll add anti-cheat to it (even though there&#39;s there no real need for it) and Linux will become flagged. The fact that they moved the game to only be available to new players via the Epic client has me worried they&#39;re moving in that direction."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A big :+1: for running Docker containers with `--read-only`, forcing you to use explicit writeable volume/bind mounts for all writable data... it&#39;s not just the security benefits, you can also avoid entire classes of problems like:* minimizing the difference between `docker restart` (preserves overlayfs changes) and container re-creates (resets overlayfs back to the image state)* surprise data loss on container redeployments because data was unexpectedly being written to the overlayfs instead of a volume* unexpectedly running out of disk space in `/var/lib/docker` because data was being written outside of a volume* performance issues caused by excessive overlayfs writes (storage drivers and /var/lib/docker not necessarily designed for IO performance)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"All of these isolation techniques (and much more) can be used inside systemd units. Write your .service as usual, then run this command on it:  $ systemd-analyze security service-name

It prints out a long list of hardening flags that can be applied inside of your service, like so:    NAME                                                        DESCRIPTION                                                             EXPOSURE
   PrivateNetwork=                                             Service has access to the host&#39;s network                                     0.5
   User=/DynamicUser=                                          Service runs as root user                                                    0.4
   CapabilityBoundingSet=~CAP_SET(UID|GID|PCAP)                Service may change UID/GID identities/capabilities                           0.3
   CapabilityBoundingSet=~CAP_SYS_ADMIN                        Service has administrator privileges                                         0.3
  ...

Here&#39;s what I typically use for a .NET 5 application:  WorkingDirectory        = /opt/appname/app
  ReadWritePaths          = /opt/appname/data
  UMask                   = 0077
  LockPersonality         = yes
  NoNewPrivileges         = yes
  PrivateDevices          = yes
  PrivateMounts           = yes
  PrivateTmp              = yes
  PrivateUsers            = yes
  ProtectClock            = yes
  ProtectControlGroups    = yes
  ProtectHome             = yes
  ProtectHostname         = yes
  ProtectKernelLogs       = yes
  ProtectKernelModules    = yes
  ProtectKernelTunables   = yes
  ProtectSystem           = strict
  RemoveIPC               = yes
  RestrictAddressFamilies = AF_UNIX AF_INET AF_INET6
  RestrictNamespaces      = yes
  RestrictRealtime        = yes
  RestrictSUIDSGID        = yes
  SystemCallArchitectures = native
  ProtectProc             = invisible
  CapabilityBoundingSet   =
  SystemCallFilter        = ~@clock @module @mount @raw-io @reboot @swap @privileged @cpu-emulation @obsolete

ReadWritePaths should be replaced with a combination of DynamicUser + writing local persistent data to $STATE_DIRECTORY, but I&#39;m too lazy to do that yet.See systemd.exec(5) for more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use Hadolint[1] as a CI job to check if my Dockerfiles follow the good &#34;rules&#34;. But there is one rule that annoys me the most and which is also present in this article, is the pinned OS package version rule[2]. While I understand its interest, I struggle to handle this problem.When I build new images and it fails because the pinned version is not available anymore, I have to dig into Debian or Ubuntu packages websites to find the new ones as they don&#39;t keep the old packages online.I know I could ask Hadolint to ignore this rule but I don&#39;t like this and I think it&#39;s important to stick to a certain version of a package to avoid problems. I&#39;m just trying to find any tip that could make me use pinned version and avoid this manual search every time I have to. Does apt-get install allows wildcard for example?1: https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint2: https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint/wiki/DL3008"</p>
