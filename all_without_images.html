								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"During a centralisation of public school local servers to a data centre, I created a consolidated library enquiry system. It served over 2,000 libraries, had 330 million titles, and had about a million users. It was efficient enough to run off my laptop, if need be.AFAIK it was one of the top five biggest library systems in the world at the time.I was asked to add some features that would have been too difficult in the old distributed system. Things like reading competitions, recommended reading lists by age, etc…I watched the effect of these changes — which took me mere days of effort to implement — and the combined result was that students read about a million additional books they would not have otherwise.I’ve had a far greater effect on the literacy of our state than any educator by orders of magnitude and hardly anyone in the department of education even knows my name!This was the project that made realise how huge the effort-to-effect ratio that can be when computers are involved…"</p>

Still used to this day.Failover of IP in ATM switches (VVRP, PXE, secondary DHCP, secondary DNS, secondary LDAP, secondary NFS). While not invented here, it is still used today as this is a Common setup to this day.Printer drivers for big, big high-speed Xerox printers on BSD. Still used to this day by big, big high-speed printers.Also, early IDS products (pre-Snort) at line-speed.  Sold to Netscreen.Easy zero-setup of DSL modem before some BellCore decided to complicate things (thus exploding their field deployment budgets; Southwestern Bell/Qwest enjoyed our profitable zero-setup). Sold to Siemens.1Gps IDS/IPS before selling it to 3Com/Hewlett-Packard Packard.Now, I&#39;m dabbling in a few startups (JavaScript HIDS, Silent Connections, replacing the systemd-temp).Impact?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to grow my own in Australia, as a hobby, patience is the hardest part really. 5-7 years after planting seems to be needed.At one stage I was the northern most producer of truffles (very few produced actually but I only had 40 trees and didn&#39;t really look after them to the utmost detail) in the southern hemisphere, then a guy 150km further north, and in soil that was near total sand, got some to grow. This was totally unexpected.It seems the conditions required are not quite so special as thought, and some totally unsuited conditions (as previously thought) might be good due to reduced competition from other fungi.The action of inoculating trees is simple as well, get a ripe couple of real truffles, blender them up and pour it over the small saplings in pots, if the mycorrhizal sets in you can see it as white bits on the roots. (I think you need two, but not even sure on that).A wide range of trees will work, oak, hazel, cork to name a few. There is a preferred pH range for the soil, as would be expected for all fungi pH has a strong role to play.There has been a lot of secrecy enshrouding the whole game for a long time.I refer only to Tuber melanosporum in the above, I am not sure anyone has been able to get the white truffles growing out of the wild, there will be some special condition or symbiosis with an animal or something that is needed, but not understood yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe 5 years ago I was hanging out with a buddy and we took an angle grinder to an empty propane tank. When we were finished, we smelled uniquely awful. It turns out that added to propane is a tiny amount of the odourant Ethyl Mercaptan. Now when you’re using propane you get just enough of a whiff of it to remind you that you’re using propane, but if you get a smell of the inside of an empty propane tank? Well, something about the liquid propane residue that remains, some miracle of science and chemistry, creates a density of Ethyl Mercaptan that is shocking. Room-fillingly shocking. Clothes throwing away shocking. Many showers worth of shocking.A couple years ago I had my first “truffle” experience with some truffle cheese and was like cutting back into that propane tank. Not the same in scale, but certainly in type. Tremendously similar smells. Since then I’ve been sad and thought I just managed to ruin truffles for myself. This article has given me hope."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m French and I live in France. Here, most of our truffles are real truffle.We do get some Tuber aestivum as well, but that&#39;s alright because they&#39;re displayed as &#34;truffe d&#39;été&#34;. No harm done.As the article said, the &#34;truffle flavour&#34; has nothing to do with the real stuff, and outside of France, Italy and Spain, you probably won&#39;t get them on the market. You might be lucky in some restaurants all over Europe. But everywhere else it&#39;s propably not the &#34;real&#34; black truffle. Especially, if they put some in ketchup..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"2038 is going to be an interesting year that’s for sure. I’m big into Final Fantasy VII modding/speedrunning and while reverse engineering the game I stumbled upon some code that actually checks if the current date is before 2038. If it’s not it refuses to run. I have no idea why they put this kind of check in the game&#39;s code, I tried to remove it but the game actually still didn’t start so there is probably some issue that prevents it from working when the date overflows.I can only imagine that a lot of other legacy software will have similar issues when we reach year 2038."</p>

Possible, but unlikely. A virus wants to spread, not limit its opportunities to do so.After investigating, I was able to determine that the system clock somehow had gotten set past 2038 and this was sufficient to destroy network connectivity. As soon as it was corrected, everything was fine again.Not the first time I have run into a clock issue breaking software.We are lucky 2038 is still 16 years away and not next month."</p>

Chickens aren&#39;t just about a few bock-bock and cockle-doodle-doos. They have a rich set of physical expressions as well (flap flaps, head kicks, grating the soil, etc) and a vibrant culture that is transmitted between generations. Their philosophy on death and their capacity to always see life on the sunny-side is both unique and deep, the fruit of seeing their children being picked for food on a daily basis. This should be celebrated.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; rainbow palette for use in my data visualisations.Indeed for her kind of data the rainbow palette works okay. But if you have to visualize more complex / denser data, beware of the pitfalls of the rainbow color palette. It is not always the best choice.IBM did research back in the 90s on perceptually-based colormaps and how to best represent various types of data within the color dimensions of luminescence, saturation and hue [1]. For example, they found that,(1) Hue was not a good dimension for encoding magnitude information, i.e. rainbow color maps are bad.(2) The mechanisms in human vision responsible for high spatial frequency information processing are luminance channels. If the data to be represented have high spatial frequency, use a color map which has a strong luminance variation across the data range.(3) For interval and ratio data, both luminance- and saturation-varying color maps should produce the effect of having equal steps in data value correspond to equal perceptual steps, but the first will be most effective for high spatial frequency data variations and the second will be most effective for low spatial frequency variations.===[1] the original link got removed from IBMs website.

Furthermore, our journey to democracy has not been smooth - the last 10 years were marred by massive corruption.Through all of this, our constitutional rights to freedom of expression, and freedom of press, has stayed sound.  We have had multiple instances where journalists reported on some nefarious action and were intimidated or even legally threatened by authorities.  However, our courts have, for the most part, sided with our freedom of expression and press rights.  The South African government has had quite a couple of punches on the nose in our courts ;-).I have read most of the comments in this thread.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a software engineer who works on genomics. I see a lot of negativity in this thread, which mirrors my experience: in most places, you&#39;ll be paid like a researcher with the respect of a lab assistant – unless you have a PhD and a postdoc.That said, it&#39;s possible find work that&#39;s respected and pays well. Most of that kind of work is happening in the context of startups or freelancing. My favorite example of this is Robert Edgar: he&#39;s a freelance computational biologist with over 100k citations who has made a living for the past 20 years by selling licenses to his bioinformatics software (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RzVMRc0AAAAJ).To find those kinds of jobs, I&#39;d try YC&#39;s Work at a Startup, Flagship Pioneering&#39;s portfolio companies, and emailing founders of companies that have a bioinformatics component (my email is in my profile!).I think the issues with the field are because it&#39;s a new and growing space. We do need better tooling, respect for engineering, and established best practices, but that seems to have been the case in the past for other domains that moved from research to industry – including software engineering itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Usually, scientific oriented companies or organizations have little regard for software as a domain, craft, etc. It’s just a thing that gets in the way, despite being vital. It’s almost just a utility to them rather than a differentiator and active component of the advanced work going on.For example, the Broad Institute is super interesting, but having applied there several times, they are esoteric, to say the least, in their hiring. They pay well below market, and their process is opaque and slow and sometimes downright non-communicative. They are also not really open to remote work, so you gotta move there and commute to the heart of Cambridge. Budgets are set by folks maybe a couple years out of a PhD program, who will also make technical decisions in terms of the software design (the latter an assumption given my experience in similar places).These organizations are also pretty traditional in their selection of stacks. Good luck trying to use a functional-first  language, aside from maybe Scala (usually lots of Java stacks), and be prepared to write lots of Python, the only language that exists to many scientists. I once saw a Python signature (function name and arguments) spill over 10-20 lines, in a file over 10,000 lines long. They had given up on another software stack because “it wasn’t working for them”.This is all painting with broad strokes, of course. But I think scientific organizations that would embrace software as a major component of their technological and scientific development would do well. There’s a lot of opportunity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve worked on genomics, at the Broad. Can confirm there is a ton of toxicity. There&#39;s also a lot of smart and great people, if you can find a team specifically dedicated to software I would recommend it. Also the pay is good...for a non-profit.More broadly...shortages like this aren&#39;t because SWEs just love ad-tracking and hate health improvements. People need to be willing to pay for these services (case in point; the jobs link for AWS has 3 links which appear unrelated to genomics, for Microsoft there are 2 for interns, and for Google its empty).There are a lot of opportunities in biotech for SWEs, and many firms (though not all) really do respect the power of software. Worth looking around if you&#39;re interested in the area."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"MMM deserves all the attention it gets, but there&#39;s more!1. I&#39;ve got to track down the source of the quote (it may be the linked video), but Brooks has said that the most important architectural decision he made was to have an eight bit byte rather than the cheaper 7 bits (Edit: 6 bits) being considered for the IBM 360. To call that influential is an understatement.2. And he has said the most important management decision was sending Ted Codd to graduate school, where Codd laid the foundation for what became relational databases.3. A paper [0] he co-authored with Amdahl and Blaauw introduced the term &#39;architecture&#39; to computer hardware, later borrowed for software. From the first page:  &#34;The term architecture is used here to describe the attributes of a system as seen by the programmer, i.e., the conceptual structure and functional behavior, as distinct from the organization of the data flow and controls, the logical design, and the physical implementation.&#34;He gave an interesting talk at the 50th anniversary of the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) a few years ago, [1][0] &#39;Architecture of the IBM System/360&#39;, Amdahl, Blaauw, Brooks.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StN49re9Nq8"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My one email exchange with Brooks had nothing to do with Mythical Man Month.In the 1990s I was was the junior co-founder and, for a while, main developer of VMD, a program for molecular visualization. I wanted to include molecular surface visualization, but me being me, would rather integrate someone else&#39;s good work.I looked around and found &#34;Surf&#34;, a molecular surface solver written by Amitabh Varshney when he was at the University of North Carolina. (See &#34;Computing Smooth Molecular Surfaces&#34;, IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/310720 .)Brooks, you may not know, heard Sutherland talk about using the screen as a window into another world, which got Brooks interested in VR. Back in the 1970s, at UNC, they started experimenting with head-mounted displays. Brooks worked on VR for the rest of his career.The UNC VR group worked on many different VR approaches, including haptic (tactile) feedback. As I recall, the first was a used hydraulic-powered robot arm. People had to wear a lab coat and helmet when using it because it would leak, and had a tendency to hit people.One of the experiments, the NanoManipulator, hooked up the VR and haptic feedback (not that same robot!) to an atomic-force microscope, so people could feel the surface and move nanoscale objects around. http://www.warrenrobinett.com/nano/ .Brooks felt that VR would be very useful for molecular visualization, and developed the GRIP Molecular Graphics Resource. Quoting https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA236598.pdf , some of its early achievements were &#34;the first molecular graphics system on which a protein was solved without a physical model&#34;, &#34;using remote manipulator technology to enable users to feel molecular forces&#34;, and &#34;Real-time, user-steered volume visualization of an electron density map&#34;.As that document points out, their goal was to &#34;wildcat radical new molecular graphics ideas to the prototype stage. Winning ideas are spun off to the thriving commercial industry or into autonomous research projects.&#34;Surf fit very well in those lines, as VMD was an &#34;autonomous research project&#34;.My exchange with Brooks and UNC was 1) to get permission to distribute Surf as part of the VMD distribution, and, 2) a few years later, to provide numbers about how many people had downloaded VMD with Surf."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In a previous thread, I had this at &#34;more than 10 years, less than 60&#34; (yeah, that&#39;s an easy bet to make!). The core driver of the sentence is probably the guidelines 2B1.1 table, which scales sentencing levels by economic losses. She was convicted for something like $140MM in fraudulent losses, which by themselves ask for a 24-level escalation (the table maxes out in the mid-40s).By the numbers, the court was probably quite lenient here. Not to say that&#39;s an unjust outcome; the &#34;lenient&#34; option for sentencing on serious federal felonies is still quite harsh.EditI tracked down the prosecutor&#39;s sentencing memorandum; they asked for 15 years. So I guess maybe not that lenient.Later editThe PSR (the court&#39;s own sentencing memorandum, which the prosecution and defense respond to) had Holmes at level 43. I hereby claim that I called this. :PBut the PSR looks at the guidelines level table, which suggests 960 months for level 43, and instead recommends 108 months. So the court imposed a sentence higher than the PSR, lower than the prosecution asked, and all parties asked for much lower than the guideline maximum for the level.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29790880Later later editI&#39;m doing the math wrong; the guidelines range at that level is 240 months per charge (usually served consecutively). Still much higher than the ultimate sentence."</p>

It solves IP exhaustion, NAT, and IP privacy at the cost of an extra hop and no UDP.The big question is going to be pricing. The current top player in this space is Cloudflare Tunnel, which is a loss-leader product that technically forbids selfhosting anything other than HTML sites.Selfhosting media can use tons of bandwidth.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In 2015 I was working at a &#34;fintech&#34; company and a leap second was announced. It was scheduled for a Wednesday, unlike all others before which had happened on the weekend, when markets were closed.When the previous leap second was applied, a bunch of our Linux servers had kernel panics for some reason, so needless to say everyone was really concerned about a leap second happening during trading hours.So I was assigned to make sure nothing bad would happen. I spent a month in the lab, simulating the leap second by fast forwarding clocks for all our different applications, testing different NTP implementations (I like chrony, for what it&#39;s worth). I had heaps of meetings with our partners trying to figure out what their plans were (they had none), and test what would happen if their clocks went backwards. I had to learn about how to install the leap seconds file into a bunch of software I never even knew existed, write various recovery scripts, and at one point was knee-deep in ntpd and Solaris kernel code.After all that, the day before it was scheduled, the whole trading world agreed to halt the markets for 15 minutes before/after the leap second, so all my work was for nothing. I&#39;m not sure what the moral is here, if there is one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Currently software has to be built to accommodate leap seconds. They happen frequently enough that you&#39;ll find out within a few years whether your software breaks when time suddenly skips forward or backward.If we kick the can down the road such that eventually we&#39;ll need to add a leap minute, we&#39;re going to end up with software that was never written to expect time to change in such a way, hasn&#39;t had a real world test of the change for decades, and will have no one working on the software who ever had to deal with such a change.It&#39;s going to be much worse for software reliability to have a leap minute on the order of once a century than a leap second every few years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hot take…Storing anything as UTC was a mistake and we should be using TAI for all storage and computation, only transforming into more human friendly formats for display to end users. This never needed to be a problem except we decided to make it harder to use TAI than UTC and so everything got built up off the backs of legacy bios level hardware supported UTC style clock behaviour, when we should have been using TAI from the start. Yes I know it would have been harder, but we got off our collective asses and decided to fix our short sighted decision making for Y2K date storage, why not this… if it truly costs as much for everyone to endure a leap second why wasn’t it just fixed from the bottom up and rebuilt correctly!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a vegetarian for well over a decade, I&#39;ve always said the same thing. Meat isn&#39;t nearly as egregiously unhealthy as it&#39;s panned if at all. Processed foods, excessive simple carbohydrates and sugars are the main evils in the kitchen, but there are a variety of reasons to eat less meat too.There&#39;s nuance in all of this. People sympathetic to American consumption patterns will probably see science and explanations like this as some kind of endorsement of their diet. Nutritional science is still in its infancy and we&#39;ll be waffling on the specifics for decades to come, especially if food companies have a vested interest in funding studies.Another data point. Just eat minimally processed whole foods as often as possible, diversify your plate and moderate your intake. I think people are too hyper focused on the &#34;super&#34; and &#34;evil&#34; quality of foods and we end up stuck in the margins bike-shedding the minutia."</p>

Moreover, we found no evidence of an association between unprocessed red meat and ischemic stroke or hemorrhagic stroke. We also found that while risk for the six outcomes in our analysis combined was minimized at 0 g unprocessed red meat intake per day, the 95% uncertainty interval that incorporated between-study heterogeneity was very wide: from 0–200 g d−1. While there is some evidence that eating unprocessed red meat is associated with increased risk of disease incidence and mortality, it is weak and insufficient to make stronger or more conclusive recommendations. More rigorous, well-powered research is needed to better understand and quantify the relationship between consumption of unprocessed red meat and chronic disease.

Obviously these don&#39;t apply to FTX but the truly shocking thing here is the likes of Sequoia and other sophisticated investors did not require an adult in the room in the form of a CFO.They literally handed billions of dollars to a 20-something with absolutely no supervision or accountability. I would not be surprised if this lack of oversight doesn&#39;t land them in court from customers and other investors. You may think they are shielded from this through limited liability and corporate structures but that doesn&#39;t innoculate them against tort claims and you could probably make the case they are recklessly negligent or even as far as being liable in conspiracy to commit fraud (before or after the fact).SBF engaged in on-the-record messages with a reporter about this.

Specter outperformed GPT-3 on tasks like citation prediction two years ago. Nobody seriously uses general LLMs on science tasks, so nobody who actually wants to use this cares about your benchmarks.

If you underperform some that&#39;s fine!

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love softcore FP (immutability, first-class functions, etc), but I always get the impression that hardcore FP, like in this article, is about reimplementing programming language concepts on top of the actual programming language used.The pipe feels like a block of restricted statements, `peekErr` and `scan` recreate conditionals, the Maybe monad behaves like a try-catch here, etc.Of course there are differences, like `map` working on both lists and tasks, as opposed to a naive iteration. That&#39;s cool. But this new programming language comes with limitations, like the difficulty in peeking ahead or behind during the list iteration, reusing data between passes, and not to mention the lost tooling, like stack traces and breakpoints.I&#39;ve written many (toy) programming languages, the process is exactly like this article. And it feels awesome. But I question the wisdom of presenting all this abstract scaffolding as a viable Javascript solution, as opposed to a Javascripter&#39;s introduction to Haskell or Clojure, where this scaffolding is the language."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One take away from functional programming that I have incorporated into my Java (and C#) code: If/When possible, never (ever ever!!!) re-assign a local variable.  (Rare exception: Classic C-style for-loop iteration with mutable `i` integer variable.)  Really, really, I am not trolling / not a joke.  How / Why?  How?  All primative parameter value must be final, e.g., `final iint level`, and local variables must always be final.  Why?  Final vars are significantly easier to &#34;reason about&#34; when reading code, as compared to non-final (mutable) vars.  If you are using containers, always, always, always use immutable containers from Google Guava unless you have an exceptionally good reason.  Yes, the memory overhead will be higher, but big enterprise corps do not care about adding 4/8/16 extra GB RAM to host your Java / C# app.  Yes, I know that any `Object` in Java is potentially mutable.  As a work-around, try to make all `Object`s immutable where possible.  On the surface, the whole thing / exercise feels like a terrible Computer Science nitemare.  In practice, it becomes trivial to convert code from single-threaded to multi-threaded because most of your data classes are already &#34;truly&#34; final."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m sure this is a wonderful intellectual exercise in computer science and math, but if this is to be the advertisement in favor of functional programming, I wouldn&#39;t consider myself a customer.You start out with code that will not win any beauty awards but it gets the job done. It&#39;s easy to understand by programmers of any seniority, it&#39;s simple to debug and reasonably easy to put in an automatic unit test.Next, you add all kinds of vague, poorly named meta utilities that don&#39;t seem to solve any tangible real world problem. You even mess with built-in JS methods like map. The code is now harder to understand and more difficult to debug.A massive pain is added for some theoretical purity that few even understand or will benefit from. I&#39;ll double down on my rebellion by stating that the portability of code is overrated.Here we&#39;re writing code to format notification objects. In our overengineering mindset, we break this down into many pieces and for each piece consider reusability outside this context to be of prime importance.Why though? Why not just solve the problem directly without these extra self-inflicted goals? The idea that this is a best practice is a disease in our industry.Most code that is written prematurely as reusable, will in fact never be reused outside its original context. And even if it is reused, that doesn&#39;t mean that outcome is so great.Say that the sub logic to format a user profile link turned out to be needed outside this notification context. Our foresight to have made it reusable in the first place was solid. Now two completely different functional contexts are reusing this logic. Next, the marketing department goes: well actually...you need to add a tracking param specifically for links in the notification context, and only there.Now your &#34;portability&#34; is a problem. There&#39;s various ways to deal with it, and I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll pick the most complicated one in the name of some best practice.After 20 years in the industry, you know how I would write the logic? A single method &#34;formatNotification&#34;. It wouldn&#39;t weirdly copy the entire object over and over again, it would directly manipulate the object, one piece at a time. Error checking is in the method as well. You can read the entire logic top to bottom without jumping into 7 files. You can safely make changes to it and its intuitive to debug. Any junior would get it in about 2 minutes.Clear, explicit code that requires minimum cognitive parsing."</p>

Automated tooling and tests that were ostensibly created to make life easier were the number one pain point and constantly failed in obscure ways that required cutting tickets to teams responsible for the automation.More often than not these tickets would be ignored and issues would persist for weeks beyond what&#39;s reasonable.I&#39;d actually force myself to write even trivial code on weekends to ensure my ability to develop didn&#39;t atrophy as a result of lack of use.That, paired with the awful corporate culture and constant fear of PIP/job loss forced me to finally leave.Generally a very unpleasant experience all around, sans the compensation and name on the resume."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; but also a job that made me feel more unhappy than any other job I’ve ever had.I can relate. I worked for many years for one &#34;those&#34; companies that is a household name. The pay wasn&#39;t outstanding, and the job was not one that gave me much fulfillment, but it was at a marquee brand. My business card opened a lot of doors.When that job finally ended (after almost 27 years), I started looking at working for other companies. I would have been a particularly good fit for startups, as I was financially secure (thus, didn&#39;t need to be paid too much), and have a huge arsenal of skills and experience, that can be quite useful to any small outfit that has &#34;many hats&#34; employees.What I found, is that us older folks are quite unpopular, and got tired of slamming doors and passive-aggressive insults.So I just decided that I was in early retirement.Best decision I ever made.I would have liked having the extra money, but the soul-sucking aspect would have probably killed me, by now.I am in a good position. I have enough set aside to be OK, but not at an exorbitant level, and I get to write awesome code every single day. It&#39;s basically, my &#34;dream job.&#34;I feel terrible for over-leveraged young folks, having to deal with this kind of thing, early on. I feel even worse, for the ones that have &#34;crossed over&#34; into &#34;old,&#34; and are still over-leveraged. They won&#39;t feel old, but they will be treated as such.It&#39;s really humbling and infuriating."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My experience has been similar at other large companies (MSFT, Google). My advice is to look for founder-led teams (not companies). If there are plenty of founders still on the team, they will likely care a lot about the product and code and hold everyone to high standards which make the work easier in the long run. On the other hand when I&#39;ve been on teams where all the original founders left, it&#39;s been a constant struggle to make anyone care about anything. At that point there is no ownership and most people are there for a paycheck. Lots of sloppy code gets shipped, everyone approves anything that looks like code, and eventually adding a single line anywhere feels like playing Russian roulette. Extreme short term thinking takes hold and no one cares that in 2-3 years the code will be unmaintainable because they don&#39;t plan to be on the team by then."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"He&#39;s got Granny Smith in the shit category, and this just reminds me of a funny story about dogs!We had two corgis and my wife made all their meals by hand. Part of their diet was apples, but we found one of the corgis would almost always eat around the apple (usually just a cheap red apple) pieces and leave them for the other dog. Then one time Granny Smith apples were cheaper at the grocery store so that is what we purchased and provided. He ate them up!Turns out the dog just didn&#39;t like the sweeter apples and wanted the tart tang of a good Granny Smith."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Now this is the kind of important tech/nerd info that I come to HN for! 10/10Notes:I&#39;m only familiar with several of the varieties on this page, but I definitely agree with the rankings. We used to buy Gala, Fuji or Juici, since there were the cheapest at the store and we didn&#39;t know better, but once we tried Honeycrisp we never went back. (Cosmic Crisp also ok but not as good. I&#39;d also rank Envy a bit lower.)Also, best cider I&#39;ve had is from Honeycrisp apples.Red/Golden Delicious are tasteless garbage. Granny Smith is ok for particular dishes so I&#39;d probably rank it a bit higher."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I once spent a month blind taste-testing apples with my wife to compare the apples in our supermarket.  We learned 4 things:1) Most of the Honeycrisp varietals that make it to market are good (Wild Twist and Cosmic Crisp being our favorites), but…2) The time of year makes a HUGE difference.  It seems obvious when I say it, but different varietals from different farms are best in different weeks.  Honeycrisp has an advantage here because it has so many growers that someone is keeping a batch in good condition for practically every week of the year.3) You have to go by the apples in your local market. Lists like these are hard to use because there are many more apples on it than you have available to choose from - most grocery stores only stock 3-10 varieties depending on time of year4) Your use case is critical. Obviously baking a pie requires a different apples from eating, but even if you are just eating the apples raw there are differences.  Some apples beat others in texture when cut up, but have the wrong density to eat by biting down on the appleAfter all our testing, we mostly went back to Honeycrisp because it’s so reliable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an improvement within the current paradigm of &#34;big ag&#34;, but IMHO tech is opening the possibility of a completely different way of doing things. For example, this comment which is below the linked video imagines a robot-maintained food forest, I think it&#39;s on point because I, too, believe that the future is swarms of small robots rather than a few big tractors:&gt; Imagine, a few years down the line, applying these principles to maintaining an edible polyculture ecosystem-farm. Not necessarily a big machine going through a flat field, but small drones tending to trees, vines, herbs, plants, pollinators and water features all in the location that is best for them based on local features. It could micromanage weeding and harvesting, but also composting, planting, grafting and nurturing keystone species and rare species while avoiding pesticide, nitrogen imbalance and soil compaction. A productive farm could look like the garden of Eden."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I see stuff like this sometimes I get depressed that I&#39;m building apps that just move little bits of information around the web and don&#39;t have any real demonstrable value to the world.How hard is the jump into the realm of computer vision/AI/robotics for someone with strong skills and experience building web applications? Is the coding much different? Is a company like this employing math/theroy-heavy people to develop new types of AI or are they working higher up the stack and just need people who can pipe data around?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seems like it should hoe each weed instead of spraying it. I guess that&#39;s a little harder to do. Maybe a lot harder.Two other things I thought were interesting in the video. One, the idea of mapping the whole field is pretty cool. There must be useful things you could do with a millimeter-scale 3D map of an entire field. Two, this is happening in California, just a few hours&#39; drive from Silicon Valley. I hope some of the engineers laid off recently find work in ag tech, because there will be huge opportunities coming with the rise of computer vision and (hopefully soon) robotics."</p>

I picked up contract gig through them a few years ago. Here are some of the takeaways from my short lived experience: 
 - It took them over two weeks to send me a computer.
 - They cancelled PTO for everyone. (this was the most egregious single thing they did)
 - They had absolute worst internal site for accessing HR documents and accessing personal resources. Just a maze of links. You could only access it via Internet Explorer (I swear I&#39;m not joking). Everything took forever to load. It was like stepping back into 1997.
 - When I gave my 2 week notice, they refused and said I &#39;owed&#39; them at least a month. LOL not sure how they think they can control people like that. I gleefully told them to &#39;deal with it&#39;. This happened about 45 days after I started as it became obvious very quickly how bad this company treats people."</p>

At some point, the rights were sold to the giant publisher Brill, which was charging $30  per chapter for a book that has no value by chapter.Luckily, some kind soul at University of Marburg   uploaded it and   Library Genesis still has it.https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/141915/https://libgen.is/search.php?req=Joshua%20Fox&amp;column[]=autho..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Me and my colleagues will be affected by the end of Z library and co related projects.Here in Brazil and for sure in most second and third world countries, people don&#39;t have money to spend in books.You can argue that people can go to the library, but in most cases it&#39;s even expensive to take a bus or taxi even a Uber.I&#39;m a law student at an university in brazil. Law books are really expensive. 
Even though my university have a library, sometimes it doesn&#39;t have the books that the professors ask us to read.Since I found z library I could have access to most of books that I needed.I do know that the writers and publishers have costs and they need to make money, but I don&#39;t agree with the fact that we have to pay to have knowledge.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know this won&#39;t be a popular take on HN, but while I can understand and to a certain extent sympathize with pirating movies (the intentional friction and arbitrary geographic limitations on access imposed by the multinational movie-industry conglomerates), I can&#39;t see stealing some poor author&#39;s work in the same light.Sure, people get hung-up about DRM (which can easily be removed by widely-accessible tools), but e-books can be purchased pretty much anywhere in the world. I&#39;m in Sweden but buy most of my e-books from the US. But often buy books directly from publishers (hopefully they, and the author, get a better cut that way).The fact these people were trying to personally profit (some other HN:ers have documented this), while trying to present themselves as some sort of &#34;information wants to be free&#34; info-warriors doesn&#39;t make the whole thing any better.An enormous amount of work goes into producing a book - through a close friend who works in book-publishing I know a couple of authors who pretty much starve for a year or two to produce their work - and then the editing, typesetting, designing, proof-reading etc is all an enormous and personal investment.In spite of what people think, authors are not all budding J.K.Rowlings with movie-deals and a couple of billion in the bank, and if we don&#39;t buy their books, they won&#39;t be able to produce the next one for people to pirate."</p>

A bill proposed by Sens. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) seeks to grant the CFTC “exclusive jurisdiction over any agreement, contract, or transaction involving a contract of sale of a digital asset that is offered, solicited, traded, executed, or otherwise dealt in interstate commerce, including market activities relating to ancillary assets.” Perhaps in anticipation of such a move, FTX has stocked up its ranks with former CFTC officials. Former CFTC commissioner and acting chair Mark Wetjen is FTX’s head of policy and regulatory strategy. Ryne Miller, who was legal counsel to Gensler when he led the CFTC, is FTX’s general counsel. The Tech Transparency Project has also identified 14 other cases of CFTC alumni revolving into the crypto industry.Vote these people out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article spends quite a bit of time talking about SBF&#39;s risk appetite and how it might be drug related. I think that&#39;s missing a fairly obvious piece of logic.In order to decide to go into crypto trading you need to have an extremely high tolerance for risk. The crypto industry is self-selected for risk in the first place, you don&#39;t need complex explanations of why they use lots of leverage on highly volatile assets, that&#39;s literally the reason why they&#39;re there. If SBF had a low appetite for risk he wouldn&#39;t have entered crypto or started a start up, he would have stayed in trad-fi getting paid massive sums of money for some fairly basic quant work. It&#39;s not that Sam has a high risk appetite, it&#39;s that in order to get into the position Sam was in you need a high risk appetite.And that obviously poses a big problem for people who want to use a crypto exchange - because they can only find exchanges run by people with a massive risk appetite making it likely to blow up in your face."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Building and selling macOS apps is a pretty good niche to be in right now.I escaped my stressful corporate job 1 year ago and I’ve been living comfortably since then from app revenue only.I’m making between $3.5k and $9k per month with https://lunar.fyi/ and the smaller apps I create at https://lowtechguys.com/It’s not much for some parts of the world.  But I’m well enough from this that I even took the time to build a small calendar app (https://lowtechguys.com/grila) from which all the funds will go to my brother’s college costs so he can stop working 12h/day jobs.Before this I tried creating paid web services but none took off. I realized I actually don’t use any indie web product after 8 years of professional coding. I’m only using web products from big companies like Google, fly.io, Amazon etc.Desktop apps on the other hand, most that I use and love are made by single developers.With the ascent of Apple Silicon, and the ease of SwiftUI, this has the potential of bringing a modest revenue while also being more fulfilling than a corporate job.In case you’re curious how the code looks for something like that, here’s a small open-source app that I built in a single (long) day, which has proven to be useful enough that people want to pay for it: https://github.com/alin23/Clop"</p>

Ideally two or three; consider being the first.* Revenue: A reasonably stable revenue stream lets you take on mid-long term projects. Ad revenue from a niche content business is quite good here."</p>

You will forget things and get distracted and not get as much done. So what. You are still intelligent and caring and dedicated and responsible and a hard worker. You probably put more effort in (when you get around to it) than many others without the condition. And you will do about as well as everyone else, on average. And this is fine.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ah, there it is. I was wondering when this would happen.Facebook used to be involved with the Mercurial community, but it was difficult to work with them. They always wanted to do things their way, had their own intentions, and started to demand that the Mercurial project work the way that Facebook wanted. For example, they demanded that we start using Phabricator and started slowly removing sequential revisions from Mercurial in favour of always using node hashes everywhere, arguing that for their gigantic repos, sequential revisions were so big as to be useless.Eventually the disagreements were too great, and Facebook just stopped publicly talking about Mercurial.I figured they would emerge a few years later with their fork of it. They love doing this. HipHop VM for PHP, Apache Hive, MyRock; these are examples of Facebook forking off their development in private and then later emerging with some thing they built on top of it.The Mercurial project is surprisingly still chugging along, and there are still those of us who actually use Mercurial. I doubt I&#39;ll switch over to Sapling, because I disagreed with the things that made Facebook fork off in the first place. But if others like Sapling and this manages to put the slightest dent into the git monoculture, I&#39;m happy for the change and innovation. I really hope that git is not the final word in version control. I want to see more ideas be spread and that people can see that there can be a world beyond git."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thank god.I have been waiting ten years (https://www.google.com/url?q=https://stevebennett.me/2012/02...) for someone to develop a better CLI for git, someone with the scale and clout to do it well and gain mindshare. It&#39;s not that useful to learn a new workflow if no one you ever work with will be familiar with it.This looks incredible. A simple command to uncommit or unamend makes you further realise what a disaster the Git CLI is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not a big fan of FB as a company, but I think their open source work is pretty impressive. Various other large companies have the problem of giant monorepos that they constantly need to onboard new developers to, but I can&#39;t think of anyone other than FB who consistently released their solutions.Sure, most people are probably fine with Git once they learned it and if they only work with small to mid sized code bases (like me). But I&#39;m still happy Sapling is out there, I might use it or learn from it if I ever run into the problems it solves."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Physical books wear out in decades to centuries, computers break in years to decades. Also digital formats are constantly evolving and backwards compatibility for old formats is removed. Even without publisher/legal issues it&#39;s clear that preservation of digital media for even the next 10 years, and especially for the next 100 or 1000, is at risk.But I really wonder why is there no other major service like the Internet Archive? The way to preserve media is to distribute it and store it in many places, not just one central location. Does the Internet Archive store redundant copies in many locations? Does it use long-term physical formats?Also, figuring out what information is &#34;meaningful&#34; and which is completely useless or redundant is extremely important. Because we want to store everything with the potential to be important in the future, but we also have an incredible amount of data (hence one of the reasons why IA is the only major archiver). It may be good to strategize data collection, e.g. a shallow list of all sources and a deeper list of popular sources, a sample of various sources from every region, etc"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Ever try to read a physical book passed down in your family from 100 years ago?  Probably worked well.No, it worked terribly because they hadn&#39;t been stored well and were covered in mold (even the ones from only 70 years ago) or otherwise falling apart. I couldn&#39;t search them for specific phrases I remembered my grandfather reading me as a child, and I didn&#39;t have the physical space of my own to store them all either anyway. Even making a stab at indexing them all was enormously labor intensive. I was the only one in the family interested in even trying. It really sucked.&gt;Ever try reading an ebook you paid for 10 years ago? Probably a different experience.Yes, it was excellent, since naturally it was DRM-free or I wouldn&#39;t have paid for it. I have digital stuff from the 80s, still perfectly preserved, that I can call up as I wish, when I wish, anywhere I wish anywhere in the world.I&#39;m 100% onboard with the correct argument that modern copyright and DRM go against the core bargain of IP (societal agreement for public benefit) and could use major reform. But I don&#39;t think this piece does a very good job of making that argument, the entire comparison and pretending that books don&#39;t require any sort of preservation and so on really distracts from the core issues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"DRM-laden digital books should be seen like the extra cheap paperbacks which fall apart sitting untouched on the shelf after a couple of years. Extremely different than the well-bound books one might think of when handling a 100 year old book.Non-DRM&#39;d ebooks in formats which are open, easily parseable, and that people care to archive should be fine for a long time. Some people here are talking about a decade as if we won&#39;t be able to parse epubs or text files in 10 years. I&#39;ve got documents &gt;30 years old already which are still easily parsed, and I don&#39;t imagine I&#39;ll have problems rendering them in another 30 years.I&#39;ll be utterly amazed if we can&#39;t render a basic HTML document, text-focused PDF, or hell even just ASCII text in the year 2032. I also have little doubt I&#39;ll still technically be able to load my DVDs or Blu-Rays of that data in 2032 and copy it into the holographic crystal storage devices that&#39;ll come out just before that."</p>

The idea that you need to resubmit a 100 apps because Google decided you need to target a different internal version number is insane. It would be very bad if the SDK had a breaking change, but in this case it&#39;s just busy work: upping a number and resubmitting.And what about the rule to be able to report user generated content? Who the hell is Google to interfere on such app-specific functionality? What if my moderation workflow would only allow draft posts, each manually approved, making reporting them pointless? Does Google actually check if a report gets sent or followed up? I don&#39;t think so.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was just on the ground coordinating with 4 friends that got buried in 5+ foot of unexpected snow  in the mountains (forecast said 1&#34;-2&#34; when they went up) for the rifle opener in Montana. I wound up getting sick so I stayed home (hilariously I was the only one who got an elk) but I sent them up with my InReach.All I can say is THANK GOD that I did, because it turned into over a week long effort to get them out. Two decided to walk out and were able to text me a nav point that I was able to meet them at (took all day to get there because of the snow and mud, but I made it and was able to pick them up). The other two stayed up there, and we sent probably 100 texts back and forth coordinating what turned into like 3 solid days of fighting to get up there with snowcats and get them back down. Multiple situational changes that we would have been hosed without.In the end, I spent like $80 on texts, but it was money well spent. I think it&#39;s great for people to have SOS built into their iPhone, but there needs to be a &#34;use it now, pay later&#34; or no one is going to activate it and actually have it available when they need it. The other half of the equation is that you really need to be able to send texts. The SOS button is very expensive. Extremely expensive. That will keep a lot of people from using it. (Yes insurance exists, but hardly anyone has it). Being able to text your friends for help is substantially more useful. Being stuck on a backroad with no service, 5, 10, 20 miles from where anyone can be expected to drive by is a far more common scenario than breaking your leg at the top of a mountain and needing to be evacuated."</p>

To have an iPhone be able to send GPS location to the public safety access point is fabulous. Our dispatchers can at least drop a pin on a map and we can route to that location ourselves. This already happens in a lot of cases but the caller has cell service. We&#39;ve been on multiple incidents up in the hills where people have reported that they had to drive several miles down the mountain before they were able to get any reception to make a 911 call.This will save us a lot of time, and it will save lives. This is a game changing feature."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pardon for living under a rock, but why are crypto exchanges affected by the mood in the crypto market?I thought that a crypto exchange functions like a currency market: I put an offer to sell 10,000 EUR for 1 BTC and someone else puts an offer to buy 10,000 EUR for 1 BTC. When orders cross, a transaction happens and the exchange gets a fee, whether in currency or crypto units.What are crypto exchanges fundamentally doing differently that they are suddenly losing money?Surely a drop in transactions would make them lose fees and require them to fire some staff, but I expected a &#34;Facebook-like&#34; downsizing, not a full-blown bankruptcy.What am I missing?"</p>

These are written manuscripts of african scholars which are hundreds of years old, and still exist today. Some record the history of great west african civilizations along with other things they studied (e.g. science, religion, math, literature, ect). I was never taught this history even existed but yet was made to learn the various details about asian, european, middle eastern, central/south american history.

According to FTX math, I now have $99,999,000 of assets on my balance sheet, but of course if I actually tried to sell a lot of my &#34;kept&#34; tokens I would tank the SCAMMER price.Even better, and I think what is probably more common in the crypto industry: suppose I get my buddy to create a SUX2BEU token. I tell my buddy I&#39;ll by 10 SUX2BEU tokens for $100 each if he buys 10 of my SCAMMER tokens for $100 each. Now suddenly we can both say we have huge assets on our balance sheets!

And so I assume he refused to learn anything from it. But what he ended up creating was almost a hilarious parody of the financial system.That&#39;s at least how I can square the circle about how someone who could criticize Lehman Brothers for letting themselves get overleveraged on shady asset classes could literally have negative 8 billion dollars in &#34;Hidden, poorly internally labeled ‘fiat@’ account&#34; and then publicly go to Twitter to say they have a &#34;liquidity problem&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow! It is great to see another low code, open source platform being launched. I’ve been involved with open source for over 25 years, and I am a big believer in the power of open source to accelerate development and empower people all over the world to build amazing things. I have built a career on OSS, and millions of others have as well. It is a game changer.In full transparency, I am the Head of DevRel at Appsmith, which is an alternative tool to Open Blocks, and a source for some of Open Block’s code (https://github.com/openblocks-dev/openblocks/search?q=appsmi...).However, that is not really what I want to discuss here.As long as I have been involved in open source, I have dealt with FUD about OSS from investors, executives, and business people who don’t “get it”. These folks have usually been highly resistant to open sourcing code or making contributions because they think it will hurt the business. “Why would I want to share code that can be used to compete against us?” This could even apply to a young engineer or maintainer of a growing open-source project who’s deciding to startup and thinking whether to build an OSS company.We have seen a huge boom in open source business models, and this is a GREAT thing. But, what can we do to ensure that we don’t prove the naysayers right?My concern is that as we see a rise in competition among open source businesses, we will also see a rise in competitive businesses (open source and proprietary) that use previous work to accelerate their advantage… which is one of the central features to open source.But, in theory, open source also has advantages for those who provide code - attribution, contribution, funding, shared resources, etc. There are also different licensing models that have strengths and weaknesses. We decided to go with a permissive license so that people can use Appsmith in all environments, and sometimes this works against us because competitors can build on top of Appsmith. But hey, that’s the nature of the game right?So - what can we or should we do as a community to ensure that open source business models can be successful without tarnishing the reputation of open source in general? Should we be more clear with attribution? Should we partner and make shared libraries for common functionality? Maybe do nothing? What do you think?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m horrified by so many of the comments here that seem to lack even the most basic of human decency. Allow me to fill people in for those who have never uprooted your life and moved across the world for a job. It is a massive commitment on the part of the employee, where you sell the majority of your earthly possessions, property, cars, etc. Then you go through an immigration process which even if its handled by FAANG involves a ton of work. You get to the new country, find a place to live and start to adjust.So to do that to someone and then days later be like &#34;we actually don&#39;t want you&#34; is beyond shitty. This persons visa is dependent on their employment so now they get to go into a city they don&#39;t know and try desperately to find employment with an employer who is interested in sponsoring someone from abroad (which is a small fraction of the total employers).For all you budding Elons, here&#39;s a shorthand for it. If you ask someone to move across the world and don&#39;t need them anymore, give them three months on the books to find somewhere else that don&#39;t count against their visa. It will give them a chance to get settled and go on interviews. Or don&#39;t recruit internationally."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So many commenters here (presumably US/CA citizens) don&#39;t realize that the gut-wrenching feeling of being laid off whilst your visa depends on uninterrupted employment is _nothing_ like the SHTF-but-all&#39;s-ok feeling of being laid off &#39;regularly&#39;.In the USA, for most work visas, you are given a 60 day death clock pleasantly sugarcoated as a &#39;grace period&#39; to find a new employer or leave the country. Cue trying weave in that baggage in between screening calls &amp; technical interviews to explain to prospective employers how you have 47 days and 15 hours left to be hired or leave. The complication of dealing with USCIS and attaining a work visa (usually bound to your employer) is a marathon even with unlimited time, but in a puny 8 week window?...In my own experience this also happened in mid 2021 when Australia&#39;s borders were closed (to AU citizens as well...) so leaving back home wasn&#39;t even an option."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Imho the real question here is, why is it that Meta keeps hiring right right until they do large layoff rounds?The kind of issue that requires large layoff rounds is not something that just materializes overnight, out of the blue.So why does their management - which should be able to read the writing on the wall, since that&#39;s part of their job - not issue a strict hiring freeze (in addition to other measures taken to try and avoid/reduce the impeding layoffs).Why do they go from hiring to firing in the blink of an eye?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The most persuasive argument for Apple as trustworthy on  privacy was weak: that because they didn’t monetize data as rapaciously as Google or Meta, there was less incentive for them to spy on users.But once they introduced new privacy controls, they seemed to suddenly start investing more seriously in their own advertising network. That, and the encryption slight-of-hand with iCloud, makes the cynic’s case for them.App telemetry, metrics, etc might get handwaved away with a sinister phrase, like “essential for improving user experience.” But placing trust in a company on privacy due to the relative lack of financial incentive seems hopelessly naive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple will probably get away with that as it is all in the fine print. But,1. Let&#39;s not forget vast majority ( if not all ) of people on the Internet, inclusive but not limited to Main-steam Media, HN, Reddit and Twitter who commented between 2017 and 2021 thought privacy meant anonymous. And before anyone disagree, very very few on HN even bother to downvote or stand up against the notion of privacy meant anonymous.2. Apple play this card, both in PR and marketing, along with media ( Submarine Article or not ) as a tool against Facebook. Or Social Media but let&#39;s be honest we all know they mean Facebook. And of course, for people from US, after 2016 Facebook is the most evil company on planet earth. Any Facebook bashing equals great.3. A lot of people were brought into the idea of privacy meant anonymous. So in other settings, Apple use the word &#34;personalised&#34; instead of Data Collection, cough, I mean tracking.4. The good thing about all of these, anything illogical will have to unfold some day. ( Just like Crypto ) Apple of course collect Data from you. Apple of course has all the Data about your usage pattern. So when some people came to realise privacy doesn&#39;t mean anonymous, I guess they aren&#39;t so happy?5. Apple&#39;s true definition of privacy is that All Apple&#39;s user Data belongs to Apple. Any data to third party are by definition &#34;Tracking&#34;. Since Privacy is a Fundamental Human Right, I guess the only choice is to give Apple all your Data?6. Most people, especially tech nerds will likely play the I trust Apple more than Google card. Because Apple are not in the Ad business! - That was 2017 to 2021 if not 2022. They have their ads business right infront of you for a long time. They have been preparing their Ads business for a long time. Most tech nerds, or Apple apologist just turns a blind eye to it."</p>

Allow Apps to Request to Track specifically &#34;Allow[s] apps to ask to track your activity across other companies&#39; apps and websites.&#34; This clause clearly doesn&#39;t apply to any internal analytics process.2. Share [Device] Analytics is a bigger issue, and is the problem. The switch says that it sends information about how the user uses the operating system and Apple services. That clearly includes the App Store, so switching this off should switch off App Store analytics.Including the first point seems stupid, since it muddies the claim against Apple.A note about the App Store privacy information. It (separately) indicates that they collect the information this article alleges - so Apple IS disclosing it. However that doesn&#39;t change the fact that the Analytics toggle reasonably seems to apply to the App Store as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Mass layoffs makes the news because papers depend on sensational headlines, but it&#39;s important to put into perspective.&gt; The pandemic produced Amazon’s most profitable era on record ... Amazon doubled its work force in two years, and funneled its winnings into expansion and experimentation to find the next big things.So it doubled its head count in the past 3 years and is now trimming by 3% (or 1% of global).Update: Tried to figure out whether the doubling head count was corporate employees or total. I don&#39;t have time to dig into it now but a quick search did turn up Amazon&#39;s EEO reports in which they break employees down into a number of categories including &#34;Professionals&#34; -- which sounds like it would include engineers. 77K in 2019, 121K in 2021. So it&#39;s reasonable to assume those did double from 2019 to the present. See https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/our-workforce-dat..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is just the latest round of cuts at Amazon: &#34;From April through September, it reduced head count by almost 80,000 people, primarily shrinking its hourly staff through high attrition.&#34;Also: &#34;Amazon froze hiring in several smaller teams in September. In October, it stopped filling more than 10,000 open roles in its core retail business. Two weeks ago, it froze corporate hiring across the company, including its cloud computing division, for the next few months.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; In 2018, Echo and Alexa lost about $5 billion, said a person with knowledge of the finances. When Amazon introduced new devices this fall in an annual event, it was notably more restrained than past years when it had featured zany products like a sticky note printer and $1,000 home robot.$5B loss from one business line is a lot. Maybe this manner of investment inspired Zuck on the metaverse."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I would think about your positioning some.You’re marketing this as having “less complexity” which   first of all, isn’t going to appeal to people unless they’ve already used the other tools. But, if they had tried Trello, that’s far from complex, as you say it doesn’t have the features you think are needed, so you are more complex than that. It might be that you’re excellent at UX but that needs some comparative examples to see how you have differentiated things.Instead, it might make sense to go more with all the features you need, nothing you don’t angle. Note that I don’t think this really differentiates too much from clickup which has personal productivity options, and as you get bigger you know customers are going to ask for more and more features, because that’s what they do, and we also know that business accounts are the money makers in this market.  It also runs counter to building an “all in one” tool.

I’d wager that if you already know how to operate an SDR, you properly will have little trouble with the fairly simple  algorithm of measuring phase differences, filtering, CFAR etc. to make a passive radar. Synchronizing a bag of RTL-SDRs with a common oscillator is a trivial soldering task.The cat went out of the bag the second SDRs jumped from DARPA R&amp;D to DVB-T commodity.That aside having a passive radar breadboard is not the same as a high-end passive radar where frequency/phase stability, use of wideband multi-source emitters, ultra-low noise amplifiers and N&gt;&gt;2 channels for increased angular resolution are integrated in an operational system. These systems that actually works, should be controlled."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can order a reasonably good passive radar on Alibaba right now.[1]The DVB-T/T2 Passive Radar (external radiation source radar) itself does not emit signals, but receives the echo signals of non-cooperative radiation sources (radio, television, communication base stations, etc.) reflected by the target for detection (as shown in Figure 1). The radar is composed of antenna, multi-channel receiver, and signal processor: the dedicated reference antenna receives direct wave signals, and the monitoring antenna array receives target echo signals; the multi-channel receiver amplifies the signals received by all antennas, performing frequency conversion and A/D sampling. The signal processor processes the output signal of the receiver, and outputs target information after reference signal purification, clutter suppression interference, matched filtering, target detection, parameter estimation and tracking processing. Unlike other passive detection systems, DVB-T/T2 Based Passive Radar(external radiation source radar) can achieve single-station positioning and speed measurement, and can detect more types of targets (can detect radio silence targets, such as autonomous cruise drones, birds and balloons), and is particularly suitable for applications where there are restrictions on electromagnetic radiation and high detection performance requirements.Type of Target: Low-altitude targets such as drones, balloons, paragliders, and general aviation aircraft, including non-cooperative targets with radio silenceDetection Range Directional model: 5 to 10km (DJI Phantom 4), Omnidirectional model: 2 to 4km (DJI Phantom 4)All suppressing this does is cut the US out of the market.[1] https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Silent-Sentry-Passive..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It may be  true today that calloc checks for multiplication overflow and doesn&#39;t zero memory if it doesn&#39;t need to, that&#39;s modern revisionism.  Historically, calloc did not do either of those things.eg, from the 4.4 BSD, circa 1993:https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=4.4BSD/usr/src...    void *
    calloc(num, size)
     size_t num;
     register size_t size;
    {
     register void *p;
    
     size *= num;
     if (p = malloc(size))
      bzero(p, size);
     return(p);
    }"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regurgitating from an older comment of mine: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13110538----The first version of UNIX to include `calloc` was Research UNIX V6, and here&#39;s how it was implemented: https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Researc...    calloc(n, s)
    {
    return(alloc(n*s));
    }

There are several interesting things we learn from poking around V6:- `calloc` originated not on UNIX, but as part of Mike Lesk&#39;s &#34;iolib&#34;, which was written to make it easier to write C programs portable across PDP 11 UNIX, Honeywell 6000 GCOS, and IBM 370 OS[0]. Presumably the reason calloc is the-way-it-is is hidden in the history of the implementation for GCOS or IBM 370 OS, not UNIX. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t seem to track down a copy of Bell Labs &#34;Computing Science Technical Report #31&#34;, which seems to be the appropriate reference.- `calloc` predates `malloc`. As you can see in the above code, there was a `malloc`-like function called just `alloc` (though there were also several other functions named `alloc` that allocated things other than memory). (Ok, fine, since V5 the kernel&#39;s internal memory allocator happened to be named `malloc`, but it worked differently[1]).[0]: https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Researc... (format with `nroff -ms usr/doc/iolib/iolib`)[1]: https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Researc..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does anyone know if this is actually true?By that, I mean the title of this article, &#39;Why does calloc exist?&#39;. My guess would be that back in the origins of the C library:1) Few cared about automatic overflow checks, that was a job for the programmer, so it seems unlikely the creators added calloc() specifically so that it could check if m * n overflowed (after all, there are loads of libc calls that will shoot you in the foot if you don&#39;t do overflow/buffer size checks)2) calloc() is ancient, probably pre-dating many virtual memory optimisations, and back then, memory was relatively fast vs instruction execution, so adding calloc() to speed up giant memory allocations would be less impactful. But that&#39;s just a hunch, and I&#39;m often surprised by just how sophisticated early UNIX code was. Early computing was slow, every performance gain you could squeeze out of the system mattered and if there were VMs that could defer zeroing memory until it was really needed then people would probably try to do that.But my guess is, calloc() was simply a helper function, added because it was very common to malloc() some memory and then zero it straight away. Does anyone know the actual history?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The author was doing the right thing with explaining it only makes sense when you know the history of how we got to where we are - but there is a bit more to it. It is all a series of band-aids. Band-aids all the way down. As somebody who has been involved with AWS since 2012 I&#39;ve seen them all get added incrementally in response to explosions in usage and complexity and customer unhappiness and frustration.Explicit allows being all you can do in an IAM policy were easy(ish) when there was a handful of AWS services and API actions. As there were more and more services and policy actions etc. they became unwieldy. Enter Permission Boundaries where you could wrap a few explicit denies around them. Kubernetes RBAC is nearly at the same place and could now really use those too - but I digress.Also, early on in my AWS journey, even two accounts (one non-prod and one prod) was only done half the time and viewed as a best practice to think about - people genrally just opened one AWS account. But when IAM wasn&#39;t enough (i.e. there wasn&#39;t enough granularity on the resources or the conditions exposed etc.) the answer became separate AWS accounts as the only, or at least the easiest, way enforce these authorization boundaries/separations with a blunt instrument you could trust. It also helped to keep your bills straight before they would do things like break them down by Tag.Then you often needed cross-account role assumptions to deal with the inevitable cases where things or people needed access between these accounts.Then the explosion in AWS Accounts led to AWS Organizations to provision and manage them all. And it built in Service Control Policies and OUs as a tool/layer to help further manage/constrain IAM policies/permissions (IAM policies, Permission Boundaries and SCPs now being in a venn diagram with each other these days).But AWS Organizations managing heaps of accounts was also too painful to use and get right and so they brought in AWS Control Tower to help make setting up Organizations easier.So, in short, this all makes sense when you understand the inability to totally rewrite/refactor important complex systems used by customers (breaking backward compatibility) and instead trying to keep solving all the challenges with an steady stream of incremental band-aids that you can announce at re:Invent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Almost ALL manuals for setting up something on AWS, third party tools, and sometimes AWS official tools, effectively have a step that requires admin permissions, like being able to attach arbitrary policies to an instance.At that point you can either:- give everybody Admin access- involve the same 2 or 3 trusted people in processes that they shouldn&#39;t really be involved- dig down into permissions to try to build something yourself that apparently the people writting the manuals gave up on doingLooks very bleak, anybody has a different view in this? Seems unlikely that big organizations work like this on AWS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Rant: I&#39;m glad the author called out GCP as well, but the idea that it&#39;s the user&#39;s fault for granting too many permissions is absurd. Has the author tried doing this at scale? Try a super simple example: I want a user to have access to query a schema in BigQuery. Can you guess the magic combo of permissions that is going to take? Because the documentation is not going to correctly tell you. Thus after spending way too much time trying to get it done one ends up widely over-permissioning to just get the damn thing to work. You could argue their model is sound and it&#39;s just that how they aggregated permissions into roles is absurd or even just argue that they need better defined roles and I would accept that, but still it&#39;s quite frustrating as is. I mean just look at the length of the reference: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Every corporate librarian or archivist keeps a plan to save their archives in their back pocket. We have to. Corporate archives can come under attack at any time when someone in power—a new CEO, a legal department, the consulting firm behind an acquisition, even a random IT person cleaning up servers—suddenly doesn’t like the idea of a bunch of old stuff lying around. (If you want to know how the Hewlett-Packard Company Archives was saved after enduring a major spinoff, 6 CEOs in 10 years and a company split, read my 2020 article.)I like the idea that corporate librarians and archivists know they have a professional and ethical responsibility that supersedes what the current corporate leadership believes is their current business interest. (Think about the reasons someone would decide they don&#39;t &#34;like the idea of a bunch of old stuff lying around&#34;)Engineers could use some of this too.It is striking to me how the library staff is all smiling big on their last day of work -- because they know they saved the archives, without Steve Jobs noticing."</p>

Here’s what that article said.&gt;When Mr. Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, a dozen years after he was forced out, one of the first things he did was offer Stanford University the company’s corporate archives, said Henry Lowood, the curator of Stanford libraries’ History of Science and Technologies Collections. “Stanford had a signed document from Apple’s legal department within 24 hours, allowing it to transport some 800 boxes from the company’s campus to the university.”This story wasn&#39;t made up by her. It was reported, may be misreporting, may be Apple&#39;s Submarine PR for years. And she kept the story going. ( So to speak )And then this interview [1] with Jony, Tim Cook and Laurene Jobs. I guess people can make up their own mind after watching the interview. But if anything a lot of what was being said by Tim Cook and Laurene Jobs was repeating what Steve had said publicly. Intentionally or not.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdvzYtgmIjs"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At the risk of sounding to newage-y, I experience the benefits of exercising as energy balancing.Solving problems, learning and building new things all day can be very mentally exhausting. Cardio, sports, lifting; helps re-balance the physical with the mental. I am sure there are more scientific words and biological descriptions that I lack the vocabulary for. If I get too mentally focused on a project/job/problem and go days without matching it with vigorous physical activity, I end up not sleeping as well, am less tolerant, more scattered and brain fog tends to start rolling in. If I counter it with the physical exercise or physical energy expenditure the mental clarity comes back, I sleep better, and don&#39;t have hair-triggered verbal impulse control issues. Otherwise, if I let it go for too long, lethargy sets in - which I attribute to the body/physical and mind/mental trying to rebalance itself. I dont think it cares that it makes me feel like crap overall, more that it&#39;s neutral in just wanting a balance however that comes about.I often refer to exercise as me taking care of my mental health - as opposed to being physically fit. That could be seen as &#34;exercise [being] the best cognitive exercise&#34;. Looking at it that way, exercise creates a mental-out imbalance, which causes the stored energy in the mind to be stimulated and need more output creating the mental sharpness. Obviously I have nothing to back up the claims other than decades of experiencing this to be true for me time and time again; though I do believe there are better biological explanations than energy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t have any references to hand, but drawing from both personal experience and anecdotal stories from places like r/nootropics, the link between cognitive performance and physical exercise is already well established and almost universally accepted. In comparison, brain training games and sudoku puzzles are rarely, if ever, mentioned as beneficial (again, anecdotally). Am I misunderstanding what&#39;s being speculated here?Somewhat related - something that I do find quite curious from my own personal experience is that lifting heavy weights has a far greater impact on my ability to concentrate (and therefore perceived cognitive ability, I guess) than cardio/aerobic exercise does. Like night and day. I&#39;ve recently started attributing it to creatine supplementation, but I do wonder if there&#39;s anything more to it than that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Working out makes you more cognitively sharp because it increases the rate of fluid transfer throughout your body and increases metabolism. Ancillary effects of this are calmness, endorphins, and regulated sleep. There I said it, no magic science required. You bring balance in, you get balance out. This ain&#39;t the type of cut throat science most of you on HN expect, but sometimes the simple explanation is the one."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was on a ferry ship from Italy to Greece where they had  paid sattelite Internet via WiFi. The WiFi AP was at first a captive portal. You could buy Internet access with cash at the reception or you could pay online. For that they had to enable access to stripe.com. But stripe uses fastly CDN, so they enabled one specific fastly endpoint that stripe uses. You had direct IP traffic to this specific IP address. reddit also uses fastly CDN. So with a /etc/hosts hack I could load reddit pages for free. Not images though, as they are hosted by imgur.I assume one could also create a tunnel over reddit chat connect to the Internet, but I never did that.By default, reddit did not work though, as their fastly CDN endpoint is different from stripe&#39;s, also the stripe&#39;s endpoint did not correctly sign TLS for reddit.com. But setting a Host header of old.reddit.com on that fastly IP successfully downloaded the page.When I still had phone network by the coast, I set up iodine IP over DNS tunnel, but it did not work, even though DNS requests worked on that WiFi. Maybe they had some sort of protection specifically for iodine."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; If you have $110 million in assets and $100 million in liabilities you are said to be levered 10:1There is no single leverage ratio [1]. On an asset basis, this is an 11:1 leverage ratio, i.e. $11 of assets for each dollar of equity. A lot of miscommunication around leverage seems to stem from this ambiguity.[1] https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/accounting/l..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems a bit too wordy to demystify the concept. Here&#39;s a simpler example.1. Bank A offers you 5% interest for a 1 year deposit. You deposit $100 of your own money. You are unlevered. Things go well and after a year you receive $105, a neat 5% return on your investment. Or things don&#39;t go well, bank A turns out to be a scam and you receive $0, a -100% return.2. Bank B offers you a loan for a year for 4% interest. You borrow $900, together with your own $100 you deposit $1000 at bank A. You are levered 1:9. Things go well and after a year you receive $1050 ($1000+5% interest) from bank A, you repay bank B $936 ($900 + 4% interest), so you&#39;re left with $114, a very neat 14% return (almost triple the unlevered return). Or things don&#39;t go well, bank A turns out to be a scam and you receive $0. But now you still owe bank B $936, so together with your own $100 loss you made a -1036% return. Oops.p.s. It&#39;s called leverage because (like a physical lever that allows you to lift something much heavier than without) supplementing your own funds with lots of borrowed money allows you to tackle something much bigger than using only your own money, like buying a house or starting a business or getting 5% on $1000 instead of on $100."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find this uncharacteristically hard to understand.In the stock brokerage example, we&#39;re told:&gt;They might allow you 2:1 leverage when you buy stock: your $1,000 buys 20 shares now.But then a couple of paragraphs later:&gt;But you now owe $1,000 to your brokerage, and are 1:1 leveredMy brokerage offers 2:1 leverage, which results in me being 1:1 levered? I think I understand what patrick is saying here but I also find it hard to followOn the other hand:&gt;One is that, because people can ask for money from their checking accounts at any time, impecunious operation of the bank could cause the value of the mortgages to be impaired just a tiny little bit at a time when people need most of the money in their checking accounts.I&#39;ve read this four or five times and I don&#39;t understand the chain of cause-and-effect here at all. Why does &#34;people can ask for money from their checking accounts at any time&#34; mean that &#34;impecunious operation of the bank could cause the value of the mortgages to be impaired just a tiny little bit at a time when people need most of the money in their checking accounts&#34;?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s important to note that Uniswap is decentralized and anyone can &#34;list&#34; anything for trading without asking anyone or going through any process. This means there are thousands of tokens, probably millions in the future, available to trade.Users do not see these tokens unless they actively search them out. Uniswap uses the TokenList standard (https://tokenlists.org/) and by default users only see tokens such as the top 100 projects on CoinGecko. There are many lists created by reputable players such as Aave and Gemini which cover the entire gamut of projects users want to trade without exposing end users to scam tokens.I believe this is a good system and has worked well as having any kind of listing process or even a DAO introduces subjectivity and provides points of capture for bad actors. With an open listing process and standards like TokenLists we can say that Uniswap is truly a public good and will be around as long as we need it which provides a guaranteed way to swap any asset for any other asset no matter who created it or how controversial it is which is a good primitive for humanity to be able to rely on."</p>

Nothing was &#34;launched&#34;.These trading pairs are more akin to spam, to show up in the search results (somewhere else, do not show up on Uniswap). Other research find the scam volume is way less than 1% of the total trading volume. Only looking this number does not reflect the true health of the market or the controls Uniswap has in place to prevent trading these tokens.We also do not call fake Viagram advertising email rug pull, even if it is clearly intended to steal your money without making your dick hard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sure, because anyone can create and list a token on Uniswap. The only cost are the gas fees.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Second of all, there&#39;s no need to include &#34;window shopping&#34; in our recorded history; this is when you undo a ways, take a look around, then skedaddle out of there back to &#34;the present&#34; without changing anything. This is just a matter of moving information back and forth from undo-stack to redo-stack.Usually the whole reason I might undo for a while is to get back part of something I was working on and merge it into other changes I’ve made since then. I’m curious why the author dismisses this, personally cherry picking old history is my primary workflow with undo. In editors that support the undo history they’re advocating here, like emacs, I’m usually undoing a long way so that I can put something in the clipboard, then redo all the way back and cut-and-paste the previous partial state.It is nice in emacs that typing after undo doesn’t lose my undone edits, that is handy and is a nice little safety net, but it doesn’t actually solve the problem I normally want to solve."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many times I want to undo to a previous state, but then apply again a few of the changes I just reverted, basically cherry-picking from the future (from the redo stack).It would be interesting to be able to see all edits as individual patches/diffs that you can commit/discard individually. Like a mini automatic git inside the editor, automatic in the sense that every &#34;edit&#34; creates a commit, undo/redo move HEAD.This would be entirely optional, you can continue using Undo/Redo as usual, but if you need to do a more complex history operation you can open this &#34;git&#34; view and operate on the edit tree directly.Photoshop has this nice undo panel where you can see individual edits and click your way to the desired point in history:https://www.bwillcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/how...One can imagine such a view in a text editor, where each entry shows a diff of what that step did."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Vim has this, it&#39;s :earlier and :laterhttps://vimtricks.com/p/vimtrick-time-travel-in-vim/    :earlier 3 – Undo the last 3 changes
    :earlier 5m – Go back to the state of the file 5 minutes ago
    :later 2 – After undoing something, redo the next 2 changes
    :later 1h – Travel forward through the change history 1 hour

Vim also stores the tree of changes, but it&#39;s a pain to access without plugins."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Big fan of Git style guides in teams. We had one at Thread. It was common for engineers to come in and find we didn&#39;t do rebasing and find it weird, but we took the opinion that history should be exactly what you actually did, not some clean and idealised version of what you wish you had done. There are advantages and disadvantages to this, but having a defined approach was the most important aspect.Also the fact that we didn&#39;t rebase and used merges everywhere was a major contributor to no one ever breaking their git repos, something that git seems notorious for elsewhere."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Modern Git workflow is very simple on its own:1. Your codebase has a `main` branch which is write-protected2. Devs submit changes to `main` from their own branches using PRs3. Devs can do whatever the fuck they want on their own branch4. PRs are merged one at a time5. When merge happens a dev&#39;s PR is squashed into one commit that gets appended to `main`6. If next dev wants to merge their PR with a conflicting change they have to resolve the conflict first and then they merge7. The end result is that `main` is a linear history of all PRs with the time they were committed to the `main` branch i.e., when they could&#39;ve started to break prod.This is a solved problem and it works great in industry. Why break it? If you want interactive rebase then make 2 PRs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMHO the single most important idiot proof of git should be a universal &#34;undo&#34; command.- Committed wrong? Undo- Switched to wrong branch? Undo- Pushed wrong? Undo- Merged wrong? Undo- Wrong reset? UndoThere should be a &#34;idempotent&#34; undo for every action in git. If not, warn the user for possible outcomes.In this way, we can safely learn git via trial &amp; errors."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an excellent description of a false sharing perfoance issue, and I wouldn&#39;t envy the work involved in tracking that code down through the JVM. These sorts of issues are common inside the OS kernel itself. Kernels are managing lots of shared resources, and as you add more CPUs, these sorts of issues emerge as bottlenecks. They&#39;re enough of a problem that the perf tool recently got a new sub-command, &#34;perf c2c&#34;, which tries to help identify false sharing (and other cache ping-ponging) issues much quicker.If you&#39;re interested in learning more about this class of issues and the new tool, there was an excellent talk at LPC 2022 by Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Markdown is a convenient but deeply limited markup language  with only a small subset of html&#39;s features. And yes, limitations are good because we want documents not web apps, etc, etc, but I mean &#34;images can&#39;t have captions&#34; limited, &#34;navigation bars don&#39;t exist&#34; limited. Actual important features of html don&#39;t exist in markdown, which is why almost every markdown platform ends up adding extensions and shortcodes. Why use markdown at all? Just use html.&#34;But html isn&#39;t style-agnostic&#34; yes it is. CSS isn&#39;t style-agnostic. Instead of a markdown browser, how about a browser with a fixed stylesheet and no js? You don&#39;t even need a browser for that, that could just be a userscript that gets plugged into an existing browser. It&#39;d break non-compliant websites that require javascript or custom css, but so would a markdown browser. Most people wouldn&#39;t write content for it, but most people wouldn&#39;t write content for a markdown browser either.&#34;But html is cluttered&#34; it doesn&#39;t have to be. This is a valid webpage:    &lt;!doctype html&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Page Title&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Page Title&lt;/h1&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
    Ut ac lorem ut massa euismod vestibulum.

    &lt;p&gt;Nullam rutrum blandit eleifend. Aenean a varius diam.
    Morbi sodales velit nunc, vel vestibulum lorem tempus sodales.

Personally, I prefer writing in markdown, but that&#39;s no reason to insert a markdown renderer into browsers. HTML can already be as sleek and readable as you want. If we added a new type of markup for anybody with a personal preference, we&#39;d never stop."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This doesn&#39;t really make sense, for a couple reasons...There are many flavors of markdown. We&#39;d need a standards body, compatibility suites, etc., and for all the browser vendors to adopt it.Meanwhile, markdown is designed to transform to HTML, which browsers already render. Adding a markdown-to-html plugin/step to your web server or publishing process is not exactly the most burdensome thing, relative to everything else it takes to develop, publish, and maintain a site. And it resolves the markdown flavors issue.The thing is, people could choose to publish, simple uncomplicated sites now -- it would be cheap and easy, too. The HTML is barely more complicated than the equivalent markdown, and it would take a few lines of CSS to apply a basic style.The many sites that choose to be complicated, cluttered, and expensive will continue to be so, for the same reasons they are now. Markdown would just be another way to build simple sites, which they don&#39;t want."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"HTML is already a markup language. You could just as easily make basic websites using HTML and some basic inline CSS.(They’d even have some extra features missing from Markdown that I’d consider still part of a basic content formatting suite like floating or multi-column layouts. They’d even have a defined standard for machine readable metadata!)The problem is that people don’t make websites like that very often, even though they can. This is trying to solve a problem that doesn’t currently exist."</p>

In this case, dismissing the “current” security code screen was a supported API surface and that should set off all the red flags.Of course it’s annoying to have to track the identity of “our screen” and bind that identity to event handlers, or make it accessible with context etc. But it’s necessary in anything remotely security-adjacent.(And never assume anything is a singleton unless you add a breadcrumb comment for someone who might change that assumption on a different team!)"</p>

I&#39;ve noticed I don&#39;t think about what I&#39;m building as much when working remote, I&#39;m just building it.That said, I don&#39;t think 100% office is good either. That tends to just burn me out and I know other people I work with say the same thing. I think I&#39;m at my best when it&#39;s 2-3 days in the office and the rest working from home.40 hours in the office is really extreme these days. And any potential benefit of having employees working together in an office 24/7 is going to be negated by their dissatisfaction. Were I working at Twitter I&#39;d probably be looking for a new job after this announcement. Not so much for the remote work decision either, but just the general lack of respect for how the employees prefer to work. This lack of flexibility probably means Musk won&#39;t just stop at remote work but he&#39;ll want keep track of your productivity, when you arriving in the morning, how long you take for lunch, etc. Working for these kinds of people in my experience is a living hell."</p>

FTX extended loans to Alameda using money that customers had deposited on the exchange for trading purposes, a decision that Mr. Bankman-Fried described as a poor judgment call, one of the people said.&#34;In the FTX International terms of service ( https://help.ftx.com/hc/article_attachments/9719619779348/FT... ) they say that users have full title, ownership and control of digital assets. They say that the assets are the property of the user, and shall not be loaned to FTX trading, shall not be treated as they belong to FTX trading, and that users control the assets in the account.So if they did indeed loan out customer deposits, that is just straight up criminal fraud, open and shut.

It’s been used pretty widely for “liquid” tumors for a while (eg leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma),but solid tumors are particularly difficult to target using current CAR-T therapy. If this CRISPR  tech can be applied widespread to solid tumors that opens up a huge swath of patients that can be treated.However cost and logistics are a huge factor. CAR-T therapy currently cost about $300,000-$500,000 to treat a patient. Beyond the cost of the immunotherapy you require a huge institutional investment because there are characteristic side effects that occur within the first 30 days of treatment which necessitates patients to be either admitted to the hospital for 30 days or stay in close proximity with daily check-ins (yes the cancer is getting treated BUT now your immune system is hyperactive which can be very dangerous in the short term).Very few academic hospitals, let alone community hospitals, have this bandwidth which will lead to cancer care being concentrated in a handful of a few very large cancer specific institutions."</p>

It is more similar to adoptive TIL therapy because it is using the T cell receptor (TCR) to target the cancer&#39;s mutations.  This has a huge advantage over CAR-T.At the moment we use CAR-T to target, mostly, B cell cancers.  These cancers have CD19 and CD20 on their cell surface, as do most B cells.  We can safely target these cells because it turns out your B cells aren&#39;t critical for life.  Think of it like an amputation.  Your B cells went rogue, you wipe them out.The problem is this doesn&#39;t translate to other cancers, which don&#39;t have an obvious cell protein you can target specific to a group of cells you can do without.All cancer cells have mutations, and all cells in the human body have to display a sample of its proteins on its cell surface. This way our immune system regularly identifies cancer and removes it.  Cancers that get established have somehow leveraged local immunosuppression to hold off the immune system, and so the immune system and cancer become a stalemate, or worse the cancer takes off and kills the person.If we can target the mutations of the cancer, then we can get at the heart of the cancer itself.You might ask why the cancer just doesn&#39;t display it&#39;s antigens on the surface.  If a cell does this it gets removed by NK cells (natural killers) - our body&#39;s fail safe.What I find interesting is that I didn&#39;t think we were close to predicting what TCRs can bind to to a peptide on MHC on the cell surface.  I&#39;m going to need to look at the article to findout how they did this.  I suspect they used a library of known TCR-antigen interactions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"You&#39;re going to get a lot of responses that say record-replay testing doesn&#39;t scale, is unmaintainable, etc. They&#39;re totally right.But the thing is, early on when your app is in flux, neither does writing Selenium code. There&#39;s a pretty big truism in UI automation that writing UI tests before a UI freeze is a recipe for a shit-ton of pain. Coding to ids or xpaths only gets you yay far if the UI flow itself fundamentally changes.But re-recording might be easy.Don&#39;t use stuff like this for long-standing tests. Unless you architect your app just right so that IDs are always stable, and you never change the interface, it&#39;ll break and break in ways that you can only fix by a complete re-record. Plus the tests tend to be extremely timing-fragile because recording uses delays instead of synchronization points, so they just won&#39;t work in CI.But do use stuff like this at your desk during bring-up, when the cost of a re-record is lower than the cost of a test rewrite and it&#39;s ok to re-run the thing if the first try craps out due to a timing glitch.And from there, keep an open mind.I went to a GTAC (Google testing conference) where a presentation made a very good argument--with numbers and everything--that for smaller projects with simple and more or less static UIs, and where the tests were all fundamentally scripted, there was almost no advantage to coding the tests later. Record-replay was the best way to go.But I definitely don&#39;t think a system like PlayWright fully replaces remote stubs like WebDriver and coding tests in the languages that can talk to it.At some point you hit the issue that the login screen changed and now every single test is invalid. It&#39;s awfully nice if you used Page Object Model and you have a single-point-of-truth to fix it.More to the point, test automation can do more than just execute a script repeatably. Randomized monkey testing is something you can really only do in code, ditto scenarios that need to talk to testing interfaces exposed from the app itself.Glad you found a tool that resonates with you!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Selenium just couldn&#39;t parse the over-engineered Javascript framework we had, and I had to pile on hacks on hacks.Excuse me, but isn&#39;t selenium actually a browser robot and not a javascript parser? I assume this is just that DOM is mutating so much that they could or could not find that element or always have to wait for it and comes with unreliability and such.I haven&#39;t used alternatives, but using selenium feels like solid &#34;Engine&#34; to make abstractions on."</p>

I grew tired of having the respect I afforded Marty, and his employer, with attempts to resolve the dispute privately, get turned into a giant waste of time, effort and money. The Reddit post had been up for 15 months and attempts to resolve the dispute with Marty had gotten me nowhere. With my patience stretched to the absolute limit, I decided to take steps to remove the Reddit post myself.Reddit Moderator: I reached out to one of the r/DOOM moderators. We made contact and arranged a call via Discord.The moderator introduced himself and spoke about his love for the DOOM franchise and its fanbase. Along with the r/DOOM subreddit, he told me he also moderated the official DOOM Discord server.I told him how Marty’s Reddit post had affected me deeply, both professionally and personally. It was a source of ongoing stress and harm, and I asked if he’d consider removing it.Much to my relief, he instantly took it down.But within 12 hours, the post was reinstated. The moderator blocked me on Discord and didn’t reply to my emails.A few days later, Marty’s lawyers contacted me and said removing the Reddit post had greatly offended him.

I express that as a compliment, even if in the real world it works against you.It&#39;s not the main topic, but I like to call out attention to this:&#34;incidences of online abuse escalated at an alarming rate as Marty’s Reddit post led to frustration over my alleged professional failure, and toxic gamers grew openly aggressive.They shared my personal details via message boards, including Reddit, which meant that abusers could now reach me in more ways than ever. They email-bombed my inboxes, crashing the server and clogging my messaging services, crippling my ability to communicate. They harassed my other clients with attempts to get me fired from their projects. They called my phone numbers around the clock, screaming messages full of abuse.I began receiving specific expressions of violence, the content so vivid it made me sick. The torrent of abuse telling me how to kill myself, how I’d be mutilated, how they would circulate photos of my body to traumatise my family, how my family would be murdered, how they’d hurt my animals, how they’d shoot up any event I attended, how I’d be raped to death, really started to wear me down in ways I couldn’t previously imagine.&#34;I&#39;m strongly against authoritarian overreach and used to consider trolling a &#34;fact of life&#34;, nothing requiring intervention. I no longer believe that. We&#39;re talking about a disappointing audio track for a stupid game yet the man and his family have to fear for their lives. And surely Mr Manager Marty looks at it with approval.A line has to be drawn in the sand. There must be a cost to such threats. A massive fine or some short prison time. Further, those enabling and launching the mob, even if unknowingly, need to carry responsibility too. This isn&#39;t just defamation, it spills over into real world danger."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a great writeup. What a clever design!I remember Apple had a totally different but equally clever solution back in the days of the 68K-to-PowerPC migration. The 68K had 16-bit instruction words, usually with some 16-bit arguments. The emulator’s core loop would read the next instruction and branch directly into a big block of 64K x 8 bytes of PPC code. So each 68K instruction got 2 dedicated PPC instructions, typically one to set up a register and one to branch to common code.What that solution and Rosetta 2 have in common is that they’re super pragmatic - fast to start up, with fairly regular and predictable performance across most workloads, even if the theoretical peak speed is much lower than a cutting-edge JIT.Anyone know how they implemented PPC-to-x86 translation?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember years ago when Java adjacent research was all the rage, HP had a problem that was “Rosetta lite” if you will. They had a need to run old binaries on new hardware that wasn’t exactly backward compatible. They made a transpiler that worked on binaries. It might have even been a JIT but that part of the memory is fuzzy.What made it interesting here was that as a sanity check they made an A-&gt;A mode where they took in one architecture and spit out machine code for the same architecture. The output was faster than the input. Meaning that even native code has some room for improvement with JIT technology.I have been wishing for years that we were in a better place with regard to compilers and NP complete problems where the compilers had a fast mode for code-build-test cycles and a very slow incremental mode for official builds. I recall someone telling me the only thing they liked about the Rational IDE (C and C++?) was that it cached precompiled headers, one of the Amdahl’s Law areas for compilers. If you changed a header, you paid the recompilation cost and everyone else got a copy. I love whenever the person that cares about something gets to pay the consequence instead of externalizing it on others.And having some CI machines or CPUs that just sit around chewing on Hard Problems all day for that last 10% seems to be to be a really good use case in a world that’s seeing 16 core consumer hardware. Also caching hints from previous runs is a good thing."</p>

To do this on prem, they needed an installer.I cooked up this idea of creating a dummy file (dd), formatting it into a file system, mounting it as a loopback device and deb-bootstrapping it. Then I chrooted inside it, installed all the dependencies needed, added all the code and things we needed for the application, left the chroot and use makeself to create a self extracting zip file of the whole application along with an initial config dialogue. We wrapped up the process using a Python script so that people create such &#34;installers&#34;.Once you ran the file, it would unzip itself into /opt/{something} and start up all the processes. Inside the chroot was Debian with a db and several other things running. Outside the chroot was Redhat or whatever. It ran surprisingly well and was used for a couple of years for all their customers even after Docker came out. I rejoined them as a contractor after they got a decent amount of funding and the same thing was still in use .I wrote about this as an answer to a Stack Overflow question back then https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5661385/packaging-and-sh...It was a proto docker without proper process isolation. Just file system isolation using chroot. Definitely brought back memories. The real value docker added was standardization, a central container registry, tooling etc. It mainstreamed these kinds of arcane old school sysad tricks into a generally usable product."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fun deep dive. In a previous life I wrote web apps, and I liked to develop on Chromebooks to make sure that everything ran smoothly on low-end machines.I would set a price point of $2-300, which usually meant I was lucky to get a Rockchip. And this was before it was popular to build for ARM architectures.And yet, ChromeOS&#39; chroot-based projects like crosh always managed to deliver. Surrounded by aluminum MacBooks and carbon-fiber Dells, I would run Rails apps and X GUIs and source builds on a rubberized hunk of plastic that had been designed for use in schools.I have always been surprised at how well that worked. If it was using the same fundamentals as Docker and Podman, I&#39;m not surprised that the containerization movement has enjoyed such popularity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yes, containers are more than chroot, until you:- Want to give them their own IP addresses or networks, or- Put upper bounds on their resources, or- Get tired of dealing with chroot and unshare and seccomp and probably other tools I&#39;m forgetting, or- You want to run an arm64 container on an x86 host with minimal configuration, or...this is a really fun (and important) exercise for anyone working with containers seriously to undergo but let&#39;s not trivialize how insanely easy Docked made creating containers become."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been using Kagi the last few months. I&#39;ve never had a reason to complain about its search results - they seem to work plenty well enough day to day that I don&#39;t really &#39;notice&#39; them. Like most, I now search reflexively, as an extension of the mind, so I only &#39;notice&#39; search when it&#39;s bad.What really excites me is that is that I&#39;m paying them. That sounds odd, but seriously. It&#39;s incredibly refreshing to know that the company providing my search results has an incentive to make things better for _me_ and not a legion of advertisers. With Google I can&#39;t help thinking about every keypress being logged to optimize sales pitches at me. I just don&#39;t feel that with Kagi, because I&#39;m paying them.Sure, they might be logging every keypress (I don&#39;t actually think they are, but you never can tell) but even if they were, I could be reasonably certain they were doing it to retain my subscription, which probably means making my search better, not selling me other stuff.It&#39;s a priveleged position to be in, and the economic argument isn&#39;t watertight, but in the &#34;search as a brain extension&#34; space it still _feels_ premium, because it creates trust. And that frees up brain space for other things - like where the hell was that article I was looking for?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just signed up and tried it a little bit and I like what I see so far. I find myself increasingly frustrated with Google search results for a particular use case: searching for documentation. For example, today&#39;s work had me thinking about Python&#39;s datetime and timedelta and I wanted a reference on what functions are available. With Google I am annoyed with results from geeksforgeeks.org and freecodecamp.com because they are not reference materials and generally only cover some basic use cases. In Google, those two sites are in the top four results. In Kagi, they are not. Instead, there is a longer-form blog post from guru99.com, stack overflow, and the official Python documentation.Now, I will admit that for this particular query Kagi and Google results are pretty close. But my general experience is that when I search in Google I find that I have to look farther down the search results to look past the blogspam to find the authoritative reference."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO this article misses the biggest issue with search engines today. It&#39;s less about any ranking algorithm (like PageRank), but rather the root cause is with indexing. No matter how much you fine tune your ranking system, if your index is filled with SEO junk and blogspam, you&#39;re fighting a losing battle from the start.For some reason, a lot of these search engines like to brag about the number of documents in their index, which never made sense to me. Maybe it was true in the past, but on the modern web, larger index !== better results. In fact, I&#39;d argue the opposite since you&#39;re much more likely to serve SEO spam.That was my motivation to start hacking around on CrowdView (https://crew-rho.vercel.app), a search engine specifically for forums and discussion content (e.g. forums, discords, twitter, reddit, etc). It has a curated index (today, curated by yours truly) to remove SEO junk and help you figure out &#34;what does a real, genuine human think about this think?&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the thick of it, illiquidity and insolvency blur. But not after the fact.As usual, Levine put it best: “the problem is not a timing mismatch, in which FTX’s customers asked for their cash back but FTX did not have enough ready cash because it had long-term but money-good loans out. The problem is that FTX took its customers’ money and traded it for a pile of magic beans, and now the beans are worthless and there’s a huge hole in the balance sheet” [1].Before one is insolvent, illiquidity and insolvency are circular questions of asset value. After the fact, it shouldn’t take someone more than a few minutes to come to a conclusion. (There is a deeper discussion on the folly of accepting as collateral assets correlated with confidence in oneself. I recommend reading the article.)[1] https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-11-09/bankma..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s even more funny is that Binance make it look like they are a stable financial institution, and it&#39;s thanks to their high standards that they won&#39;t acquire FTX.
Binance is most probably much more of a fraud than FTX.Binance doesn&#39;t even have physical headquarters in any country in this world - and the reason is that they are being actively investigated or banned almost everywhere."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why does anyone trust Binance either? They’re notoriously shady about where they operate and what assets they actually hold, to the point that they’re officially not headquartered anywhere.If you have $100k at Binance, is there any reason to believe you could withdraw it tomorrow? Any contract you may have with Binance is made with a local shell company that could just as well be a hot dog stand. Any money you’ve sent them is effectively nowhere.FTX was supposed to be above the board and they collapsed in a day. A few months ago FTX was the white knight buying out distressed crypto companies. Why would Binance do any better?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Serif&#39;s Affinity suite has probably the greatest value for money in the whole software industry. I mean 119 bucks ONE-TIME for three pretty comprehensive graphics apps which are polished and get constant updates is very hard to beat.For people making their living with graphical work (designers, photographers, etc.) Adobe is probably still the way to go (even if just to keep using the muscle memory). However for the many people who only need something like Photoshop or InDesign a couple of times a year, Affinity is just great."</p>

Nothing else seems to handle this case.  [1]I use Illustrator to make stitching patterns and lining up the corners in this way is absolutely essential, otherwise the stitches come out looking lopsided.[1] https://forum.affinity.serif.com/index.php?/topic/145760-how..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I migrated to Affinity after Adobe put the last nail in the coffin for me.I have to admit that even with some experience, Affinity doesn&#39;t get close to Photoshop in terms of shortcuts and ease of use (&#34;getting in the flow&#34;).Sometimes I even resort to using photopea web, rather than open affinity.That said, I really appreciate their pricing model and hope they stick to their guns."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Glasses are expensive because there is no competition. One company - Luxottica - owns pretty much everything.You go to LensCrafters and prices seem super expensive, so you go to Pearle Vision and that&#39;s expensive too, so you go to Target Optical and prices are still high and then you think maybe glasses are expensive, since you went to multiple stores and they all have similar prices. What you don&#39;t realize is that all those retail brands are owned by the same company - Luxottica [1]. They operate under several names, so there is an appearance of competition but there isn&#39;t.But wait, it isn&#39;t just stores, they also own eyewear brands such as Ray-Ban, Chanel, Coach, Oakley, Prada, Tiffany, and so on. Yes, all of those brands are owned by Luxottica [2].Wait, not done yet. They also own insurance. Luxottica owns the vision insurance company EyeMed. [3]Still not done. Luxottica has merged with Essilor and now own multiple lens brands [4].See 60 Minutes story on Luxottica if you&#39;re not outraged yet [5].Where are the anti-trust enforcers in this country and other countries, and why are they not doing anything?[1] https://www.luxottica.com/en/retail-brands[2] https://www.luxottica.com/en/eyewear-brands[3] https://eyemed.com/en-us/about-us[4] https://www.essilorluxottica.com/brands[5] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDdq2rIqAlM"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Same reason medical care is so expensive in the US: Insurance and the art of the upsell. The provider gets to charge high prices because the bulk of the cost is covered by insurance and thus &#34;hidden&#34; from consumers. The insurance company gets a non-trivial cut of the pie, which pads the bill further. And in my experience, when you go in with something wrong with you, most doctors will recommend (or perform without asking) tests that aren&#39;t covered by insurance and you don&#39;t find that out until the bill arrives in the mail.I have a pretty standard vision insurance plan and need glasses roughly every two years. (Two pairs: one for indoors, and sunglasses for outdoors and driving.) I go into an optometrist office and get my vision checked. $10 copay or whatever for the exam. Then the pain starts. The frame selection is terrible and it turns out that the only decent-looking frames and lenses cost 3-4x what insurance will cover. And insurance doesn&#39;t cover more-or-less &#34;required&#34; add-ons to lenses like anti-glare coatings. And the person selling you the glasses is _very_ good at convincing you that you need all the extras.I did the math one time and I paid $200 per year for vision insurance to save $190 (including the cost of the exam) on one pair of glasses.The last time I bought glasses, I took my (recent) prescription to an online eyelasses e-tailer website and purchased a pair that included all the fancy extras for $60 out the door. I don&#39;t _love_ them, but I can certainly live with them for the price."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Warby Parker recognized this as a business opportunity. I’m surprised others haven’t jumped in as well with reasonably priced eyewear.&#34;This author is uninformed. Others have jumped in. And Warby Parker wasn&#39;t even the first.15 years ago I would buy my single-vision prescription glasses from optical4less.com. The cost was $58 for 2 pairs, including worldwide shipping.Today I buy my glasses from Zenni. Last month, I paid $176.75 total for two pairs of glasses, each with single-vision photochromic lenses (and one pair with additional blue light blocking)."</p>
