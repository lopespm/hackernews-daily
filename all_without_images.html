								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love technical content like this. Not only is it incredibly interesting and informative, it also serves as a perfect counterpoint to the popular &#34;why does Netflix need X thousand engineers, I could build it in a weekend&#34; sentiment that is frequently brought up on forums like this one.Building software and productionalizing/scaling it are two very different problems, and the latter is far more difficult. Running a successful company always requires an unlimited number of very smart people who are willing to get their hands dirty optimizing every aspect of the product and business. Too many people today think that programming starts and ends at pulling a dozen popular libraries and making some API calls."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have some experience serving static content and working with CDNs. Here is what I find interesting / unique here:- They are not using OS page cache or any memory caching for that, every request is served directly from disks. This seems possible only when requests are spread between may NVMe disks since single high-end NVMe like Micron 9300 PRO has max 3.5GB/s read speed (or 28Gbps) - far less than 800Gbps. Looks like it works ok for long-tail content but what about new hot content everybody wants to watch at the day of release? Do they spread the same content over multiple disks for this purpose?- Async I/O resolves issues with nginx process stalling because of disk read operation but only after you&#39;ve already opened the file. Depending on FS / number of files / other FS activities, directory structure opening the file can block for significant time and there is no async open() AFAIK. How they resolve that? Are we assuming i-node cache contains all i-nodes and open() time is insignificant? Or are they configuring nginx() with large open file cache?- TLS for streamed media was necessary because browsers started to complain about non-TLS content. But that makes things sooo complicated as we see in the presentation (kTLS is 50% of CPU usage before moving to encryption offloaded by NIC). One has to remember that the content is most probably already encrypted (DRM), we just add another layer of encryption / authentication. TLS for media segments make so little sens IMO.- When you relay on encryption or TCP offloading by NIC you are stuck with that is possible with your NIC. I guess no HTTP/3 over UDP or fancy congestion control optimization in TCP until the vendor somehow implements it in the hardware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of the reasons they&#39;ve had to build most of this stuff themselfs is because they decided for some reason to use freeBSD.The NUMA work they did, I remember being in a meeting with them as a Linux Developer at Intel at the time. They bought NVMe drives or were saying they were going to buy NVMe drives from Intel which got them access to &#34;on the ground&#34; kernel developers and CPU people from Intel. Instead of talking about NVMe they spent the entire meeting asking us about howt the Linux kernel handles NUMA and corner cases around memory and scheudling. If I recall correctly I think they asked if we could help them upstream BSD code for NVMe and NUMA. I think in that meeting there was even some L9 or super high up NUMA CPU guy from Hillsborough they some how convinced to join.The conversation and technical discussion was quite fun, but it was sort of funny to us at the time they were having to do all this work on the BSD kernel that was solved years ago for linux.Technical debt I guess."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This sucks... I&#39;m sorry you had to go through this. The App Store review process is just pretty bad. It&#39;s especially frustrating when you see downright shitty apps on the store. The &#34;black-box&#34; aspect of it makes it that much more kafkaesque too.When I first submitted my app on there, they rejected it and complained that I used HealthKit but didn&#39;t mention it in the app description. The thing is, I did. My app description had a list of &#34;highlighted features&#34;, one them being &#34;Apple health integration&#34;.I was about to file an appeal, but then I saw a couple other apps with &#34;Integrates with Apple Health&#34; on its own line in the description. Figured that&#39;s probably what they were looking for (even though the guidelines don&#39;t explicitly say that) so I changed it and boom, the app was approved. I hate it, but it&#39;s not worth my time or the risk to fight it.For what it&#39;s worth, I think your app looks really good!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yep, I got this rejection when I made this tipping app (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tip-69/id1460610078).I went on to add OCR detection for receipts so you don&#39;t have to type in the amount, I added more tipping modes, I added split bill functionality, and eventually added an entire social network with the ability to share your receipt for the world to see, like or comment on.Must have spent months trying to get approved by Apple.I&#39;d rather no one ask me why."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They&#39;ve done this since the early days of the app store. Mostly-content apps without really broad appeal have long carried a high risk of rejection.&gt; Homescreen widgets: utterly useless, but can&#39;t get more iOS-y and less webapp-y than this, right?This especially, but really the whole post reads like the system working as intended.Granted (as the author notes) way too much shit gets through anyway, but that&#39;s not an excuse to do even worse. I do, as a user, wish they&#39;d tighten up the rules a lot and improve enforcement. I&#39;m quite sure it&#39;d improve my experience on the store (and probably on the web—imagine how much better the Reddit site would get, probably overnight, if their app got pulled over not being well-justified)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At a previous job, I was the engineering manager for a new neo-bank and was on call 24/7 for it. I have a beefy Lenovo P52 that I hated carrying around and leaving in my car lest it get stolen. So I got a GPD Pocket. It fit very well into my back pocket.Not only did it work great for emergency situations (I ran Ubuntu MATE as well) when I needed to SSH into machines, check stuff on Datadog, edit code to make a quick fix, push code to our K8S environments and more, but I actually found myself frequently at coffee shops and bars coding away happily on it. It brought a certain amount of freedom and cool factor with it. It was a delightful little device with a very sharp and crisp screen, a surprisingly useful keyboard that combined well with my i3 environment, that I could actually be productive on (save for running our test suite which took around 30 minutes and sucked the life out of the battery). It also got a lot of onlookers asking questions about it, leading to those ever so fun random conversations that can lead to night long friendships over wine and coffee.I genuinely miss it and will probably pick up another one now that I just got hired as a CTO for another project with equally demanding on-call schedules and uptime requirements. Although I don&#39;t drink anymore so none of those fun conversations. Ce la vie."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Micro PC is a really cool device, but owning one I couldn&#39;t really recommend it outside a very small niche.Form factor, ports, and performance are all great. The firmware is very frustrating though. Mine shipped with a newer firmware (4.18) than was available to download, and it was miserable. The machine would power on to blank screens, and have random crashes. I was wary of downgrading because I couldn&#39;t put the &#34;newer&#34; firmware back on.Finally gave in and stability was much improved on 4.13. Boot issues still happen though (less frequently). They seem possibly exasperated by Linux. It can require 3 or 4 attempts at holding the power button to force a reset. Unplug anything that could be back-feeding power so it will actually reset (not confirmed). Just all around annoying if you power it on and off a lot.Other issues to consider. The hinge support is somewhat fragile. I try to be gentle opening and closing. I think I also put some epoxy around the plastic screwhole pillar. The battery has a permanent over-discharge cutoff that a number of users have hit so I&#39;ve been careful to keep a charge on it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Had one for three years. Use it nearly every day, but I work with embedded systems in robots/industrial machinery. One handed operation, tons of IO, dual boot, fits in back pocket etc. have made this indispensable.One dead battery, replacement part from alibaba via GPD rep given link. Easy to disassemble via screwdriver and spudger. Works great now. Injection molded piece that held the threads where the hinge attached also failed. Drilled a little pinhole and added a small machine screw, nut and threadlocker. No more problems. Nut goes under the plastic hinge cover. The fix is literally better than original.Other than that, the only issue I&#39;ve had is getting grub to see the screen as landscape. Grub config options seem to get ignored. Oh well. Standard rotation is sorted with boot scripts and the OEM Windows 10 side works great."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m very optimistic for near-term AGI (10 years or less). Even just a few years ago most in the field would have said that it&#39;s an &#34;unknown unknown&#34;, we didn&#39;t have the theory or the models, there was no path forward and so it was impossible to predict.Now we have a fairly concrete idea of what a potential AGI might look like - an RL agent that uses a large transformer.The issue is that unlike supervised training you need to simulate the environment along with the agent, so this requires a magnitude more compute compared to LLMs. That&#39;s why I think it will still be large corporate labs that will make the most progress in this field."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting to see how he&#39;s progressed with this. When he first announced he was getting into AI it sounded almost like a semi retirement thing: something that interested him that he could do for fun and solo, without the expectation that it would go anywhere.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As someone who has recruited hundreds of candidates at this point I would urge caution with lists like this.By all means read the list, but rather than trying to grind through as many of the questions as possible, try to use it as inspiration and think of what you&#39;re actually curious about and which might tip you over one way or the other if you&#39;re on the fence. It&#39;s far better to have a good conversation about 1 thing which might affect your decision than a superficial sprint through a bunch of topics you don&#39;t actually care that much about.Secondly, consider that if you do well you are likely to have multiple rounds of interviews.  Think about which questions are likely to be most enlightening when you ask each interviewer.  Don&#39;t shy away from asking 2 people the same question if you think you&#39;ll get different perspectives. If you ask a peer engineer the diversity questions you may well get quite a different answer from asking the HR/recruiting person for instance (eg one might give you a cultural insight vs the other might just give you the policy/factual answer).I once interviewed a candidate[1] who had printed off a whole list like this and insisted on grinding through the whole thing.  It was weirdly offputting, but he was such a monster programmer that he was already a clear hire. It gave an insight into the thoroughness of his nature though and showed that he was absolutely perfect for the (critical) role we were hiring him for where mistakes were extremely costly.[1] Hi Fluffy! If you see this I hope you&#39;re doing well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m obviously cherry picking, but if an applicant asks me a series of questions akin to &#34;what source control tool do you use and why&#34; I&#39;m going to begin doubting that this person can focus on actually shipping product. There&#39;s this whole scene of people who do performative, almost theatrical, quality programming but nigh on forgot how to actually ship features, and questions like those are a hint they might be in that camp.EDIT: to add some context, i run a small startup, we need the whole team able to ship. I can imagine that in certain bureaucratic bigcorps, performatively obsessing on code/process quality can be useful, because the distance between the programmer and the customer/user is so long."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of the comments in here are reacting to the large list of questions being very off-putting. There&#39;s a deeper issue here that we still don&#39;t have a good answer for: it is incredibly hard to tell what a company is like until you start working there, and asking questions either leads to very surface-level answers or just flat out catfishing candidates. Companies being transparent and detailed about how they operate is the exception.The company gets to spend 3+ hours finding out information about a candidate, but the candidate has little option to discover company culture for themselves. They can snoop around on LinkedIn but this doesn&#39;t answer much about culture unless there is someone who is prolifically producing content inside the company. There&#39;s glassdoor which might answer part of it but generally the reviews there are extremely shallow and biased by the skills, mindset, and treatment of whoever wrote the review.So what&#39;s the answer? I think &#34;ask targeted questions&#34; is fine as long as it is not &#34;ask 100 general questions&#34;. I haven&#39;t seen a single article on the meta of how to pick what questions to ask or how to get past shallow answers. I also think the entire industry is performing pretty terrible in this space and we don&#39;t have a good answer for how to handle it that is common or even well-known. This leads to lost candidates or (intentionally or unintentionally) catfished candidates who will leave after joining."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So I&#39;m just at the tail end of a project where I&#39;m attempting to build a collaborative text editor, and it&#39;s been absolute hell. I figured it would be a tricky problem, but I had no idea how far down the rabbit hole goes. I kept thinking, gosh, there&#39;s gotta be a backend service that bakes this in, if there isn&#39;t it would be a great business opportunity.I almost want to scrap all of my code and move it to Supabase. Congrats to the team on this launch, very cool.edit: actually, after thinking it through, I&#39;m not clear on what Supabase is calling multiplayer. Presence is one thing, but when I think multiplayer, I&#39;m thinking conflict resolution. Is this an OT/CRDT implementation? Or is it just presence?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"hey hn, supabase ceo herewe&#39;re excited about this release - it adds a few neat features to our Realtime server[0]. For those who don&#39;t read the post (it&#39;s quite long), our Realtime server was initially built for subscribing to Postgres changes via websockets. We&#39;ve added Broadcast functionality (for &#34;ephemeral&#34; messages that don&#39;t need to be persisted to Postgres) and Presence (similar to Broadcasts, but it retains an eventually-consistent state between users).We were planning a larger write-up with all the technical details but it became a bit long. Some highlights:- Realtime is built with Elixir an Phoenix[1]- We&#39;ve moved to a single, global cluster
- We&#39;re using `Phoenix.Tracker` to globally distribute the Erlang PIDs of all of our Postgres connections. This guarantees there is only a single connection to each database.- We&#39;ve implemented a &#34;leaky-bucket&#34; rate-limiter using Erlang&#39;s `:counters` module[3] for &#34;per tenant&#34; rate-limiting. We&#39;ll move this to a global rate-limiter in the future- We&#39;re currently seeing ~2000 concurrent connected users - it will be interesting to see what this spikes up to now that this is on HNIt&#39;s still in heavy development, and we&#39;ll make sure to detail all the choices we take as we continue solve problems. A few of the Realtime team will be here answer questions - @chasers, @wenbo, @abc3erl.[0] Realtime: https://github.com/supabase/realtime[1] Phoenix Framework: https://www.phoenixframework.org/[2] rate limiter: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket[3] :counters: https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/counters.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really neat, I have been keeping an eye on Supabase, this (presence) is the feature that will finally push me to build a side project with it. I have one in mind.Anyone from Supabase here, do you have any plans to build in support for CRDT toolkits such as Yjs or AutoMerge for these features? It would make working with them so much easer if there was a plug and play backend.The one other thing I would love to see next from them is an offline sync product, so you could partially sync a users dataset to their device and save back any changes later (bonus points for then combing that with CRDTs). Maybe the WASM Postgres yesterday [0] could be a foundation for such a product.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32498435"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m not OP, but the timing context of this post is important:Today, California has issued a FlexAlert, and Powerwalls in PG&amp;E and SCE will start discharging at 6pm to help reduce load on the grid. It&#39;s not a daily action, but it&#39;s emergency support when the grid needs it the most.And the time window when it happens is important: Powerwalls are contributing to  to reduce load when the grid needs it the most. It&#39;s not meant to support the entire grid, just directly attack the problem at the time where every Watt and Watt-hour counts.You don&#39;t need to own Powerwall to benefit from this, just like how you don&#39;t own the peaker plants that typically spark up at these times. You benefit because there&#39;s a big chance that there won&#39;t be rolling blackouts in California this afternoon—distributed assets like this can be dispatched.Dispatch Info: https://twitter.com/AlexGuichet/status/1559748677626777600A VPP tracker in the Tesla community: https://www.lastbulb.com/virtual-power-plantSome technical details of how Tesla VPPs work, as organized distributed systems: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggdYts4muu0CAISO Grid Outlook: https://www.caiso.com/TodaysOutlook/Pages/default.aspx"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m contemplating enrolling in this.Right now I&#39;m a net generator, even with our 100 deg days, but I am not 100% off grid. The Panels charge the Powerwall during the day, the Powerwall is drained overnight.The batteries currently do not survive the night. Even though the house cools down, it retains enough heat that the AC still kicks on, thus draining the battery. Note my AC is 78 all day/night. We got a thing from the power company &#34;do these things on this day and get power credits by lowering your usage&#34;, and, of course, we already do all that...no credits for us!So typically during transition at dawn, I pull in grid power.But I&#39;m still a net generator, they get more than I take.The concern was simply if I enroll in this, then the batteries kick in and drain even before the evening, and I go to grid power sooner.But, thinking about it, &#34;I don&#39;t care&#34;. It&#39;s an offset. They&#39;re draining because they need the load NOW, and I can provide it. Later, when things settle down, I&#39;ll pull it back.I think this works out, simply as a &#34;be a good citizen&#34;, use my battery to prevent someone in Fresno&#39;s AC browning out late in the heat of the afternoon.Maybe I&#39;m just being whimsical, but I&#39;m still thinking about it.Also thinking about bolting on another battery, I already have two."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Quick math shows a long range Model 3 has about six times as much battery capacity as a Powerwall. I’m willing to bet more people have Model 3’s than Powerwalls. And I’m willing to bet 16% of your car’s battery capacity will impact you far less than 100% of your Powerwall.F-150 Lightning called it right: EV’s should ship with grid-tie inverting."</p>

There is little to no constitutional protection for free speech in Australia and defamation is routinely employed successfully in fairly speculative situations (for example, politicians, as public figures, suing journalists they don&#39;t like). Every time a question comes up like this it is genuinely an unknown what the court will do and no clear precedent suggesting they weigh potential broad impact of decisions heavily in their judgement.So this could easily have come down the other way and we could have a precedent suggesting potential liability for literally anybody who links to anything."</p>

The specific constraints applied in the suit which led to the High Court have been found not to apply.I don&#39;t have a list of what do, I just hypothesise there could be other constraints. Private agreements, CSAM laws, IPR laws, which go to why you cannot provide a hyperlink.Not a Lawyer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Low profile ergonomic mechanical keyboard is a pretty deep hole to dive into.
You can design your own PCB, order it from manufacturer and build the exact keyboard you want (split, wireless, with knobs, any form and key count).
It is not for everyone and might require soldering, but possibilities are endless.Additional resources:- r/ErgoMechBoards: https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/- Low Profile Discord: https://discord.com/invite/dBSRZ2a- Collection of split low profile mechanical keyboards: https://kbd.news/tag/low-profile/- &#34;A Tiny, Ultra-Affordable Keyboard You Can Build Yourself!&#34; video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqpBKuEVinw"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks fantastic!A thought-experiment that may interest you coming from someone (me) who already has happily spent several hundreds of dollars on mechanical keyboards and uses them every single day:Let&#39;s imagine the keyboard could be bought today as-is with a simple &#34;Buy Now&#34; button and price was no concern.The two main reasons I would _still_ hesitate to hit that button are:1. I absolutely and undoubtedly need to know what it SOUNDS and FEELS like. Is it linear, tactile, clicky? How much? I turned my speakers to max because I assumed you&#39;d have some audio-track running but to no avail. Did I miss something?2. I wish there was a &#39;blank&#39; version with zero typography anywhere. Just all black. I touch-type and have not looked at my keyboard in 15 years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I guess this is a good place to share my open source large format laser cutter design for sewing projects. It’s cheap to make, works pretty well, and the whole gantry assembly slides right off leaving just a sheet of plywood with low profile 3D printed rails on the sides. So I throw my rug over it and it becomes my floor when not in use. Important because the laser cutter can cut a full 60” wide piece of fabric two yards long. It’s basically 5 foot by 6 foot, and I don’t have space in my apartment for a dedicated machine that takes up all that space. But since this doubles as my floor it works great! Also includes a raspberry pi camera on the laser head which serves as a pattern scanner. I really want to finish my video on this thing, I’ve just been busy. But please take a look and considering building it! If you have any questions open a GitHub issue and I will do everything I can to help. I think it’s a great starting point (designed in three weeks) and I’d LOVE for other people to reproduce it and extend the design! The machine has a few hiccups but I use it all the time for my sewing projects and it is SO nice to get all the cutting done repeatably and automatically. You can even scan existing clothes often without disassembly and turn those in to digital patterns!https://github.com/tlalexander/large_format_laser_cutter"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Didn&#39;t expect to see sewing patterns on HN, but not complaining, this looks really cool!While on the topic, my girlfriend recently showed me this site: https://freesewing.org . It&#39;s fully open source and all the patterns are actually parametric, meaning you can customize the patterns to exact body measurements. Their custom JS framework for designing patters as well as the rest of the platform is MIT licensed [0] and the patterns are all Creative Commons.[0] https://github.com/freesewing/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the British Army every subunit is entitled to train someone in sewing and using sewing machines so that they can repair the subunit’s clothes and webbing equipment, including in the field. It’s a very creative course and people come back able to build you all kinds of rigs and pouches and things like this from webbing and Cordura that are extremely robust. The soldiers are all super keen to get on the course and to learn to sew."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really appreciate this post and how it highlights the power of becoming involved in occupation. I use that term in the context of the fact that my spouse is an Occupational Therapist by trade. In that field, the term occupation refers to a collection of activities of daily living, not a &#34;job&#34; per se. Rather than seeing patients through a framework of diagnosis or disability, they look at activities and people&#39;s ability to perform them, and intervene where there is lack. In practice that may involve helping an amputee learn how to put on socks, or helping an autistic child participate in education. More broadly, a central philosophy of their field is that meaningful occupation is a powerful motivator that has cascading effects across the many component activities in somebody&#39;s daily life. OP&#39;s post described how becoming involved as a Guix contributor effectively organized and motivated other areas of their life as well. The fact that we all are here hanging out on a VC&#39;s forum tends to color our idea of what value means. I think this post inspires that there is value to not only the community but also the individual as well in just &#34;doing cool stuff&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not a developer but I totally relate to this. Most of my creative pursuits are weird, niche, sometimes avant-garde. If I didn&#39;t make my artifacts, nobody else would, and it is so intrinsically rewarding to see my visions instantiated, even if they pale in comparison to my first imagining of what they might be. Because I have fringe-y interests, most people don&#39;t necessarily &#34;get&#34; it. (Probably true of everyone else on HN as well.) But the people who do get it, I found them on the internet, and I thank God for that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I believe already some 2 decades ago Bill Gates said that the biggest failure in software is the lack of productivity gains in software development.Just to cherry pick a dramatized example. In the late 90s, one of my first programming experiences was in Delphi. It&#39;s a very visual way to program. You drag and drop a UI together from standardized elements. You could data bind things like input fields to a data source. You&#39;d double click a button and it takes you to the already created &#34;onclick&#34; event where you do the actual coding. In a way, this is still similar to how you can &#34;program&#34; Microsoft Access today.In this same period (I was in a computer science study) I was moaning to my teacher how tricky programming in C was. I made tiny memory management errors crashing the entire PC, with zero debug output.His words: &#34;Don&#39;t worry. By the time you get to work, you&#39;ll just do modeling&#34;.Now I work on the web. It&#39;s been 30 years since Delphi and instead of productivity gains, we&#39;ve taken steps in the opposite direction. There is no standardized UI library. JavaScript has no standard library. There&#39;s no single unified architecture. There&#39;s no standard tool chain. It&#39;s all very low level after which we stitch together fragile semi-abstractions.I know it&#39;s an imperfect comparison, but I hope it gets the point across. It&#39;s all far too low level and fragile.This doesn&#39;t just hurt productivity, also accessibility. It&#39;s simply not beginner friendly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great post - the one word missing, &#34;maintenance.&#34; Most programming work is done maintaining/enhancing existing code. The greenfield work is a piece of cake by comparison.You want to do the hard stuff? Maintain existing code you&#39;re not familiar with.The problems around maintaining unfamiliar code are huge, largely unsolved, expensive and risky. There&#39;s a little branch of computer science called Program Comprehension and no one pays any attention. Though most programming money is spent on maintenance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been programming for over 30 years, and never been as productive as before. Need to load and decode a jpeg/png, I grab stb_image.h. Need to decode an ogg file, libogg. Need to decompress, libz. Need to decode video, libavformat. Need physics, libbullet. Need truetype fonts, freetype. Need a GUI, Qt. Need SSL, libssl.My day becomes selecting libraries, integrating them, and testing integration. My business code is &lt; 20% of our entire codebase. And I’m much more productive in 2022 than in 1992."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Aside from running Ceph as my day job, I have a 9-node Ceph cluster on Rasberry Pi 4s at home that I&#39;ve been running for a year now, and I&#39;m slowly starting to move things away from ZFS to this cluster as my main storage.My setup is individual nodes, with 2.5&#34; external HDDs (mostly SMR), so I actually get sligtly better performance than this cluster, and I&#39;m using 4+2 erasure coding for the main data pool for CephFS.CephFS has so far been incredibly stable and all my Linux laptops reconnect to it after sleep with no issues (in this regard it&#39;s better than NFS).I like this setup a lot better now than ZFS, and I&#39;m slowly starting to migrate away from ZFS, and now I&#39;m even thinking of setting up a second Ceph cluster.  The best thing with Ceph is that I can do a maintenance on a node at any time and storage availability is never affected, with ZFS I&#39;ve always dreaded any kind of upgrade, and any reboot requires an outage.  Plus with Ceph I can add just one disk at a time to the cluster and disks don&#39;t have to be the same size.  Also, I can move the physical nodes individually to a different part of my home, change switches and network cabling without an outage now.  It&#39;s a nice feeling."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Man, Ceph really doesn&#39;t get enough love. For all the distributed systems hype out there - be it Kubernetes or blockchains or serverless - the ol&#39; rock solid distributed storage systems sat in the background iterating like crazy.We had a huge Rook/Ceph installation in the early days of our startup before we killed off the product that used it (sadly). It did explode under some rare unusual cases, but I sometimes miss it! For folks who aren&#39;t aware, a rough TLDR is that Ceph is to ZFS/LVM what Kubernetes is to containers.This seems like a very cool board for a Ceph lab - although - extremely expensive - and I say that as someone who sells very expensive Raspberry Pi based computers!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I will once again lament the fact that WD Labs built SBCs that sat with their hard drives to make them individual CEPH nodes but never took the hardware to production.  It seems to me there&#39;s still a market for SBCs that could serve a CEPH OSD on a per-device basis, although with ever increasing density in the storage and hyperconverged space that&#39;s probably more of a small business or prosumer solution."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Housing in the US has gotten to where it is due to horrible laws effectively allowing total tax avoidance for landlords.Take some investment property. You buy it at some basis price, let&#39;s say 500k. You rent it out for 15k a year. Each year you can offset your rental income against deprecation of the property and property taxes - meaning, you pay no income tax on your rental income.~30 years later, you&#39;ve deprecated it down to an effective value of $0, so you hypothetically would have to start paying taxes on your rental income(of course, you can still deduct property taxes against that). What do you do? Well, there&#39;s something called a 1031 exchange - this lets you sell an investment property, and as long as the funds go directly into another investment property, you pay no capital gains taxes. So guess what? You can buy a brand new investment property with a new(albeit adjusted) cost basis, and you can start the entire cycle of depreciation and deduction all over again on your new, more expensive, property.So, you&#39;ve now held this property your entire life, and you die and pass it to your kids - well, great news, unless your estate is over 12 million dollars(and double that for a married couple), you pay no estate taxes.  And even more fun - when you inherit property, the cost basis is &#34;reset&#34; to the present day value of the property at time of inheritance - So your children can now rent the property out, deprecate it, and pay no income tax on the rental income either, and continue the cycle.The net result is that rental properties generate a ton of income for the owners, who pay almost nothing in taxes. Even if they do pay property tax, property tax rates are generally much lower than income tax rates."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a simple problem, we turned housing into an investment.  Now everyone who owns a home is incentivized to ensure their investment is maximized and that results in a lot of NIMBYism.  The simple solution is we need more housing in cities and suburbs.  How we get there is an exercise that&#39;s taken on by local housing authorities and they are not incentivized to solve the problem.  That&#39;s because they work for voters who are currently living in the area opposed to future people who aren&#39;t contributing to the vote.States are going to have to step in and override cities that aren&#39;t being effective, this cannot be solved from the federal level.  They are going to have to say, these permitting processes are too restrictive, homeowners can add backyard units or convert their homes to duplexes/etc, and make it easy for apartment builders to buy a few homes to make small apartment complexes even if the neighborhood hates it or the city has been stalling on that kind of development."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fraud protection of credit cards is the root of modern e-commerce. In some ways, Visa and Mastercard are the privatized court systems of the internet.If I end up on a random, self-hosted ecommerce site and decide to make a purchase - what guarantee do I have that the item will show up or be as-described? If I bought something through a bank transfer, reversing that purchase would be incredibly difficult. And, suing a merchant is prohibitively slow, expensive, and arduous.Also, modern B2C SaaS is built on credit card subscriptions. The ability for a merchant to pull payments on a recurring basis from a credit card requires an incredible amount of trust. If consumers had to push payment every month or year to continue subscriptions (instead of having it automatically debited), then churn rates would skyrocket and modern SaaS multiples would crash - taking company valuations with it.So, I&#39;m sure online merchants are happy to keep paying their ~3% fees as long as sales continue. Nobody wants to go back to &#34;Cash on Delivery&#34;, and nobody wants to hire workers to knock on doors asking for bills to be paid."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Living in New York City, I&#39;ve noticed that there are a whole lot of businesses that are either cash-only or card-only.I always understood the cash-only ones. If you can get plenty of customers who are willing to pay in cash, why would you want to pay credit card fees?The card-only ones were harder for me to understand, until I realized that handling cash costs money, too. Somebody needs to count it all at least once a day, if not more. Employees can steal it. Robbers can steal it. You need a safe. You need cash registers. You need to get the cash deposited in the bank, by paying someone to go do that. You need to maintain an inventory of smaller bills and coins to make change. You need to train people on all of this.Even just the accounting costs might make up the 2-3 percent in fees. &#34;Your register said you made $150 in cash that day, but the deposit that night was only $135.&#34; That&#39;s what you pay accountants to deal with, rather than just exporting from your Square account to Quickbooks or whatever.I had this realization because I went to a new coffee shop that had opened up. It appeared to be owned and operated by just one lady, and she was really nice. So, as I normally do for the nice local business owners in my neighborhood, I got out some cash instead of a card, thinking it would benefit her business. But then she told me they were card-only and it dawned on me: she&#39;s just one lady running a store by herself, _of course_ she doesn&#39;t want to deal with cash.So, I&#39;m not sure the 2-3 percent fees are all that bad, though I could be convinced otherwise. Plenty of small business owners seem pretty happy just setting up a Square reader and not dealing with the headache of cash. I think there&#39;s a lot of value in that for them."</p>

It breaks up one of the &#34;long poles&#34; in the project schedule.Hardware buttons and switches have to be designed, tested, re-designed, and validated very early in the process of designing a new model so that there is time to figure out how to manufacture / source all the parts, how they integrate with the rest of the car&#39;s systems, and how they&#39;ll be wired and assembled.  Just imagine what the impact would be if late in the process a new feature needs to be added!  Pretty much forget about it, add it in the next major model refresh.With a touchscreen all those dependencies go away.  The hardware team just says &#34;there&#39;s going to be an iPad sized capacitive touch screen here for climate/infotainment, and another custom sized display here for the instrument cluster&#34;.  The software guys can independently do the design of the UI, changing things down to the very last moment, or even after the last moment if the car can be updated."</p>

Tactile interfaces (buttons, wheels, keyboards...) perform generally better when well arranged. Mercedes did a good job about that thirty years ago. Logical layout, one button one task, LEDs within a button representing the status and the buttons arranged in the layout of the seat.I wonder how a complete industry just assumed that touchscreens are somewhat better just because their widespread in smartphones. Smartphone are small devices, require visual attention, every app is different and distracts the users, touchscreens are cheap and - therefore working on them is slow. Apple and Lenovo tried both the add a &#34;TouchBar&#34; but the tacticle keyboard has proven to be better. Apple tried also a touch area in Apple Remote, the current one is back to tactile buttons ;)"</p>

It started with one of our engineers showing up in slack 6 weeks ago &#34;So I did something crazy over the weekend...&#34; from there it evolved into much more.The post explains a lot of the high level, but we&#39;re going to being doing some deeper dives as well including the build process, but also some of how the tutorials are powered by an internal notion doc which allows us to easily iterate and collaborate on the tutorials themselves.Perhaps our favorite easter egg is that you can bring your own SQL into it for example: https://www.crunchydata.com/developers/playground?sql=https:..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is so awesome for two reasons, Postgress isn&#39;t exactly easy to setup, this makes it so much easer for tutorials, anything that makes teaching it quicker is good!It&#39;s also an amazing demonstration of the power of WASM, I am utterly convinced that DBs running in browser via WASM on top of the &#34;coming soon&#34; filesystem/block store api [0] will be the future of all offline first apps. I think it&#39;s going to be SQLite that really sines here (it will be a smaller package), but if you can run Postgres in browser, you potentially have a close alignment between your server and browser implementations.I love the idea of running Django in browser via PyScript with Postgres!0: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileSystem - This API doesn&#39;t grant access to the users file system, but a local virtual one just for the website. It will operate at the block level so can be used to provide efficient persistent storage for WASM DBs.—Edit rather than replying individually:It’s so important when teaching people a new thing, like sql, to hit the ground running. A lot of these people will have no experience with Docker, package managers or compiling from source. It’s so important to make technology accessible to all. This does that! Imagine high school kids having a lesson on SQL and running Postgres’s just by opening a webpage!We shouldn’t assume that someone learning Postgres, or just SQL via it, is a developer with experience of other areas of development or system administration."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sometimes non-accounting people get hung-up on the words &#34;debit&#34; and &#34;credit&#34; and think they have to do with &#34;owing&#34; or &#34;being owed&#34; money. The effect of a debit or credit on the business depends on the accounts in the transaction and debit and credit don&#39;t have anything to do with the &#34;direction&#34; of a flow of money.My 100-level accounting instructor summarized it as: &#34;A debit is the entry in the left column, and a credit is an entry in the right column.&#34; Without the context of the specific accounts being debited or credited the terms themselves mean nothing.Aside: A 100-level knowledge of accounting can confer near &#34;super powers&#34; when it comes to dealing with finance and accounting people. Double-entry bookkeeping is one of the oldest and longest-practiced &#34;IT&#34; disciplines. Your work probably touches revenue / expenses for your employer and someday you&#39;ll need to interface with accounting or finance people. Being able to speak the language, even poorly, has helped me gain trust and credibility that I don&#39;t believe speaking only in IT terms would have."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Any time the idea of double entry bookkeeping comes up there is nothing but unanimous advocacy for it. This thread echoes the same sentiment where there&#39;s several comments about the importance of double entry. And yet like all previous endorsements I&#39;ve heard, I&#39;ve not been able to take away why it is so important. The reasons are always around error tracking, tracing source of funds, standing the test of time etc. and yet in my head I&#39;m not able to envision the specific problem double entry can solve that single entry cannot.Somewhere in my head I feel a double entry system makes sense if you have two different parties making respective entry. But if it&#39;s all with a single party, single entry system should be equivalent to a double entry system. My accounting concepts are weak so I&#39;m unable to justify. Hoping someone with more expertise can shed some light here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s good to see Martijn Braam fought the good fight on things like the PinePhone Pro bootloader in eMMC, and I&#39;m sorry to hear the situation became untenable.After Pine64 went to all the trouble to make a series of branded early developer editions for various distros, and ongoing community goodwill outreaches, I didn&#39;t expect something like this to happen.IMHO, any handheld hardware right now wanting to be open and sustainable Linux should probably start by making sure it&#39;s solid with PostmarketOS configured with a mainline kernel, as a good test.  (PostmarketOS is a litmus test for purity, and has had a bunch of work to make bringing it up easier than the usual server/desktop purity test of Debian.)  Working Phosh and Plasma userlands running atop PostmarketOS are good further tests.  Supporting additional distros, userlands, and hacking is also important.(Even if the hardware is something like the Purism Librem 5, which has invested heavily in lots of good distro work, if PostmarketOS with mainline kernel boots cleanly and runs solidly, that&#39;s a good sign.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unless PINE64 changes course hard, I think this will be the moment they died, so to say. They may keep making SBCs etc alongside other vendors but the phones/tablets/laptops/watches/etc would continue being novelties and realistically majority e-waste. Really quite sad. If I&#39;d name one single person in the FLOSS community who&#39;s done the most good for mobile open source, it&#39;d be OP. Thank you so much for your service, work, and patience up until now.I fail to understand the reasoning of PINE64 on stuff like this recently. It&#39;s like they became a spiritually fundamentally different company. Can&#39;t see how this is supposed to make them money either.&gt; Now I can just focus on making postmarketOS work better. On the PINE64 hardware, and all the many other devices supported by postmarketOS...Maybe not so terrible after all. For a while there I almost thought pmOS was"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just wanted to say thanks to Martijn Braam for all the work he&#39;s put into PostmarketOS along with the other pmOS devs. I was lucky enough to snag a pinetab when the first batch was released, and I was blown away by the quality of pmOS.This was my first taste of mobile Linux, and pmOS was easily the best distro I used on it in terms of documentation, install tools, performance, and package selection. pmOS has the advantage of being more mature than other mobile Linux distros, but all the work they&#39;ve put in over the years has really paid off and helped make the ecosystem more viable, so thank you!I&#39;m really sad to learn about this with Pine64, I had a hint of this when I saw there has never been a second batch of pinetabs and no communication about it (at least that I saw). I had no idea it was this bad though and this makes zero sense why they would kill the ecosystem they spent so long building. It sounds like the decision was made purely based on reducing user support requests? Even though someone that buys one of these is likely to be a tinkerer/hacker with prior experience with *nix and distros already have their own community support channels and would already be doing most of that work for free?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One topic I&#39;d like to see more discussion around is how best to set up staging environments for Docker Compose projects.Ever since the V2 migration, I&#39;ve been banging my head against multiple bugs in Docker Compose itself, which has severely damaged my trust in it as a production-ready utility. I no longer feel like I can safely update Compose without running extensive testing on each release.For example, my journey since migrating to V2 has been:* Originally on 1.29.2  - Stable and I did not encounter any issues.

* Swapped to 2.3.3.  - As part of the migration from V1, docker-compose lost track of several networks and started labeling them as external. Not a huge deal.

  - docker-compose stopped updating containers when the underlying image or configuration changed (#9291). This broke prod for a while until I noticed nothing was getting updated.

* Updated to 2.7.0, which was the latest release at the time.  - This introduced a subtle bug with env_file parsing (#9636), which again broke prod in subtle ways that took a while to figure out.

* Updated to 2.8.0, which was the latest release at the time and before the warning was put up.  * This broke a lot of things as it renamed containers and generated duplicate services, etc.

* Finally swapped to 2.9.0. No issues yet, but I&#39;m keeping an eye out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like to divide up my compose files into three:1. A `docker-compose.yaml` for basic configuration common among all environments2. A `docker-compose.dev.yaml` for configuration overrides specific to development3. A `docker-compose.prod.yaml` for configuration overrides specific to productionThen I have `COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yaml:docker-compose.dev.yaml` in my `.env` file in the root of the project so I can just run `docker compose up` in dev, and `COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yaml:docker-compose.prod.yaml` in a `prod.env` file so I can run `docker compose --env-file=prod.env up` in production. Sometimes also a `staging.env` file which is identical to `prod.env` but with a few different environment variables.It&#39;s been working pretty well for me so far."</p>

A manager was pretty much dismissive of everything anyone of a lower caste did / wouldn&#39;t communicate with them effectively.HR absolutely struggled with the issue.  The HR folks tasked with dealing with discrimination issues largely had spent their time constructing company wide emails and classes that revolved around white folks discriminating against others / concepts of privilege, absolutely froze when faced with a discrimination issue outside that stereotype.Long story short legal eventually was the brave one and decided that yes it was discrimination and the manager in question was asked to move on.  The folks he refused to work with were compensated and their status in the company (pay scale, etc) was corrected.As one of my Indian college&#39;s observed about the manager in question &#34;If he was white this would have been dealt with sooner.&#34;Credit to my Indian coworkers who really pushed this issue with HR and made legal act in the end.  They wanted nothing to do with this kind of  behavior."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Out of curiosity, for Indians working in America, how hard is it to hide your caste or pretend to be of another caste altogether?Is this something that comes up in conversation among Indians? Do names tend to correlate to you caste? And if so, do people change them as a way of hiding their family caste?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My dad once told me of how at his work (in the 1980s or early 1990s, I think), they had a team of two Indians assigned to a project. One turned out to be of a much &#34;higher&#34; caste than the other, and refused to work with the other, making him utterly useless to the project.It&#39;s good that Apple, IBM and other tech companies are taking steps to prevent this sort of discrimination. It&#39;s a shame that Google seems be going in the opposite direction."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My 2c (not exhaustive for what you want to do, probably):1) Get some statistics/probability basics. It&#39;s full of people (you can see a lot of analyses on Kaggle) that &#34;do machine learning&#34; but make very silly mistakes (e.g. turn categorical data into a float and use it as a continuous variable when training a model).2) take a look at traditional machine learning approaches. Nowadays you&#39;re swamped by DL (a lot of good suggestions on this thread, I won&#39;t chime in), and you miss the fact that, sometimes, a simple decision tree, or dimensionality reduction approaches (e.g. PCA or ICA) can yield an incredible value in a very short time on huge datasets.I had written a fairly short post about it when I finished my georgia tech path https://www.franzoni.eu/machine-learning-a-sound-primer/3) It can take a lot of time to become effective in ML, effective as in, what you _manually create_ is as effective as picking an existing trained model, fine tune it, and use it. This can be frustrating: low hanging fruits are pretty powerful and you don&#39;t need to understand a lot about ML algorithms to pick them up.4) Consider MOOCs or online classes. I took Georgia Tech OMSCS, I can vouch for it and some classes force you to be a data scientist and read papers as well, and you can have &#34;real world&#34; recognition and discuss with your peers, which is useful!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work in ML - I might make 3 buckets for ML careers right now:1. ML/DL Researcher2. Data scientist - 20/80 engineering vs modelling3. ML Eng - 50/50 (or 70/30) engineering vs modellingPeople suggesting working in engineering to support ML are right that there&#39;s a lot of demand, but it&#39;s not what you&#39;re asking for.Becoming an ML/DL researcher working on novel techniques or new models will be hard without academic research experience. Few companies are big enough to support true research, and the ones that are have a very high bar even for people with PHDsWhat I call &#34;data scientists&#34; apply math/ML to real problems. The people I see here have a quantitative background like physics/math/CS. Often they have more general quantitative skills that go beyond ML. People like this will might work on things like fraud where an eng pipeline exists and small improvements in the model are valuable.There are more of these roles than &#34;true research&#34; and they exist at small companies because it&#39;s applied. You can get into this with demonstrated evidence in side projects + a convincing background, but professional education might be the most sure way.Finally - there&#39;s a lot of demand for engineers who can do both modeling and the requisite engineering. A model is a small part of what goes into a production ML feature - you need a data pipeline, automated retraining/prediction, a place to deploy the model, monitoring on eng stats + data stats, and the usual application backend/frontend to do something with the results.You might be able to get into this with some demonstrated experience in side projects assuming you&#39;re a SWE already, and depending on your standards for where you want to work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can I suggest a longer, but (I think) better route?Try the Data/ML Engineer route. Instead of going directly into ML, try to work as a “supporter” of those doing ML. There’s a HUGE gap there, specially if you’re a good programmer.There are a lot of people in the “pure” ML space, people with science background, with phDs, etc.But there’s not enough people to support them: taking their models to producing, building their pipelines, etc.If you get into Data/ML engineer, you’ll be working with these people and learning from them.It’s a longer route for sure, but I think it can yield the highest success rate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can provide some details regarding the times things did break that I mentioned in the article.* In September 2014, X broke, and I created an `/etc/X11/Xwrapper.config` file with the lines `allowed_users = anybody` and `needs_root_rights = yes` to get it to work again. I don&#39;t remember and don&#39;t have notes on why that helped. It sure does sound like a pretty terrible hack. I don&#39;t have that Xwrapper.config file anymore, and I also don&#39;t know when I deleted it.* In June 2017, audio stopped working, but all I had to do was add my user to the `audio` group.* In May 2018, X broke a second time. This time I downgraded the `xorg-server-common` and `xorg-server` packages. A few weeks later, I ran another system upgrade, and this one went fine.These weren&#39;t the only problems, but they were the most disruptive. Generally, things like TrackPoint driver updates changing how the cursor responds or Firefox changing its UI have been far more annoying than Arch Linux issues :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I always reinstall from scratch although I could just Debian &#34;dist upgrade&#34;.  My thinking is this: if, ten years ago, I somehow missed a security patch or some 0-day owned my machine before it was patched, then I&#39;d potentially have been copying / dd&#39;ing / rsync&#39;ing a rootkit for ten years.By installing from scratch at every new stable (or unstable) release, I get rid of a lot of potential security issues.Now as an anecdote: ten years with the same install is nice but...  I&#39;ve got a dedicated server at OVH with 3400 days of uptime.  You read that correctly.  Nearly ten years of uptime.  Once in a while I give temporary ssh access to people here and there just so they can type &#34;uptime&#34; and see.  Kids: don&#39;t try this at home.  Yes, it&#39;s insecure (although there&#39;s a firewall and only the SSH port open).  No, it doesn&#39;t do much nor is it very useful.  But it&#39;s fun to think I own one of the computer in the world with the biggest uptime.I plan to kill it once it reaches ten years \o/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I stuck with Ubuntu (eventually Kubuntu) for many years because I thought it was the best for a no-fuss distro for folks who wanted things to just work (TM). I was afraid of things randomly breaking and interrupting my daily work. One day I eventually bit the bullet and installed Arch instead. The experience has been phenomenal, and if anything it feels more stable than Ubuntu. I was underestimating my own Linux knowledge, and it really isn&#39;t difficult to setup/configure at all if you have a reasonable understanding of how Linux works. The initial installation can be done by just following one of the many YouTube videos that break down the process step by step - you may even learn something if you don&#39;t already know it. I can&#39;t ever see myself going back."</p>

While reducing cruise speed to 1.7 mach.
I see no visible changes to deal with the sonic booms problem.
So operation would be like Concorde I suppose, subsonic (or hi-subsonic) over land and
Supersonic over ocean only. Unless the super-rich manage the regulation to change.EDIT : ah yes :) &#34;2x FASTER OVER WATER&#34; and &#34;20% FASTER OVER LAND&#34;...Also : Maybe good to remember that 18 airlines had once placed orders for Concorde, with only the 2 national carriers flying it in service eventually.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Overture is being designed to carry 65 to 80 passengers at Mach 1.7 over water — or twice the speed of today’s fastest commercial aircraft — with a range of 4,250 nautical miles. Optimized for speed, safety and sustainability, Overture is also being designed to fly more than 600 routes around the world in as little as half the time. Flying from Miami to London in just under five hours and Los Angeles to Honolulu in three hours are among the many possibilities.Probably will be very expensive but it&#39;s exciting for future possibilities"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Strong FOMO settling in. Premium transatlantic routes routes like NYC-LHR are super important to the bottom line of the big legacy carriers. If one airline has supersonic and others don’t that could be a huge blow to the others.Of course things didn’t work out that way with Concorde, which was not commercially successful and more of a spectacle than something founded in business fundamentals. But if Boom can make supersonic passenger travel economics work out it would certainly be hugely disruptive."</p>

I had two questions after watching this:- Is Raft alone in this space, or are there other popular algorithms/libraries that fill the same space?- What happens when the node count gets larger than a handful? What happens when you hit hundreds or even thousands of nodes, that are trying to achieve consensus? In particular, the part where all of the nodes respond (semi) simultaneously to a broadcast node. In a radio spectrum world, that would be a disaster. N:1 communication slots are choke points for timely communication."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It sounds to me like you failed to renew your domain on time, and missed the grace period. Redemption grace period is not a fine, it’s a normal period of the lifecycle of a domain name during which they (the registry, via the registrar) give you a last chance to get your domain back. This is well documented and part of the conditions you accept and need to understand when you rent a domain.You said you had another payment mean, but they’re likely not allowed to use it without your approval. If you missed the email requests for approval, they couldn’t renew and you legitimately lost your domain.The annual contact accuracy check (WDRP) usually doesn’t result in deletion but suspension, so something sounds fishy here. Maybe it came at the same time as the renewal (which makes sense) but I’m pretty sure it’s not the direct reason for deletion of your domain.However the above is true only for gTLDs, not for ccTLDs. What’s the TLD of your domain?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This info gives us an interesting opportunity to estimate the rate at which Signal is adding new users. They&#39;ve been very tight-lipped (understandably) about their usage stats but anecdotally they seem to be an increasingly common presence on my friends&#39; phones, even the non-techies.As far as I can tell, Signal uses Twilio only to send SMS for phone number verification. Verification happens when a user registers a new number or changes the number on their existing account.The rate at which Signal is adding new users could be calculated by:1900 * (proportion of new registrants among SMS recipients) / (length of Twilio incident)You could probably make some common-sense assumptions about the first variable. But I can&#39;t find any publicly available info on when Twilio was first compromised. Their press release only mentions that they discovered the intrusion on August 4, which is presumably close to the end date of the incident. Does anyone know what the estimated start of the incident might be?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The attack Twilio suffered is almost identical to the recent attack against Cloudflare: https://blog.cloudflare.com/2022-07-sms-phishing-attacks/ (even down the wording of the text messages, which are nearly identical). Cloudflare’s use of security keys prevented the attackers getting access to any accounts in that case.These attacks are sophisticated and are capable of bypassing TOTP or mobile-app-based MFA. If this is widespread, I’d be surprised if we didn’t see a massive influx of breaches soon. The vast majority of companies are not well defended against this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Among the 1,900 phone numbers, the attacker explicitly searched for three numbers, and we’ve received a report from one of those three users that their account was re-registered.I wonder if this was a curious attacker trying to see what they could do with their access, or a targeted attack."</p>

A need that some would see is contradictory to the pure business goals.Doing business out in the open like Tailscale is doing is so refreshing. Having seen Brad Fitz communicate in other places, it is obvious he isn&#39;t doing the right thing for the user only because these conversations will be scrutinized in public. Tailscale has a lot of great technical people who actually are even better communicators.This is the lesson for me in this thread: remember to optimize hiring good communicators and not just good technical people. This conversation would have quickly gone south if it was purely about the technical or business reasons for doing it. After all, the root word of communication is commune: to connect. We often forget that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article, and some of the comments here, seem to confuse &#34;second-order&#34; with &#34;long-term&#34;.Long-term just means doing the same analysis far out into the future: &#34;If I spend less on maintaining software product $LEGACY, I will save money. If I continue to do this, I will save more and more money by each passing month.&#34;Second-order means discovering neighbouring causal links. &#34;If I spend less on maintaining software product $LEGACY, I will save money. I will however also have to prioritise which bugs I fix. This will lead to some bugs that would be fixed today not getting fixed. That might mean that some users of $LEGACY move to a competitor. In turn, it costs more to acquire new customers than to retain old ones, so just maintaining the same customer count while dissatisfying customers until they quit will cost more money than by trying to make existing customers happy.&#34;Quitting $LEGACY customers will however lead to fewer bugs being discovered in $LEGACY, meaning the reduced maintenance budget might be sufficient again. However, quitting customers doesn&#39;t only force me to spend more to re-acquire similar number of customers – it might also be negative for marketing, so it becomes harder to acquire new customers, thus having a non-linear effect on the customer replacement costs.&#34;Decreased maintenance of $LEGACY might make some developers happier, but signal to others that we are not serious about the lifecycle of our product. This might result in them not putting in as much effort to make maintenance easier in future products, which will increase the maintenance demand in future products. Thus, insufficient maintenance efforts on $LEGACY may lead to increasing maintenance demand, which leads to insufficient maintenance efforts, which leads to increasing maintenance demand, and so on.&#34;As the last parts of that hint at, what&#39;s really important is not all the neighbouring causal links, but those that lead to nonlinearities and feedback cycles. By mucking about with things in a stable system, in particular when there are nonlinearities and feedback cycles involved, you can accidentally create an unstable system that wants to drive itself into the ground."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not sure if Bun has had an influence on this, these features must have been in development for a long time, but the timing surely is impeccable.npm compatibility is huge for Deno. It is basically the one major drawback to Deno, which gets hopefully fixed with this feature. It also looks like this compatibility layer is implemented transparently in the existing module management, which is a big bonus. Nobody wants to deal with node_modules anymore when working with Deno for an extended period, just love to see this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m actually a little disappointed by NPM compatibility. Or at least conflicted. Deno has felt like an opportunity to reboot the server-side JS ecosystem into something far more sensible than it currently is. Not that anyone is to blame for what it is, really, but you learn lessons and move forward. Sometimes making breaking changes.This seems like an acceptance that moving on simply won&#39;t happen. The existing ecosystem is too big and too powerful to be ignored. If I were a particularly cynical person I&#39;d also point to Deno taking on millions in VC funding - once you&#39;ve done that you can&#39;t be content to create a perfect, gleaming sandbox. You have to bring in money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a non-user of Deno, I’m curious, how do people tend to manage dependency version centralisation in Deno? I suppose this will apply to existing Deno as well as npm imports. I can just see you ending up having to change “import express from &#34;npm:express@5&#34;;” from 5 to 6 in lots of places when the next major version comes out.When contemplating how I might do it, I came up with centralised reexport, a file deps.ts containing:  export express from &#34;npm:express@5&#34;;

This would basically stand in for the dependencies object in package.json.So then I looked up the docs and found https://deno.land/manual/linking_to_external_code#it-seems-u... and was amused to find the same solution, even down to the file name “deps.ts”!Is this how people tend to work with Deno?I see it also supports import maps, https://deno.land/manual/linking_to_external_code/import_map..., which could readily solve the problem too. Do people use that?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Many moons ago, one of the things I did was to port the Windows version of Google Earth to both Mac and Linux. I did the mac first, which was onerous, because of all the work involved in abstracting away system specific API&#39;s, but once that was done, I thought Linux would be a lesser task, and we hired a great linux guy to help with that.Turns out, while getting it running on linux was totally doable, getting it distributed was a completely different story. Due to IP reasons, this can&#39;t ship as code, so we need to ship binaries. How do you do that? Do you maintain a few separate versions for a few popular distributions? Do you target the Linux Standard Base? The first approach is a lot of work, and suffers from breakages from time to time, and you alienate users not on your list of supported distros. The second version, using LSB, was worse, as they specify ancient libraries and things like OpenGL aren&#39;t handled properly.End result; management canned the Linux version because too much ongoing support work was required, and no matter what you did, you got hate mail from Gentoo users."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Agree. Had a few games on Steam crap out with the native version, forced it to use proton with the Windows version, everything  worked flawlessly. Developers natively porting to linux seem to be wasting their time.Funnily enough with wine we kinda recreated the model of modern windows, where Win32 is a personality on top of the NTAPI which then interfaces with the kernel. Wine sits between the application and the zoo of libraries including libc that change all the time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Coincidentally, Win32 is also the only stable API on Windows.WinForms and WPF are still half-broken on .NET 5+, WinRT is out, basically any other desktop development framework since the Win32 era that is older than a couple of years is deprecated. Microsoft is famous for introducing new frameworks and deprecating them a few years later. Win32 is the only exception I can think of."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel there is some slight mis-information in this article that might confuse people and give them the wrong impression of &#39;Local SSDs&#39; vs the network based ones and about the nvme protocol and made it seem like &#34;local ssd == nvme&#34;.NVMe - &#39;non-volatile memory express&#39;. This is a _protocol_ that storage devices like SSDs can use to communicate with the external world. It is orthogonal to whether the disk is attached to your motherboard via pcie, or it lives somewhere else in the datacenter and uses a different transport layer. For example, local NVME SSDs will use PCIe transport. But you can also have NVME-over-TCPIP, or NVME-over-fiber-channel. Or NVME-over-Fabrics. Many of these are able to provide significantly lower latencies than a millisecond.As a concrete example, AWS `io2-express` has latencies of ~0.25-0.5ms, though i&#39;m not sure which technology it&#39;s using.nvme over fabrics: https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/NVMe-ove...
many interesting presentations on the official nvme website: https://nvmexpress.org/education/documents-and-videos/presen...
aws: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/achieve-higher-database..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of mirroring an SSD array to a HDD! I believe this is what some college kids get their hands on, since many motherboards come with 2 NVMEs. NVME RAID0 is too dangerous and RAID 1 is too expensive, but, by pouring few hundred more bucks, one can gain a marginal safety while enjoying the blazing fast RAID0.The magic here is `--write-behind`/`--write-mostly`[1] in `mdadm`. I mean, that&#39;s the only method that I can think of here. This is an old dark magic that prevents (though not entirely) reading from a specific drive.[1]: https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Write-mostlyTBH, in general, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good option for databases. The slow drive does cause issues, for it is literally slow. The whole setup slows down when the write queue is full, reading from the write-mostly device can get be extremely slow thanks to all the pending writes, and the slow drive will wear out quicker thanks to the sustained high load (though this one should not apply in this specific case).So you mostly don&#39;t want to use a single HDD as your mirror. For proper mirroring, you need another array of HDDs, which will end up being a NAS with its own redundancy. That&#39;s a large critical pain in the butt, but this is necessary for industrial grade reliability, and also allows making your &#34;slow drive&#34; faster in the future.In this specific case, it&#39;s pretty well played. They get 4 billion messages per day, which is roughly 46k per second. Assuming each write requires updating at least one block - 4kb - the setup needs to sustain at least 185 MB/s, which is clearly beyond a single HDD. Google Persistent Disk is a kind of NAS anyway, so that perfectly aligns with the paragraph above."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me, this sounds like a GCP failure. The provider is supposed to provide you with options that you need. If you&#39;re going to build it yourself why bother with GCP?It would be a fun exercise to reimplement Discord in AWS...or with FoundationDB.In any case before revving the hardware I&#39;d want to know how ScyllaDB actually is supposed to perform. I mean, their marketing drivel says this right on the main page: &#34;Provides near-millisecond average latency and predictably low-single-digit P99 response times.&#34;So why are they fucking with disks if ScyllaDB is so good? I mean, back in the day optimizing drive performance was like step 1. Inside tracks are faster, and make sure you don&#39;t saturate your SAS drives/Fiber Channel links by mistake. It&#39;s fun to do, but you could always get better performance by getting the software to not do dumb stuff. Seriously."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Is the fear of &#34;people selling your email to spammers&#34; a modern myth, or are spam filters that good?Email databases for sale are not always for spam or malware.  They are often used for tracking and cross marketing calculations.  Placing a companies name in the address will signal a canary and they may likely filter your contact out of their database or at least flag it and treat it differently.I&#39;ve been using email canaries for decades but recently had to adjust my canaries to be less obvious.  A few vendors got upset that I had their name in the address and one even accused me of fraud and canceled my $500 gift card.  That was the Tractor Supply Company.Either way I will continue using canaries and multiple domains as it is a good way to be filtered out of some cross marketing databases and to avoid some behavioral tracking and some machine learning.  It is also useful to find companies that get upset.  This is an indicator to me they lack integrity and should be avoided.  Canaries are also a good indicator to detect if a company has been compromised."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m glad you had a good experience.  I had a different one.I&#39;ve ran my own domain for longer than you have, and many emails have been compromised.Some are 100% from companies selling the emails to sister companies.The majority, though, is from a company itself being compromised by hackers / database access / etc.  LinkedIn, Neopets, ProFlowers, TeeSpring, etc.  I can go on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let&#39;s consider a few things:1) Just because it hasn&#39;t happened to you, that doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t happen. I have quite a few examples of companies selling or otherwise sharing, whether intentionally or through compromise, my email addresses.2) If someone (some company) is going to sell email addresses, it&#39;s not unreasonable to imagine that they&#39;d want to remove any addresses that would directly link those addresses to their source, so a quick search to remove any address with the word &#34;adobe&#34; in it when selling Adobe mailing lists would not be unexpected in the least.Years ago I set out to learn more about the &#34;missing sock&#34; problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_sock). I bought a dozen pair of brand new socks and I ironed on labels identifying each and every sock. Guess what? The labeled socks never went missing. The act of labeling the socks dramatically affected the experiment.Perhaps using companies&#39; names in our email addresses is affecting our results."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the notes: &#34;These marginal design choices are not the only way to get an efficient unit, since the fridge compressors from the 1940&#39;s and 1950&#39;s era were very efficient, while having consistently longer lives. This failed unit is purely an example of doing just enough to get by until it is someone else&#39;s problem.&#34;I&#39;ve been seeing this as a common issue throughout most of the household appliances we&#39;ve tried to buy in the last ten years. They just don&#39;t last."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These studies never account for survivorship bias. There were plenty of crappy appliances decades ago, but they’ve all long since broken, so we only have the very best old appliances to compare against today.Also, the inflation adjusted cost of a fridge in the 50s was something like $10k. A $10k fridge today (e.g. Sub Zero) will easily last for many decades. A $1k Wal-Mart special will not."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Without numbers it&#39;s really hard to say how good or bad these engineering choices were in regards to the consumer to come out on top or not.In my experience appliances are a lot more efficient and cheaper than they used to be. My new stainless steel fridge has much more capacity while using the same amount of power than the 20yo one it replaced (Which didn&#39;t actually fail, but the white coating was rusting all over the place).My HE washer doesn&#39;t fill the entire tub compared to the old upright ones, so my water heater is used less, and spins at ~1,200rpm, greatly reducing dry times for my electric dryer. The recessed lighting in my house went from 90 watts per bulb to 12 watts for LED, and saves me $$ on cooling when needed. My tankless water heater heats up only the water being used, no more, no less.I&#39;m paying roughly 32¢/KW all-in (after taxes, fees etc.) for electricity in the Bay Area, so efficiency gains build up quickly over time.Anecdotally, the only issues I&#39;ve had so far have been with poorly engineered Samsung refrigerators, where the fans would seize due to ice buildup, not mechanical wear."</p>

To answer some of the questions in this thread:- No, Lebanon does not follow Islamic Banking.- No, people can&#39;t make wire transfers anymore. All bank accounts are frozen, you can&#39;t withdraw your own money. You have to beg and wait in line for weeks to be able to get a tiny amount of your account to be able to buy bread etc.- The local currency collapsed, lost more than 90% of its value. If the bank decides to give you some change (from your own money), they play money conversion tricks so that e.g. your account is down $1,000 but you get $100 only.- This person did not &#34;rob&#34; the bank. He tried asking the bank for money because  his father (and some people said his child as well) were in the hospital, needed medical care, and for that the hospital needed money. He had $210K in his account, but the bank kept kicking him away in previous attempts to appeal to them. He came back with a gun, and held hostages. Negotiated until they give back $35K, to his brother who was waiting outside. Then he surrendered without hurting anyone.- He is now in bad health because he&#39;s on a hunger strike after they arrested him. (In the negotiation they promised him not to arrest him, but of course they need to make an example out of him.)- Why is this all happening? Bad economic and financial policies for 40 years, rampant corruption. The economy was unproductive, but they kept the local currency subsidized, as it turns out by just spending the money that people deposited in the banks. And it&#39;s all gone now."</p>

To add all the truth @aboodman wrote, both teams were amongst the best I’ve worked with, but Chrome was much healthier, happier and more supportive. Senior industry folks helped."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I mean even at Google (on a different team) I was a &#34;technical lead&#34; in my 20s, and let me tell you, I had noooo business leading anything technical of any importance. But this is very common! We would never accept this in other fields. Would you live in a house built entirely by junior carpenters in their late 20s who built one or two houses that barely stood up? Would you drive cars designed and built by junior engineers?I find this kind of funny, because this is what happens right? I was under the assumption that architects typically design the building plans and do all the engineering, and a construction crew (which can consist of people mainly in their 20s) will build those plans under the supervision of the lead engineers/architects.So, in the same way that many senior software engineers don&#39;t write much code, don&#39;t architects/civil engineers typically refrain from using power tools to build the actual building? If this is the case, then software engineering is very akin to other engineering disciplines in this regard.I feel like the author of this tweet is conflating craftsmen with senior leads. A craftsmen is somebody I would expect to have been working with the medium for 10+ years, and continues honing their craft throughout the years. Whereas engineers and architects are typically more concerned with the abstract ideas and overall outcome. An engineer/architect can be a craftsman, but I don&#39;t believe they need to be synonymous."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The culture of “we are awesome” has dominated most internal communications for the last couple of years, including in 2022. We all believed that we were awesome and would continue growing and winning.This is the big thing that drives me nuts.I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a fragility of ego thing or what the cause may be, but it results in a corporate inability to critically self-evaluate at the highest levels.  If you can&#39;t say where your weak areas are, you&#39;re not improving.One of the experiences that untreated ADHD blessed me with was routinely failing classes.  That repeated exposure to undeniable failure (and the consequences of it) really helped me accept that failure is the default.  If you&#39;re not constantly fighting against failure, you&#39;re failing.  You can&#39;t pretend that something didn&#39;t work out, or stop thinking about it because it hurts.The self congratulatory back-patting (even if it&#39;s just &#34;everything is fine, we&#39;re doing great&#34;) is treating success like an achievement.  Success requires vigilance.  Excellence is not an achievement, it&#39;s an activity.We need more leaders that talk about the things we could be doing better, and doing so inspirationally, not derogatorily.  It&#39;s ok that you&#39;re not the best at something.  Very few are.  That doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t or shouldn&#39;t do better.Try internalizing that if you&#39;re not constantly struggling to do better, you&#39;re not living up to your potential."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, that sounds so poorly handled.  Not figuring out a way to tell everyone affected at (nearly) the same time is probably the worst sin.Best layoff I ever went through was when my boss came to our team and said, &#34;look, don&#39;t tell anyone, but we have a layoff coming in a few days.  I have to let one of the three of you go.  Do you want me to decide or do you want to decide amongst yourselves?&#34;.  She knew we were good friends outside of work and would probably make a better choice than her.I ended up volunteering because one other guy had just bought a house and had a baby and the other guy had debts to pay off and I didn&#39;t.  Ended up working with both those guys again.  One of them ended up leaving and getting a new job, then he pulled me in after 1.5 years of unemployment, and then we pulled the last guy in after he eventually got let go."</p>

Klarna would relocate folks to Stockholm who&#39;d then leave within 6 months to a year once they realised the shitshow they signed up for.This was in 2015. They didn&#39;t value people back then or care to treat folks with the tiniest amount of decency. Seems not much has changed."</p>

Do not use with fast changing content like videos.Have you noticed the degraded display in your Kobo? I imagine it&#39;s not uniform across all pixels, since editing would mostly be localized to your cursor area (though scrolling and other actions would be wider). I&#39;d also be interested in hearing what the timeline looked like for the quality drop, since it sounds like it&#39;s a function of the total number refreshes for each pixel."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the bar to whether something is an &#34;illegal data breach&#34; or not, should be whether the security is half-decent according to most security researchers. Because in cases like these (and the one where someone almost got arrested for clicking &#34;view source&#34;), the vast majority of security researchers will agree that the security was terrible and irresponsible.Even scraping public data could be a gray area e.g. if you&#39;re scraping a huge amount of possible addresses or de-aggregating on a massive scale. More importantly, you could say that you are doing this, e.g. claim that you found a &#34;secret&#34; 64-bit key by evaluating every possible one. But if your data is accessible via simple API requests, clearly there is limited &#34;guessing&#34; or brute-force going on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On the one hand, I do think that scraping should be legal, on the other hand, I maintain a lot of websites and scrapers are a gigantic pain in the ass that make hosting a popular site for normal people cost-prohibitive (you need to scale up servers or invest engineering time to prevent scraping).This can only lead to a more centralised web where only rich people can afford to host content.There needs to be a solution like some kind of internet metadata archive, distributed on IPFS or something where bots can get their data if they want."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Changing a security model that has been used for decades to a more restrictive model is difficult, especially in something as complicated as macOS. Attaching debuggers is just one example, there are many similar techniques that could be used to inject code into a different process. Apple has squashed many of these techniques, but many other ones are likely still undiscovered.&gt; Aside from Apple’s own code, these vulnerabilities could also occur in third-party software. It’s quite common to find a process injection vulnerability in a specific application, which means that the permissions (TCC permissions and entitlements) of that application are up for grabs for all other processes. Getting those fixed is a difficult process, because many third-party developers are not familiar with this new security model. Reporting these vulnerabilities often requires fully explaining this new model! Especially Electron applications are infamous for being easy to inject into, as it is possible to replace their JavaScript files without invalidating the code signature.It makes me sad that we are likely not going to see any new fundamental design rethink for security&#39;s sake in mainstream operating systems. It is cost prohibitive at this point to do something that gets security right for the world of 2022 and yet not break all the apps which would never be rewritten!Mobile OSes were a good break off point as far as security goes but that came with a lot of functionality sacrifice.Although something like QubesOS can theoretically dream of being semi-mainstream with support from hardware and OSS OS vendors like RH/Suse/Canonical or even Microsoft."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It is unclear what security the AES encryption here is meant to add, as the key is stored right next to it. There is no MAC, so no integrity check for the ciphertextI imagine this is to prevent accidental disclosure of sensitive data through basic tools (only) like grep, and Spotlight.Also to prevent layman attempts at tweaking the files in a text editor like one used to do tweaking save files as a kid. But not to protect against dedicated attackers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Surely there is a better fix to a deserialization exploit than just making every new app implement `bool dontBeHackable { return true; }`??Even just, I don&#39;t know, forcing all builds to silently include this property in the compiled output - I mean, interacting with  OS app state data files should be abstracted away from the programmer anyway, so it shouldn&#39;t matter if they&#39;re signed/encrypted behind the scenes, just handle it automatically, right?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve programmed for a long time. One of the best programmer&#39;s I&#39;ve known actually had his own debugger. He was an OS kernel developer and carried the debugger with him from job to job; we were working on the new operating system at IBM that would become AIX. He was a bit of a nuisance in the large development organization because he would wander around the kernel in his debugger fixing code before others had even noticed the defects.We were working on a distributed file system, and I had complained that we couldn&#39;t be expected to finish on the same deadline as the hardware device driver teams and the network stack teams. How would we even develop our software if we didn&#39;t have any working communication between machines? Well, my friend came to the rescue and wrote the kernel support for the NIC and a comm stack up to the level of UDP (having a debugger helped).Eventually, the managers of the other departments that wouldn&#39;t cut my team any slack on our schedule started coming around to ask us for help because they were falling behind schedule. They were responsible for the official development of the network device drivers and networking, and it turned out they didn&#39;t have a working kernel debugger like we had (thanks to my friends personal one), so they had fallen behind schedule while we were already making good time on our distributed file system running on top of the our own hacked together temporary device drivers and networking code. I had to lend the teammate and his debugger to the other two teams to help them with their schedules."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Such a joy to listen to Carmack talk about just about anything.Not sure if it&#39;s an age thing but there is a particular feeling common to contemporaries of that era, growing up in our formative years as computers grew from their humble beginnings to the incredible machines we have now. At that time, each new improvement brought astounding differences in capability. In the space of 10 years we went from 8k to 64k of memory, 4 colors to 256 colours to 16k colors to 16M colours. Resolution from 320x200 to 640x480 to 1024x768, which was close to photo-realistic (for the time, an amazing capability). I remember how revolutionary it was when I first got a computer that could render 80 columns of characters - rather than 40. Storage went from tapes to floppy drives storing a hundred kb of data to MB to hard drives storing GB of data. Every time one of these changes happened, a vista of opportunity opened up to explore and innovate and figure out what you could do with the new capabilities. Writing code in those times was all about deeply understanding the internal capabilities of the machine you had and how to get the most out of them.Something about that process forged a deep appreciation for the fundamentals of hardware and software that I don&#39;t know how anybody could get these days."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been trying to listen to the whole thing (it&#39;s 5 hours!), and there are some really interesting moments. Albeit, a bit too much talk on old video games that aren&#39;t from my generation, but I&#39;m sure this will be interesting to some people to.What I found interesting:* he has insane hours and has never burnt out. He says that if you want to achieve big things in your life, you need to work a lot. He also says that as long as he&#39;s working, and making progress (and he always makes progress when he keeps trying, reminds me of Linus), then he can withstand his hours and pressure.* he learns a lot through reading computer science books* he is really big on simplicity, seems to appreciate Golang and its design, and he&#39;s not into metaprogramming on C++. I really like that he&#39;s focused on building things that work, and can be maintained, and not that interested in theory and advanced concepts that don&#39;t seem to bring him much. He also says he spent some time on the functional side, and that probably made him a better programmer, but he&#39;s back doing C++.* he talks about the sort of hacking community he felt part of, where you just wrote code and shared it and reused other people&#39;s code. It really feels like open source is something else, made me feel bad about all these patents, and weird licenses (even Apache 2 or MIT) and academic people whining about credits. Wish we could just share and use whatever and be happy with it :(* Agree with him, VSCode is THE IDE. It&#39;s much better than emacs IMO (I&#39;ve tried using vim many times but couldn&#39;t).* 8-9 diet cokes a day. Holy fuck. That&#39;s a lot of caffein (and I&#39;m guessing not good for the teeth)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;But because of a subtlety of Unix systems (of which macOS is one), when an existing file is moved from another location to the root directory, it retains the same read-write permissions it previously had.&#34;And ownership. (The sentence before that suggests &#34;root directory&#34; here means &#34;directory owned by root&#34;.) The permissions on the directory apply only to the file&#39;s directory entry, not the file itself.This isn&#39;t a &#34;subtlety&#34;, it&#39;s how it works, and no-one who doesn&#39;t understand this should be writing macOS installers.The correct approach is to open the file for read and copy its bytes into your private area. Only then check the cryptographic signature. Just renaming into your private directory isn&#39;t enough, even if that directory has no read or execute access to other users, because the attacker could have opened the file for write access before you did the rename."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For years, I have refused to install zoom, webex etc clients for exactly this reason. Their installer wants admin user access for no apparent reason. They could have given a simple drag and drop installation app. Instead they want to run an installer with root user permissions to do whatever. Also, I hate apps that installs a helper background program, and doesn&#39;t let me disable it via preferences. I refuse to use those too.Besides, for what zoom does, why do they need an app? Browser has all the capabilities they need."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note that if SIP is enabled (the default), &#34;root access&#34; does not mean full compromise. On macOS, root is far from being as privileged as it was in the old days of UNIX yore. (Even on Linux it does not have to be, but my impression is that on most distributions it probably still is.)Just because you&#39;re root does not mean you get any entitlement you want, or arbitrary access to the whole filesystem, arbitrary memory access (a la /dev/(k)mem), or can replace the kernel just like that.(That&#39;s also probably why you don&#39;t hear of iPhones being &#34;rooted&#34;, but rather &#34;jailbroken&#34;. Just being root on an iPhone wouldn&#39;t do that much.)Make no mistake, this is still a privilege escalation attack and needs to be fixed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the things I remember being discussed on m.d.s.policy not so long ago was making a registry (maybe handled by IANA) for example private keys. Turns out Peter Gutmann did the heavy lifting (thank you Peter) to turn that from idle discussion into a draft document:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-gutmann-testkeys/From the point of view of m.d.s.policy the main idea is to require CAs to reject these keys in certificates for the Web PKI and encourage software to use these keys (rather than their own examples) in sample code. Basically when you build my-cool-website.example and copy paste the private key from an example into your certificate fetching code, the CA should say &#34;Er, no, you need to actually choose your own private key, that&#39;s what the word private means&#34; and this should happen when you copy-paste a high-rated Stack Overflow example, the provided sample code from the library you used etc. Ideally these would all be the same keys is the idea.It would also make sense for tools to care about these example keys e.g. GitHub could flag code that&#39;s checked in and has keys which are not these examples since maybe you used real keys by mistake in your GitHub repo, meanwhile your build-for-production CI tools could reject keys which are on the list because that means you forgot to pick actual keys for the real build."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Mac address part stood out to me, has something changed over the year that made changing Mac addresses more complex?Back in college our school had some limitations on the internal networks in our dorms. After doing my normal stuff (you know mega downloading,ftp, limewire etc) my net stopped working. Come to find out they had a bandwidth monitor and would just block you for some time if you used too much and had to contact tech support, even for simple things like window updates.Anyways, somehow I found out I could tweak some net configs in the registry. So here I randomly change some dword value to change my Mac address. I finally got back online and just forgot about it.A few days later I came back to my room after classes, my roommate told me the school officers raided the room trying to get on my PC. I went to the student dean&#39;s office and come to find out I took net access from I think the president and they tracked it to my PC ... Some luck I say lol .. Tech support said that there was no possible way I could change my Mac address after a bit back and forth I decided to just agree with him.O yeah and they had like a 200-300 page printout of irc chatlogs ,there was more stuff but I&#39;ll end it there.Needless to say my net access was blocked for a year even tho I had a work study job with the webdev department.
It didn&#39;t stop me though, I ended up running a long cat5 cable from the dorm next door. Fun times."</p>

For example, a Canadian guideline suggests an MAC of 200 ppt for PFOA, and 600 ppt for PFOS. These are the most common PFAS. Also, these are based on a lifetime exposure, and short term exposure to these amounts is probably not particularly harmful.Additionally, even in the US, the guidelines by the individual states vary between 13 to 1000 ppt.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Like another comment here mentioned, housing is complicated. People don&#39;t want to live in a random house in the middle of nowhere (&#39;roof over your head&#39;). Some people prefer to be homeless on the street versus getting to a roof over their head that they don&#39;t like.People want to live where they want to live (near family, jobs, culture etc)Take NYC for instance. Politicians try to address the NYC housing crisis from a demand/cost perspective. Rent is too high? Let&#39;s just screw the property owner and cap the rent. Or let&#39;s just raise minimum wage to make it easier for people to live in those properties.The result in both cases: you didn&#39;t have enough housing before, you don&#39;t have enough housing now. You give more money to people, rents will just go up. You cap the rent, there&#39;s still a huge number of people that can&#39;t live where they want and you make it impossible for existing tenants to move (or for new/more development to be built, for that matter)So, what instead? You want to build more housing in NYC? Great, that should work. But you have to make it cheap. Deregulate construction, get rid of unions, prioritize developer rights over tenant or homeowner rights. What? You don&#39;t think these are good things? Okay, but then you&#39;ll have to sit back and watch new construction trickle in and result in &#39;luxury&#39; housing because that&#39;s the only way a developer can recoup their enormous land acquisition, regulation and construction costs.
So the challenge with housing is that it requires fundamentally difficult decisions. To pretend that you can just spend 100 billion (or even a trillion) and the problem will be solved and people will be happy, is an illusion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I definitely do. It&#39;s something that turns a basic necessity into a speculative asset, with a price distorted by the money poured into it. Airbnb is also a deeply harmful influence on housing prices.Imagine if we did the same thing with, say, water: privatized it and then &#34;democratized&#34; ownership of it.It&#39;s easy to get retail investors to buy things at inflated, speculative prices, so the price of water would go up. People would say, &#34;Why are so many people dying due to lack of access to water?&#34; And we would blame these startups, laws would be passed, and we would fix it.Unfortunately the necessity of housing is not as direct and clear, and we have a long history of denying housing to people who are unlucky, sick, or the children of such people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a natural first impulse, but it&#39;s wrong. What is the correct impulse is to be concerned about how lopsided most cities zoning is towards single family, as that is what is driving the market power that makes real estate profitable as a financial asset. If most of a city was zoned to allow up to multi residential highrises rather than most of a city being zoned for single family it would cut the appreciation ability of the scarce and valuable land zoned for higher density already and would allow more people to live closer to where they want to live (i.e. close to work/wherever they daily commute).The market isn&#39;t failing to function because someone realized they could buy up current stock and make a large profit over time, people noticed they could make a large profit over time because city governments zoned everything wrong for the actual demand."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was fortunate enough to spend about 18 months as staff assistant to my CEO, including access to their email and basically all meetings. This was a PE-backed roll-up that was in the midst of acquiring several smaller companies, and then pursuing an exit.The experience really opened my eyes about the requirements for the job. The amount of code-switching required to communicate well with ownership, the other C-levels, employees, customers, and potential acquirers could make my head swim. The breadth and depth of technical, financial, and human expertise necessary to verify all the parts of the business and smell out where issues might be hiding. All of that before even getting to (in this case) integrating several businesses into a whole, identifying up-and-coming leaders, and keeping the employees happy; let alone actually having a strategy, getting buy-in, and implementing it. And then spending most evenings networking with the elite class that you need to know to have access to capital. You can never have a bad day. Ever.This was for an org that was comfortably under 1000 employees, all located in the US, where none of the VPs were the kind of political operators you get in meatier companies.I walked away thinking that there can&#39;t be even 100k people in the country with the ability to do even a non-laughable job as the CEO of a 500ish employee company. Not even do a good job, just do a job that doesn&#39;t look like one of those 80s child-parent-bodyswap movies where the kid tries to work in an office.I still think CEO pay is out of control, but I understand better why boards end up paying what they do. Any weakness in any of these skills is an existential threat, and you don&#39;t know for sure what will hit you this year."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The &#34;What it&#39;s like&#34; posts are really cool. Especially enjoyed this account[1] from a content writer who shadowed the CEO during a half-day meeting with a major investor and got to see the impact of their work in a context they never expected:&gt; Next we met with Vinod, Bruce, and investment partners Brian Byun and Sven Strohband for a company brief and brainstorm session. Sid began with an update on the financials, and detailed our massive growth and expansion both in terms of people and product. There were no slides presented. Instead, Sid used our website as a visual aid. Nearly every question or discussion point was first addressed with a Google search to pull up the appropriate GitLab web page to reference.[...]&gt; I’ve been working at GitLab for two and a half years as a content writer on our marketing team and at times have been extremely frustrated with our marketing website—the content on it, how it’s organized, what we’re presenting, etc. It doesn’t look or operate in a way I’m familiar with so my instinct was to not trust it. But nothing we do at GitLab is “normal,” and witnessing our CEO use the website as a single source of public truth to inform our investors is just one example of what it means to be a transparent company.[1] https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/04/08/khosla-ventures-git..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m constantly in awe of Gitlab&#39;s radical transparency approach. I have no idea if this is actually a good idea (surely every competitor of Gitlab has a huge amount of assymetrical information about Gitlab that Gitlab does not have in return) - but I am fascinated by it and truly grateful for them for daring to go out on a limb and do this experiment. My fingers are crossed that this brings them amazing success as I wish all companies worked this way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For consumers in some jurisdictions they may be able to get refunds on the product if it can be argued that this feature was a core reason the application was purchased.However once you are a business many of those protections aren’t present. There is an assumption that businesses should be able to sort things out amongst themselves and the court system. However an SME barely has any more power then a consumer going against a giant like Autodesk.I wonder if the solution wouldn’t be to extend those protections to smaller businesses, and additionally allow reclaiming the cost of any investments in the platform (Training, etc) and other expenses.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you have to debug at that level, and you&#39;re not designing hardware, things are really bad.Some years back, Wes Irish at Xerox PARC tracked down one of the great mysteries of early coax Ethernet - why was throughput so much lower than theory predicted? For this, he got both ends of a building-length coax with many machines on it connected to one office, so he could plug both ends into a storage scope. If the waveforms disagreed, somebody was transmitting when they shouldn&#39;t. Storage scopes with large storage were rare then. It was an expensive LeCroy unit.After the end of each Ethernet packet on coax, there is a brief &#34;quiet time&#34;, and then the next packet can be sent, beginning with a sync pattern. The hardware detects if what it is sending does not match what it is receiving, which indicates a collision. Both senders stop, wait a random time so they don&#39;t collide again, and retry. This is how &#34;carrier sense multiple access - collision detection&#34;, or CSMA-CD, works at the hardware level.This setup revealed that something on the cable was transmitting a single spike after the end of each packet, during the &#34;quiet time&#34;. That reset the &#34;quiet time&#34; timer in the network interface, which inhibited the transition to &#34;look for sync&#34; mode. So the next packet would be ignored. 
The quiet time timer was at a very low level - software did not see this event.What came out of looking at the waveforms was the surprising result that the                                                                                      spike during the quiet time was not coming from either the data source or the destination, but from something elsewhere on the cable. The spike was not synchronized to the packet just sent.
With the waveforms for both ends of the cable visible, speed of light lag revealed both that this was happening and where it was coming from, as distance along the cable.It turned out that several brands of network interface used a part which contained the quiet time timer, the sync recognizer, and the transmitter power controller. When the timer ran out, the device did a state machine transition, and during that transition, for a nanosecond or so, the transmitter turned on. It wasn&#39;t supposed to do that. This generated a spike on the cable, resetting every quiet time timer and causing the next packet to be silently ignored by all stations.The network interface didn&#39;t need to be active to do this. Being powered on was sufficient. One device with that part could halve the data rate on a coax Ethernet. Thousands of network interfaces had to be scrapped to fix this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know a little bit about Ethernet, having used it since the early 10Base-2 days as well as having done a bit of &#34;hacking&#34; in an effort to decode 1000Base-T.This article is focused on the QSGMII PHY chip, without which it would be practically impossible to use an oscilloscope for any meaningful troubleshooting.1000Base-T is the most commonly used Ethernet variant in use today.  It uses four balanced differential pairs for signalling.  Each pair transmits and receives simultaneously.  This works because 1000Base-T is a point-to-point connection and the PHY contains a hybrid that subtracts the voltage being transmitted from what is received.  This makes the problem of &#34;tapping&#34; the interface harder because the third party observer sees a jumble of data and cannot easily determine what data is coming from either of the two connected devices.  Each pair can send/receive five possible symbols, represented by voltages of +3.5, +2, 0, -2, -3.5 volts.  In addition, the PHY &#34;scrambles&#34; the data being sent with a LFSR (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register) seeded with either a &#34;master&#34; or &#34;slave&#34; value.  (The master/slave identity is negotiated between the two peers when they detect each other.)  It gets even more complex with hamming codes and an abstraction layer to separate the control/data planes.  There&#39;s also a complicated DSP for line equalization.BTW, I do own one of these: https://www.amazon.com/midBit-Technologies-LLC-SharkTapUSB-1... which can make the job very easy, but it was not an available option for my &#34;hacking&#34; application."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The scope&#39;s sample rate really jumped out to me:&gt;  I configured the oscilloscope to collect 100M samples at 1 TSPS (tera-sample per second, 10^12) ...Wow! Sampling at 1000 GHz? I wouldn&#39;t have thought that was possible! Does anyone know how the scope can even do that?"</p>

I wish I knew how to ask properly.The weirdest is that some ISP are blocking it and some are not. So why is that the case? Are some ISP not listening to the government?VLC and VideoLAN are quite apolitical (we only fight against DRM and for open source) and VLC is a pure tool that can read anything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Indian government (and Indian courts) is infamous for these random harebrained stunts.

(https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html). It mentions a debate between
J. Friedl and comp. sci. purists about whether NFAs and regular expressions should really be called what they are in the face of backreferences and other notation. Friedl suggests another name should be used, because de facto &#34;NFAs&#34;
are no longer equivalent to DFAs.Since Xerox Research Europe&#39;s invention of xfst, the term &#34;extended regular
expression&#34; is already taken for a specific superclass of expressions that
describe regular relations.So I propose two alternatives, semi-regular expressions and super-regular expressions, for strings that look like regular expressions but that use non-regular extensions like backreferences that push the complexity beyond what can be done with NDAs/DFAs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So fun story (to me in retrospect).I had an interview at google years ago where I basically I was asked to come up with this on my own.  In my opinion, a terrible interview Q (per Kernighan&#39;s blog, linked in original post, it took pike an hour or two alone in his office), and I bombed it.  It was either my just before or just after lunch interview and it stuck with me for the rest of the day and I couldn&#39;t give my entire focus to the rest of the sessions.anyways, after it was done, I found kernighan&#39;s blog post and decided I should try to implement this in java as it will allow me to even get some practice with things like junit and more experience with object oriented programming as I had been living in the C world at that time).  so I did, but I then found this regular expression page ( https://www.regular-expressions.info/) and learned many more things about &#34;regular expressions&#34; that i hadn&#39;t learned in school (because they aren&#39;t regular) and wondered if I could extend pike&#39;s simplicity to them in a relatively simple manner.  So I did.which I created this https://github.com/sjpotter/regex.Not meant to be &#34;performant&#34; but meant to be educational to me and perhaps others.Then when I was learning go, I rewrote it in Go.  I did things that are not &#34;normal&#34; go patterns (i.e. using panic and recover to make error handling cleaner (in my opinion, if an error path is simply if (err) { return err } all the way up, I personally think panics/recover at the top can be cleaner, but it seems most disagree), but it was educational on how to rewrite my java code to an object oriented style in Go and to explore the limitations of interfaces and how one might get around them (also perhaps in ways that go against what might be considered proper go programming)https://github.com/sjpotter/regex-gothough now that I look at that repo, wondering if all the work was done elsewhere and then I just pushed a single commit there, might need to go back and look at it"</p>

I thought they recorded it forward (tracking an actual object the whole time) and presented it in reverse, but it looks like they didn&#39;t actually follow a real object. They just chose a path and took the path in reverse, using the types of transportation that such an object might in theory have taken:&gt; They write that, “Four years later we found ourselves on the largest container ship in the world on our way from Sweden to China.” As per the trip: “We had started the journey by truck to Middle Sweden, then by freight train to the port of Gothenburg, and after four weeks at sea, we filmed from a truck again, this time from the port of Shenzhen to a factory in Bao’an.”The idea of following a single, real object from point of manufacture to destination--documenting all the transfers and hiccups along the way--is interesting to me. Presenting it in reverse chronological order is an artistic decision I&#39;m ambivalent about. But it doesn&#39;t sound like that&#39;s what they did. They didn&#39;t track a pedometer; they just took freight vehicles along a path that maybe the thing went on, without following the actual transfer of the item from box to container, from truck to ship, etc.I&#39;m disappointed.

There must be more. Perhaps he also deployed it? That would be a different story. The article is quite murky in that regard. Perhaps they don&#39;t know yet.In there is an interesting paragraph explaining what Tornado Cash is:… The (criminal) origin of the cryptocurrencies is often not or hardly checked by such mixing services. Users of a mixing service mostly do this to increase their anonymity.Note how they sneaked &#34;criminal&#34; in there. There are of course legitimate reasons to desire anonymity for financial transactions! It&#39;s one of the reasons people like to pay cash.Satoshi Nakamoto is wise to remain anonymous."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of the apologists for this are making arguments along the lines of &#34;being decentralized doesn&#39;t make you exempt from the rules&#34; or &#34;imagine if a bank laundered this much money&#34;.The problem is it doesn&#39;t make sense to treat protocols like companies. And it definitely doesn&#39;t make sense to treat protocol devs as if they were the executives of those companies. The CEO of a bank and the lead dev of a protocol have very very different powers and responsibilities, and we can&#39;t just throw our hands up in the air and say &#34;the law&#39;s the law, and you gotta follow it&#34; (even when it&#39;s literally impossible given the decentralized and autonomous nature of the protocol).Analogously when joint-stock corporations first entered the scene it required the development of whole new branches of Western law. That law had to be tailored to reflect the realities and nature of joint-stock corporations. What would have been very dumb is simply to pretend like nothing changed and say &#34;same rules apply&#34; and make individual shareholders liable for the action of the corporate entity the same way we&#39;re trying to make software devs liable for the action of the decentralized protocol."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My comment from 2 days ago:&gt; The US sanctioning Tornado Cash and the resulting repercussions is deeply concerning. Whether or not you like crypto, you should not be supporting this if you are a researcher, academic, technologist, cryptographer, or privacy advocate. The code for Tornado Cash is a series of cryptographic and mathematical functions that can be repurposed for a variety of applications unrelated to privatizing user wallets. The protocol itself is designed for one reason: to give users privacy through end to end and zero knowledge cryptography.&gt; Allowing it to remain open source and accessible as a tool for blockchain privacy and codebase for cryptographic research is a net benefit for the entire world.&gt; A comparison would be that US decides to sanction the open Matrix protocol along with any user, developer, source host, or sponsor that has ever contributed to it in the past - because it can facilitate end-to-end encrypted terrorist communication.Discussion:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32404966"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Story time - My dad asked the local school which had a goat if he can borrow it for a weekend. It was to tame his backyard. As the backyard was enclosed with no chance of the goat escaping, we left it by itself. The goat was be extremely hungry and ate everything insight including the roots, leaves and bark. By Monday, the backyard is barren and took months recover.Moral of the story - keep an eye on the goat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My sister has a small farm and in addition to cows and horses she also has rabbits. Every spring, parents show up to buy a rabbit to have at home. When the deal is done my sister takes the parents aside and tell them that if they plan or feel by the end of the summer that they want to let the rabbit loose, they can return it for free.What she does not tell is that our brother-in-law is a chef and happily makes rabbit stew of the returned rabbits. If there was ever a win-win situation, this is it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another story from a fellow hacker with a backyard goat - It actually starts in a very subtle way. Goats have different tastes and moods, and it&#39;s not like they eat everything right away unless the density of a goat per backyard m2 is too high. I started giving mine some free &#34;roaming&#34; time with the chickens every day before the sunset. It looked very innocent - first few days she ate just some weeds, nettle and some low hanging branches of pear trees. No worries, I was planning to cut those anyways. After few weeks of not paying that much attention in the evenings, bottom third of all our ~12 trees were gone, she got into salads, potatoes, zucchini, pumpkins, peppers and cucumbers, all nettle was done, and she started checking out tomatoes (which seemed that she is really really not into at first). I am building a new goat house with it&#39;s own separate &#34;backyard&#34; with weeds that she won&#39;t be able to escape. :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The study didn’t actually find anything related to cookware. Modern Teflon in the US doesn’t expose people to PFOA/PFOS like old version did due to new regulations. The chemicals could also be entering peoples body’s through drinking water or bioaccumulation in meat or plants.You should throw away nonstick cookware from before 2013, but new nonstick cookware sold in the US does not have PFOA. I believe the EU followed suite recently.Edit: After doing more research based on many comments here, I realized I was wrong. The brand Teflon replaced PFOA with GenX, a different fluorosurfactant that&#39;s probably worse than PFOA. From what I can tell, fluorosurfactants are more or less required to make PTFE and it seems quite likely that all fluorosurfactants are toxic. Personally I choose to use Teflon for eggs and stainless or cast iron for everything else. That feels like a decent trade off to me comparing years of life lost from liver cancer to time spent scraping scrambled eggs off of pans.I want to add that a lot of cool startups are working on PFAS remediation. One I know of is Cyclopure, they make a Brita filter replacement that filters out PFAS (it&#39;s very expensive at the moment, though). Probably worth it if you live near a chemical plant, airport, or US military facility (airports and military bases both use PFAS fire-extinguishing foams which they typically fail to contain)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They&#39;re finding PFAS in everything now.https://www.consumerreports.org/bottled-water/pfas-in-bottle...https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7gban/rainwater-everywhere-...https://www.dcourier.com/news/2022/aug/11/prescott-valley-sh..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There isn&#39;t a human alive today whose blood is free from PFOA and/or PFOS. The question to answer is what are the major routes by which this is happening.There is a lot of discussion in this thread about cookware. The problem is that these chemicals are now found throughout the environment and used in countless products. The stuff is found increasingly in drinking water and foods. Maybe cookware is a major contributor, but the truth is nobody knows yet.Nor does this effect appear limited to liver cancer. The paper notes:&gt; Studies examining associations of PFAS exposure with risk of other cancers, such as kidney cancer, in the general population have found similar associations to those reported here. For example, in the only existing nested case-control study examining the prospective association between PFAS levels and risk of renal cell carcinoma, PFOS levels &gt;50 μg/L were associated with more than two-fold increased risk of developing renal cell carcinoma (OR=2.51; 95% CI: 1.28-4.92), and similar associations were reported for PFOA and PFHxS [[52]]. These findings are notable due to the similarity in PFOS concentrations associated with risk of HCC in our study. ...https://www.jhep-reports.eu/article/S2589-5559(22)00122-7/fu...For its part, the paper never mentions the word &#34;cookware&#34; and is instead focused on the link between blood concentrations and cancer.Edit: Wikipedia has the following paragraph on the topic of cookware:&gt; Despite DuPont&#39;s asserting that &#34;cookware coated with DuPont Teflon non-stick coatings does not contain PFOA&#34;,[91] residual PFOA was also detected in finished PTFE products including PTFE cookware (4–75 parts per billion).[87] However, PFOA levels ranged from undetectable (&lt;1.5) to 4.3 parts per billion in a more recent study.[48] Also, non-stick cookware is heated—which should volatilize PFOA; PTFE products that are not heated, such as PTFE sealant tape, had higher (1800 parts per billion) levels detected.[92] Overall, PTFE cookware is considered an insignificant exposure pathway to PFOA.[93][94]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfluorooctanoic_acid"</p>

And knowing you don&#39;t have to adjust the range of the named area as long as the table is the correct length. Far nicer than SUM(F:F) or SUM(F2:F1000) which can cause performance issues and could be exceeded when pulling in new data respectively.Within the table, you can do this syntax to use items on the same row of data.    =[@[Price]*[@[Tax Rate]]"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know which is more tiresome, 3-4 hours of focused programming and thinking, or 8 hours attending two children below 5.They are both tiring, but differently. Intensive programming is like working hard at the gym. Tiring, but content. Attending children is low intensity in attention, but constantly vigilant. And you are expected to pay that kind of attention for another maybe 4 years. Very different kind of tiring indeed, both makes you unable to focus afterwards.  So while thinking hard makes us tired, not thinking hard can also makes us tired."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe it&#39;s just me, but I find meetings to be way more mentally fatiguing than, say, coding. Even if I&#39;m just listening in.A 1.5hr meeting cooks me. After a showcase, which can go for 2 hours, I&#39;m done for the day.However what works for me isn&#39;t having a rest, or flicking through YT for some quick mental rewards. A good walk, or doing some gardening, mowing the lawns - basically anything physical - helps me regenerate. Especially being outside.That&#39;s been a big benefit of working from home. Yesterday at lunchtime I just went out back with a skillsaw and cut a whole bunch of wood for an hour (not random cutting, I need it for a project haha). Came back in feeling great!"</p>

Their website lets you search for routes, and in the route options you can go for the fastest route, or choose this option: &#34;Routes with the least changes&#34;.  Every year on the same date, I would contact them and ask them to change that to &#34;Routes with the fewest changes&#34; and they would respond with something to the effect of &#34;thanks for the feedback, passed it on, go away now&#34;.I think I did this for over 10 years until one day it did get changed on their site.

They said, and I quote, &#34;due to RBI regulations, we can&#39;t&#34;. Naturally, I asked &#34;which regulation document? do you have a number?&#34;. The other person did not have an answer and escalated my call. They said they would get back to me and in the meantime, I read all the regulations there were. The regulations clearly stated that issuers shall give an option to close the account at any time. There was no such option in the app.I pressed again to close the account to prevent misuse and/or fraud. The person on the other end of the call asked me (beratingly) to logout and delete the app. Because it was the same as deleting the account. I argued that it is not the same thing. To which his tone was more or less like, [my words, this is how it sounded] &#34;you blithering idiot, you blasphemous imbecile, do you know how miniscule you are in the grand scheme of things.

That makes me think, huh, I wonder if I&#39;m not a &#34;natural born engineer&#34;. I start going through my life story so far and beating myself up for playing too many video games, or not going deep enough on my interests.Then I start thinking about the ways my life is different from his. I start to feel resentment about the opportunities I didn&#39;t have, the resources that weren&#39;t available. What could I have done if things had been different?Next I start to resent how society scores us on things that can contribute to the economy, or things that look particularly cool, and things that we accomplished at a young age.And then I start to imagine the difficulties that this young inventor will have. &#34;Oh yes&#34;, I think, &#34;He&#39;ll find out soon enough what the REAL world is like.&#34;And these thoughts are not who I want to be. But I can reflect and learn something about myself from them. And I can choose to go another way.I can decide that, if a 17 year old kid with the right resources and a crazy idea can make something really cool, then I, as an adult with more experience and resources can make something at least as cool if I want to. And I&#39;m going to. It&#39;s not like my life is over because I&#39;m older than 17.And if this article is making you spiral with insecurity, I hope you make a similar decision. A decision to be inspired instead of intimidated."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few years ago we played this for a few weeks at the office over Christmas break when things were otherwise slow.  We had maybe a dozen players, and played in Survival mode which I believe is infinite with difficulty ramping up.We split into four teams, with one providing power, one providing ammo, one building defenses, and the rest just running around trying to help out where we needed it the most.There was a ton of potential.  I had to keep adjusting the difficulty as the match went on to keep us alive and then to finish us off when we were running out of time.I&#39;d love a multiplayer coop game like this but with the potential to have fifty or a hundred players.  Right now the office plays CS:GO once a week, with the settings changed to allow max players, but it still caps at thirty.  CS:GO is hard for new employees to get in to so I&#39;d love something where everyone has fun.  We also did TF2 for a while, which was better because the newbies could be medics and still feel like they were contributing, but the hard-core player base loved the challenge of CS:GO."</p>

It&#39;s very satisfying to lay something down fast. A stumble there is that the keyboard combinations are chorded but not overlap-free. So you hit like 1-3 for one thing and 3-1 for another, which means if you change your mind you can&#39;t abort a chord by starting another. Quite frustrating in the moment.Another &#34;so close to greatness&#34; problem is that the campaign doesn&#39;t allow you to trust your friends to run separate parts of the planet. You all have to be on the same map at the same time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It looks like Twitter is using SFSafariViewController for their in-app browser. This is the system-recommended way of creating an in-app browser. It prevents the embedding app (Twitter in this case) from reading website data and injecting JavaScript into the view. You can also break out of the session into Safari pretty trivially by hitting the Safari button in the lower right corner.Apps that implement a custom web browser using WKWebView (e.g. IG) are much worse and can do those nefarious things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really like the simplicity of this proposal, and how Adrian compares it to X-Frame-Options: DENY which has been in place for a decade now and has solved the problem of clickjacking and unauthorized framing for regular websites.My hunch is that having X-Frame-Options: DENY start applying to native mobile apps wouldn&#39;t be feasible because it would break too much existing stuff that didn&#39;t intend to opt-out of native embedding, but having different syntax (X-Frame-App-Options: DENY for example) would solve this need very effectively.It&#39;s interesting to note that Google have already taken steps in this direction: Google sign-in now detects if it is running in an in-app embedded browser and shows you an error telling you to use the native browser instead: https://developers.googleblog.com/2021/06/upcoming-security-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I used to work in mobile advertising, advertisers and tech vendors were always so desperate for this, because it would let them track users across apps and not just websites, so I’m not super sold on enabling it by default.&gt; Seem familiar? This is framing, merely in app form. But this time, the framed website has no way to framebust.Click the safari button. It opens it in your normal browser. Better behaved apps (shout out to Apollo) will let you set a config that sends off links to safari directly.
The only apps I know of that don’t have this button are Facebook messenger and TikTok, to nobodies surprise, 2 reasonably badly behaved apps. I think Instagram still does as well, but that’s not a surprise.
You can still escape the app context via the sharing menu though, although that is somewhat more involved."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think a few more concrete use cases would help.First, a key limitation that every architect should pay attention.  Redis reaches the limits of what you can do in well-written single-threaded C.  One of those limits is that you really, really, *really* don&#39;t want to go outside of RAM.  Think about what is stored, and be sure not to waste space.  (It is surprisingly easy to leak memory.)Second, another use case.  Replication in Redis is cheap.  If your data is small and latency is a concern (eg happened to me with an adserver), then you can locate read-only Redis replicas everywhere.  The speed of querying off of your local machine is not to be underestimated.And third, it is worth spending time mastering Redis data structures.  For example suppose you have a dynamic leaderboard for an active game.  A Redis sorted set will happily let you instantly display any page of that leaderboard, live, with 10 million players and tens of thousands of updates per second.  There are a lot of features like that which will be just perfect for the right scenario."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;  it was difficult to find images where the entire llama fit within the frameI had the same trouble. In my experiment I wanted to generate a Porco Rosso style seaplane. illustration. Sadly none of the generated pictured had the whole of the airplane in them. The wingtips or the tail always got left off.I found this method to be a reliable workaround: I have downloaded the image I liked the most. Used an image editing software to extend the image in the direction I wanted it to be extended and filled the new area with a solid colour. Cropped a 1024x1024 size rectangle such that it had about 40% generated image, and 60% solid colour. Uploaded the new image and asked DALL-E to infill the solid area while leaving the previously generated area unchanged. Selected from the generated extensions the one I liked the best, downloaded it and merged it with the rest of the picture. Repeated the process as required.You need a generous amount of overlap so the network can figure out which parts is already there and how best to fit the rest. It&#39;s a good idea to look at the image segment you need to be infilled. If you as a human can&#39;t figure out what it is you are seeing, then the machine won&#39;t be able to figure it out either. It will generate something, but it will look out of context once merged.The other trick I found: I wanted to make my picture a canvas print, and thus I needed a higher resolution image. Higher even then what I can reasonably hope with the above extension trick. What I did is that I have upscaled the image (used bigjpg.com, but there might be better solutions out there.) After that I had a big image, but of course there weren&#39;t many small scale details now on it. So I have sliced it up to 1024x1024 rectangles, uploaded the rectangles to DALL-E and asked it to keep the borders intact but redraw the interior of them. This second trick worked particularly well on an area of the picture which shown a city under the airplane. It has added nice small details like windows and doors and roofs with texture without disturbing the overall composition.What I did:"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; [TikTok]&#39;s addiction-based advertising machine is probably close to the theoretical maximum of how many advertisements one can pour down somebody’s throat.Well put. It&#39;s interesting that we pivoted in my adult lifetime from:1. Myspace&#39;s emphasis on sharing things on your own webpage, essentially a hosted blog
2. Facebook&#39;s evolution from &#34;hosted blog&#34; to &#34;friend update aggregator&#34; to &#34;chat client&#34; to &#34;friend update &amp; ad aggregator&#34;
3. Instagram&#39;s callback to simple update sharing (with pictures) and a chronological ad-free news feed
4. Snap&#39;s emphemeral sharing
5. Facebook&#39;s slow agglomeration and bastardization of all of the features that made Instagram and Snap distinct.
6. TikTok&#39;s addictive advertising machine that barely includes any friend connections at all.Initially I was concerned that this would mean the death of real social media, just like the article initially suggests. But I really like the conclusion the article ultimately comes to: we basically don&#39;t have social media right now, we have advertising engines masquerading as social media. Better that Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat show their true colors and become disgusting advertising machines just like TikTok.If we&#39;re lucky, that means a federated, open, mostly-ad-and-suggestion-free open source social media experience can fill the power vacuum for intimate, interpersonal, high-latency communication over the internet. microblog seems promising, but I think even mastodon could provide the experience I&#39;m looking for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the &#34;social&#34; part of social networks just moved to group chats. All my friends share updates of their family events, kids&#39; stuff etc.. over Whatsapp and Telegram. Strangers gather over topics that interest them and want to talk about it seem to have moved to discord, slack etc.The whole &#34;broadcast yourself to the world&#34; part of social networks just moved to Tiktok, Twitter, Instagram etc.. I think."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"TikTok is winning because it is video first. The more immersive the media, the more profitable the ads. Facebook is having trouble pivoting it&#39;s products to video. Facebook is betting big that the next more-immersive medium after video will be VR. That&#39;s basically the whole story.Notice I didn&#39;t use the word &#34;algorithm&#34; or &#34;social&#34;? These takes are tired and naive, TikTok isn&#39;t addictive in any operationally useful sense of the word, people just like it and use it. You may as well write a blog post saying &#34;TV is addictive and it&#39;s dying because of commercials&#34;. It&#39;s just not an accurate conceptualization if the landscape."</p>

AZW?) under the hood.* Several sites mention AZW3 as the official Kindle format. Is that the same as MOBI?* It is unclear whether ePub and/or MOBI are natively supported by Kindle.If I connect my Kindle and (1) drag an ePub to its local storage and (2) drag a MOBI to its local storage, will either of them work or not?"</p>

And the legacy providers are clearly sitting on their monopoly position in a way that makes their pathetic alternative so starkly unattractive.But isn&#39;t it also true that once his network grows above a certain customer base (and gets into the maintenance phase), he will start to see all the effects that eat into being able to do this cheaply?Namely:-- customers who don&#39;t behave as well or kindly as before-- customers who need 24 hour customer service-- maintenance that can&#39;t be done himself, and he has to employ people-- customers and vendors who sue you for breach of contract, or other simply nuisance lawsuits-- upgrading the network to the next technology requirement, or when he&#39;s unable to get 2nd-hand parts so cheaply, etc.-- or a natural disaster that unexpectedly forces replacement of (and charging for) equipment that wasn&#39;t anticipated in the original subscriber priceMaybe none of this rises to the level of making it fundamentally different or unsustainable?  But it seems to me the honeymoon phase doesn&#39;t last long, and it&#39;s got to hit some unavoidable realities soon.   At least, if you think you can replicate this, it requires finding people and neighbors who are willing to do actual work and investment/concern to make something like this possible, and not simply pay a vendor a premium to phone it in.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was super confused by this since to the best of my knowledge SFSafariViewController blocks anything like this, you, as a developer, cannot inject anything or peak into the view it creates. Then I got to the bottom and realized I was correct, but FB/Meta/IG/etc aren&#39;t using SFSafariViewController and instead using the older ways to embed a web view.Honestly I thought all other methods had been deprecated and had no idea apps could still make use of the less secure (for the user) options. Trust me, as a developer I&#39;ve wanted to reach inside a SFSafariViewController many times to make my life easier but in the end I&#39;ve just grumbled and assumed it&#39;s not possible and worked around it.I wish there was a privacy-safe way to get the best of both worlds but due to bad actors I doubt that will be possible. I need to look more into App-bound domains but I don&#39;t think even that will give me what I really wish for (a way for the page loaded in SFSafariViewController to tell my app something). Something like postMessage support for SFSafariViewController would be amazing and be safe privacy-wise I think since the contained page would need to support sending/receiving messages instead of just having code injected against their will."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Only Instagram? Every app maker who makes an in app browser can see what you do, that’s the point of embedding it. And why not?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a consultant, I come around a bit.I have seen many companies with very poor productivity, and in zero of those cases was it laziness of the employees. In fact they usually would have loved to be more productive. Nobody wants to spend their life being dead weight.But as companies grow they install more and more rules and regulations that end up making sure nothing ever gets done. It is not unusual to meet &#34;developers&#34; whose company calendar is 80% filled with meetings. Well no wonder they don&#39;t get anything done!Also remember that this is only half the problem. The other half is that agile makes you iterate through pseudo productivity before you actually understood the problem, accumulating cruft that you need to maintain and extend as you go on. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if of the productivity that is left, more than half gets wasted on crufty software structures and writing code before you understood the problem.And then nobody wants to throw code away that turned out to be not what we need. Wasting yet more productivity on working around bad decisions from before we knew what we are actually building."</p>

However, any time there was an emergency related to my function, I had everything required to jump in, fix serious problems, and then get out of the way during the cleanup then contributing my bit to the postmortem.  
I could tell there were very few (fewer all the time) people who truly understand google prod, and in that sense, the company seems to be OK with paying top salaries to people who can prevent the company losing lots of money, or other critical prod issues."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m looking at https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/ and I still can&#39;t tell what&#39;s interesting and unique about this as compared to other options in this space.I acknowledge that this might be a PEBKAC situation, but I&#39;d love to hear thoughts from people who used Next.js, Remix, or whatever and found Astro to be a revelation.It seems like Astro&#39;s creators believe &#34;content-focused&#34; is a differentiator, but I find that confusing since content-focused sites are a popular use case for web frameworks that are also suitable for more complex apps."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used Astro recently to rebuild my personal website/portfolio, and I really enjoyed it. I&#39;m not a frontend dev and I quickly get overwhelmed by all of the choices and the breakneck speed that the web ecosystem changes at. Astro was exactly what I needed. It&#39;s optimized for spending most of your time writing content in markdown, but it gives you complete freedom to seamlessly add web code of any complexity you like. MDX is just markdown plus custom components, and Astro lets you drop in stuff from React, Vue or Angular, so you&#39;re not restricted to whatever components you can find for the single framework that you choose at the beginning of your project. Everything possible is made static. I found it to be pretty intuitive and I don&#39;t feel boxed in by it. This is how I want to make (frontend-only) websites in the future.My biggest issues using it (admittedly in the beta state) were 1) wrong line numbers printed for errors due to extensive rewriting and transpilation without source mappings and 2) no built-in image optimization (there is a third-party tool that works well enough, but for a content-first framework this doesn&#39;t seem good enough to me).[Edit]: Ah, I see in the 1.0 they have built-in image optimization :) I&#39;ll have to try that out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sometimes all the frameworks that re-invent MVC (but in a detached fashion) and tout &#34;server side rendering&#34; just feel like we&#39;ve come full circle where we&#39;re just serving a static view cache that was generated from models and data using a controller.The big difference here (as with other JavaScript-based renderers) is of course the &#34;use one tool/language for everything&#34; aspect which to me is a bit of a &#39;meh&#39;-benefit.At this point, while all the renderers get better and simpler, we&#39;re still in a situation where complexity or writing code hasn&#39;t really gone away, it just shifted around to new places. Perhaps at some point we get to the HTML + WebComponents stage again (kinda like MDX and React mixing), and classic Apache Server-Side Includes become the new hot thing again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Someone reading this may disagree with abortion. But if we can separate the controversy of the topic at hand from the fact a state government requested data from a private company for what is not universally considered a crime it could lead to a pragmatic discussion into data requests and privacy (i.e questionable practice of &#39;emergency data requests&#39; that function outside the normal process of a subpoena[1])[1]: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/hackers-gaining-power-of..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The real issue I have is that Facebook keeps an unencrypted copy of everyone&#39;s DMs stored and just waiting to be handed to the government. I understand it&#39;s how they make money, and that they&#39;ve done it forever, but man, I guess using Signal has spoiled me. It&#39;s so weird to me that most people are completely unaware or unworried that their &#34;private&#34; conversations aren&#39;t private in the slightest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While this case involved a search warrant, Facebook also gives information to police departments without a warrant for any case that they determine to be an &#34;emergency&#34;. Here is the portal where the information is requested and provided:https://www.facebook.com/recordsBack when I used to have a Facebook account, Facebook provided private information from my account to a police department without a warrant for a situation that they deemed an &#34;emergency&#34;, but that I did not.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have noticed that a lot of/majority of  &#34;regular people&#34; tend to coast along on the back of others as a way of life. If &#34;smart people&#34; are perceived by friends and family as being problem solvers, many will route their problems to a &#34;smart friend&#34;, someone who seems to have their life somewhat in order or always have the answer to everything. I used to get an endless stream of requests for everything from technical help, legal/financial advice, help planning vacation, help making decisions on purchases, career advice and help fixing their &#34;failed to launch&#34; kids, really often far exceeding simply asking for an opinion, folks effectively transfer ownership of their problems to you for you to fix.Of course they may praise you for this and perhaps you get addicted to this positive feedback, but it comes at a high cost, especially as you can end up spending so much effort on &#34;friends&#34; that you neglect to solve or even recognize your own problems.I have come to realize recently that I don&#39;t actually have any friends, only dependents. Declining to take ownership of people&#39;s problems caused basically all of them to more or less cut off contact with me (maybe I get a text once a year or something), but I am so much happier now that I ever was before."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not especially smart, or happy, but, personally, I don&#39;t know how to be it, or what it feels like. I know pleasure, but being in a constant pleasurable state is not what is meant by happiness as far as I know.Slavoj Žižek (someone who does seem to be especially smart):“Happiness was never important. The problem is that we don&#39;t know what we really want. What makes us happy is not to get what we want. But to dream about it. Happiness is for opportunists. So I think that the only life of deep satisfaction is a life of eternal struggle, especially struggle with oneself. If you want to remain happy, just remain stupid. Authentic masters are never happy; happiness is a category of slaves.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many people conflate hedonistic pleasure with happiness. This is a big mistake that leads to addiction, selfishness and inevitable dissatisfaction. Even happiness as a sustainable state may be an unrealistic or unattainable goal. For me the answer to this puzzle is a finely tuned balance between self growth and contentment with perhaps a heavier emphasis on contentment. Regular and consistent periods of reflection and appreciation for what you have (no matter how small) is the recipe for promoting states of contentment. Pleasure is ephemeral, happiness comes and goes but contentment can be reliably and directly cultivated."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great.  All I know is I&#39;m trading a lot more time for money this year.  Way less takeout, avoiding toll roads unless it saves at least 30 minutes, fewer streaming services (will renew on a show-by-show basis), and food is getting so crazy I might start going to multiple stores to try and save money instead of my one consolidated trip to Wegmans.I&#39;m also stuffing my freezer with meat and have a year&#39;s supply of non-perishables, not because I&#39;m a prepper but because I know it&#39;ll be so much more expensive next year as to be worth it.Also my rent is up 6.9%, but that&#39;s because I locked it in for two years.  Would have been 10.5% for a one-year lease, and that&#39;s on top of last year&#39;s comparatively conservative 4.5% increase.And my salary is up a mere 4.5%, and that only because I took on stretch assignments at work."</p>

So this value has been jumping around a bit as it has been going up. This drop is being taken as good news -- but I worry whether this is really a meaningful drop or whether we are just over interpreting what could be a fundamentally noisy metric?"</p>
