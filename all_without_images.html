								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My dad owns a successful chain of bicycle stores in Texas.  He’s been in business for almost 51 years and he’s one of the largest bike dealers by volume in the country.  He has nearly a hundred employees and a bookkeeper.  Despite having a proverbial dozen balls in the air at any time and despite having people on the payroll to do bookkeeping, he sits down at his computer every night at home, logs into the ERP system, and reviews sales and receipts.  He catches all kinds of crazy things.  Credit card fraud (before the chargeback even comes), internal theft, mis-priced items, mistakes, you name it.  He has great employees but even the best make mistakes and he’s learned this habit over the decades the hard way.  I remember sitting next to him as a kid, watching him pour over cash register journal tapes that were yards long, looking for problems.My point: if you let this kind of fuck-up go undetected for over three months, you have to at least assume some of the blame and acknowledge that you probably could have caught it if you scrutinized transactions.  Every good business owner does it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually thought Stripe did decently here, there were periods of silence which sucks. It&#39;s odd that you feel they are obligated to explain their internal processes with you?Things they did right:
1. Immediately acknowledge the issue and raise it to a Specialist.
2. Give you a work-around, so that you don&#39;t need to be blocked.
3. Engage the lead PM, to speak to you, to address your concerns.
4. Fix the documentation first, so others know how to fix this and understand the cases.
5. Take feedback that they need to improve the API.
6. Find which customers had an issue and pro-actively reach out to them. (Isn&#39;t this what you wanted in the 1st place?)Things that didn&#39;t go well:
1. Long periods of silence between mails.
2. Lack of a bug bounty, sounds like a pretty big miss on their part and a bug bounty would be nice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I also had issues with stripe&#39;s automatic tax. We use stripe&#39;s subscriptions with free trials but don&#39;t collect credit card details up front, preferring to make sign up simple and low friction. Automatic tax is charged at 0.5% of each transaction, and apparently a trial ending is considered a transaction even if the user has no payment method, so we were hit with automatic tax fees for every trial end even if we received no money for them.Overall my experience with stripe has been pretty negative and the large gap between my perception of the quality of their products, and the reality I discovered in actually using them has made me realize how much effort they put in to marketing to developers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"They have no intention of bombing the plant of course, or doing so in a way that would cause any serious destruction, especially when Putin&#39;s clear intentions are to take the entire Ukrainian territory; to me this is just psychological warfare to fuel the fear among other nations about nuclear dangers, so that both leaders and the public opinion will be against going at war with them. In theory, we (as EU) could intervene with traditional weapons so that the burden of escalating it further would still be on them; not an easy decision though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, aside from the obvious nature of messing around with Nuclear generating station being an idiotic move.  From a tactical move for Russia - clearly they want the generating station offline to cause further chaos in Ukraine and that it supplies 1/6 of the power I believe(?).  Was the generating station fighting to say online / not surrender or did Russia just show up guns blazing?It&#39;s clearly a tactically important source of energy for Ukraine.Also - wouldn&#39;t it just be easier for Russia to destroy the substations nearby?  I assume there would be some problems with all that excess power being generating if the substations were blown.  The whole thing is pretty nuts.I can&#39;t imagine being the ISO trying to balance the grid or ISO equivalent of the grid over there right now (amongst other impossible jobs/positions people are in Ukraine right now)."</p>

It will isolate them enough to allow the government to push an anti-western agenda.They need to see the misery of the war they are inflicting and the only way is via an open internet. Yes they will push their own propaganda to the west but we can deal with that.Fire-walling them off will result in the people not knowing what is going on. Just look how China is able to hide what happened at Tienanmen square.We can not allow Russia to run the narrative by cutting of the internet.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I obviously support Ukraine in their fight against invaders (and I am Russian born), but cutting the internet from Russia would be actually more useful for the Russian government than Ukraine. Russian government just today closed the last independent radio station, blocked the website of an independent tv station , so blocking the internet would just be applauded by the Russian state for doing what they wanted to do themselves."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not an intuitive thing but the data is fascinating. A couple of notes of people who are confused by it:1) The &#39;ns&#39; next to the box is a graph legend not a data label (normally that would be in a box labeled legend to distinguish it from graph data)2) The weird box and rectangle thing on the top is a slider, I didn&#39;t notice that until I was looking at the code and said &#34;what slider?&#34;3) The only changes from 2005 to present are storage and networking speeds.What item #3 tells you is that any performance gains in the last decade and a half you&#39;ve experienced have been driven by multi-core, not faster processors. And that means Amdahl&#39;s Law is more important than Moore&#39;s Law these days."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s very important to realize that this tool makes inaccurate projections from 2012 data. It is not at all accurate for 2020.See: https://github.com/colin-scott/interactive_latencies/issues/..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An instructive thing here is that a lot of stuff has not improved since ~2004 or so, and working around those things that have not improved (memory latency from ram all the way down to l1 cache really) requires fine control of memory layout and minimizing cache pollution, which is difficult to do with all of our popular garbage collected languages, even harder with languages that don&#39;t offer memory layout controls, and jits and interpreters add further difficulty.To get the most out of modern hardware you need to:* minimize memory usage/hopping to fully leverage the CPU caches* control data layout in memory to leverage the good throughput you can get when you access data sequentially* be able to fully utilize multiple cores without too much overhead and with minimal risk of errorFor programs to run faster on new hardware, you need to be able to do at least some of those things."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article is close, but doesn&#39;t quite get there. The problem is not the image itself or how it&#39;s taken, but rather how it&#39;s displayed. When you look at the world through your eyeballs, your brain recreates the scene so that it wraps around an imaginary point in mental space, so to speak. Things that are to your right &#34;appear to your right&#34; in your mind. When you&#39;re looking at a photograph, regardless of how much field of view it was taken with, it&#39;s displayed in a very small portion of your entire field of vision, even if you&#39;re looking at it on a computer monitor; it&#39;s even worse if you&#39;re looking at it on a phone. You&#39;re basically always looking at it zoomed out. It would be possible to recreate the scene exactly as it would have appeared if your eye was where the camera was when the photo was taken, but you&#39;d need to blow it up on a huge screen, like a movie theater screen, and stand fairly close to it. Then you&#39;d be able to see that actually most lenses other than fisheyes have fairly narrow field of views."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perspective is a huge challenge in photography, in some respects a central challenge.Here&#39;s [1] an image, made with a rectilinear lens, which manages to convey oodles of depth and structure.  It is difficult to overstate how challenging it can be to express that level of depth in a flat image.When people talk about how a focal-length &#34;compresses&#34; or &#34;exaggerates&#34; an image, what they&#39;re really talking about is perspective. Each field of view carries with it its own perspective.Variable focal-length (&#34;zoom&#34;) lenses encourage us to select our subject and composition first, then choose a perspective to match. Frequently, it is more important to begin with our desired subject and the perspective with which we wish the viewer to see it (focal-length), then figure out how to build a composition to match.   A 24-70 mm lens isn&#39;t really a lens, it is at least six lenses with significantly-different perspectives: 24, 28, 35, 40, 50, and 70mm, each of which can take a lifetime to master.One can deliver the perception that Hertzmann is after with a rectilinear lens, but it isn&#39;t easy.  Composition, lighting, and dodging/burning are all tools to that end.Think about your memory of the Tank Man in Tiananmen Square, now look at the image [2].  I bet he&#39;s a much smaller part of the frame than you recall, yet he utterly dominates your perception of the image, even when you look at the actual rectilinear image.[1] https://www.phillips.com/detail/HENRI-CARTIER-BRESSON/NY0405...[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank_Man"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s why some countries have weird regulations about maps. South Korea does not allow exporting vector maps, so Google Maps rendering is vector based everywhere except in a region surrounding South Korea [1]. China applies a (not so) secret pseudorandom offset to all geographic coordinates in online maps, frequently resulting in mismatches between systems that apply corrections and those that don&#39;t. It seems silly during peacetime but when there&#39;s an actual war, you can see why people might want that kind of thing.And militaries all over the globe do use Google Maps extensively, if not by policy then just by soldiers doing their own thing. Wrong borders in Google Maps have nearly led to international incidents when soldiers ended up on the wrong side of a border. And then there are the disputed borders that Google is forced to display differently in different countries. There is no globally accepted map and as a result the map Google shows you changes depending on where you&#39;re located.[1] Actually I am out of date, it looks like the South Korea maps are vector based now. Maybe the law changed. It definitely used to be the case."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Super cool project and write up.What&#39;s the state of EEG these days?Last I interacted with one of these systems it seemed more like confimation bias from noise.Had a buddy who bought a &#34;high end&#34; headset, shaved his head to &#34;improve the signal&#34;, and it appeared for all intents and purposes that it was mostly only reading concusive activity.  He would &#34;show me it&#39;s working&#34; by tapping on the exterior of the sensors to get it to display a spike.Conceptually these systems &#34;make sense&#34; to me, ie. the brain uses electromagnetism to function so one should be able to sense/manipulate those vectors, but an FMRI is MASSIVE and requires a 1-3 Tesla electromagnet to get its fidelity, and even then is only measuring blood flow and correlating that to brain activity.So what&#39;s the hope that a tiny sensor resting on your skin will actually correspond to anything happening inside the brain?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I learned a similar lesson in a simpler form when waiting tables.Some people will run you ragged, asking for more napkins, then when you return with them, more ketchup, then when you return with that, there’s an issue with the food, then so on and so on.If you don’t check yourself, you will actually leave your other tables without any of their basics, or their food will get cold waiting in the window, because you’ve developed tunnel vision to please this one needy table.Sometimes things really do stack up, but there are strategies to avoid or deal with that. These strategies will fail with the Truly Needy table. And then they won’t tip well, or at all.I learned it’s better to deprioritize that table and pay the normal amount of attention to everyone else. Better for those all to tip at a standard rate and give them a good experience than to let one group drag down the whole floor.That super needy table didn’t need half the things they asked for anyways. Those napkins are sitting there unused when they leave. The glass of water they asked you to fill at halfway is still almost full. Life goes on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I find scary is that if you work in a sufficiently toxic environment/culture for long enough, that very behavior that you try to fight against and change begins to seep into your everyday actions. I&#39;ve seen myself go from &#34;positive and helpful&#34; to &#34;apathetic and helpful&#34; to &#34;not caring at all&#34; to &#34;chippy, negative and unhelpful&#34; before. You hope that this is something you can pickup on, but when the culture of a work environment is like that, there isn&#39;t really anyone to give you feedback and catch you from sliding down this slope. Then when you do notice, the climb back up just feels so much more overwhelming."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I totally know that feeling. This is why I really cherish my current, by now 3 years old, job because sort of the opposite exists here. In fact, if I forget sometimes or make a mistake, my coworkers are more likely to fix it for me in the wiki or docs than they are to use it to complain or stop me from doing something. Working in a helpful and collaborative environment has had an enormous quality of life improvement for me. It is also the most productive teams I&#39;ve ever worked on. I&#39;m not writing this to gloat or anything but offer up something I didn&#39;t know before working here: Don&#39;t just hire for talent; do not hire jerks no matter how good they are as individuals. Software engineering is an inherently collaborative venture. When building an engineering team, really do build a team instead of a collection of individuals. It&#39;s fine for engineers to be critical but don&#39;t just stop there. Find fault but also offer up a solution to help the project move forward. I can&#39;t work in the type of environment the author described anymore. Now that I know functional, collaborative teams exist I will always want to be on one."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a wonderful little game. The concept and execution is extremely concise but the thing that really sealed the deal for me was noticing the escalating difficulty by making the paddles shrink."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let me use this thread to tell this somewhat related story of mine.When I was still at university we had a C class and were doing it in a computer lab with partners (back then very few students could afford a laptop). I was always partnering up with the same friend. Since we were a bit bored with the class we started building our own pong in C.
Rendering was done in ASCII in the command line, with paddles being 3 pipes, the ball a capital 0 and the walls &#34;#&#34;. We would spend some time at the beginning of the class building/improving it and at the end playing it. We used keys like &#34;W&#34; and &#34;S&#34; for the left player and &#34;O&#34; and &#34;L&#34; for the right player. Since the initial setup with rendering and &#34;physics&#34; of the game went quite fast, we thought about how to improve it and make it more fun.What made it incredibly fun (at least for us) in the end, was the addition of bonus squares. So, between the two paddles, if the ball that you just touched hit a bonus square, it would activate an effect for you or for the game depending on the bonus. We had:
- &#34;wall&#34;, would create a 3 squares wall at the location of the bonus
- &#34;turn of the lights&#34;, would hide everything but the ball (even the paddles)
- &#34;gun&#34;, would allow you to shoot and destroy walls and bonuses
- &#34;bigger/smaller paddle&#34;, self explanatory
- &#34;net&#34;, would temporarily put a net behind you preventing you from missing the ball
- and some more, like speed up the ball, add an extra ball, etc.It&#39;s been my one and only experience building a game but I think it was the most fun I&#39;ve had programming…
If anybody is up for re-building a pong with bonuses I&#39;d be definitely up for that ;)Back on the topic: love the implementation OP, pretty addictive. And, as can be read above, it brought back some nice memories."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another advantage to plain text files: source control. You can check your writing into git and get a history of all your edits.It’s something programmers take for granted, but it would be amazing if this got more widely adopted outside of tech. The number of files with names like “Report Final Final draft v3.docx” is truly staggering.“Git for everything“ would be a multi-billion dollar startup easily."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is one of the main strengths of Obsidian, which I have been using lately and I’m extremely happy with: everything is just Markdown files in some folder on disk. Zero danger of lock in.You can have a disk hierarchy if you desire, or trust that search will find you what you are looking for. For me search works fairly well and if I need something extra I can just grep/sed/awk.Plus it has the features that a simple text editor will not have: displaying images, live preview, relationships between topics, etc. It even has a Vim mode!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Plain text adoption often implies markdown for a richer experience, but we also have the wonderful https://orgmode.org markup.There is no shortage of markdown-based tools on all platforms. Our org markup options, on the other hand, are very few outside of Emacs. Org markup itself is super versatile and can power lots of use-cases.I built two org-powered apps for iOS myself:https://plainorg.comhttps://flathabits.comThere are other great ones out there:https://beorg.apphttps://logseq.comhttps://organice.200ok.chhttps://orgro.orghttp://orgzly.comLastly, a shoutout to Karl Voit who&#39;s been driving org markup awareness outside of Emacs with Orgdown https://gitlab.com/publicvoit/orgdown. He&#39;s also discussed org markup&#39;s strengths at https://karl-voit.at/2017/09/23/orgmode-as-markup-only"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think anyone who&#39;s claiming that remote work has been &#34;proven&#34; to be better or worse is wrong. There are some studies but they use estimations and proxies, carrying the same flaws as doing performance reviews based on lines of code.We&#39;ve proven that the big tech companies can go fully remote and not completely crash and burn, that&#39;s about it. Some people love the lack of commute and less semi-forced hanging out, some people hate onboarding on a new company as a remote person and so on and so on.I personally prefer a company where everyone&#39;s on site. I want to be able to quickly resolve any issues in person, not over voice call or slack, and I think that an environment where someone can tap me on the shoulder when they need help leads to overall higher productivity, even if individual productivity suffers temporarily."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been fully remote my entire career (several decades), in fact in 30+ years have never been on site anywhere for more than 2 weeks total. Wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.But as a counter-point, seeing a whole bunch of people who were never remote before, how little work they are actually doing, it is no surprise to me that a lot of employers are going to start forcing - to the extent possible - employees back into the office.I think a small percentage of people are self-motivated, and more productively at home, but watching this all play out for the last 2 years makes me realize that an awful lot of people are going to try to get away with absolutely anything they can - including working as little as possible - when allowed to be on their own. I have had coworkers literally disappear for days at a time, miss meetings for weeks at a time, constantly miss deadlines etc - and as a manager, that is very hard to manage underperformers with a remote work force.Remote work isn&#39;t for everyone, and unfortunately there is a non-trivial percentage of the workforce that actual does need someone watching over them to make sure they do what they are supposed to be doing each day.Let&#39;s hope they don&#39;t ruin it for the rest of us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve worked at a startup where everyone being there was essential in how we worked. (We were all pair programming.) It was great. It beats code reviews any day. I learned a lot.But when I was at Google, we would schedule VC meetings with people in a different part of campus just to avoid the walk. Also, I worked on teams that had people worked out in many offices, mostly not Mountain View. I was surrounded by Googlers in an open-plan office, but it was often lonely. I ate alone sometimes. It was often not worth the commute.I think Google having a company-wide policy on this is nuts. Teams vary a lot. They should probably be left to make their own decisions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This feels like a major blow, as someone who just semi recently (probably around pandemic start) started getting into purchasing flac music from indie artists, Bandcamp was a great source of music. I understand nothing will change in the short term, but long term I am very concerned. Especially as streaming becomes more dominant and companies are less willing to provide flac based music and physical discs (where I can rip my own) continue to disappear.This feels like a potential last step of true music ownership and that makes me incredibly sad.That being said if anyone knows of any place to buy flacs of music with great selection would love to know (especially for Japanese music which I generally have to import, thankfully they love CDs)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is absurdly sad to me. I like to own my media (in the most practical sense that current IP laws let me do so). I run a Plex server and use PlexAmp as my primary way of listening to music, and my criteria are always this:* FLAC or similar, I want this to be a lossless preservation of what was on the best-available source.* No DRM. No mandated player. Just let me download a dang file.* &#34;Real&#34; flac: this is technically already covered under the first bullet, but I call it out because I&#39;ve seen it happen before: if I can open the flac in audacity and see it&#39;s obviously just a re-encode of a lossy format that clips the upper and lower frequency ranges off, that&#39;s a smell and I don&#39;t like it. (I know, most people can&#39;t tell etc, but this is less for listening purposes and more for archival purposes).* Supports the artist!Now, I&#39;ll admit, when push comes to shove, I drop the last bullet point first. So previously, my source for music was:1. CD&#39;s (and I would follow What&#39;s guide for making Perfect Flacs)2. WhatBut then what shut down and I lost my main music discovery mechanism. Enter bandcamp! Now I&#39;ve been very happy with:1. Bandcamp (I buy CDs because I like the artwork and they&#39;re cool).2. CD&#39;s (+ Perfect Flac ripping guide still)Now I&#39;m not sure what to do. Epic has really soured me on their brand already, and I already boycott their launcher and any EGS exclusives. I guess I have to find some other way to get stuff now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s been so frustrating watch this play out over the past decade.I keep seeing projects that could have been written as a traditional multi-page application pick an SPA architecture instead, with the result that they take 2-5 times longer to build and produce an end-result that&#39;s far slower to load and much more prone to bugs.Inevitably none of these projects end up taking advantage of the supposed benefits of SPAs: there are no snazzy animations between states, and the &#34;interactivity&#34; mainly consists of form submissions that don&#39;t trigger a full page - which could have been done for a fraction of the cost (in development time and performance) using a 2009-era jQuery plugin!And most of them don&#39;t spend the time to implement HTML5 history properly, so they break the URLs - which means you can&#39;t bookmark or deep link into them and they break the back/forward buttons.I started out thinking &#34;surely there are benefits to this approach that I&#39;ve not understood yet - there&#39;s no way the entire industry would swing in this direction if it didn&#39;t have good reasons to do so&#34;.I&#39;ve run out of patience now. Not only do we not seem to be learning from our mistakes, but we&#39;ve now trained up an entire new generation of web developers who don&#39;t even know HOW to build interactive web products without going the SPA route!My recommendation remains the same: default to not writing an SPA, unless your project has specific, well understood requirements (e.g. you&#39;re building Figma) that make the SPA route a better fit.Don&#39;t default to building an SPA."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think one of the unsolved problems of client-side interactivity on websites is how difficult it is to add it just a little bit of extra client-side functionality to a traditional server rendered website. For example, recently I had to deal with photo uploads on a Rails app, which works fine out of the box at first, until you want to show progress bars and uploaded previews etc. Then you add a couple of client-side Stimulus controllers, maybe a Turbo frame here and there and it works, but then you get to browser navigation and you&#39;re screwed, because none of this works if somebody were to submit the form, then navigate back. Now you have to implement lifecycle handling to account for navigation and once you&#39;re done, you&#39;ve basically implemented a SPA, except it&#39;s broken into a mix of tightly-coupled Javascript, Ruby and ERB templates."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SPAs are a pattern that&#39;s been applied too broadly IMO, but it&#39;s going a bit far to call them a mistake. The aims of an SPA are pretty noble - the idea of essentially removing the network round trip when a user clicks on something is not a bad one. It means things are faster, they work if your connection is flaky, they can do things like offline support. Those are good features.They might not be actual requirements for a blog or a brochure site but it&#39;s not totally unreasonable for someone to want their website to work that way. The question is not whether or not an SPA is a good or a bad thing, but whether or not the cost (more code, more complexity, potentially a series of background requests after the initial page load) is worth paying in order to get the benefits.When either an SPA or a multi-page site is done well most users can&#39;t tell which sort of site they&#39;re looking at. That should be the goal. Make stuff where the user forgets about the tech. Make a website that just works, that&#39;s fast enough for users not to think &#39;this is a bit slow&#39;, and that&#39;s coded in a way you can maintain and work on for a long time. If you get those things right then no one can reasonably criticise what you&#39;ve made no matter how you&#39;ve made it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s discrimination any way you slice it. You can&#39;t lower the bar for one person without raising it for another so long as the class sizes remain the same. If elite universities are about providing education (a valid point of critical contention), then systematically barring Asians from entry is the same class of injustice litigated in Brown v. Board of Education. It&#39;s not enough to say you can learn calculus just as well at the University of Massachusetts.&#34;Here we find our first indication of the strength of preferences for underrepresented minority students. African-American students have nearly an 80 percent better chance of being admitted than their white counterparts, while the Hispanic advantage is reflected in almost 50 percent higher odds compared to whites. By contrast, Asian applicants and those from other races face lower odds of admission on the order of 17 or 18 percent—in relation to comparable whites.&#34;https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/tje/files/..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a confused by the equity claim to justify discriminatory behavior with what seems like heavy emphasis on race. It seems difficult to achieve equity without transparent, and standardized methods emphasizing a holistic assessment covering visible and invisible, immutable and mutable characteristics--each of which impact individual outcomes.I understand that tackling overrepresentation and underrepresentation is important; but, when emphasizing race to the degree that these academic institutions are, isn&#39;t this leading to representation disparities within the racial categories themselves? The racial categories are a very American centric and limited term, and arguably rooted largely as social constructs that loosely define the ethnic populations they cover. For example, and I don&#39;t mean any offense or to call any group out specifically, Koreans are overrepresented compared to Cambodians at the academic institutions listed in the article per their population proportion. This doesn&#39;t seem to be captured and accounted for under the current system. The same underlying disparity potentiality applies to whites, Blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans, etc...The interpretation being, that it&#39;s a sort of half-committed approach to equity that isn&#39;t really leading to equitable outcomes if that makes sense, and may even be exacerbating ethnic marginalization within the racial categories.Another question is, if this isn&#39;t leading to genuine equity of outcomes and instead passing discriminatory behavior onto smaller, marginalized ethnic groups, what do you do then? Do you revisit implementing an improved meritocracy system, or implement an equity based system with greater accuracy and precision to prevent this?This doesn&#39;t even begin to tackle the issues current racial categorization creates with multiracial people and the essence of &#34;purism.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh no! This breaks my heart. :(David and Ron Crane hired me for my first job in California right around 2000.  I had no clue who they both were we just met at a trade show and I said I was looking for a job, we had this crazy interview where we just talked about anything and everything, and voila I was working in silicon valley. I think we spent about 2 hours talking about how we could float a balloon beside an AM radio station and how light up a light bulb...Anyways, who fresh out of school doesn&#39;t work for the inventor of ethernet/fast ethernet/a core founder of 3com, etc? I only spent 2 years working with them, and I&#39;ve always been looking to work with similar talent/kindness/etc.  How they put up with a fresh grad I will never know.I remember David and I working on an SDSL project, and we were just having the worst time ever.  We couldn&#39;t get it train and finish setting up the link, it did almost everything but then just failed at the end.  It was meant to be easy....but we just couldn&#39;t figure it out.  We spent a crazy amount of time on it, maybe a month.  Finally Ron got fed up, and asked &#34;have you tried reversing the pairs?&#34; and it worked!  Turns out we had plugged the cable in backwards, and trying to streamline/debug the code had removed the final bits of cleanup code that checked if the pair was reversed.  Ah well.They were amazing mentors and friends.  David invited me over to his home for wine tastings, to meet his cats (Palo and Alto), etc. I unfortunately lost touch with him over the years as I moved, he moved, etc.Thank you David, you welcomed me to California and you&#39;ll be missed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I ran across him years ago at a shooting event (he had a very cool Steyr AUG). He was humble, down to Earth, and just a really neat guy. Amazing to think how his work impacted us all.His one conceit to vanity? The personalized plate on his older Mercedes SL coupe was something like ETHERNT, which is why I initially approached him."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"First commercial Ethernet media (1980) also was a RG-8X coaxial cable using the circa-1940 RF connector called “N” (as opposed to the F or the unthreaded RCA phono connector).You could then do “simple” vampire tap into such Ethernet RF cable to expand your network.Because the then-10Base-5 signal is a guided RF-based wire, it was originally made to allow communication in one-direction only … at a time (half-duplex). Each end of the wire had to wait their turn (just like telegraph operators did by beaconing their intent to send info by pre-sending some well-known code).Both IBM and Xerox Parc diverged into Token Bus and Star network configuration to deal with this “half-duplex” issues using the same collision backoff algorithm.I think David unknowingly cemented the IEEE 802.3 standard as a winner when he prototyped the N-backoff algorithm for upcoming 802.3 for the 802 IEEE Working Group.This half-duplex constraint of 802.3 (and 10Base-5) technology was losing out to the IBM token bus (IEEE 802.5) methodology in maximum bandwidth utilization.Of course, without this N-Backoff algorithm, 802.3 wouldn’t have made the next step of leveraging a twisted pair (precursor to 802.3 10Base-T) possible to achieve this full-duplex and modern Ethernet we know to this day. Token bus and token ring both had effectively lost out in the Ethernet “Duplex War”.While Bob Metcalf may have made it possible the 10Base-5 communications, he also got a lot of hardware help so David Bogg actually did the thinking of backoff algorithm … at hardware level. And the PARC performance team refined the backoff algorithm to near perfection.Any error are mine and mine alone.  I was close enough to that circle, others may be closer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I experienced this in the extreme recently. I&#39;m a very experienced dev in a very in-demand field. Money is not a huge priority for me in my career. Flexibility is. I have a proven track record of success in part-time roles after converting to part time at my previous company (after 2 years of full-time, of course). I spent 3+ months trying to get part-time engagements, and was willing to consider both consulting and W-2 arrangements. I got interviewed and then ghosted by two companies, was offered a laughably low rate by a third, and a fourth showed interest but then basically told me that I&#39;d need to work a 40-hour week. I know that a vocal minority has success in part-time consulting, but it&#39;s quite difficult to accomplish if you live outside of a tech hub (I&#39;m based in Central Oregon) and don&#39;t have SV connections.Contrast that with when I gave up and decided to make myself available for full-time (remote) work. In the span of about 5 weeks, I got over 200 recruiter emails, interviewed at 10 companies, and received 10 offers, mostly in the upper end of the $200k-400k range.I firmly believe that this is a cultural block, rather than one that&#39;s rooted in rational/pragmatic concerns. Tech companies want to feel like they&#39;re getting your full intellectual output, even if that&#39;s demonstrably false in the status quo. There&#39;s also this issue that gets brought up of &#34;if Bob is gone half the time, isn&#39;t that going to breed resentment with his full-time coworkers?&#34; (answer: only if you have a shitty &#34;butts in seats&#34; management culture).I honestly don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to see meaningful change in this area for a while. The 40-hour work week is something that&#39;s heavily ingrained in tech culture, to the point where certain companies&#39; &#34;perks&#34; are heavily tuned towards incentivizing you to stay at the office longer and frequently turn that 40 hours into 60. I think it will take an external disruptive event on the scale of COVID-19 in order to change this aspect of tech culture."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m working hourly on a contract where I advised the company I could only work 15-20 hours a week.  It can be a win-win I believe, but with tradeoffs for both sides.I&#39;m able to make the 3-4 hours of work a day be extremely productive.  I always deliver in fewer hours than were budgeted for the work.  As a contractor, there are no extraneous meetings to slow me down.  But I&#39;m still involved in client meetings as needed, understand their needs, and take ownership of the codebase to my immense satisfaction.It&#39;s not very different than working &#34;full time&#34; from home where you might take a walk, run an errand, cook your lunch, etc., but I can flex the schedule even further without any guilt.  The change in mindset from &#34;taking a break from full-time work&#34; for an errand versus &#34;I&#39;m not billing this hour, I&#39;ll do whatever I want&#34; is empowering.The negatives: less pay in total for me (but hourly rate can be negotiated), and features might (but won&#39;t necessarily) get done more slowly in terms of calendar days.BTW a typical day might be:- daycare drop-off 9:30, exercise- 10:30 shower, chores, life tasks- 11:45 cook and eat lunch- 12:30-4:30 work with a break for walking or playing pianoI do some &#34;down time&#34; thinking about problems as I fall asleep at night or on walks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Two big reasons off the top of my head:1. Two people working a 20h week does not mean the same costs as a single person working a 40h week (think payroll, software licensing, pension admin, healthcare, etc).So costs rise as a result.2. A job generally has a base load of admin and toil (communication, on-call, interviewing, PR reviews, etc) and you can&#39;t reduce or distribute the base load well enough to yield productive output from the remaining work time with part-time workers and some of this adds more toil when distributed across more people (i.e. on-call requires more handovers during the week and takes more communication).So productivity is reduced.*For companies to consider doing this they&#39;d need to perform an trial to satisfy themselves that the above can be overcome. But even doing that may not be possible with existing employees and risks instilling discontent amongst those not in the trial. It&#39;s high risk to try.* Unless the entire company is 100% part-time and somehow base load is fundamentally reworked, in which case #1 still applies."</p>

And stuff like Electronic Money Institutes for at least some really basic banking.Fair warning though, some of these things look rather shady so use some common sense and be careful with your local legislation (See MrDisposables response)edit: To elaborate on the last part see what happened in Kazakhstan recently. Their outage lasted luckily only shortly but you might not have to think about only western sanction but also Russias distaste for VPNs as well as the possibility for having your internet cut. Sure Kazakhstan is a lot smaller in terms of internet infrastructure, but there didnt seem to have been a way around their shutdown. You are then only left with satellite as well as maybe coverage from the neighboring countries. Both getting really expensive with a devaluing currency and at high threat of sanctions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article hits on something I&#39;ve felt for a long time. The idea that &#34;hooks are superior&#34; to me is ridiculous. If a linter is required to tell me when I&#39;m writing a bug that is not immediately obvious, that is a failing in the framework to round those edges. Lints are not rounded edges!Solid is nice and _seems_ to fix the issues with hooks, but as another comment mentioned, the challenge is with building at scale. It&#39;s unclear to me how this scales and where the sharp edges are.React IMO trades off performance in exchange for ergonomics. These ergonomics bear fruit early on, but you start dealing with this debt very quickly. As &#34;nice&#34; as Redux is, I shouldn&#39;t need it so early. React is designed in a way that results in pretty terrible performance. I once wrote a React app, and discovered perf issues 2 weeks in. Any UI framework I used in the past would have scaled beyond this point without having to have the data layer rewritten. Frameworks of the past also had what seemed like way less &#34;magic&#34;.I totally accept that it&#39;s seriously nice to write, but how many trees has React alone burnt?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"New JS frameworks always make for compelling hello world examples.Can you branch on state or use loops over data in Solid.js? The reason _why_ React has a virtual DOM is to enable more interesting relationships between your data and your presentation. Anyone can make a framework that makes the source code for an incrementing number look pretty!As an example of this point, check out the &#34;Simple Todos&#34; example for Solid.js[1].In React, we render lists by using regular JavaScript idioms like loops, arrays, and array methods like map. However in Solid.js, much like traditional templating languages, we get a construct like &lt;For&gt; that reinvents a concept that&#39;s already in the language.I&#39;ve been writing React and React-alike code for a long time. I think that fine-grained updates avoiding reconciliation are a good idea, especially for performance. At one point, I built a React-like library for Roblox and Lua whose most novel feature ended up being &#34;Bindings&#34;[2], which look sorta like Solid.js state containers. They create little hot-path data dependencies, but the bulk of your components still use normal React-like rendering.  [1]: https://www.solidjs.com/examples/todos
  [2]: https://roblox.github.io/roact/advanced/bindings-and-refs/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve used React for ~3 years, primarily with function components and hooks. I think that hooks were a wonderful addition and I think the framework has made smart choices with checking object equality to decided if components re-render.That said, I think that easily the most difficult aspects of react revolve around how re-renders are triggered. Maintaining referential equality to stop unnecessary renders gets tricky when you are passing functions or objects. Suddenly you need to be using `useMemo` and `useCallback` and passing dependency lists that all have to be primitive values unless you want to memoize them as well. It can become such a headache that the official line around it mostly seems to be &#34;make the render fast, don&#39;t worry about unnecessary re-renders&#34; – good advice, until you hit a use-case where you need to worry.Solid takes these problems and just vanishes them. UI state knows what its dependencies are automatically and only updates when they change – even in a sub-component level!To be fair, I&#39;ve never used Solid in anger, and moving to it would be a big ask when there is such a good ecosystem built up around react. That said it is easily one of the most exciting projects on my radar, and the developer Ryan Carniato seems extremely knowledgeable in the area."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The reason for my current user name here at hn was this exact form of racism. It is the first post I made when I created this throwaway. I was assured that my experience was unique and not widespread. I am both sad and happy to see this, sad because it exists, happy because it is getting some attention here at HN.I would like to take this opportunity to point out that everyone of us needs to be vigilant about this type of racism. One thing I recommend to my hiring managers is to not allow people from frictioned backgrounds to manage and interview people from the other side. Example problematic pairs for candidates/interviewers (not including the cast situation) include: Indians and Pakistanis, Serbians and Bosnians, Greeks and Turks, Chinese and Japanese.One way I solve this is by introducing an independent observer/participant when situations like this emerge. This is costly but it has really worked to not only address this problem but also created an amazing diversity in my teams because it takes care of some of the implicit bias we all have to some degree."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; A pat on the shoulder might be a friendly greeting—or a search for a sacred thread that some dominant-caste Hindu men wear beneath their shirtsI&#39;m a non-dalit Indian working in silicon valley. I know that caste based discrimination is still prevalent in India and not surprised that it continues in here in silicon valley as well amongst Indian community but I&#39;m surprised to read this part in the article. I have never heard of someone doing a scan for sacred thread. Also, it&#39;s worth noting that most non-dalit people also do not wear this sacred thread so whoever is doing this scan isn&#39;t familiar with India or probably this part is made up in the article.That said, I know that it&#39;s much harder for a dalit person to progress in India as the society still tries to pull them behind. Indian govt has reservations in colleges and jobs for dalit community, which I believe has helped the community a lot in last 50 years or so, helping many to bring their families out of poverty. But, still there&#39;s a long way to go. Also, a long way to go for non-dalit community to abolish this discrimination.My heart goes with our dalit brothers &amp; sisters and glad to hear that their issues are being discussed in silicon valley as well now."</p>

The checkbox hack is decent in a few places (though I’d say &lt;details&gt; is normally a better choice now, and the checkbox hack should be accompanied by certain ARIA properties and augmented with some JavaScript to twiddle properties as it’s used), but dark mode is not one of them. The checkbox hack is only suitable for transient state that you actively don’t want to persist over page loads. Probably the most popular historical application of it is hamburger menus (but &lt;details&gt; or `:hover, :focus-within` are better for that now). I think a more reasonable solution for dark mode is the media query (prefers-color-scheme: dark), following the browser preference by default and augmented by JavaScript to allow overriding that. https://chrismorgan.info/blog/dark-theme-implementation/ describes my own implementation, which is the most comprehensive and efficient client-side-only implementation that I know of, as perfect as it’s possible to be while being client-side-only and without getting into service workers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"F-droid gets many things right (e.g. verifiable builds), but it&#39;s just not usable in practice.Installing applications is a rare event, updating them is frequent, and needs to disrupt the user as little as possible. Android used to not allow alternative app stores to update apps without user interaction, but now supports this through UPDATE_PACKAGES_WITHOUT_USER_ACTION, which doesn&#39;t seem to be supported by F-droid. So it&#39;s manual clicking for each update.F-droid also somehow gets the regular update flow wrong and often (always?) shows an error when you try to install the update from the notification. That has remained unfixed for years. So you have to manually open it, initiate the update, then click through the dialogs.Additionally, the official repos update so slowly that they&#39;re useless for fast-moving stuff like NewPipe.Together with Android bugs like https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/204233247 (resetting all &#34;open with&#34; URIs on update), this makes using packages installed through F-Droid a nightmare."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"App developer&#39;s perspective.  I have a few apps on all major places, including F-Droid.  The &#39;no user accounts&#39; thing makes developing and distributing on F-Droid a freeing experience, as compared to the G/A &#39;jails&#39;.  There is no pressure to meet arbitrary undocumented restrictions, you are not subject to the whims of dehumanizing AI routines, there are no ratings and reviews (the feedback is direct). The build and deployment process is not really my problem, as part of their Reproducible Builds, even that aspect is taken care of. https://f-droid.org/en/docs/Reproducible_Builds/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried something like this once and it worked surprisingly well, even for a UGC site.Years back we were doing something that included users documenting TV shows. We had a big meeting where people put every feature they wanted on index cards. We laid the cards out a founder&#39;s dining room table. The host got their change jar and each person got a certain number of pennies to mark features they thought were vital for first launch.After the first round of token-voting, the &#34;user accounts&#34; card had no votes. At first it seemed impossible. But after some discussion, we realized that viewing users didn&#39;t need accounts for launch. For people who wanted to edit, we let them type in a name to take credit for their contributions if they wanted, but with no verification. At worst, we figured we could add something more robust if the need were stronger.It turned out fine. The launch got out earlier and we got to test a number of key product hypotheses without having to build any sort of user account system. Months later it did eventually become the highest priority. But not having accounts worked way longer than I expected."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I follow some of the writings of Nassim Taleb. I came to the conclusion that RISC-V will &#34;succeed&#34; because there&#39;s no way for it to fail. It&#39;s like Linux.I don&#39;t think licensing fees to ARM are a problem per se, it&#39;s the &#34;frictional costs&#34; that it introduces. My understanding is that the Raspberry Pi developed their RP2040 because ARM had a reasonable package available for its low-end Cortex-M processors, which doesn&#39;t apply to their higher-end Cortex ones.RISC-V doesn&#39;t even have these restrictions. Even extremely small outfits can play around with RISC-V designs. Most of them won&#39;t go very far, but with enough lottery tickets, one of them is bound to draw the winning numbers.Sure there are considerable obstacles. I toy with microcontrollers. For hobbyists like me, ARM processors are still the most sensible choice. I&#39;m not expecting any shift from that for at least five years. But who knows after that? Anything can happen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The real reason RISC-V is succeeding, relative to ARM:If you make your own CPU- With ARM, You have to pay ARM for ISA license (after a several months long negotiation), and you cannot license your CPU design to anyone, as ARM has the exclusive right to do that with their designs.- With RISC-V, you get a free ISA license, and you can license your CPU design to others.If you do not make your own CPU- With ARM, you can (after a several months long negotiation) license one of the few designs ARM has available. There&#39;s no other vendors that can offer you ARM CPU designs.- With RISC-V, right now, you can license any among hundreds of options available, from tens of vendors. The licensing process is usually very short and straightforward. Alternatively, there are some open hardware designs. You can get commercial support for some of them.Frankly, unless ARM does radically change their business model, I do not expect them to survive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work with RISC-V these days.many AI chips are using RISC-V.A non-technical perspective about RISC-V: China is leading to some extent in RISC-V land(Sifive works with Hifive in China, Alibaba released its RISC-V,etc). China could not license x86, could not acquire MIPS, tried to get part of ARM now(the China ARM company is fighting with ARM), but the big land needs to &#34;own&#34; a CPU core at will desperately, RISC-V fits perfectly well."</p>

Vocal Unix proponents tend to believe that anything Unix does is automatically better than Windows, sometimes without even knowing what the Windows analogue is. Programming in both is necessary to have an informed opinion on this subject.The one thing I miss most on Unix: the unified model of HANDLEs that enables you to WaitOnMultipleObjects() with almost any system primitive you could want, such as an event with a socket (blocking I/O + a shutdown notification) in one call. On Unix, a flavor of select() tends to be the base primitive for waiting on things to happen, which means you end up writing adapter code for file descriptors to other resources, or need something like eventfd.Things I don&#39;t miss from Windows at all: wchar_t everywhere. :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good, this should be standard.I don&#39;t  understand how you can have a labor market where only one side has information on what the salaries are for an industry through a team that does market research. It depresses wages, mostly for internal employees who aren&#39;t paying attention bc they&#39;re content with their jobs.Price transparency leads to more efficient markets, no reason the labor market is any different. A company hiring an employee under market rate, because the employee doesn&#39;t know what market rate is, is a failure.EDIT: Wanted to add that this hits closer to home for me b/c I&#39;ve personally experienced this.Went out and jumped companies and got a 300% raise b/c I was underpaid at the prev, only know that thanks to levels.fyi. New hires at my level were making almost double what I was.When other engineers at my current company talk about salary, or total comp more generally, they vastly underestimate the state of the market."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a candidate, I hate applying to jobs only to get a lowball offer at the end. So I appreciate bills like this.As a hiring manager, I see that this is actually not so simple. You give someone a range, say $100-150k. I ASSURE you that they are thinking they are closer to 150k than 100. So good luck giving an offer for $100k, even though that might be what that particular candidate is worth to you.It&#39;s never gonna happen, but what i&#39;d rather see is an option to instead give current median total comp on the team i&#39;m interviewing for, plus maybe the 25-75 percentile range. That gives me a sense of what I should expect, plus what the salary growth path might be."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"this is one of those ostensibly good ideas that has some downsides which are often not discussed - the main one of which, is salary depression.Forcing employers to publish salaries on job ads will inevitably lead to wide salary bands (lets see how absurd they get) with a low ceiling on the upper tier. Employers know that if they publish a high number, job candidates are naturally going to want to shoot for it, and would be disappointed if they got significantly less than the maximum advertised, compromising offer acceptance rates. Hence employers will set a lower &#39;maximum&#39; salary than they might actually pay if the salary was hidden.See UK public sector for evidence of this; salaries must be published, maximum is always significantly lower than equivalent job in private sector."</p>

I cannot with good conscience continue to support the Russian regime in any way, shape or form. People that are getting angry need to point that at the cause, their own government. If more grace time is necessary for some to move, we will provide it. Free speech is one thing but this decision is more about a government that is committing war crimes against innocent people that we want nothing to do with."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was surprised by this, until I realized that one of Namecheap&#39;s offices is in downtown Kharkiv. Today, the Russian military bombed Kharkiv with cluster munitions [1]. Civilians were killed, possibly including children [2].Given the severity of the situation, I&#39;m surprised that Namecheap has not opted for more drastic measures- for example, redirecting Russian web traffic. Simply transferring Russian businesses to other providers might be among the less-drastic options they considered.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e42F1V3AOq4&amp;t=150s[2] https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/02/28/kharkiv-rock..."</p>

Ships refuse to offload goods in Russian ports and drop them of &#34;wherever in Europe&#34;. Russian companies can&#39;t buy/rent containers to bring goods to Russia.It&#39;s a lot of collateral damage.On the other side my brothers in law family in Kharkiv sleeps in hallway for past few days while outside blow  up cluster munition delivered by MLRS systems https://twitter.com/YWNReporter/status/1498271572292952064?s...Edit: just to add, I myself was born in Kyiv. Company where I work now has officies both in Ukraine (in one of hotter places) and in russia. I am equally trying to help my colleagues from both offices to GTFO. Collateral damage is unfortunate for private person but frankly not surprising. What is &#34;surprising&#34; it&#39;s that a big chunk of Russian population is surprised by it"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My entire team of software engineers are Ukranian, residing in Ukraine (I&#39;m not in Ukraine, nor am I Ukrainian).For the past few weeks our &#34;water cooler talk&#34; has been almost exclusively about the rising threat of invasion, if not directly about the ongoing conflict in the SE of Ukraine. A number of the team signed up for the volunteer defence force and have spent countless weekends training with the army.The morning of the invasion I received early morning messages from a few of the members to the effect of &#34;Russia has invaded. We are going to fight.&#34;I have never sent such an emotional and heart felt &#34;Good luck, stay safe&#34; in what is such a vacuous and empty medium (i.e., a messenger client) before. I haven&#39;t been able to produce anything since the invasion began because I am constantly watching the news and various social media feeds for updates on the invasion, and it&#39;s really hard to pick up a full (now absent, mostly) team&#39;s efforts without metaphorically dropping bits all over the place.My work, and that of my team, it just.. doesn&#39;t matter in comparison. My boss is asking for progress updates and I&#39;m just responding &#34;Nothing. The guys are focussing on staying safe, warm, and well stocked right now.&#34; (with a small side of incredulity.)I&#39;ve brought it up with leadership and they are going to parachute in some agencies from other places and I can&#39;t help but feel we are just abandoning my team members. The people I have, on average, spent 5x8hr days working with for the past few years. My comrades. My friends. Just so expendable in the eyes of my employer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am American, moved to Kyiv almost four years ago.  My startup engineering team is 100% in Ukraine. As the warning signs mounted I urged my people to consider leaving but no one, myself included, thought it would come to this.  Of course no one left.I finally agreed to take a couple of weeks out of Kyiv to calm my cofounder’s nerves, sure that I’d be back and we’d have a laugh at how it all came to nothing. So I am in Tbilisi and my team are all stuck in Ukraine.We’re doing all we can to help   We can’t get the men out because the Ukrainian borders guards won’t let any men leave, and most of the women won’t leave their husbands behind. A few have joined the territorial defense forces and are defending Kyiv now. Many others are taking shelter in basements while the Russians shell their cities.Today, 66% of my 45 person team were online and working. It’s astonishing the grit and commitment the Ukrainians are showing. We’re resolved not to abandon them and to do all we can for them but the shitty reality is that’s just not a whole lot right now.If anyone can fight their way to victory in this war it’s them. I wish the west had done more when there was still time to make a difference, but now it’s up to Ukrainians to save themselves and make the Russian invaders pay for every meter they take."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As if the pointless prodding of “any updates? :)” is ever called for. If there were any updates, there would be fucking updates posted. I frequently get comments like this in projects they I maintain, sometimes less than a day after the issue was opened, and it does nothing but annoy me and make me not want to resolve their issue. Why is there an expectation that maintainers have infinite amounts of time to fix whatever problem you’re having? Extremely frustrating and makes me hate working in open source."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"DIY Perks [1] has a good tutorial on how to make a super bright LED panel from LED strips. Quite easily, actually.Been using one of those in my office for the last eight years or so. I use a server PSU for power.I was surprised to see how bright it is when I once went outside while it was on. Not only was my window the brightest in the entire street by far. But it actually illuminated the trees around my window.If I was to build it again - and especially for a place like living room - , I would build it so as to also simulate sunset. That is to say, that it will automatically lower the brightness and shift to a warmer spectrum in the evening. Otherwise, this thing messes with your biorhythm and gets you out of sync with normal daylight hours very quickly.[1] https://youtu.be/jLia59KfkSw"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I lived in Seattle, my solution was a 2’ square fluorescent panel I got from a gardening supply place called “The Indoor Sun Shop”. I grew up in the South and got real bad seasonal depression up there; it probably saved my life. I paid all of $300 for it. Plus like twenty bucks for a mechanical timer, because I discovered that there were a lot of mornings where I was too depressed and mopey to turn it on myself. I kept it in the home office I worked in and it did a lot to shut up that little voice that suggested killing myself as the solution to every problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m from India. Lighting in my middle class house, since forever, has been poor. I never consciously felt it when I was still studying. Just that the rooms were dark and I would prefer to play/study outside, or in the front room, where the door was always open, allowing a lot of sunlight.I realized the lighting factor a few years back. Now, My own home has two lights in every room and whenever I am studying/reading/cooking, I always have them both on.The difference is stark. Perhaps I am clutching my pearls when I say this, but I feel my quality of life has improved with better lighting.I also got my walls painted with very light colors, and the ambient light is just amazing.Good lighting is a blessing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is cool! As someone who&#39;s into fine dining, a few thoughts/tips for people starting out:1. Don&#39;t go into a michelin level restaurant expecting &#34;well it&#39;s expensive so it should be what I normally eat but better&#34;, think of it as its own category of food, that happens to have a really high buy-in price. Lots more crazy flavors, presentation, exotic ingredients, etc. It&#39;s not that it has to be &#39;better&#39; than the best $12 bbq joint you&#39;ve ever been to, just different.2. Many very high end restaurants have great lunch deals, which can really cut the price to try them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m so glad this was a positive story, and I&#39;m so happy for the author! I went into it expecting this restaurant to be mocked, since articles like this are usually played as a joke.No, not everyone can afford to try a Michelin Star restaurant. A lot of Michelin restaurants suck. And you don&#39;t have to pay a ton for a good meal; some of the best food I&#39;ve ever had has cost $10.However, food is right up there with music as something that connects people. A taste or smell can unlock a memory you thought you lost forever, or create new ones you&#39;ll never forget. There&#39;s a reason meals are so prominent in movies and literature. Not everyone is lucky enough to have a good relationship with food (in fact, for many, the connotations can be quite negative), and I&#39;m so happy for this person that she loved it.When done right, nice restaurants are an experience. From start to finish, from the food to the drink to the decor to the people, it&#39;s closer to going to a Broadway play or art museum than it is a normal meal.For people who can afford it readily, the experience is almost lost. It can become a status symbol, where the Instagram story is more important than enjoying it. It was so charming to see this through the eyes of someone who had no pretentious goals going into it, and had a wonderful time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was in Italy with my brother back in 2019, we mostly ate at cheap local spots to keep costs down. But towards the end of the trip, I said lets go get some amazing food, regardless of cost.We walked into this little Italian restaurant, ordered an expensive Merlot and a tomahawk steak to share. First the wine, &#34;holy shit&#34; was the exact words I used when I first tasted it, super smooth, to the point where you couldn&#39;t feel even the smallest bit of sting from the alcohol.Then the steak, the tenderest steak I&#39;ve ever had. You cut of pieces of fat and as soon as you put it in your mouth the thing just melts away.In the end dinner set us back 250 euros, and much like this lady, I walked away going &#34;that was worth every penny&#34;. Food like that isn&#39;t just about the experience, it&#39;s also the memory. That dinner I had is now almost 4 years ago but I still remember the wine and the slightly salted steak kisses fingers like an italian"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I do see a point in it working like it does, though. I&#39;m one of the lead developers on a free software project with over 20 years of history. Even though the project has used multiple version control systems (and hosting providers) over time, we have imported our entire project&#39;s history going back to the very  first commit into git and GitHub.Not every contributor has kept their email address for over 20 years. Some don&#39;t have access to the old addresses they once used for commits. Still they want the commits to be associated with their current GitHub account; even if it&#39;s just for statistics and &#34;bragging rights&#34;.If GitHub required email address verification, how would this be done?EDIT: To be clear: With &#34;working like it does&#34; I&#39;m referring to the possibility to add unverified email addresses to your account and have commits attributed to you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In spite of GitHub&#39;s claims that nothing wrong, something is wrong and fixable.GitHub should be showing the identity pulled from the e-mail address, and not replacing it with the name of an associated GitHub account. Just like it does when there is no associated GH account.A reasonable compromise would be to show that name, but turn it into a link to the account if there is one. Then only someone curious clicking on &#34;Linus Torvalds&#34; would see: hey, how come this leads to some VanTudor account?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"GitHub’s response is pretty surprising. How can anyone think this is expected? Having to follow Git’s commit message emails makes sense and indeed anybody can use any email they want to make a commit. But then for GitHub to make the connection between (unverified) commit emails and (unverified) GitHub.com accounts is the issue for me. Since they can’t verify the commit email belongs to a GitHub account, why show that as though it were true?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is an interesting fork of LFS that uses Musl instead of glibc.https://github.com/dslm4515/Musl-LFSI played with it for a while as the base OS for my KVM hypervisor servers.A couple of years ago, I tried to find all the source archives for the old LFS releases. I ended up using the Debian and kernel.org archives to find most of the old package versions. Packages from before 2004 started disappearing like as86 and the PowerPC patches. I was never able to find the PowerPC patches because they were never mirrored on anything but FTP sites. The Internet Archive did not pick up any of those mirrors.
https://archive.org/details/linuxfromscratch-releasesI eventually replaced the Musl-LFS build and replaced it with a buildroot set of configs and scripts when I had issues replicating my work with later package versions. Buildroot allowed me to more rapidly test and deploy my hypervisor config.  I wanted a simple /etc/rc init like what was in SunOS 4, no GRUB, and QEMU with VDE networking.I ended up with SYSLINUX for BIOS MBR and gummiboot(before it was converted into systemd-boot) for EFI because my EFI machine (Dell R810) did not allow for direct booting of EFI binaries."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Appreciate the effort the article author put in, but I&#39;ll be contrarian here (in the hopes of saving people time) and say that I think this is the wrong approach to take to getting hired (the effort:hire ratio is terrible).I don&#39;t know why, whether it&#39;s to be fair or avoid litigation, but in most companies I&#39;ve worked for or interviewed with, the senior engineers, hiring managers, HR, etc. don&#39;t have as much influence over the hiring process as you think. You&#39;ll probably still need to go through 5 stages of interviews, including a white-boarding or a take home test. Otherwise you wouldn&#39;t have all these &#34;rockstar&#34; programmers on Twitter complaining about the interview process. The best that these &#34;influencers&#34; can do for you, is to tip you off to an opening and maybe help towards the end of the interview process.The other issue is, how do you know you&#39;re betting on the right horse? e.g. is the person that you&#39;re getting cozy with really going to help you career? You only have so much time and &#34;connections&#34; to invest.My advice: instead of going to meet ups, take more interviews and improve your interviewing skills. Instead of spending 2-5 hours/week going to meet ups, take 1 interview instead. Even with no preperation, you&#39;ll start to see the pattern in the types of questions people ask. Improve on your answers. Interview again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is probably good general advice for getting comfortable in a crowd and starting conversations, but I doubt such &#34;networking&#34; has as much to do with getting a tech job as people like to think.In my 2+ decades of experience on both sides of tech recruiting, getting your foot in the door is always the easiest part of the process. Apply online at the company&#39;s careers site. Get an existing employee to refer you (literally anyone will be more than happy to do so for the bonus). Message a recruiter on LinkedIn. All of these will get you at least a screening call. From then on 100% of your hiring chances are dependent on your resume and interview performance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s clear to me that the author is introverted as in shy, not introverted as in neurodivergent; there are so many “why don’t you just ____?” and maybe there’s an audience who hasn’t tried that and would adjust well to the advice, but I’m definitely not in that audience.My advice to anyone who feels the same way: let yourself shine, make the social connections that feel comfortable for you, and… hopefully you’ll have the same privilege I have in being able to stand out just by being your awesome self. The job market is competing for you, not the other way around."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I once was part of a now-defunct reading forum in my teens.On the forum, people would package three related books into quests. A boring example would be a dystopian quest pack with three books about three very different dystopian scenarios.But the quests people put together were usually more interesting. I remember a &#34;Weird Magic&#34; quest had books with really unconventional magic systems. I found Motherless Brooklyn (detective with Tourette&#39;s) in a quest pack of &#34;heroes with issues&#34;. Other quest ideas would be evil protagonists, alien first-contact with the wrong guy, and stuff like that. You can often find three books for even the goofiest of quests.It was a cool way to find new books. And whenever you didn&#39;t know what to read next, you&#39;d look at what quests you were still working on and choose among them. Once finished, your completed quest count would increase.Long append-only lists of genre-related books were never as interesting to me. Quests only having three books made them a fun thing to collect. Maybe there&#39;s something fun there that new goodreads competitors can experiment with."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great but I&#39;m not going to sign up just to see what the site looks like. There&#39;s no reason for a large part of the functionality (book info, ratings, reviews) to be behind a login wall. As it stands right now Goodreads is a lot more open."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very interesting... some feedback.So I search for &#34;Proust&#34;, and the top 8 results are not Proust. Since Proust has one extremely famous book, I thought it would show up, rather than a bunch of different commentary on Proust.So I finally find the page for In Search Of Lost Time. However, it says none of my friends have read it. Well, of course not - I don&#39;t have any Booqsi friends yet. So, there&#39;s just nothing I can do on this page.Next I looked for The Power And The Glory. At least this page has a summary of the book. But, also none of my friends read it, and there&#39;s nothing I can do here.Next, Consilience. Same thing. Basically I search for a book, I get maybe nothing, maybe a summary, and then there&#39;s nothing else I can do on that page.So, I want to like this site, but I&#39;m just finding nothing I can do here.Personally, I love books but I hate Goodreads. I just don&#39;t care that a hundred thousand random people prefer The Twilight Saga Complete Collection to The Death of Ivan Ilych.I would be really interested to read a well-written paragraph that said, hey, if you like Nabokov and Borges, then you might like this other author. That sort of recommendation is what I occasionally get from reading blogs or tweets from people with a similar literary taste to mine, and it&#39;s very useful, I find most books through some sort of recommendation.Goodreads has this mistaken idea that I care about the average person&#39;s opinion of a book. A book is not a can opener. Everyone wants to open a can, everyone opens cans in the same way, everyone appreciates a can opener that successfully opens cans.Anyway, I hope you do succeed in building a Goodreads alternative, because I would love to spend more time reading about books, reading good books, discussing books, and Goodreads is just not providing that experience."</p>

Or change all color definitions in the terminal to print the same color?&gt; The terminal is capable of color and should be able to print color when instructed. NO_COLOR is a hint to the software running in the terminal to suppress addition of color, not to the terminal to prevent any color from being shown.I have to admit I don&#39;t really get this. I personally like colorized output, and I can&#39;t even think of situations where the colors chosen by a developer were so bad I wanted to disable them completely.I respect others like no color (and there&#39;s already a solution per that, above), but I don&#39;t quite get the desire to have just some color (prompts but not applications).

The book helped me build a strong foundation in systems; Processes, memory, filesystems, networks, concurrency, synchronization and more. After reading OSTEP, it felt like an epiphany, and I charted a path for the rest of 2 years of college around distributed systems, systems research, and virtualization.And the best part is that all this knowledge is free! Kudos to Professor Remzi and his work!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SICP for CS and programming. That book (and its exercises) really instilled in me the thought patterns that drastically improved my programming skills and made me realize how important fundamental CS knowledge is to being a good programmer. What I learned from that book was: becoming comfortable with recursion, realizing the importance of abstractions, functional programming concepts and it gave me insights into how interpreters and the machine work.I studied math in university and the book that really improved me mathematically was baby rudin. I really struggled with this the first time I worked through it and had to also fall back on Abott&#39;s analysis book, but after my first analysis course I worked through Rudin again and it just clicked. The exercises are really well chosen and the text is just so on point. Every sentence in the book is extremely carefully chosen and of fundamental importance to what Rudin wants to teach you.It&#39;s really rare that you find textbooks that almost kind of have a certain magic to them, like you are directly taught by one of the greatest minds in that field. These two books definitely meet that criteria."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Code, by Charles Petzold. It came to me at exactly the right time, and broke through the biggest conceptual barrier I’d had until that point; how do you actually go from logic gates to general purpose computing? Having Petzold walk you up the ladder of abstraction, never missing a link, really got me over the hump of treating all that complexity as a black box. On a meta level it gave me confidence to go approach apparently impossible things with an open mind and dig deep enough that you see how the “magic” works."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Project Oberon is awesome!I found the Project Oberon book in SFSU library and read it cover to cover.  Such a tight, elegant system.  Pretty much complete: Oberon OS includes compiler for Oberon language!Language was self-hosted (compiler written in itself) and Prof. Wirth had a heuristic: no feature could be added to the lang/compiler if it made compiling the compiler slower.There are several emulators, in C, JS, Java, and Python, and there&#39;s Verilog so you can burn to FPGA and make a real workstation.  People have.The system has two kinds of OOP.  There is the C++/Java/Python/etc. kind where you basically add methods to a record type, and there is the old school Smalltalk message-passing kind, where elements of the OS communicate through an extendable message bus.The GUI system, especially with the &#34;Gadgets&#34; subsystem, is mind-blowing.  It would take too long to go over it at the moment, but there are features there that still haven&#39;t made it into mainstream GUI systems.  If I get a minute later today I&#39;ll come back and add a note detailing some of the awesome if someone else hasn&#39;t already filled in the picture."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This project is still a great example of a complete computer design, starting from Niklaus Wirth&#39;s own RISC5 CPU (not a RISC-V) and very simple peripherals over the OS, runtime/garbage collector, compiler, GUI and simple example applications.One problem of the original implementation is that it was based on an old Xilinx Spartan 3 development board. This is not only no longer available, but it is one of the few FPGA boards that used 32 bit wide fast (12 ns IIRC) asynchronous SRAM chips. Wirth&#39;s hardware design relies heavily on this.Some years ago, there was a compatible board, the OberonStation. However, it seems this is no longer manufactured: https://pcper.com/2015/12/meet-the-oberonstation-kid-friendl...However, some modified designs exist that implement a cache in FPGA block RAM and an SDRAM controller. These can be used with more recent FPGA boards:- FleaFPGA &#34;Ohm&#34; board with a Lattice ECP5  FPGA and 32 MB RAM (https://fleasystems.com/fleaFPGA_Ohm.html) - https://github.com/Basman74/Oberon_SDRAM- Radiona ulx3s, another ECP5 in an open source design  (https://github.com/emard/oberon) - https://github.com/emard/oberon- PapilioPro using a Xilinx Spartan 6 LX, another open source PCB design (https://papilio.cc/index.php?n=Papilio.PapilioPro) - https://opencores.org/projects/oberon_sdramShameless plug: my student Rikke&#39;s port of Project Oberon to RV32I (this is a real RISC-V), however, we still need to find some time to build an FPGA-based SoC.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Context on what I believe they mean by &#34;fraudulent&#34;.Steam back in the day used to accept 0 confirmation bitcoin spends. This means that the transaction has been gossiped on the bitcoin p2p network but had not yet been mined into a block and thus had minimal finality guarantees. Steam could see that they were going to receive a bitcoin payment (when the transaction was mined into a block) and would credit the users account instantly for a better purchase UX.Turns out anyone with some deeper understanding of bitcoin could construct another transaction spending the same bitcoin back to themselves before their original transaction was ever put in a block. The bitcoin community moved away from accepting &#39;0 conf&#39; transactions pretty much everywhere because of this reason.In fact the high fee era (2016-2018) saw many wallets incorporating this &#34;double spend&#34; feature into their wallets. This is known as RBF, &#34;replace by fee&#34; and is really useful when you need to bump your transaction up the queue. You replace your old transaction, that is waiting to be mined, with a new one that offers a higher fee to incentivize miners to add it to a new block.I think its rather unfortunate that 0 conf transactions were written off so quickly. There are many context where a 0conf tx makes sense, mostly IRL. But, if you are running a business online and you don&#39;t trust you customers you should wait 3-6 blocks after the transaction has been mined before delivering your goods."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unfortunately no details were given about what makes 50% of all bitcoin transactions “fraudulent” ?What does that even mean?* did someone try to send something other then bitcoin to a ₿ address?* did a client claim he payed and did the payment seem to fail on his end?* did a client not realise that you as payee also pay for the network fee?Nowadays these kind of problems would be easily prevented by using bitcoin lightning payments, because they work in a fraction of a second and specify the exact amount that has to be payed.
Also they are almost free of transaction costs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There seems to be a basic misunderstanding on the part of the pro-btc ppl here all saying &#34;how is that fraud?&#34; or &#34;how is that steams problem?&#34;If you run a business that can be used in a money laundering scheme, even if you are not a victim, you have a legal responsibility to try to limit/prevent that actually.The crypto crowd may not like that, but it&#39;s not up to them."</p>

Doing it downhole at the end of a long pipe string is going to be much harder than doing it in a factory. So why isn&#39;t this an industrial machining process already, like plasma cutting?GA Drilling was pushing plasma drilling back in 2018.[2] They&#39;re still pushing it, but not making holes.The University of Minnesota was pushing electro-pulse boring in 2015.[3] Again, no deep holes.There&#39;s something called ThermoDrilling, which, despite the name, is more like a water jet cutter.[4]Successful projects are still using mechanical drilling.[5]So there are a lot of deep hole drilling approaches being studied. Anything that works would be used by the oil and gas industry, and if they&#39;re not trying it, one suspects it might not be working.[1] https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270653673_Microwave...[2] https://www.gadrilling.com/[3] https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/electro-pulse-boring...[4] https://www.geodrillinginternational.com/deep-geothermal/new...[5] https://geothermalengineering.co.uk/united-downs/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something I&#39;ve always wondered.Wouldn&#39;t massive scale geothermal end up pumping more heat into the atmosphere that otherwise wouldn&#39;t be there?In contrast, the energy collected by solar and wind generators is from the energy added to Earth by the sun and would be energy in our atmosphere regardless of whether  or not we collect it.But it seems like the heat inside the Earth&#39;s core should be fairly well insulated by the lithosphere, and it only slowly leaks out over time. If we start pulling that energy out at a faster rate to generate electricity, could that have a noticeable net increase on total energy under the atmosphere, or is it such an insignificant amount of energy relative to the sun&#39;s to not even bother worrying about?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something interesting I guess most people don&#39;t know, the pro-ukrainian mobilisations in Poland (I can only speak about Poland) is amazing. My FB wall is full of people providing their apartments for free, giving jobs etc. There is over 100 cars long queue at a border willing to transport Ukrainians escaping war where they want. They can travel by train for free in Poland.Now not so good tidbit. Just few months ago we had a lot of people lured into Belarus by Lukashenko trying to come to Europe. Poland treated them really really poorly. Catching them after crossing border and pushing them back. The society was split among pro-refugees and anti. The political parties almost all focused on &#34;protecting our border&#34;.I was afraid that this natalist sentiment might repeat, even though Ukrainians are one of the closest people to Poland. I am very happy to note I haven&#39;t heard anyone speaking against refugees from Ukraine, not on twitter not on facebook not by far-right parties, altough I am sure some people are silent about their opinions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Portugal is such an awesome country. I love going there and wouldn&#39;t mind staying there a bit longer at some point.More countries should do this; Germany and my home country the Netherlands in particular. I live in Berlin currently as a foreigner (perfect place for that). Lots of people from all over eastern Europe live here, lots of companies here outsource all over eastern Europe, lots of people that I know either come from or have friends/family from the Ukraine. Also, about 200k people of Russian origin live here that chose to move here after the wall fell. And I assume quite a few Ukranians.I remember meeting refugees from the former Yugoslavia in the nineties. I think 25 years later, a lot of those people did pretty well. I actually visited Bosnia for work last summer and met a guy that went to school in Munich. Likewise a lot of Syrian refugees that ended up in Germany seem to be doing OK. Quite a few ended up here in Berlin. In times of war, people are generally grateful if you accommodate them; even if it isn&#39;t always with open arms.It&#39;s usually the smart, free thinkers that need to flee. Incidentally those are also people likely to find a way to make it in life; start businesses; or otherwise be generally successful.The US is full of such people that emigrated there after various wars in the last century. Now is not a time to be xenophobic about this sort of thing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is definitely the last one.&gt;Last, using swift as a weapon against Russia could hurt long-term American interests. America holds sway over international finance thanks to the dollar’s dominance and its pre-eminent role in global settlement systems. Further politicising swift would give China an incentive to bolster cips, its rival to swift for cross-border payments in yuan. It would also help China court any country with uneasy relations with America looking for alternatives.I would imagine there are additional politics in play with disabling SWIFT. I dont how many countries will need to agree before shutting down SWIFT access, if it is at the will of US it would be more like a semi-nuclear option.Although I am already surprised by CIPS, one eighth of transaction volume of SWIFT is not &#34;well behind&#34;. From many POV this already seems like a battle the west are clearly losing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Why the West is reluctant to deny Russian banks access to SWIFT&#34;Because Europe is dependent on Russian gas (thanks to an ill thought out denuclearization drive), and both Europe and US governments prefer their economic and electoral interests over Ukraine or the international order.

That&#39;s what happened in East Aleppo (with the help of the Russian airforce), that&#39;s what happened in Jobar, too. Not sure if the flattening of Kyiv would be the best thing for the Ukranian people going forward.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9ZXPhmR7lQ"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting read. I guess it&#39;s self-evident, but not having thought about the topic, the utility of rubble and repurposing semi-destroyed structures, as well as how important snipers are, were new to me. Maybe the importance of snipers makes civilians being handed out guns in Kyiv now seem less futile.Would be interested to read a basic explainer along these lines on &#34;How to Rebuild a City&#34; -- I guess one divergence from urban planning/development literature would be on how to reuse rubble? Given the many destroyed cities through history including this century which have been at least partially reubilt (perhaps Grozny was first of this century?) I guess there must be plenty written on this topic."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A lot of discussion on this last time it came up:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22341983"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Author here, didn’t expect to see this here again after two years!I guess I’ll give a quick update on how things have been since this article was written. I haven’t used or studied French much since then, and have gotten quite rusty, though I’ve had a few conversations fully in French in the last few months and can still maintain a conversation. I have been thinking of picking up French again soon, as traveling to a French speaking country becomes more of an option.I also did roughly the same thing with my Spanish in the following year, with similar results, though I’d say I probably reached a solid B1.5 or weak B2 after a year (due to COVID I was unable to take the proficiency test and lost some motivation to continue studying to a high level as a result.)My recommendations are still largely the same, though I haven’t used these resources (e.g. Duolingo) since I stopped studying a while back. And as others have noted, for other languages, particularly those that are less closely related to English (e.g. Japanese), you’ll have to follow a different path to achieve the same proficiency. However, language learning resources are getting better constantly, so you can certainly still learn quite a lot without total, in-person immersion, as I did!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I learned Spanish, too, in about 12 months to dogfood my new app for learning vocabulary (which I just recently launched) [0]Even though I made an app that helped me along the way to learn words, I don&#39;t believe in a single app/book/approach for learning a language. You need to expose yourself to A LOT of different language materials.I was learning for about 2h a day, 6 times a week. I would read articles, books, websites in Spanish. I would watch YouTube videos [1]. I would read news, initially for beginners [2] and later regular [3]. And most importantly, I would have 4-5h a week itakly conversations.After 6 months I understood quite a lot, but couldn&#39;t speak almost at all. Then magic happens and 6 months later, I was having a normal conversation (though still with some errors) about any range of topics: politics, global warming, travel, engineering etc.I believe the key for me was to read a lot of books which were interesting to me. For example I read Bill Gate&#39;s book &#34;How To Avoid A Climate Disaster&#34; in Spanish, as well as about ~8 others in the first 12 months.[0] https://www.obstino.com[1] https://www.youtube.com/c/DreamingSpanish[2] www.newsinslowspanish.com[3] https://elpais.com"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I often wonder how money is stored.It can&#39;t be just a number on a computer in a bank, right?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree with the author that custom components don’t capture all the interaction details. Many times they are not accessible or cannot implement cross-platform input well.However, I disagree with:&gt; The browser’s built-in controls are quite sufficient.The problem is that browser components are good for simple forms but insufficient for other types of interaction.A good example is select. Using the select tag is the best way to have a dropdown list that’s accessible and supports mobile. But, select doesn’t cover most of the cases that you need for a complex app.Many of the WAI ARIA authoring examples  (including the combobox patterns) are not covered by built in components. Interaction patterns like pop ups, dialogs, or lookup lists are quite common for an app… but hard to do in an accessible/cross-platform way.Web browsers need to do something different to support accessible/usable apps. The idea of leaving all those things to WebComponents makes sense, but the result is reinventing the broken wheel on each app."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Years ago I worked at a company where many people were using Grammarly. One of the top devs took a look at it, and saw that the text was sent to Grammarly&#39;s server unencrypted and warned everyone not to use it. Some still did.At my previous engagement, a large number of staff spoke English as a second or third language, and Grammarly was prevalent. Even as a native English speaker, they wanted me to use it as a sort of proof reader. I&#39;ll admit that it caught some of my dumber mistakes, but I never felt comfortable using it. I could have proof-read my work better is all. Perhaps if I wasn&#39;t given mind-numbing work, the quality would have been better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think worse than keyloggers is that people are learning how to make the yellow lines in Grammarly go away rather than learning to write better. The training of humans on AI which was trained to be a (dull) average of prior humans has unforeseen consequences. I&#39;ve seen Google grammar suggestions getting worse with time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In Québec we have Antidote. It&#39;s a good &#34;old&#34; piece of software you install on your computer and it integrates with office and other programs to provide _explanations_ of why what you write, looks wrong. No keylogger, no getting dumber. It essentially let&#39;s you either learn why you&#39;re wrong or decide the software is wrong. It used to be French only but they added English too a couple years back. I have no affiliation with Antidote, I just use it everyday."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a huge AMD fan but this is bonkers.Yes, Intel has floundered for a number of years, but at the same time they are a foundry themselves, second only to TSMC (for now), have incredible manufacturing capacity, and seem poised to start pushing interesting CPU designs as well as having their foundry half finally start executing correctly. Also their growth potential for their GPU business is huuuuuuge.As someone who enjoys AMD for the competition they bring, I am worried what the next few years might look like for them for the following reasons:1. AMD GPUs were actually very competitive with their RDNA2 architecture, but at the same time AMD enjoyed a huge silicon advantage as they were on TSMC while NVIDIA was on Samsung (for consumer). The next generation of NVIDIA consumer GPUs will be made by TSMC and if their professional GPUs (see A100 which are made by TSMC) are any indication we can see potentially up to 1.5x to 2x efficiency bump for NVIDIA.2. Intel seems to be cleaning up shop and their latest generation of CPUs feel like a 1st Gen Ryzen moment. Also, Intel does not have to clearly surpass AMD, they just need to be competitive as they can simply out produce AMD given AMDs relatively small allocation at TSMC.3. Intel GPUs pose a moderate threat on the horizon for AMD for both low end and portables and at the same time they are eating up available capacity at TSMC."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just want to clear things up.The reason why AMD is suddenly catching up to Intel in valuation is because of the confirmation / success acquisition of Xilinx. Which triggered the conversion of 250M Xilinx shares to new AMD shares. Adding roughly $40B to its market cap."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something that has gone unmentioned in these comments: Intel has a lot more debt than AMD (38B vs 661M on 12/31). That does affect their comparative market cap by, you know, roughly 37 billion dollars. (give or take some amount related to their credit rating and the very low cost of money right now, I would think, and if you want something to argue about there&#39;s always the fact that Intel has an even better credit rating than AMD...)Intel has much, much more income than AMD and they&#39;re valued similarly by the market and... that is not a mystery.https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC/financials?p=INTChttps://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD/financials?p=AMD"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If I understand this correctly, the FCC has allocated the 4.2GHz-4.4GHz band for radar altimeters. The FCC has also allocated the 3.7GHz-3.98GHz band to 5G. It turns out that the radar altimeters, as manufactured, use spectrum outside their allocated band, down to and including part of the 3.7GHz-3.98GHz 5G band.Am I missing something?If a rancher buys a plot of land from 34.42°N to 34.44°N to graze his cattle on, but in actual fact grazes his cattle all the way from 34.37°N to 34.47°N. Then a farmer buys a plot of land from 34.37°N to 34.398°N to grow wheat on. Does the rancher still get to herd his cattle down to 34.39°N to feed his cattle? The cattle have to eat, after all, and cutting down the grazing land by 30% could cause some cattle to starve to death. And the rancher has a vested financial interest in ensuring his cattle are well fed, and that wheat is good eating. And the rancher has always been grazing his cattle there, what right does the farmer have to till the soil on the racher&#39;s grazing land? And we, the American public, have the right to buy beef. Why should the farmer purchasing 34.37°N to 34.398°N interfere with my ability to buy a steak?Does any of this make any sense to anyone?Unless there&#39;s additional information I&#39;m unaware of, it seems as if the design and/or manufacture of the radar altimeter is not fit for purpose. Using 3.7GHz to 3.98GHz for 5G doesn&#39;t break the radar altimeters; the radar altimeters are already broken and must be fixed or grounded, because the equipment is broken and unsafe.If 5G equipment is emitting outside of its allocated 3.7-3.98GHz spectrum then the FCC needs to drop a brick on that of course."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t know much about aviation or electrical engineering, and I’m wondering if anyone could help me understand something.It seems like the telecom and aviation industries (along with the FCC and FAA) disagree on a question of fact: does 5G equipment interfere with radio altimeters?There’s a way that the FAA could convince me, and probably all the politicians. Shoot a video with a radio altimeter and some 5G equipment where the radio altimeter malfunctions. Put it on YouTube. Do a press release.This seems like an obvious step if the underlying issue exists. Any reason they haven’t done this?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, this along with potential interference problems in weather radar [0], it&#39;s obvious the FCC bungled allocating the 5G spectrum. What a shame that they gave into industry pressure over other practical considerations.However, it doesn&#39;t surprise me that the FAA, which allowed the Boeing 737Max fiasco, is back here coming to Boeing&#39;s defense. What happens when 2 captured regulators collide?Edit: added spacing and changed &#34;radio&#34; to &#34;radar&#34; for clarity[0] https://www.npr.org/2019/07/02/737919100/forecasters-caution..."</p>

					<h3><a href="https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/ukraine-war-flashes-neon-warning-lights-chips-2022-02-24/">Ukraine is a major producer of neon gas, critical for lasers used in chipmaking</a></h3>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve found the reason (I think) 90% of the world&#39;s semiconductor-grade neon production is concentrated in one country. Per this German government whitepaper about the noble gas industry: the USSR massively overinvested in neon capacity in the 1980&#39;s, in order to build space-based excimer laser weapons. Ukraine&#39;s extant plants date (probably) to the 1980&#39;s; they&#39;re responsible for a global oversupply that&#39;s persisted since the Cold War.- &#34;Neon was regarded as a strategic resource in the former Soviet Union, because it was believed to be required for the intended production of laser weapons for missile and satellite defence purposes in the 1980s. Accordingly, all major air separation units in the Soviet Union were equipped with neon, but also krypton and xenon, enrichment facilities or, in some cases, purification plants (cf. Sections  5.4 and 5.5). The domestic Soviet supply of neon was extremely large but demand low.&#34;- &#34;Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, global crude neon production was approximately 500–600  million  l/a  (=  500,000–600,000 m3/a).  It  was dominated by far by large-scale air separation units associated with metallurgical combines in Russia and Ukraine. Simultaneously, demand was estimated at around 300 million l/a (cf. Section 4.2). In the years between 1990 and 2012, therefore,  most crude  neon was not  purified, but  released into the atmosphere, because there was no customer base.&#34;https://www.deutsche-rohstoffagentur.de/DE/Gemeinsames/Produ... (chapter 5.2)For context, this would have overlapped with Energia/Buran&#39;s launch of the Polyus weapon (which was a megawatt CO2 laser).https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyus_(spacecraft)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How is neon extracted and why does one country have a 90% monopoly (in this specific grade)?edit: Found this C&amp;EN story from 2016 that adds context:- &#34;Chip makers, which account for more than 90% of global neon consumption, are already experiencing high prices and some shortages stemming from the Russian conflict with Ukraine, Shon-Roy says. The war, which started in 2014, interrupted global supplies of the gas, about 70% of which comes from Iceblick, a firm based in the Ukrainian city of Odessa.&#34;- &#34;Iceblick gathers and purifies neon from large cryogenic air separation units that supply oxygen and nitrogen to steelmakers. Most of the air separation units equipped to capture neon, which makes up only 18.2 ppm of the atmosphere by volume, are in Eastern Europe.&#34;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cen-09410-notw7This is puzzling to me, because I don&#39;t get why air separation should naturally concentrate in exactly one place. It&#39;s not tied to a rare and localized geologic formation, like helium sort-of is.Also there&#39;s cryogenic air separation plants all over the planet, why don&#39;t they do neon too? (Asking in the spirit of curiosity)edit #2: I&#39;ve just found something that offers a possible explanation and it&#39;s far more interesting than I expected:- &#34;Neon was regarded as a strategic resource in the former Soviet Union, because it was believed to be required for the intended production of laser weapons for missile and satellite defence purposes in the 1980s. Accordingly, all major air separation units in the Soviet Union were equipped with neon, but also krypton and xenon, enrichment facilities or, in some cases, purification plants (cf.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"We should be talking about grain, not gas.Russia is the biggest exporter of wheat in the world with 18%. Ukraine accounts for 7% of the world&#39;s wheat.https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/17/infographic-russia-...This conflict will affect 1/4 of the world&#39;s wheat which will affect food prices.In 2010 Russia stopped exporting wheat due to wildfires burning their fields (most likely caused by climate change). This caused a hike in food prices which helped trigger the Arab revolutions in 2011.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Russian_wildfires"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m in downtown Kharkiv, Ukraine right now (SaaS founder born in Canada). Woke up to explosions at 5 AM this morning. At 12PM still some explosions, can feel the ground shaking, but the streets are mostly calm. Went out to buy some groceries, long lines, but everything still works. Police cars are out patrolling in full force, but no signs of unrest. Church bells tolling nonstop. TransferWise is limited to $200 USD transfers but it worked -- Apple Pay worked at the grocery store. Obviously internet and electricity is still up for now, but water pipes have been shut off in many of my friend&#39;s places."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From a philosophical stance, this is history repeating for the same basic reason. 2022 AD and risk of war is still the same as it was in 1022 AD, or 22 AD. That reason is the accumulation of power (or by proxy, wealth) in a small set of individuals, or in this case one person. No realtime access to information changes this; it just makes the story of the horror unfold faster.Persisting with the concentration of power in individuals has shown throughout history to have dire consequence. We continue risking civilization on the mental health of those who already show significant issues with their obsessive clammer for power. The cult of the leader is toxic and, as far as I can see, illogical and lacking evidence for benefit.Where are the voices that seek a structured shift away from personality cult politics? The innovation we all need for the future are those voices."</p>

So still very impressive, but Magnus loses games online all the time and I&#39;m not _quite_ sure why this is news.It is interesting which junior players Magnus invited to the tournament, though - besides Praggnanandhaa, there&#39;s also Andrey Esipenko, who _did_ beat Magnus in a classical game once at the prestigious Tata Steel Masters 2021, and also Nodirbek Abdusattorov, who beat Magnus late last year en route to becoming the World Rapid Champion at 17 years old. A fun group! With Vincent Keymer in the mix too, you&#39;re only really missing Nihal Sarin and (of course) Firouzja for many of the future faces of chess.[Edit: the article says that Praggnanandhaa is the youngest player ever to beat Magnus since 2013, which would definitely be newsworthy. I think the article must be leaving out important context, since this tournament is (1) online, (2) speed chess and (3) not FIDE rated, so it typically wouldn&#39;t be included in records, and Magnus has almost certainly lost random online games to younger players before. I&#39;m guessing the article is referencing some other source without providing the relevant criteria, which is why it looked a little weird to me.]"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is noted in another comment, but it should be a top level comment... Magnus actively has COVID and has said that it was affecting his energy levels and ability to calculate during the early rounds of the tournament (during which this game happened).And Pragg wasn&#39;t even the lowest rated player to beat Magnus this tournament! Eric Hansen, aka popular chess streamer &#34;chessbrah&#34;, is even lower rated and also beat Magnus, which again you would not expect if Magnus were playing his usual level.So still a great win and great accomplishment for Pragg, but a little context would have been nice in the article."</p>

Looks like, all people who got to government or state organizations, work on classical totalitarian scheme - &#34;for friends all the best, for all others - severity of the law&#34;.
Mean, system is so much disbalanced, that any government got totalitarian power and does not account on people. And laws are created, to make all people offenders, and with very wide possibilities of interpretation, so state officials and their friends become above law.If you really want to help Ukraine, better to contact volunteers-entrepreneurs, who where on Maidan, and who struggle for economic freedoms, and support Ukrainian army as private persons, without government/state.You could just donate, or you could create some business opportunity, so Ukrainians will make business, export working hours, or export some products to world.Business opportunities much better, because Ukraine now have critically huge dependence on Russian market, close to 50% of all trade, need much-much more export to world.Thank You!"</p>

Our apps are gleaned by blogs looking for scoops on upcoming features.I once interviewed at a major airline (not United) and at the time they had outsourced their entire app and web to some foreign companies, including any and all oversight. Their app was a POS and they had hired someone to write a new one -- the same company. Now they had no idea why it was so delayed so they wanted to hire someone to embed in the other company to spy on what was going on. Of course I wanted nothing to do with this travesty.

Without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be a Eurasian empire.”“However, if Moscow regains control over Ukraine, with its 52 million people and major resources as well as access to the Black Sea, Russia automatically again regains the wherewithal to become a powerful imperial state, spanning Europe and Asia.”"</p>

Russia understood this before invading, right? So it seems Russia is accepting a high risk of loss.But it doesn&#39;t make sense that a nation as sophisticated as Russia would accept such a high risk of loss. Which means that they might actually believe the risk of NATO intervention is low.How could the risk be low without some kind of collusion or hidden knowledge (hidden from us common folk)?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks like a decent deal looking deeper into it.Things that weren&#39;t obvious on first pass:(1) The VR specs are much higher than consumer level.  I suspect this is what makes it reasonable to read text on it.  The comparison headset is this: https://varjo.com/products/aero/  (They named it, but didn&#39;t google it)(2) They said &#34;VR Computer&#34; but don&#39;t define the term.  They mean that it&#39;s a full PC with a headset instead of a regular display.  Oddly they don&#39;t include a mouse or keyboard.My feedback for Simula one:(0) The value proposition here is (a) the included equipment and (b) the software.  They together have to justify the price at some level.(1) You have to really push the point that this is a full computer, not another headset.  I suggest you include a keyboard/mouse, and include it in the pictures with the headset (the pictures with just the headset, not the ones with the people).  Perhaps a keyboard with a trackpad.(2) Show that the headset is substantially higher-spec than the consumer ones.  Show a comparison chart.(3) Dump the AR coffee shop video.  Show AR in a home office.  Don&#39;t assume/require that your customers are that VR gun-ho.(4) Show more than a bunch of shells in the VR screenshots.  I can alt-tab as fast as I can move my head, with less work.  If this is your underlying value proposition, it sucks.  I&#39;m sorry.  If you have something more interesting, like a combined VR/app environment, then it can work.(4.1) Is there some useful interactions between 3D visualization and high-quality small-text rendering?  If you have good VR/3D developer stories, then this can work.(5) Simula One - is it Ubuntu with a 3d window manager and custom rendering stack?  Does it do anything else?  Does it just make a (claustrophobic) shell of windows around the user in VR?(5.1) Are there any integrations with anything?  Like https://blog.jupyter.org/ipygany-jupyter-into-the-third-dime... ipygany?(5.2) What do you expect people to do with it?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see people have issues with the price tag, and while it is by no mean cheap, since it&#39;s actually a full blown computer AND a VR headset all in one, it is somewhat justified.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The code design is also very elegant in its simplicity.You have two static lists of words in the JS code - known words, and a smaller, random pre-shuffled list of words the game will select from.The selection is done on the client, by date, from the second list - every day at midnight (your local time!) the next word in the pre-shuffled list is selected - no hashing or randomizing or anything. No cookies are involved in making you play one game per day, no server side calls are involved in gameplay at all. And yes, this means that changing your time zone will let you play tomorrow&#39;s game, and that you can just view source to know tomorrow&#39;s word - it appears right after today&#39;s word in the code.This is so counter to how we usually design software in so many ways, it&#39;s just delightful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually think the OP and the comments are too focused on the programmer-related aspects of this. I&#39;ll add a few things.1. It&#39;s not trivial but it&#39;s not that hard if you have a decent vocabulary and some intuitive sense for word frequencies (and word pair frequencies) for different locations in a word. The answer list does not seem to include really hard words as naively picking all the words in the MW dictionary would be. It&#39;s a fun 10-15 minute puzzle.2. Five letter seems like something of a sweet spot.3. The answer word list does not appear to have a lot of plurals or common vowel endings for past tense, etc. Or obscure words.4. It lends itself to what I&#39;ll casual cheating, i.e. there are easy ways to get some hints without giving the answers away while focusing on a strategy.5. Basically, it&#39;s got good gameplay for a casual game. It would be easy to build something along similar lines that didn&#39;t have as fun gameplay for a casual gamer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One more factor in Wordle&#39;s popularity that I haven&#39;t yet seen commentators identify much. The game&#39;s word roster tilts heavily toward words with neutral or cheerful connotations.So your brain conjures up something happy at the end. You don&#39;t slog through the puzzle solving to end up with VIRUS, ENNUI, GRIEF, SLAVE, INANE or other such morose words.Instead, we get the likes of AWAKE, BLUSH, FOCAL, etc. That helps make the game a mood-stabilizer or even brightener. We&#39;re usually clever enough to find a solution most days. When we&#39;re slow and need all six turns, we get a cheery &#34;Whew!&#34; to console us. It&#39;s a simple, barely noticeable bit of gamification at its nicest."</p>

If you have an upstream that you specify with a hostname, nginx will lookup the host, cache it, and never refresh it by default.I don&#39;t know why it happens to me so often, but I will set up nginx containers that proxy to some load balanced service (via DNS), and then one day the IPs will change and that service would break because I forgot to set resolver."</p>

In the first week, he had battery drain issues. Even when he put it to sleep, it would drain the battery. He had to keep it plugged in at all times. He tried few distros (including the older version of Ubuntu they recommend) and the problems persisted. His screen also had issues and colors would slightly shift. I lent him my colorimeter and he said the monitor would lose calibration after several days. He also complained about trackpad not tracking his finger properly. In the end, he returned it. I think he said you have 30 days to return it.Hope they fix these issues."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I kinda feel bad for Docker. The prevailing wisdom seems to be that you shouldn&#39;t be using Docker anymore, use Podman. Often the reasons for this is that Podman is daemonless, supports rootless containers, etc. But I feel this is misplaced:- The Docker daemon is actually really useful. It can run containers as other users, perform a bunch of mounting and networking stuff you can&#39;t do as rootless (or at least requires some hacky workarounds), and can monitor/maintain your containers. Podman can do lots of this as well, but requires the use of systemd. So in those cases you&#39;ve just swapped one daemon for another.- For most of my use cases, I don&#39;t really care about rootless. On servers I run all my docker containers as non-root anyway, and if I&#39;m on a workstation I have privileges and don&#39;t need rootless.- Although Podman claims compatibility with Docker, I&#39;ve always found issues with trying to use it even up to a few months ago, prior to this release. Mostly when trying to use compose, although it does improve every release.I basically just view the Docker daemon as an init system like systemd. It&#39;s a privileged daemon that runs other processes. But for some reason it seems to have been made into a bogeyman."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really like Podman, and I&#39;m happy to see this new release. This little nugget about non-released features makes me most excited though:&gt; More features, including support for volume mounts from the host, are planned for Podman v4.1, so stay tuned for more updates.IIUC host volume mounts for podman-machine are the last major missing feature in Podman that would allow something like Podman Desktop Companion [1] to replace Docker Desktop on Windows/Mac for most use cases - if it works well. It&#39;d be great to replace that nagging-for-updates and nagging-for-subscriptions with a completely open source replacement tool. (I&#39;m sympathetic to the Docker team in need of a revenue source, but I&#39;m really happy OCI containers on Mac and Windows can be made accessible without vendor lock-in).[1]: https://iongion.github.io/podman-desktop-companion/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there an eli5 or similar on the differences between podman / docker / rancher / others?Feels unexplained (at least for me), how do I know which to choose when and what are the trade offs?I recently went deeper on Rancher Desktop and it’s use of containerd vs dockerd backends and it is totally not obvious what you lose if not using dockerd and how you might fill the gaps. Feels like because docker established the space and put a bunch of related components together (cli, image building, image storing and container running) and other projects make difference choices it can be quite confusing to compare them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the article:&#34;I often encountered videos that were uploaded again and again, no matter how many times I removed them. One day, a woman emailed me, calmly explained that her ex-boyfriend had uploaded a video of them having sex, and asked me to remove it. I deleted the clip. Later that week, it was re-uploaded. The woman wrote again, I removed it, and this continued for months; I must have pulled the same video down a dozen times. This was before I had ever heard the term “revenge porn.”Requests like this were not uncommon. Once, a woman wrote to say there was a video of her on Tube8 that showed her being sexually assaulted after someone spiked her drink at a party. The video had tens of thousands of views, so I had to review it before making the call to remove it. In the clip, the woman is clearly high, laughing and head lolling, having sex on a bed surrounded by fully dressed people holding drinks and watching as colored lights flashed and music blared in the background. I took it down, but it was uploaded again repeatedly in the following months. Each time, the mortified woman flagged it, and each time, I removed it; both of us were aware that there was nothing we could do to stop the clip from resurfacing.&#34;I have read the same thing from Facebook content moderators.  They got so frustrated at having to watch and take down the same videos over and over.This seems to be such a simple problem to solve:  record a hash of the video file, don&#39;t allow uploading it again.  That would probably get rid of most re-posting.It could be bypassed by modifying the file slightly, but the hashing could also get more sophisticated.  At some point, an ex-boyfriend is not likely to want to keep modifying a video to piss off his ex."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Be careful working in this field (pornography). In 2017 I wrote a mildly pornographic app (http://driftwheeler.com) and it appears on my resume. When hiring managers or recruiters take a look, some of them get upset.For example, a scheduled interview was abruptly cancelled the night before. I pursued the matter through a friend who had a senior role at the hiring company and it was determined that the (middle-aged female) in-house recruiter had been deeply offended when she followed the link on my resume and had cancelled everything. Eventually, I received a sincere apology from the CEO.There is a real stigma, and it will affect you. Beware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; One day, I received inquiries from journalists looking to find out more about Manwin. Believing it was a major threat, I sent off a panicked email to the owner of the company and some vice presidents. My bosses were stunned, and not in a good way. Corey, the guy who had originally hired me, marched me into an office, and I nearly got canned. They had mercy on me. I think they could tell that I was trying to protect the company in my own overzealous, entirely inappropriate way. It was true — I felt like part of a team and wanted to do my best for them. But I had blown it.&gt; After that, with my reputation tarnished, my fortunes at the company started to dwindle.That seems wrong to me, but I&#39;m interested in other people&#39;s responses. It doesn&#39;t seem like &#39;blowing it&#39; at all. How many companies have problems with employees that are too motivated?First, afaik, CEOs generally work to have open lines of communication with their lower level employees - the problem is people not paying attention, not communicating important information, or it getting filtered by the interests of layers in between. Second, Manwin can&#39;t be that big a company. It&#39;s not like emailing the CEO of Microsoft, who has &gt;100,000 people working for them (and again, wouldn&#39;t Satya Nadella just say - &#39;hey, thanks for keeping a sharp eye out and for the heads up. It may look bad, but we&#39;ve seen it many times before. I&#39;m going to forward this to corporate communications, who can handle these things astutely.&#39;)Maybe other companies are just different than the ones I&#39;ve seen."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I fully agree with this. Scanning Google News or a couple of the more professional international news services like BBC / Al Jazeera / Reuters I still feel pretty well informed (and confident that there&#39;s usually nothing of immediate consequence to me) but it doesn&#39;t grow into &#34;expert analysis&#34; or impact my feelings much. Here&#39;s another thing I noticed: how manipulated / manipulative it is. And not just news and I don&#39;t just mean politically - I know everyone thinks that news that doesn&#39;t align with their politics is just brainwashing. Broadcast TV is just generally awful now IMO.We went quite a few years without ever seeing cable. My kids would stream shows and consume other media on-demand, but any advertising was minimal and fairly non-intrusive. And then they were watching a kids show at a hotel once and the ads came on and the effect it had on them was crazy. They suddenly desperately needed all the toys in the commercials and were repeating catch phrases from ads after only seeing them a couple of times. The contrast in their behavior was insane. And they HAD to keep watching it like I hadn&#39;t seen before. I spent a week off-grid with my parents a while back and it was great. We came home and my Mom put on the news suddenly everything was terrible and she was angry, but she had to keep watching.Just awful for mental health if you can&#39;t separate yourself from it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who just stepped back into pop culture after being in prison for years (so might as well been on the moon) my first shock was just how horrible it all is now. There is no news worth watching. Cable news is just a pile of filth excremented by a Labrador Retriever that solely eats baby diapers. I thought I will watch Bloomberg since if real money is involved it can&#39;t be too manipulative. Nope, wrong. The internet is just a fireheap. Let&#39;s check Reddit. Oh god close the browser window immediately. WTF? Slashdot? Um, what is this, someone wearing a Slashdot skin suit? How about the sites by supposedly rational academics on each side of the political persuasion to get some balance. WTF? Just hate and anger and toxicity on a crazy level otherizing any opinion not their own. People are once thought great intellectual insides making incredibly uncharitable frankly hate filled comments and self isolating in echo chambers. Google Discovery app... &#34;here&#39;s some blog posts summarizing relationship posts made on Reddit&#34;. Huh? Why would anyone want to read this let alone have it further aggregated for them? Seriously, modern American discourse has less humanity, compassion, depth, and recognition of nuance THAN PRISON. Or maybe prison just made me less patient of bull crap and able to immediate horrible people by their mannerisms. Seriously this site is the only place I have found still sane and enlightening."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I strongly agree with this. I would, however, like to call out one TV program here in the U.S. that I think comes much closer to approximating the experience of “reading a 5,000-word article”: PBS NewsHour. It’s great, completely free and available to watch online, and you can even get most of what you need from their podcast alone (https://www.pbs.org/newshour/feeds/rss/podcasts/segments).It consists of fairly in-depth, thoughtful coverage of both domestic and worldwide news topics, as well as a tiny bit of political analysis on Mondays and Fridays. It almost never devolves into the breathless, “the world is about to end”-type coverage found on basically all cable news programs. Judy Woodruff and her team are really great. I dearly miss Gwen Ifill and Jim Lehrer.The Economist is also a great resource, as has been pointed out by other commenters here. They publish an audio edition of each week’s newspaper, too."</p>

Take it from them: https://www.samsung.com/us/business/samsungads/resources/tv-... and https://www.samsung.com/us/business/samsungads/insights/You&#39;re not their customer, you&#39;re the product.Additionally, Samsung have a habit of releasing forced updates that almost-but-not-entirely brick their TVs, slowing them down to molasses. They do this right before the next model becomes available for purchase.Last but not least, a colleague worked there as a consultant, and his stories of their lax IT security were nearly unbelievable. Even though they spy on you like Google or Facebook, they are not like a FAANG when it comes to protecting your private info! They&#39;ve been hacked for sure, probably by multiple nation state actors. Whatever you watch or do with their TVs is being relayed to the US, Russians, Chinese, or whomever. Assume that nothing you do with a Samsung device or Samsung software is remotely secure or safe.They&#39;re a slimy company made up of unscrupulous people trying to squeeze every last drop out of every rock.Don&#39;t give them your money. There are many other companies with much better track records."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am truly, deeply, unsurprised that foldable phones fail along the seam.I know that&#39;s not the point of the post, and I&#39;m not blaming the author. It just seems like such a ridiculous concept in the first place. My old flip phone had its own problems, and there wasn&#39;t even a display along the seam."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So the author had a folding phone that failed and couldn&#39;t get it repaired/replaced. The narrow take is that you&#39;re kinda crazy to buy a folding phone but Samsung was selling them so is really on the hook for the inevitable issues.The story of getting it fixed is really why people love Apple and even Amazon.I&#39;ve had the Wifi go unreliable on an iPad. I got a Genius appointment for later that day. They confirmed the Wifi module was shot and just gave me a new device on the spot. They even offered to do the transfer for me. This sort of convenience is what gives people confidence in buying Apple products.Even something as simple as accessory access matters. If my Macbook charger dies, I can walk into any number of stores and buy another. Dell charger? Not so much.Amazon has pretty accurate shipping estimates. This matters. So does Apple for the record. Just last week I got sent the wrong product. I didn&#39;t have to talk to anyone on the phone. I simply went to my order on my phone and clicked &#34;return item&#34; -&gt; &#34;wrong product&#34; and the entire matter was dealt with.I don&#39;t want to deal with support that is deliberately hard to contact that is monetarily motivated to not do anything for you."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I changed careers at 40+ years old.  I&#39;m very happy that I did it.People have all sorts of constructs / ideas about how careers work (based on experience) or how they think it works, or how they want it to work.   I talk to some college graduates who tell me what they&#39;re planning for and have ZERO clue what industry they&#39;re talking about, their description is unrecognizable to me ... even tho I know it is the one I work in.I find your experience and paths can vary greatly company to company, even job to job.We all find truths we want to hold on to about work.   I recall trips to the valley where my coworkers where astonished to hear tales of people doing the same work they did, but doing it slightly differently elsewhere in the country.  Their view of how that job was done was entirely shaped by the couple places they worked (and everyone seemed to cycle through those couple companies).   You&#39;d think these folks though that if you didn&#39;t fill out the TPS report right to left that the world would end... I&#39;m pretty sure the vast majority of people fill them out left to right but I didn&#39;t feel like telling them that, it might have been too much for them to handle.&#34;
I think there are three main kinds of career destination, at least in the tech industry:    Independent
    Senior individual contributor (IC)
    Management
&#34;I have no idea why those are the only destinations ... for an article worried about being happy that seems kind of limited.The whole article feels very pie in the sky to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;It&#39;s not surprising, then, that many of us find ourselves in less than fully satisfying jobs, with doubtful or non-existent prospects for advancement.&#34;Very true. I can&#39;t wait for my career to be over. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever find the position where I feel I belong, so I&#39;ll just be miserable anywhere now that I know how broken the system really is."</p>

Also volunteering/open source but mostly, not doing things I don&#39;t want to do any more. Yep, I don&#39;t want to be &#34;incredibly excited&#34; about the &#34;next growth chapter of my life&#34; - I just want to live my life in a non-agile way without sprinting towards the end of it.

I&#39;m not sure why it needs to be made over and over again, but it seems that&#39;s the only way it doesn&#39;t get buried.Let&#39;s play a game. I will be the institution, you will be the person. You will get ability to record me with your cellphone and post stuff online to complain about various issues. I will get the ability to see all your financial transactions, listen to all your communications, track your location, arrest you when I don&#39;t like you recording me, smear you online and pressure companies to ban you from literally any service imaginable, including banking.Both of us will be bound by the legal framework, but when I don&#39;t like it, I will have the ability declare the state of emergency and scrap all the rules. Also, I will have sovereign immunity when I break the rules. Also, many of my actions will be secret because of national security.Oh, and I will be doing all the things described above using your money.Sounds fair?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Exactly correct.Anyone who is applauding this, just imagine the opposite political party in power using this against you or organizations you support.  This is why no one should have been happy when executive orders became the norm in the US and congress did nothing.  This is how you lose a senate and gain a Caesar, and look what happen to Rome eventually…Debanking someone who can now no longer pay for thier own defense is crazy overreach.  Absolute power corrupts absolutely."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The simple answer is to reject the cashless society.In the medium to long term it&#39;s simply incompatible with any reasonable definition of freedom. Surveillance is bad enough, but a system that allows governments to arbitrarily &#34;turn off&#34; thousands or millions of people at the push of a button is too powerful to not be abused.Even the mere existence of such a system has a chilling effect. Which I suspect is precisely what these people want and is exactly why we can&#39;t give it to them.I&#39;ll take inconvenience over slavery any day of the week.This isn&#39;t some sort of anarcho-libertarian paradise opinion, I have no issue with there being a well functioning justice system.But yeah, if you want to seize assets, get a court order and go and lock someone in a box and take their things, don&#39;t take the cowardly way out and pretend that you&#39;ve just flipped a database key and it&#39;s not really a big deal.By the same token, if you tell me there&#39;s been a murder on my street I&#39;ll give you the CCTV footage of my door cam. If you ask me for a backdoor, I&#39;ll tell you where to shove it. That&#39;s what being a member of a free society is, that seemingly minor distinction is one of the most important things we have and better minds than mine have sought to elaborate on why.Even a child is able to understand that force is still force regardless of whether it involves the direct visible physical kind."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had the chance to work with a few people I&#39;d consider genius level.  While I&#39;m pretty smart myself, they all have something I don&#39;t always have:  The ability to be happy in any situation and interested in everything.For example, we were walking trough a hallway. On a wall is an old, damaged, ugly map of my country, half covered with graffiti.  I&#39;d walked past it almost every day for half a year.He checks it out, and starts noticing a lot of semi-interesting factoids about names, merged cities, obscure places, old mapping conventions, etc...  All of this with an absolute positive energy of pure interest.  We spent a fun hour just looking at it.  I should have known all this, and yet an hour with him makes me look at it with new eyes.Wherever he was, he instantly attracted a group of friends and wannabe girlfriends, and never really seemed to notice.  Same in this case:  There was a group of beautiful partygirls we&#39;d never met before, no nerdy interests at all, which accreted around the map in less than 5 minutes. They loved the situation just as much as us nerds did.I learned a lot from him, and try to follow this example, but I still can&#39;t do this today and am humiliated (in a positive way) by this way of living."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; we suggest that leaders follow the science and take a structured approach to hiring for, promoting, and developing employee happiness&gt; Measure happiness in both employees and job candidates.&gt; we conservatively advocate using measures of happiness and optimism as discriminators, or tiebreakers, because the risks are low and the benefits could be important.Good luck getting a job, unhappy people…I don’t think they have the evidence to make this recommendation, since they surveyed people already employed (by the US army), who may have been unhappier pre employment.&gt; might dismiss these results if you believe that military data somehow doesn’t apply to the business world, but you would be wrong to do so. After all, the U.S. Department of Defense is the single largest employer in the worldTheir entire argument for this also applying outside the military domain seems to be that the military is a very large employer… However, is not the military a vastly different environment from normal civilian workplaces?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reading these comments is forehead slap inducing. People think that just because something is mental that it has to do with your mindset, your parents, your this your that.When a dude can run faster than other people, it’s written off as genetics. When someone is resilient to depression, it’s anything other than genetics. Both cases are the same: it’s just biological.I’ve been suffering super hard with depression recently and it’s made something clear to me: your mindset is bullshit. It might tip things one way or another but the actual mechanisms of depression will change your life. Everyone will be super humbled when we figure out how to turn off depression, and everyone gets it and everyone experienced on average a 50% boost to their intelligence and productivity. They will be humbled because they will realize that all of that relative suffering was totally pointless and for no other reason than a quirk of evolution. And that some people had it good for absolutely no reason. But it’s exciting to know that this day will come and it can’t come fast enough for me!"</p>

   C current instruction name.
   I the input from the current tape position. Either 0 or 1. Each instruction has 
   execution parameters for both inputs.
   W the output to be written to the tape at the current position. Either 0 or 1.
   M the movement of the read/write head. A 0 moves the head one position to the 
   left. A 1 moves it to the right.
   N the name of the next instruction to be executed at the new tape position.

Would it have been clearer to use &#34;&lt;&#34; or &#34;&gt;&#34; to specify whether to move left/right from the current position?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve seen a lot of commentary about the fact that the Emergencies Act provisions &#34;expire&#34; automatically after 30 days, and include &#34;safeguards&#34;, ergo there&#39;s nothing worry about. People getting hung up on the text of the bill forget that it&#39;s merely an Act of Parliament, and thus can easily be amended or replaced via a simple majority vote.What played out last night indicates that none of these checks and balances really matter in a parliamentary system where the nuclear option of a non-confidence vote (and subsequent election) can be invoked to force any MPs with qualms to vote along party lines.It&#39;s easy to see what will happen next, based on this government&#39;s track record: they will introduce amendments to the Act, or new legislation containing only the provisions they would like to make permanent, and once again proclaim that voting against the amendment will result in a new election.They will probably also use it as an excuse to ram through their &#34;Online Harms Bill&#34;, i.e. internet censorship, targeted at &#34;misinformation&#34; (disagreeable speech) and, many suspect, independent media outlets that the PM despises.Internet censorship + government-directed financial de-platforming = Canada&#39;s near-term future if the situation doesn&#39;t change somehow."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Occupy Wall Street was started by a group of organized Canadians and they blocked access to NYSE facilities. OWS was obviously an occupation (it’s right there in the name), but the better question is: was OWS a protest, too? If so, why can’t this be called one as well?There are generally more parallels between OWS and the truckers than people are willing to recognize, because there’s been a hell of an inversion: if you supported OWS 10 years ago you probably don’t like the truckers today and if you like the truckers you probably weren’t for OWS 10 years ago. There are a handful of Tim Pools that like both, and there are elites that disliked both, but the average person has to do some gymnastics.All that I ask is that everyone is consistent: if OWS is a protest, then this is too. If you don’t like that Americans funded the truckers, you have to be willing to call out that OWS took place in NYC but formed from a Canadian nonprofit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A related report from the BBC (published a few days ago):Europe gas prices: How far is Russia responsible? https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/58888451Some key points in the BBC article:- Russia supplies about 40% of the EU’s natural gas imports. Most of the rest comes from Norway and Algeria.- Russia sends gas to Europe through several main pipelines - such as the Nord Stream, the Yamal-Europe and the Brotherhood (see the map in the article).- Overall, Russian gas exports to Europe have been decreasing over the last couple of years - down 32% in February this year compared to February 2020. One factor - during the pandemic - has been falling demand as economic activity shrank. Stocks of gas across Europe have been depleted, which in turn is driving up prices.- Gazprom, Russia&#39;s majority state-owned energy company, supplies gas to Europe under two different arrangements: 1. Long-term contracts often lasting from 10 to 25 years. 2. &#34;Spot&#34; deals or one-off purchases for a fixed amount of gas.- It is understood that Gazprom met its obligations to European buyers last year under these contracts.- &#34;Spot&#34; sales don&#39;t appear to be happening in any significant quantity, going by data from Gazprom&#39;s own electronic sales platform.- The International Energy Agency&#39;s executive director, Fatih Birol, has accused Russia of reducing gas supplies to Europe for political purposes.- Gas storage across Europe is well below the 10-year average, with levels currently at about 75% of storage capacity, according to Gas Infrastructure Europe data."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That is not remotely pulling the plug. This is &#34;thinking about it&#34; again. They already stopped accreditation a few weeks ago, otherwise it would already transport gas as the pipeline is already filled. They just say that they have officially stopped the process which they more or less already did. I think in a year it might come online again if the news cycle is on another topic.Overall it will be much more expensive for Europe than for Russia. Who do you think will profit the most if gas prices hike?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s some quick numbers I just googled to understand the big picture.This pipeline has an annual capacity of 55 billion cubic meters. It&#39;s the same capacity as the Nord Stream 1, which is already in operation. If Germany was truly meaning business, they&#39;d stop Nord Stream 1 the moment Russian boots enter Ukrainian territory. But let&#39;s leave that aside.55 billion cubic meters translate to about 0.6 billion MWh. The price today for natural gas Dutch TTF futures is EUR 78/MWh [1] , so that translates in about 40 billion EUR per year.  It has been as low as EUR 13 and as high as EUR 165 over the last 2 years. It&#39;s quite likely that Russia would make a profit even at the lower range, so the 40 billion EUR/year is pretty much pure profit for them.[1] https://www.theice.com/products/27996665/Dutch-TTF-Gas-Futur..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thank goodness. Bethesda&#39;s launcher was uniquely awful in a number of unpleasant ways. Slow, prone to crashes, bad user communication, not suitable for use on small monitors. The worst of the launcher apps I have used - and there are so many!I remember when it was in vogue for every game maker to build their own launcher or even full Steam clone - when EA pulled all its new games from Steam to get people to use Origin, when Ubisoft forced uPlay on you no matter how you bought the game, and so on. Now, it seems like we&#39;re pulling back from that situation somewhat - a lot of EA games are back on Steam, for example.I wonder whether the experiment didn&#39;t work, or if it worked, but now the goals have changed again?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there a technical reason why Steam is a such a force in the space? People, myself certainly included, often criticize Apple for taking 30% of developer revenue for merely existing in it&#39;s walled garden. Right or wrong, they control the ecosystem, so their ability to monopolize and heavily tax the App Store is unsurprising, they&#39;re exercising their pricing power as much as they possibly can.But how is it that on PC, where we have a mostly open field on which anyone can participate freely without a gatekeeper&#39;s blessing, Steam managed to consolidate so much of the gaming marketplace that even a titan like Microsoft is throwing the towel and bowing to Steam&#39;s cartelish 30%? I get that being the dominant two-sided marketplace of a given space is a strong network effect and moat, and consolidation is certainly convenient for users (I like having all my purchased games on a single account), but intuition tells me Bethesda doesn&#39;t need Steam&#39;s exposure to sell games or make new arrivals known (their announcement will go viral regardless), similarly to Riot, Mojang, Epic and co not listing on Steam. So I&#39;ve always found it surprising they were dual listing their games in the first place, but the fact they&#39;re now entirely giving up on direct selling is a testament to Steam&#39;s might in the gaming industry.Is Steam&#39;s product particularly good and hard to reproduce from the publisher&#39;s PoV, even one backed by Microsoft, to the extent it is hard to compete against with something like Microsoft Store? Or is this just another case of being early enough to establish the initial brand and let the self-fulfilling network effect kick in - with the userbase acting like gravity to bring in more users and developers - until it&#39;s large enough that sheer force of habit/inertia makes it quasi-&#34;indisruptible&#34;?Either way, I found it fascinating how Valve turned into Steam, whether it was accidental or not, what a homerun pivot. Seems that is the way of the Internet, being first matters more than just about anything, having the superior product (not claiming there is one for game stores) is irrelevant if you&#39;re remotely late, it just won&#39;t matter how much cash you pour into a Microsoft Store or a Google+. My gut tells me Microsoft is salivating at the idea of buying out Steam, seems like a perfect fit for the conglomerate if it wasn&#39;t for the scrutiny it would bring their way while they are positioning themselves as the good FAAMG."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a matter of principle, I think digital delivery platforms benefit from competition, and we should not be locked down into a single monopolistic, stagnating platform.As a selfish consumer though, I hugely wish we just had Steam and Netflix:The Origins and Uplays and Battle.nets of the world exist solely to make my life difficult, refusing to play my game when I want it due to obscure update required or forgotten password or old email account (especially when they are an overlay on top of Steam), and have zero repeat zero positively zero benefit to myself as a consumer. It is blatantly anti-consumer, and not made with customer view in mind.(Gog.com gets a pass because it allows me to JUST download the game, with no launcher and crap, so essentially going into opposite direction from all publisher-owned platforms and provides a unique value proposition)Same for Netflix.  It&#39;s fine. It&#39;s good. It&#39;s great! Over the last 5 years, proliferation of Disneys, Amazons, HBOs, Hulus, CBS All Access, Paramount Ultra Plus Exclusive Diamond Platinum... the whatEVERs, all they do is make me have to guess which  service is content I want to play on. All they are, at any level, is &#34;we want more money for less consumer convenience, and we think we can get away with it due to exclusive content lock-in we refuse to license to the convenient platform&#34;.I understand I&#39;m supposed to vote with my money, but with exclusive lock-in that&#39;s difficult. My kid wants their Octonauts and their Stinky &amp; Dirties, dammit :D"</p>
