								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I worked at eBay, we had a bonus program based on company revenue.  It was around 6% of your salary max and managers got around 25% max based on the same formula.  For the first few years, you could count on getting a max bonus every quarter.  To the point where most everyone who worked there had always gotten one.And the one quarter, we didn&#39;t get the max bonus.  In fact, I don&#39;t think we got it all.  People screamed and yelled and were pissed.  At the company all hands they spent a lot of time explaining that bonuses weren&#39;t guaranteed.  Some of the lower paid folks were actually crying about not making critical payments because they counted on the bonus.  Morale went way down.  People left because of it.Stories like this are one of the stated reasons Netflix doesn&#39;t do things like bonuses or any sort of variable comp.  Because once you get one once, you feel entitled to it in the future, and it feels like a loss when you don&#39;t get it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of my first job as a developer, age 21. I haven’t shared it before, so here goes...There was a ‘crunch’ coming up at work (i.e. IMHO, bad planning) and so the boss offered everyone a bonus if they performed well.However, the older employees warned me that the criteria for such bonuses were often ill-defined. I therefore pushed for clear achievable objectives. These pre-agreed objectives were promised, but never provided.Anyway, we all work hard, some more than others, but we met all the deadlines.Then comes bonus time, and they propose that I be given 30% of the maximum bonus. I explained that I felt this was entirely unreasonable, as I met all my deadlines. No other objectives were set, and therefore I felt I deserved the full bonus.They didn’t agree, and we went three rounds of meetings with more and more people in the meeting. Each time they tried to convince me what I was asking for was unreasonable.At this point I should add that I had seen this boss (CEO, small company) be what I would now call abusive. Verbally abusive to junior staff members, and insulting members of staff behind their backs. So my loyalty was, well, absent.So on the third round of weirdly manipulative meetings, we come to an impasse. So I explained that I still stand by my request, and I pulled out my letter of resignation.At which point there is a long silence. My boss puts his head in his, and the other two people in the meeting (another boss, and my coworker) looked surprised, to put it mildly.After collecting his thoughts, my boss asks: what is to stop me threatening to resign every time I don’t get my way? To which I calmly explain that he didn’t have to pay (Ie. I could just quit).After a bit more stunned silence, the boss relents, and agrees to give me the full bonus.I wait until the bonus is in my account then I hand in my notice anyway. Abusive bosses don’t get loyalty.The best part is, the coworker in the meeting also didn’t get the full bonus, despite working much harder than me. He’d only asked her into the meeting to try to guilt/manipulate me. So not only did the boss have to give me the full bonus, he had to do the same for her too.After that I went freelance. And 15 years later I can say it was the best decision ever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see a lot of comments bemoaning performance-based bonuses, but consider the following:&gt; I remember being in shouting matches with our signal integrity team about among other things, how many capacitors we needed. These tiny devices evened out the power of the system, but they wanted far too many to be added to allow the design cheap and easy to build&gt; Meanwhile I was waking up at 4AM on most days, in full-stress-insomnia. Sometimes I would just give up on sleep and go into work at that early hour, and while there, sometimes run into other stressed-out engineers who also could not sleep. I had shaved as much time as I could possibly get off the schedule, and a little cost. A $25K bonus was out of the question at this point, but $10K or more, still in the running.&gt; Because manufacturing, as discussed, was not on the secret bonus program, did not even know it existed, and had very little incentive to speed up the rework. As far as they were concerned the project was slightly ahead of schedule, so why rush the job and make another mistake? More time ticked by. They actually did make another mistake anyway, and mounted incorrect rams a second time, which I remember being really mad about.&gt; Meanwhile, our sister project had managed to minimize their cost target and beat the target schedule of their project, such that each member of that team received the full $25,000.Sounds to me like the bonus program was working exactly as intended. OP got into shouting matches with other stakeholders to trim overly cautious expenses. He and his teammates voluntarily worked far outside regular working hours. Both him and his sister team succeeded in delivering a successful project ahead of time, with lower costs, and were ultimately tripped up only by the incompetence of other teams that had minimal bonus incentives.I&#39;ve noticed a huge difference between orgs where people have skin in the game, and orgs where people don&#39;t. People with skin in the game, have a real fire under their ass. It&#39;s inspiring to see how much they are able to get done, and how quickly. At orgs where people don&#39;t have skin in the game, I spend half my time sitting in meetings, discussing what doc we should write next, what format we should use for the doc, and when to schedule the next meeting to review that doc. It&#39;s as though people are more interesting in impressing one another and putting in facetime, rather than actually getting stuff done. In fact, I&#39;ve noticed that people often add a net-negative value to many projects - their urge to add their 2 cents and make their impact felt, results in goalposts getting constantly shifted and launches getting continually delayed.Is it possible for a badly designed bonus program to produce disastrously bad results? Definitely. But there has to be a better way to give people more skin in the game, when it comes to doing their job as effectively as possible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For background context around telecoms for anyone reading this, there is an underlying difference in how telecoms networks are designed and architected - in the Telco world, links between networks were predicated on trust. Originally, telecoms networks were run by national level quasi-government operators, one per country. You interconnected with other &#34;known entities&#34;.Even now, you likely have 3, 4 or 5 national mobile operators in any one country. They negotiate their own roaming agreements in order for you to get roaming access. It&#39;s all driven by these kinds of relationships predicated on trusting other networks.In IT, we are rapidly moving towards zero trust (due to the internet), but circuit switched (legacy) voice is still all designed to be sent over private circuits between operators who trust each other.The legacy protocols (see SS7), used to route calls between operators are functional, but also lack access control and authentication, as it&#39;s assumed only trusted parties are on the network and able to use them. Those assumptions are no longer valid, and there&#39;s a huge challenge in dealing with this - hence SMS and call interception and rerouting attacks to steal 2FA tokens etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My assumption is that all intelligence services in all countries would love to have access to fully compromised networks. They spend all their time thinking about how to access information, so they would be fairly incompetent not to consider this.Does that mean that all systems are compromised? No, because there are risks associated with tapping in to these systems. Partly it depends on if they have access to the systems, but mostly on the possible blow-back if they get caught.Example: Swedens FRA (NSA equivalent) could in theory ask Ericsson (a Swedish company), to install a backdoor. But, Sweden has a fairly free press, and there are good chances that someone would leak this information. If it got leaked it would be a major scandal that could go as far as toppling the government and destroy one of Swedens most important export companies. Its very risky, and its a risk no one wants to take, so the parts made in sweden are probably not compromised.China, on the other hand has almost no risks associated with adding backdoor. No free press, hard suppression of whistle blowers, and since most foreign intelligence services already assume the equipment is compromised, there is no real reputational damage either. I assume they are all compromised, why wouldn&#39;t they be?The US is somewhere in between.Sometimes companies are compromised by intelligence services, but much more often I think its employees. Why try to change Tim Cooks stance on privacy, when all you need to do is find one Apple employee, willing to take a sack of money to &#34;do their country a great service&#34;?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Since the early 2000s at least, most billing has been outsourced. This works by sending all Call Detail Records (CDRs) to a third party, often from Israel or China.This is quite misleadingly written: telcos are not shipping reams of CDRs to some cubicle farm in Haifa or Chongqing.Yes, almost every telco outsources its billing software to other companies, notably Amdocs (founded in Israel, now HQ&#39;s in the US).  However, billing info is some of the most sensitive data a telco has for both privacy and commercial reasons, so that software always runs in a closed environment from where it cannot dial home.  Historically that&#39;s been on-prem, it&#39;s slowly moving to the Cloud but even there it&#39;s going to be firewalled off very carefully."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s more concerning to me is the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Perhaps there is an argument to Bitcoin being a kind of &#34;digital gold&#34; even if it is all but useless as a currency. But events like Dogecoin hitting a $50B market cap are very unsettling to me.I used to take part in &#34;Dogecoin Socks for the Homeless&#34; events. It was wonderful, everyone was trying to make something good out of what we all knew to be a meme. I am shocked now to look back on those wallet addresses which once held ~$1,500 and see they&#39;d be worth $285,000 (had I held). Of course, it might be that I&#39;m just angry I wasn&#39;t the one to become rich, but the mania right now is really, seriously, insane.Many people who are FOMO-ing in thinking this will make them millions with a few hundred dollars invested will be hurt when the &#34;number go up, number go down&#34; cycle turns to &#34;number go down.&#34;"</p>

					<h3><a href="https://jonatron.github.io/webgl-fingerprinting/">Are top websites using WebGL for fingerprinting?</a></h3>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some of these are probably fingerprinting but the Twitch one isn&#39;t (I worked on the video system at Twitch for a number of years).&#34;player-core-variant-....js&#34; is the Javascript video player and it uses WebGL as a way to guess what video format the browser can handle. A lot of the times mobile android devices will say &#34;I can play video X, Y, Z&#34; but when sent a bitstream of Y it fails to decode it. WebGL allows you to get a good indication of the supported hardware features which you can use to guess what the actual underlying hardware decoder is.This is sadly the state of a lot of &#34;lower end&#34; mobile SoCs. They will pretend to do anything but in reality it just... doesn&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sorry, but this is nonsense, as presented.There is zero evidence any of these are being used for fingerprinting, which is defined as building up an entire set of capabilities to uniquely identify a user.Essentially all of these seem to be attempting to identify the graphics card, and all of these could be related to feature detection for an embedded video player, for example. Feature detection is not fingerprinting.Fingerprinting is pretty easy to confirm, because it collects a large combination of data points (fonts installed, canvas rendering quirks, etc.) and either reports or hashes them all together. (That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s easy to find the code that does the fingerprinting, but once you&#39;ve found it it&#39;s quite obvious what it&#39;s doing.)It is deeply irresponsible and misleading of the author to claim fingerprinting without looking for that type of combination. And slapping &#34;No claims made about accuracy&#34; at the top of the page isn&#39;t an excuse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As I&#39;m repeating myself too often regarding this: the statistical norm is to be trackable. Every browser that isn&#39;t will get flagged.Privacy does only exist if you seem to look exactly like any other person visiting the website.That is why user agent, web apis, asset loading order and behaviours, http stack behaviours, tcp fingerprints all have to look like they came from the Browser Engine you&#39;re trying to identify with.If you don&#39;t, you&#39;re watched. It&#39;s as simple as that. Don&#39;t kid yourself into safety if you think that the Content-Security-Policy hack of adblockers work to prevent tracking and fingerprinting. Sure, you send less data, but less data means more obvious than the norm.As there was not a single concept that could fix this (in regards to looking like another Browser) I started to build my own &#34;web filtering browser&#34; [1] that is able to emulate fingerprinting, and sticks them to specific domains and their originating uncached CDN requests so that if you have the same IP for the same website, they cannot correlate it to ptevious visits.The most effective way to not get tracked is to not visit the website. And I think that there&#39;s a huge potential in offloading traffic to peers that have the same URL already in their caches. Peer-to-peer Browser Caches would fix so many issues on their own, I don&#39;t understand why nobody is doing that. To the end user it doesn&#39;t matter where the assets come from, as long as the website is rendered in the same way afterwards.[1] https://github.com/tholian-network/stealth"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love Squarespace. I find it to be as close to the perfect mix of flexibility, usability and beautiful defaults that I&#39;ve ever seen in a website builder. I can hand off management of the site to someone with almost zero technical skill (my 70 y/o father with almost no technical knowledge manages a Squarespace site I built him!) and when I look back in 2 years the site will still look pretty good and will still work on mobile. Chances of the site being hacked are much much lower than on Wordpress. Prices are reasonable. The layout engine is exactly what I want, it looks nice on all devices and can handle most layouts, which is a totally worthwhile tradeoff for the few times that something just doesn&#39;t quite look the way I want it to without custom css.I know people say this stuff:&#34;You can&#39;t transfer your site away&#34; - I know, but I can build a reasonable site in ~2 days, so the tradeoff is worth it and the sunk cost is lower&#34;But I want a fully custom design&#34; - Yeah, fair enough, there is a cap on the high end of design with it but I think that cap is pretty high, especially in 7.1&#34;But it is making the whole internet look the same!&#34; - Not really, between colors, photos and sections in 7.1 I just don&#39;t think this is true. If you use unsplash for all of your photos then maybe, but if you are doing that you are probably too small to care, worry about that when you hit 2MM in revenue&#34;But Wordpress is user friendly too&#34; - No it isn&#39;tAs I write these I think that maybe it is just the perfect thing for my subset of clients (SMB), so read this from that perspective.

It&#39;s good, it&#39;s fast, it&#39;s productive, it&#39;s well supported, battle tested and documented for decades with a huge pool of devs. And many companies already use it and the tooling is excellent.But those are not sufficient reasons for me.Python is older than Java, well supported, battle tested, documented with a huge pool of devs. But it&#39;s way better for high level stuff, data mangling, scripting, gluing, and for most web dev stuff.If I want a distributed system or something with a lot of I/O, Erlang and Go will always be better than Java. Sure, they are less widespread, with all the stuff it implies, but for such a nice need, I will pay the price hapily: my goal is optimization for the use case. Same for stuff that needs to go fast or have a small footprint, I&#39;m not going Java if I can go Rust.If I want to have fun, Java is out of the loop. Better sharpen my inner weirdness by fighting with some exotic lisp. Why try productive ? I wanna enjoy myself, not run a business.So Java is not a bad choice. It&#39;s an excellent tech. I just don&#39;t have a use case for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This post from &#34;an ignorant computer science undergrad&#34; is pretty silly, so allow me to get a little silly in response.I think if Java&#39;s new features are an attempt to woo new developers, Java comes off pretty tragically, like the old guy in the club, trying stay relevant by showing off how it just got up to date with ideas that hit the mainstream ten years ago.  Whoa, check out these record classes!  Fresh stuff over here!  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any significant audience for this (a few &#34;ignorant computer science undergrads&#34; aside,) and I doubt that&#39;s what Oracle is shooting for.I think what Java is really doing is reassuring people who committed to it long ago that it will take care of them.  Java is not the old guy in the club; it is the middle-aged guy dressing up and taking his wife out for a night (or half an hour, depending on her arthritis) of dancing at a jazz bar.  It&#39;s doing its honorable best to show the people who committed their lives to it that it understands they still need a little bit of excitement now and then, and they don&#39;t have to sacrifice their dignity to some cad at the bar at the country club to get it.They don&#39;t really want to leave Java.  Java understands things about them that nobody else ever will.  All Java needs to do to keep them is love them enough to keep doing its best."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I haven&#39;t been coding as long as most (about 10 years) but I&#39;ve had phases of Java, Ruby, Python, JS, TS, ObjC, etc.If I go onto my GitHub and try to get any of my old projects running I am extremely confident that the non-Android Java  ones will still work. All of the other ones will probably have &#34;rotted&#34; over the years and send me down a day-long rabbit hole looking for old dependencies or build systems.There&#39;s something to be said for that amazing stability. I can&#39;t think of another language where you can find some .edu page from 2001 with a link to a library (.jar) that does what you need and you can actually use it in a modern application."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The title is slightly misleading, and so is Linus&#39; response here. This RFC never claimed to be in shape to be immediately mergeable into the mainline kernel as-is. Miguel (the author of the patch) has replied to this mail (and in other places in the thread) that the Rust alloc() is currently called only as a temporary measure to speed up development, and all panic() calls from allocation failures are just as temporary. This is all because the Rust code that hooks into the kernel memory allocation functions is not yet usable.The main point of this RFC is that &#34;the [in-kernel Rust] support is good enough that prototyping modules can start today.&#34; There&#39;s no point in making long arguments about alpha-quality design shortcuts on an alpha-quality prototype that are also explicitly mentioned by the patch authors to be of alpha quality.See e.g. https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/14/1130 and https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/14/1023EDIT: Thanks for the child comments; it seems that Linus is simply not aware of all the specifics and is asking for more information and/or decided to look at the code before reading the full mail thread."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I would love to see is Rust in the kernel, with a caveat. That caveat is something akin to Erlang&#39;s OTP supervision trees. Erlang has a similar philosophy to Rust in that if something erroneous happens the process fails. The difference is that Erlang OTP is designed to have supervisor processes of the worker processes. The only thing the supervisors do is monitor the processes under them and control when, if, and how those processes are restarted on failure or other conditions. The supervisors themselves have supervisors, right up to the root supervisor for each Erlang application.Rust got the language and the tooling perfect, but Erlang got the services and service infrastructure perfect.  The more I think about it the more I think I should shut up and put up. In other words, apply my knowledge of Erlang and OTP to create a gen_server in Rust as a jumping off point for a OTP like Rust framework, perhaps called OARS (Open Advanced Rust Services).  This is definitely bigger than one person. If you&#39;d like to join me on this journey then reply to this comment and I&#39;ll send you project details by the end of the weekend."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Aside from Linus&#39; reaction, there are some really interesting pearls in that thread, for example:Regarding code style[1]:&gt; The more you make it look like (Kernel) C, the easier it is for us C people to actually read. My eyes have been reading C for almost 30 years by now, they have a lexer built in the optical nerve; reading something that looks vaguely like C but is definitely not C is an utterly painful experience.&gt; You&#39;re asking to join us, not the other way around. I&#39;m fine in a world without Rust.CoC was already brought into battle[2]:&gt;&gt; I could be mistaken but you seem angry. Perhaps it wouldn&#39;t be a bad idea to read your own code of conduct, I don&#39;t think you need a browser for that either.&gt; Welcome to LKML. CoC does not forbid human emotions just yet. Deal with
it.These ([3] [4]) messages have an interesting perspective about maintenance.&gt; I&#39;m sure about one thing, the C bugs we have today will be
fixable in 20 years. I&#39;m not even sure the Rust code we&#39;ll merge today
will still be compilable in 10 years nor will support the relevant
architectures available by then, and probably this code will have to
be rewritten in C to become maintained again.Linus wants to see a real, working kernel driver instead of Android Binder[5]:&gt;Would there be some kind of real driver or something that people could
use as a example of a real piece of code that actually does something
meaningful?[1] https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/16/118[2] https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/16/143[3] https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/16/181[4] https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/16/283[5] https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/14/1091"</p>

You come along, with Google Chrome, and visit my site.
Google adds the fact that you visited my site to their massive dataset (as well as who-knows-what-else)
And to opt out of something I have never been asked to be involved with in any way, I need to contact Google and ask them to please leave my site alone?Am I understanding this shit correctly?Whether I like it or not, my site, by proxy, is participating in Google&#39;s data mining?If my guess is correct, how the actual fuck is this not illegal?Edit: Ok, I guess I&#39;m off the mark here with my assumptions so I&#39;ll put my pitchfork down.Google are just using your Chrome browsing data, matching it with site id&#39;s (or hashes?) and then analysing the shit out of it for their gain.As a website owner, nothing has changed other than I can tell them not to use my site as part of their analysis... that sound about right?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Has nobody bothered to read anything about FLoC?The purpose of this permission is to prevent embedded third-party content from using FLoC. Besides that it’s a no-op.FLoC does not track arbitrary websites, it tracks sites which retrieve the FLoC cohort via JS. So instead of dropping a unique third party cookie, and associating it with the data on the page, sites can now retrieve a k-anonymous cohort id and associate it with the data on the page. If you’re not doing that (or serving ads) there’s nothing you need to do.That’s not to say that FLoC doesn’t deserve criticism just that most criticism I’ve encountered is not grounded in reality."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is really huge news. Starship has in about 18 months gone from a Elon standing next to a steel grain silo duct-taped into the shape of a rocket, to all the eggs in NASA&#39;s moon basket. The thing I kept thinking - and I have to believe was considered within NASA - is given the rapid progress SpaceX has been making along with the delays in Congressional funding, SLS, BlueOrigin&#39;s other projects etc ... if NASA hadn&#39;t selected SpaceX there was at least some chance they&#39;d go ahead and do their own private Moon landing mission before NASA&#39;s, a massive egg-on-face moment.There are still major risks with the Starship program so I don&#39;t think anyone should be 100% confident they can pull this off, but the massive side benefit is if they do NASA will have proven out a generic system, fully reusable and with orbital refueling, that can with minimal modification cost-effectively send humans to Mars and much of the rest of the solar system as well. A Model T or 737 in space. The original Artemis plan never made much sense as a Mars &#34;proof-of-concept&#34;, but it actually does now.If at some point say 2025, NASA says to the President &#34;we can get the first human on Mars in 4 years for $15 billion&#34; I have to imagine any American president being eager to sign their name on that accomplishment and give the JFK speech, &#34;We choose to go to Mars in this decade, not because it is easy, but because it is hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win&#34;To me that&#39;s the real takeaway here: this is implicitly a huge NASA bet not just on the Moon, but Mars and the rest of the solar system. Finally."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The biggest news IMO is that there&#39;s only a single winner.   There was a lot of pressure to make Commercial Crew a sole contact to Boeing, and it now appears that Boeing is going to deliver Starliner two years later than SpaceX delivered Crew Dragon.  So going with two winners saved NASA&#39;s bacon.    It&#39;s surprising to see them only choose a single winner here.  Yes SpaceX may be considered a safe bet, but ten years ago it was Boeing who was considered the safe bet.   Things change over years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have to say, I am completely skeptical of Blue Origin&#39;s ability to do anything in a reasonable amount of time and that they will amount of anything but Bezo&#39;s hobby. At least until they change their approaches.That said, it&#39;s a very secretive firm with an unknown amount of progress.I&#39;ll believe in Blue Origin when I see it."</p>

In fact, another Google Account setting titled ‘Web &amp; App Activity’ also enabled Google to collect, store and use personally identifiable location data when it was turned on, and that setting was turned on by default.&gt; 
The Court also found that when consumers later accessed the ‘Location History’ setting on their Android device during the same time period to turn that setting off, they were also misled because Google did not inform them that by leaving the ‘Web &amp; App Activity’ setting switched on, Google would continue to collect, store and use their personally identifiable location data."</p>

And what&#39;s worse is that the federal governments don&#39;t even have any direct control over the app itself, they just bought access to the contact tracing data for 12 months from the company operating the app. Meanwhile the company controls the app and all connected user accounts and can repurpose it in whichever way they see fit (and they already announced they have plans for the app beyond the pandemic).It&#39;s absolutely mind-boggling to me how our government(s) can get the idea to &#34;rent&#34; contact tracing data from a private company like this, it just reeks of corruption.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a hiring manager, the things that stand out to me in your post:- You said you quit a job at EA, quit a job at IBM, dropped out of college your freshman year. You may have valid reasons for leaving each of these, but you have to see this from the manager&#39;s perspective: You had 3 different great opportunities that all came to a dead end at the beginning of your career. You need an alternate narrative.- You talk about applying to Google, Facebook, Airbnb, Palantir, and other companies known to be very competitive, yet the only real job experience you list in your post is low level customer support. Nothing wrong with aiming high, but you need to also be applying to jobs that are a logical next step in your career. It&#39;s extraordinarily difficult to jump from customer support to FAANG engineer, so have a backup plan.- You spoofed e-mails to manipulate executives into meetings. This kind of thing sounds clever in movies or from anecdotes in the 90s or 2000s, but in this era everyone is on high alert for phishing attacks and security breaches. Read the room, and don&#39;t commit computer fraud during your application process. Big companies have systems in place to catch these things and you&#39;ll get blocked in short order.- No mention of your network. Do you have any contacts or friends or acquaintances anywhere in the industry? Even people you knew briefly from school? People who you worked with in the past who moved up? Reach out and ask if they have any advice for your job search. Going forward, make a point to stay on good terms with the people around you. You can help each other as your careers progress."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Have you tried asking any of the jobs that rejected you&#39;re getting rejected?Honestly, just a guess, you&#39;re probably giving off bad interpersonal vibes/people don&#39;t really like talking to you. Half of interviewing is just being very personable/being able to talk comfortably with other people. Generally in this space (this space meaning those interested in tech/startups/etc) sometimes people struggle in this area but really shine in tech. I would encourage you to spend some time reflecting on your interpersonal skills.Some other red-ish flags from your post - you kinda seem like you might struggle just doing exactly what you&#39;re asked to do. Bringing up how frequently you quit things for various reasons or finding issues and bringing them up with your superiors&#39; superiors, spoofing numbers to get in touch with very very senior people. Lots of lower-tiered jobs literally just need people to show up and do what they&#39;re asked. A part of getting a &#34;first&#34; or &#34;entry level&#34; job is accepting you&#39;re there mostly to learn, not to teach/move outside of your lane. The fact that you would even bring up Bill Landreth seems like you might not necessarily see yourself how the rest of the world sees you.I&#39;m not trying to offend you - I really hope you can line something up soon. I apologize if this feedback seems cold - I think reflecting on things like this can be hard because you have to face things about yourself you may disagree with or not realize. Unfortunately interviewing is such a biased game, you kind of have to play your opponent (meaning, be the person they want, not the person you are).Happy to chat through any of this stuff if you have questions. Wish you all the best."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Your writing is not strong, i can tell you did not attend college. Written communication is important in tech.Your applying to those companies with 0 experience or college degree is unrealistic. The entry level is extremely competitive and you have nothing to make you interesting to hire. They get thousands of applications for those jobs.You are still young, plenty of time to learn, but I recommend taking a step back and rethink your strategy. There are plenty of companies that do not get thousands of applications for jobs.Let me put it bluntly: you are not qualified to be a software engineer. There is no reason anyone would currently hire you, unless you are personable and fun to talk to.You show immaturity in the way you handled the flaw in the system you described. Calling your boss&#39;s boss because you think you are right is childish.Additionally, you do not understand how to get a software job, you do not have realistic expectations for what kind of jobs you are qualified to acquire.A few years ago my brother, who is in his thirties, was stuck in a dead end job he hated. So he took some classes in 3D modeling. He worked hard, built out his portfolio, networked, and eventually landed a job at a world famous video game studio making AAA games at an interesting role that builds his skills.What he did not do was blindly apply to jobs he was not qualified to do with zero training"</p>

So long as there is more money in mining BTC than there is cost in energy to mine it, mining will proceed.No entity in the world can control the price of crypto. But, we can and already do regulate energy production.I think we need a carbon tax, that is specifically a financial disincentive towards any means of energy production that directly pollutes the atmosphere.Seriously, what are the current best arguments against levying such a disincentive?Moreover, if energy were priced correctly (its toll on the climate priced in) would BTC become higher in value? That is, we have a supply, increasing at a rate fixed between the arbitrage of energy and mining efficiency. If energy were to become more expensive, the growth in supply would slow. Assuming demand remains constant or continues to grow as well, the only way for price to go is up."</p>

Obviously for-profit companies will abuse their positions if it&#39;ll earn them more money, and fines ends up being the cost of doing business instead of deterrents.How is Apple allowed to disallow any other web browsers on their mobile devices? We already went through this with Microsoft in the past but suddenly it&#39;s different?How can Amazon be allowed to sell competing products in their own marketplace, when they own the actual marketplace? They should have been forced to divide their business long time ago. Of course they are gonna use metrics from competitors that only they have access to, in order to make their own product line get better.Why is Google allowed to rank their own products in front of more general results? Try searching for &#34;Earth&#34; on Google and see what the top hit is. Is that really a fair ranking? We don&#39;t even know, because no one knows how their algorithm is working, but one thing is clear, Google products consistently rank higher than anything else in the search engine.The list goes on.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;A year after initiating the investigation, we received testimony from the Chief Executive
Officers of the investigated companies: Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg, and Sundar Pichai.
For nearly six hours, we pressed for answers about their business practices, including about evidence
concerning the extent to which they have exploited, entrenched, and expanded their power over digital
markets in anticompetitive and abusive ways. Their answers were often evasive and non-responsive,
raising fresh questions about whether they believe they are beyond the reach of democratic oversight.Although these four corporations differ in important ways, studying their business practices has
revealed common problems. First, each platform now serves as a gatekeeper over a key channel of
distribution. By controlling access to markets, these giants can pick winners and losers throughout our
economy. They not only wield tremendous power, but they also abuse it by charging exorbitant fees,
imposing oppressive contract terms, and extracting valuable data from the people and businesses that
rely on them. Second, each platform uses its gatekeeper position to maintain its market power.By controlling the infrastructure of the digital age, they have surveilled other businesses to identify
potential rivals, and have ultimately bought out, copied, or cut off their competitive threats. And,
finally, these firms have abused their role as intermediaries to further entrench and expand their
dominance. Whether through self-preferencing, predatory pricing, or exclusionary conduct, the
dominant platforms have exploited their power in order to become even more dominant.&#34;Well they&#39;re not wrong..."</p>

Apparently embedded software developers choose FTP whenever a spec doesn&#39;t specify how binary file transfers should work.It was kind of amusing getting FTP to work in a modern cloud environment. I run a single Kubernetes pod with a Node.js based FTP server optimized for one thing: Transferring files between FTP and Google Cloud Storage. A series of ports are specified in the Docker file to enable passive FTP transfers.Even more amusing was the number of varieties in which FTP was implemented by different hardware manufacturers. I regularly had to dive into the FTP libraries to add support for crazy edge cases (tcpflow in kubectl exec -it is your friend!). Example: one device added a newline in the middle of a command (USER\n myusername)..The latest curve ball I received this week is that a certain firmware version of a Qualcomm modem chip cannot deal with the size of the IP packets coming from our FTP server... Fun stuff!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From rfc801 (transition from NCP to TCP/IP) :
&#34;FTP: This is specified in RFC 765.  It is very similar to the FTP used with the NCP.  The primary differences are that in addition to the changes for Telnet, that the data channel is limited to 8-bit bytes so FTP features to use other transmission byte sizes are eliminated.&#34;So FTP is older than the standardisation of byte size :-)"</p>

This is regardless of being in no position to see positions/flow/etc that would give you any insider edge.The industry generally sees it as easier to show compliance by having locked down personal trading by employees.Usually this takes the form of - ETFs only, pre-clearance required, 30 day holding periods, limited to using only a list of 5 approved brokers.. and sometimes all of the above.The restrictions apply not just to spouses but to anyone in household, and you have to attest you are reporting any holdings of say.. your parents, if you still live at home.So the mother of a live-at-home college grad tech support analyst who plugs in phones at a bank has more trading restrictions than senior politicians :-)"</p>

The author recommends a &#34;podcasting&#34; microphone, but a $35 standalone headset mic[1] is almost as good and much easier to use. If you want to hear a comparison, I got kind of obsessed with this problem at one point and took some comparison recordings here[2].(You need a standalone mic since most headsets, even really nice ones, have really bad mics because most headset buyers don&#39;t care about or even know how good their mic sounds. The one I linked is wired because wireless is evil[3] and in particular, Bluetooth will silently degrade your audio quality. If you want a pair of wired headphones, I like these[4] which are &#34;open back&#34; and therefore sound more natural + cool your ears better, although the open back also means they &#34;leak&#34; sound and are only suitable for working without people next to you.

It also often makes the difference (given equal visuals) between great amateur and pro in e.g. the YouTube scene.I didn&#39;t have data to back this up before, but I bought a good microphone specifically for this purpose. People will simply like the audio, and by extension what I am saying and also me as a person, better.Meanwhile, my ears will continue to bleed from the awful audio people broadcast into this world. I wonder, most people must notice how terrible everyone in e.g. video conferences sounds; why don&#39;t they make the connection that they themselves have it in their hand to improve the situation?

Everything I make for personal use works in Firefox and I don&#39;t bother testing with anything else.However, almost every web site or web app I make in my professional capacity gets tested with, and is expected to work with, ~95% of browsers. That means testing against Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, UC Browser, Samsung Internet, and Internet Explorer.
Edit: I forgot to add Safari, which I also test with.Anything less is not my brand of professionalism, because I am convinced my clients expect me to leave my personal thoughts and convictions at the door. If you want to only create sites that work in Firefox and maybe not elsewhere, then you can do that - but doing it ethically means telling the client upfront that you won&#39;t accept work that requires the site work for the widest audience reasonably possible.That said, there are two caveats.  The first is ethics. I do not leave my ethics at the door and if I am being asked to do something unethical I will refund the money and walk. If it is illegal it will be reported, as otherwise I am an accessory. Clients agree to this upfront. The second is client requests. If the client wants it to work in Firefox and they tell me not to bother with the other websites, despite my advice against it, then that&#39;s what I do."</p>

Here&#39;s one example - I like to access my database from my IDE remotely - my understanding is that remote access is not possible with sqlite.Another example - multitenancy is dead easy in postgres, makes things more secure and makes coding easier.Another is that Postgres had an extremely rich set of data types, including arrays and json.Also Postgres is designed for symmetric multiprocessing which matters in today&#39;s multicore world."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We&#39;ve been using SQLite as our principal data store for 6 years. Our application services potentially hundreds of simultaneous users at once, each pushing 1-15 megabytes of business state to/from disk 1-2 times per second.We have not had a single incident involving performance or data integrity issues throughout this time. The trick to this success is as follows:- Use a single SqliteConnection instance per physical database file and share it responsibly within your application. I have seen some incorrect comments in this thread already regarding the best way to extract performance from SQLite using multiple connections. SQLite (by default for most distributions) is built with serialized mode enabled, so it would be very counterproductive to throw a Parallel.ForEach against one of these.- Use WAL. Make sure you copy all 3 files if you are grabbing a snapshot of a running system, or moving databases around after an unclean shutdown.- Batch operations if feasible. Leverage application-level primitives for this. Investigate techniques like LMAX Disruptor and other fancy ring-buffer-like abstractions if you are worried about millions of things per second on a single machine. You can insert many orders of magnitude faster if you have an array of contiguous items you want to put to disk.- Just snapshot the whole VM if you need a backup. This is dead simple. We&#39;ve never had a snapshot that wouldn&#39;t restore to a perfectly-functional application, and we test it all the time. This is a huge advantage of going all-in with SQLite. One app, one machine, one snapshot, etc..."</p>

There is also some really annoying bullshit with the ambient brightness adjustment feature where I have to manually disable it in the registry every time a driver or windows update hits.The most painful problem with the machine is that WiFi is entirely unusable if you are simultaneously using bluetooth. I have had to get external dongles to resolve this.All of that said, I have had few-to-no issues with the Surface Pro product line at work, and my sample size is 1.

If you don’t do that, you may very well end up measuring a mixture of the performance characteristics of interpreted JS and optimized machine code.Since unwarmed first execution is a very common use case on the web, and a very intentional improvement for WASM, it seems foolish to discard that when comparing. I understand for benchmark determinism warming is important in long-running systems, but when parsing/warming is a common part of every run, it deserves to be factored in. I can make WASM look better by removing intentional benefits from JS before comparing too."</p>

Lot of new languages comes up only to fix syntactic problems with existing languages but create small semantic differences in the process, making automated translation from and to existing languages difficult. I wish we could move to a world where syntax and semantics in programming languages are discussed separately from each other."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice to see Datalog being validated by a big name, though I don&#39;t see what&#39;s modern about Logica in particular, or why one should use it over plain Datalog (as syntactical Prolog subset) when the available backends are restricted to SQL rewriters or locked-in to BigQuery. Will have to look into the model for aggregate queries which I guess is a selling point for Logica (as is modularization/composition with optimization), and a weak point since typically neither in Datalog (the decidable logic fragment) nor portable.Edit: also I find the title a bit grandiose since this isn&#39;t about Logic Programming in general, but only database querying"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not a great introduction to the language, IMHO. There is not a clear use of logic to automatically reason about anything, just query composition. It seems the language is much more powerful than what this introduction makes it to be!&gt; English words (...) often capitalized to keep the old-fashioned COBOL spirit of the 70s alive!I like logic programming a lot but a convention not technologically enforced is a poor reason to argue for a language change. When arguing about SQL limited abstraction capabilities that space would have been better spent talking about CTE limitations, for example.Also:&gt; To make things worse, SQL code is rarely tested, because “testing SQL queries” sounds rather esoteric to most engineers, at bestSo nonexisting best practices require a language change, apparently. It was also not showcased how this can be done in Logica, beyond the table mocking that could be done with a &#34;with xxx as (values a, b, c) select (query to be tested)&#34; approach in sql."</p>

I can’t blame them as I also don’t want this on my messaging app.I feel like I will just give up and use WhatsApp and assume that I only had privacy pre-internet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are three pre-requisites to escaping the messenger silo treadmill:  1. multi-vendor, open standard protocol for E2EE group messaging
  2. reference open-source clients for web, desktop &amp; mobile
  3. reference open-source server

Wire is contributing to #1 and they have a high-quality iOS (OSS) client and OSS server. Their Android and web clients are less stellar, but exist and can be improved.  The iOS Arm client will likely be enabled on M1 Macs. Wire is free for individual consumers and has a paid offering for enterprise teams (i.e. their business model is neither data nor charity), and they do not mandate sharing your phone number or address book -- only an email address is required.The IETF standard is MLS and it will live alongside TLS, https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mls/about/.  The team behind Wire founded Skype and contributed to the first patent-free high-def audio codec (OPUS), which in turn enabled WebRTC, the protocol behind most modern video conferencing services.  
Matrix.org provides #2 and #3 and has stated that they will migrate to the IETF MLS standard protocol.Since both Wire and Matrix offer both OSS clients &amp; servers, and there is active multi-vendor development on an open standard protocol for E2EE group messaging, web &amp; mobile developers have multiple options for open-source contribution. Matrix already supports federated servers that can be self-hosted, and they recently supported the FOSDEM online conference with ~30,000 attendees, https://matrix.org/blog/2021/02/15/how-we-hosted-fosdem-2021...&gt; The most unique thing about Matrix is that conversations get replicated across all servers whose users are present in the conversation, so there&#39;s never a single point of control or failure for a conversation (much as git repositories get replicated between all contributors). And so hosting FOSDEM in Matrix meant that everyone already on Matrix (including users bridged to Matrix from IRC, XMPP, Slack, Discord etc) could attend directly - in addition to users signing up for the first time on the FOSDEM server."</p>

I have about 25% of the conversations in signal, but especially for groups, whatsapp is so sticky, that they seem to have broadly failed in signal, and are back to whatsapp.I continue to have individual conversations on signal with most friends, but the idea of being able to leave whatsapp seems to be much tougher than I thought."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been using pass for several years now and I recommend it to my friends, but I usually get weird looks when I say I store my passwords in a git repo (it&#39;s not as bad as it sounds!). Here&#39;s why:- I host my git repo on my desktop computer (through SSH), so it&#39;s not exposed anywhere except if you have SSH access to my computer. (A lot of people seem to think git = GitHub which is not true). So if your git repo is not exposed to the public, you don&#39;t leak any of the site names/usernames you use.- The passwords are GPG encrypted so even if it were leaked that would be okay as long as my secret key remains secure.As far as usability goes, I usually use the -c option to copy/paste my passwords. I used a browser extension for awhile, but I haven&#39;t gotten around to reinstalling since the copy/paste works fine for me. Syncing with my phone and Linux devices works perfectly (since it&#39;s just git).The Windows client seems to be no longer maintained [1], so I would like better support here for my Surface. But this is still okay since I can SSH to my desktop computer from Windows and copy/paste the passwords from there.[1] https://github.com/mbos/Pass4Win#readme"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here are some of the pros of the Pass:* It leaks meta-data. That might sound a con, but in exchange you get the ability to extract a password without decrypting and thus exposing other passwords. There is isolation.* It’s more convenient than a single file password manager. You type ‘’pass -c goo’’ for your Google account, instead of clicking on your password manager, typing password, searching in data base, finding the right entry, copying password or pressing auto complete and closing the database. The combination of mouse and keyboard can make alternative password managers slower.* You don’t need your master password to add a new password (it uses asymmetric encryption).* You can easily program it, eg, write a backup script that grab a password from store.* It uses GPG which means your secret key can be stored on Yubikey, handled by a dedicated agent. Your password is basically a short PIN with max 3 tries. This is unparalleled convenience and security!* It’s secure, because it’s a short bash script that you can check, and delegates encryption to a dedicated well-audited cryptographic tool.* You can encrypt to multiple keys, thus use it similar to LUKS that supports multiple passwords.* GPG is usually widely available, so you can decrypt a password on another system on which you may not admin rights to install your password manager.There might be few cons though. For example, if you store your database on a cloud, say, Dropbox, Dropbox could switch  your Dropbox.com file with google.com file, and you copy and hand over your Google password to Dropbox. But this is hypothetical for most of us! Also, some people don’t like metadata (filenames) leakage, though apparently there are solutions for that.Overall it’s very convenient and functional. I highly recommend it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use pass for exporting secrets to environment variables. I have a multi-line password called &#34;envvars&#34; that contains a script like this:  #!/usr/bin/fish

  set -x PASSWORD hunter2
  set -x PASSWORD_STG hunter3

  set -x LUGGAGE_KEY 12345

  set -x TOKEN (curl &#34;https://api.example.com/oauth/token&#34; \
    --data-urlencode &#34;username=$USERNAME&#34; \
    --data-urlencode &#34;password=$PASSWORD&#34; | jq --raw-output .access_token)

  set -x TOKEN_STG (curl &#34;https://api-stg.example.com/oauth/token&#34; \
    --data-urlencode &#34;username=$USERNAME_STG&#34; \
    --data-urlencode &#34;password=$PASSWORD_STG&#34; | jq --raw-output .access_token)

When I want to set the environment variables I run `pass show envvars | source` and it sets the environment variables for the current shell. It&#39;s an easy way to keep the secrets out of my shell history and plaintext files."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think the issue most developers have with CORS is how late in the dev cycle you encounter it. When everything in localhost/http you don&#39;t see any issues. It only crops up once you deploy to staging/production environments that are actually on the web. Worst case is when it works fine in staging, and only has issues in production and someone else controls the allow list.It usually bites you once, and then you look out for it. But about every web developer I know hits it at some point. There used to be footguns of being able to disable CORS, and devs would provide this as a work around. Thankfully browsers have pretty much disabled these settings without intensive investment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve always setup HTTPS to an alias domain as the first step in any of my projects. I do it because at an early internship I witnessed a bunch of bugs that only appeared after pushing to “prod.”Nowadays with tools like mkcert it’s trivial to install and maintain a trusted root cert for whatever .test (RFC approved TLD) domain you want to add to /etc/hosts.  (Just be careful which colleagues you allow to install a custom root cert on your device. ;))As a fULlStAck DeVeLoPEr, what annoys me the most are the preflight CORS OPTIONS requests, and the fact they came out of nowhere in the past ~5 years. Most frameworks don’t have a good solution for dealing with those requests out of the box. It’s annoying how web standards change so much so frequently.  I could put my code in a vault and take it out in 2023 and it would probably break due to some obscure update in whatever JS runtime is popular then."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great and clear guide to this thorny topic. However, even this article gets a little confused in its wording at one point:&gt; In such cases, we want our API to set the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to our website’s URL. That will make sure browsers never send requests to our API from other pages.&gt; If users or other websites try to cram data in our analytics API, the Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers set on the resources of our API won’t let the request to go through.The ACAO header only performs a controlled relaxation of cross-origin restrictions. It is the browser that is ensuring that by default other pages can&#39;t send requests to the API.
Just a nitpick as I feel the rest of the article illustrates this well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While this looks interesting, I&#39;ll admit I feel like there&#39;s been a bit of drift from their bread and butter over the years since they launched their cloud thing and started pushing hard towards a subscription model. I chose them long ago specifically over options like LastPass because I liked having a rich application without internet dependency and their attention to detail and features there, but it&#39;s been a while since it feels like it got major new improvements vs the site. For example, while macOS and Windows have supported smart cards and security tokens like YubiKeys forever now, and I use them to login, unlock, authorize sudo/SSH, etc every day, 1Password still has no support. There are things that can now only be done through the web interface, like finer grained control over permissions for shared vaults, and some of those are also nastily locked away behind more expensive subscriptions. I think everything should be manageable through the application, without ever visiting the site. Duplicate items across vaults remain completely manually managed, when automating stuff like that is kind of the purpose of a password manager. Etc. Heck, even within their own subscription service I think they&#39;re missing a trick by not having more powerful/flexible organization(including families) and inter-organizational capabilities.I still think 1Password is the best option for most people. I specifically want my non-technical family and friends to use password managers too as long as its necessary, and having some multiperson capability is also key to that. I can&#39;t say though that I feel like the move to subs has been a huge win in terms of development.Granted, I&#39;m a little down on the whole field which colors things a bit. Ultimately underlying my feelings is a touch of bitterness that their entire industry even exists. Passwords and password managers are mostly recreating public key auth really, really badly and it stinks. Passwords and other symmetric tokens by definition should never be shared. A website being hacked should never affect me in the slightest, in the same way that me getting hacked doesn&#39;t somehow suddenly mean attackers now own Debian/Apple/FreeBSD/Microsoft. Everywhere should just have public keys. We&#39;ve had the tech for decades and sufficient crypto speed on client systems since at least AES-NI. What&#39;s been missing has been glue and effort. It&#39;s frustrating every time a hack happens. We shouldn&#39;t have to care! Sigh."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I purchased my first 1Password license when it was version 3, and have faithfully upgraded to every standalone version ever since. These days I’m not so sure I will be upgrading again (and I’m not sure there will be more stand alone versions).The latest version is a mess on Big Sur, with unlock fields obscuring input fields, conflicting with Apples iCloud Keychain, and just not working like I expect it to.Furthermore, stand-alone versions are buried deeper and deeper behind a cloud service subscription that brings me absolutely no value over what i already have, and adds the uncertainty of having to synchronize my most secret secrets to a cloud service.While I can certainly forgive software errors, this has been going on for so long that I’m beginning to suspect it’s either a strangler pattern to get people to switch to the cloud solution, or it’s death by a thousand cuts.In any case, I’ve begun evaluating alternatives. Bitwarden looks promising (though nowhere as polished), is open source, and allows me to synchronize to a service on my LAN.Password-store uses gpg and git that also allows me to synchronize locally (though it leaks website names without the vault extension which is not supported on iOS).Finally I’m evaluating Yubico authenticator for 2FA codes and just using iCloud Keychain for the rest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks interesting. We use 1Password, and I always thought it would be useful to programmatically pull values out and use in our cloud infrastructure.Currently we end up using the secret managers available in AWS or GCP, which seems pretty half baked. In GCP, for example, secrets are stored at a project level. It&#39;s not unusual to have certain secrets that are needed by more than one project, which means they get duplicated. The granularity also prevents me from controlling which secrets are visible to a given user.I&#39;d love to have one centralized source of truth for all infrastructure secrets."</p>

They&#39;re not causing the &#34;poor to get poorer&#34;.And comparing the wealth distribution of today to that of 1980 is pretty silly. We&#39;re in a global economy now, so if you want to be fair, you need to look at it from a global perspective. Almost all Americans are going to fall in the top 10% of earners globally. And global poverty has collapsed since 1980. Yes, you no longer get a comfy middle class life just by virtue of being born in the US (regardless of skills) anymore. I personally don&#39;t believe that an unskilled worker in the US deserves to be paid 10X what an equivalent worker in Bangladesh makes just because they were lucky enough to be born here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m just gonna quote what I think is a very important part from the Graham piece itself&gt;&#34;People who don&#39;t look any deeper than the Gini coefficient look back on the world of 1982 as the good old days, because those who got rich then didn&#39;t get as rich. But if you dig into how they got rich, the old days don&#39;t look so good. In 1982, 84% of the richest 100 people got rich by inheritance, extracting natural resources, or doing real estate deals. Is that really better than a world in which the richest people get rich by starting tech companies?&#34;And my answer to that question would be, arguably yes. Why? Because at least old money understands the concept of noblesse oblige. The real sinister psychological thing going on behind the Graham argument is that it&#39;s not at all about meritocracy, it&#39;s that this mentality of earned wealth completely rids the owner of any sort of responsibility.The aristocrats and oligarchs of the olden days might have been corrupt, debauched and half-useless, but at least they knew it. This new, self-made entrepreneur class does not only think they have earned their money themselves, which as a sidenote is also kind of a fiction, but that they&#39;re intellectually superior, morally superior and virtuous in ways that anyone else just can&#39;t understand.Old money might have ignored you and thrown a party, but Silicon Valley money wants to remake people in their images, they have a Protestant zealotry associated with their money that makes any oligarch look straight up sympathetic in comparison.C.S Lewis:&#34;“Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron&#39;s cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be &#34;cured&#34; against one&#39;s will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of people who are just as smart and motived as Elon Musk or Steve Jobs will never be able to start their own companies and get rich.Because they have family obligations that take priority.Because they live outside high-income countries.Because they have no access to support network, so when they fail, they fall all the way to bottom.Because they may have made a crippling mistake in their pasts that now prevents them from reaching their full potential.And so on and on. While I would still recommend everyone to pursue the dreams over never trying to do so - being poor is the single most powerful force that prevents people from doing that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I got hit with this a few years back. I signed up for Ps CC for a month (I thought) to create an anniversary gift for my wife. I used it ONCE. Tried to cancel and they told me I had in fact signed up for a year, and that if I didn&#39;t cancel now, they&#39;d give me two months free.I didn&#39;t want it at all! Anyway, I sucked it up, got on with the remainder of the year, because they wouldn&#39;t let me put the cancellation in early, had to do it X months before the end. Then life happened and I missed the deadline to cancel and got suckered for a second year!Fuck Adobe and this practice is all I have to say, I stick strictly to Open Source options now. It may have been my fault for not reading the first time, but robbing me a second time by counting on me missing the cancellation because they wouldn&#39;t let me do it there and then is just scummy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is this really a cancellation fee or is it just honoring your contract? AFAIK it&#39;s very clear on Adobe&#39;s page that your options are (1) Annual plan paid monthly, (2) Annual plan prepaid, and depending on the product (3) Monthly plan at usually 150% higher price.https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/plans.htmlIf you signed up for a yearly plan paid monthly, the cancellation fee is finishing your contract.If you didn&#39;t want to agree to pay by the year maybe you shouldn&#39;t have signed up for a year of service?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had the same, they wanted me to pay the rest of the year (after 2 or 3 years?). Problem is, that is against Dutch law, after an initial year, one is only allowed to prolong a contract by 1 month at a time. I reminded the person on the phone (who only spoke English, so imagine what happens when you are not as fluent in it as I) that they broke Dutch law, I told that to 3 other persons and they finally told me: Ok, we&#39;ll cancel. Finally.Edit: I had to call them, because the website indeed only showed me these options where I had to pay the rest of the year. Email didn&#39;t help, they offered me some discount for the rest of the year. Very strange as a Dutch person, it has become so normal to not worry about this (I really like this law, a nice example of citizens before companies.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Apple has just engineered the worst possible situation for themselves by being the only way to get apps on the store and by simultaneously incessantly marketing the store as &#34;Safe and Secure&#34;. The former encourages them to maximize the number of apps on the store, while the latter encourages them to shoot first and ask questions later.If side-loading or alternative ways of getting apps onto the iPhone existed, then they could implement far stricter controls knowing that, worst case scenario, you can still get an app onto the iPhone. This is how it works on the Mac. Tor isn&#39;t on the Mac App Store, but that of course doesn&#39;t mean Tor can&#39;t be used on the Mac.This is one of the tricky parts about AppStore discussions, it&#39;s not about being for or against the AppStore. In fact, I wish the AppStore was MUCH pickier about the apps it let in, and I also wish there was an alternative to the AppStore to catch cases that didn&#39;t meet that strict bar. Then the AppStore could actually be about curation as opposed to fear-induced isolationism. Then Apple wouldn&#39;t have to inadvertently have political side-effects when it disallowed apps like HKMap.live.Being on the AppStore could still be advantageous beyond just &#34;either that or you don&#39;t get to be on the iPhone at all.” Apple payment processing, iCloud integrations, Family-sharing, etc. could all be tied to being ON the AppStore, so there&#39;d still be a huge incentive to try to ship that way. And side-loading doesn&#39;t have to be easy or even on by default."</p>

It got everything from banning apps for competitive reason to Apple&#39;s FEAR ( Fraud Engineering Algorithms and Risk ) team saying the current App Store review process is inadequate.I am starting to think there is a much deeper problem with Apple, it is that without Steve Jobs, no one is being the yard stick of quality, especially in UX.A decade of App Store, you are wondering if they have actually put any effort in its Apps Search Engine. It took them 3 years to admit they have problem with Keyboard and offering an update after 5 years. For things that are easily quantify, like Sales, Hardware Performance ( Apple Silicon ), Logistics and Operation. They are absolutely excelling under Tim Cook. For everything else it seems they are loose, at least from an Apple Standard point of view, although that is still far higher than their competitors.To quote Steve, it seems people are too focused on the process, and forgot about the content.[1] https://twitter.com/PatrickMcGee_/status/1380194940236353536"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The risk of dying from a blood clot after receiving the J&amp;J vaccine is six in 6,800,000 (6.8M). The world population is 7,900,000,000 (7.9B). If everyone on the planet got the J&amp;J vaccine tomorrow, and if it is the cause of the clots, then 6,971 people would die from the vaccine.Yesterday, Covid19 killed 8,803 people (according to worldometers).We don&#39;t want anyone to die from vaccination, and we don&#39;t fully understand what the clotting issue is, so it probably makes sense to pause using J&amp;J as long as the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna) have not been implicated (which they haven&#39;t). OTOH, if this being in the news causes fewer people to get vaccinated, pausing it may be a mistake that will cause more overall deaths.Now, your risk of dying either from vaccination or Covid19 depends on various demographic factors not accounted for in my math above. But, nonetheless, the risk of dying from the J&amp;J vaccine is really, really, really tiny.Like, if I knew there was a 0.00009% chance my car were going to explode every time I got in it and started it, I would not be at all nervous about starting my car everyday for the rest of my life. I&#39;m way more likely, even accounting for my age demographic, to choke to death eating dinner tonight (5,051 deaths from choking in the U.S. in 2015 of which 2,848 were older than 74).Edit: lifetime risk of car exploding assuming I start it every day for 50 years is about 1.6%. Okay, maybe I wouldn&#39;t play that game."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The incidence of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) varies between studies, but it is estimated to be between 2 and 5 per million per year. A recent study in the Netherlands with comprehensive ascertainment suggested a much higher incidence.&#34;
https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/STROKEAHA.116.0...So the six reported cases in 6.8 million vaccinations seems low. Glad I read about all this because I got the J&amp;J vaccine 12 days ago. No noticeable side effects so far. I exercise a lot and did a 5 mile hike four days ago that resulted in a slightly strained a calf muscle.  I have been taking it easy the past few days, meaning sitting and reading a lot more than usual. So after learning about the blood clotting, have started exercising the legs frequently. My optimistic thinking is that even if the vaccine does cause an increased risk of CVST that risk can be eliminated via exercise.It will be most interesting to learn if those six cases involved people at high risk, if they exercise regularly, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"John Campbell suggested on his video the other day that perhaps this is happening because some injectors are not aspirating. What that means is that when an intramuscular injection is given you want to ensure that it goes into the muscle and not into a vein. So the proper way to do this is for the person doing the injection to first pull out the syringe (after it&#39;s been stuck into the arm) a bit to make sure there&#39;s no blood coming out. Then if not, the vaccine is pushed in. If blood is seen then a new site has to be chosen. Apparently Denmark has included aspiration in their directions for usage of the AZ vaccine."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"People in this thread seem very confused about a lot of stuff so I’m going to try and make some clarifications:1) This is an RCE, so what it does is achieving code execution in the browser, i.e. it can run arbitrary code from the attacker, it’s literally like running a compiled program inside the target’s browser. This doesn’t bypass Chrome’s sandbox, so a lot of OS operations are not reachable from within the browser (for example, a lot of syscalls can’t be called).This is the first step in an exploit chain, the second one would be a sandbox escape to expand the attack surface and do nasty stuff, or maybe a kernel exploit to achieve even higher privileges (such as root)2) WASM being RWX is really not a security flaw. W^X protections in modern times (even in JIT-like memory mappings) makes sense only when coupled with a strong CFI (control flow integrity) model, which basically tries to mitigate code reuse attacks (such as JOP or ROP). Without this kind of protection, which needs to be a system-wide effort as iOS has shown, W^X makes literally zero sense, since any attacker can easily bypass it by executing an incredibly small JOP/ROP chain that changes memory protections in the target area to run the shellcode, or can even mmap RWX memory directly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s some nuggets of truth in here, but I am disappointed that this article sidesteps what I feel is the most important reason for startup success in 2020: easy and abundant access to cheap capital.- Interest rates are at all time lows, borrowing is cheap- The Fed&#39;s balance sheet is at an all-time high. The economy is flush with cash, particularly the investor / VC class- This excess cash creates an (arguably artificial) wealth effect and drives an appetite for risk- Large unicorn startups that are perpetual money losers continue to operate only because they are effectively subsidized by regular capital raises. Look no further than all the Silicon Valley darlings such as Uber, Netflix, AirBnb, Tesla, and so on. All of them would cease to exist without continued capital injection from secondary share offerings or VC raises- These companies achieve growth and put pressure on the competition by offering their services below the real cost that would be needed to achieve profit, hence driving huge share price growth- This share price growth attracts new investment from the momentum-chasing crowd, increasing appetite for subsequent secondaries, and then the cycle repeatsI don&#39;t mean to be cynical, but it&#39;s hard to see this ending well for some of the nouveau riche. Tech has been a great avenue to riches by offering real innovation in some cases, but the article&#39;s error-by-omission really gives the wrong impression."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m rather disappointed PG would think that the Forbes wealth list could support any kind of conclusion whatsoever. One of the biggest reasons that the top of the list is filled with tech billionaires is that their wealth is relatively transparent, being mostly in the form of stock holdings in publicly traded companies and often directly disclosed. This makes it much easier for Forbes to estimate their net worth with some degree of confidence. Older wealth is often more opaque and diffuse, hidden behind various complex financial structures or stored in assets that are difficult to value or rarely change hands. Whether Forbes is aware of how much wealth there is and in what form, depends largely on the desire of the possessor to make it known. Some would want to disclose (or even inflate) their wealth for ego or branding reasons. Others would likely prefer to remain off the Forbes list altogether. So the Forbes list is a poor starting point even for a discussion soley about the wealthiest people. To draw any kind of inference from it to the broader economy is just downright ridiculous."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;So it&#39;s not 2020 that&#39;s the anomaly here, but 1982. The real question is why so few people had gotten rich from starting companies in 1982...a wave of consolidation was sweeping through the American economyMicrosoft, Oracle, Apple, Bloomberg, etc were all started in the late 70&#39;s/ early 80&#39;s. Their founders are the richest people in the world.Seems like the question he&#39;s asking, though, is why weren&#39;t they obscenely wealthy after only 5 years, but that requires a different thesis than PG&#39;s.Every time I read one of PG&#39;s posts, it seems like he&#39;s working from a narrative that he&#39;s trying to conform facts to."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those confused, this acquisition is due in large part by Nuance&#39;s dominance in healthcare related products.  From Nuance&#39;s last earnings release[1]:“We are very pleased with the strong start to the fiscal year, as we delivered revenue and EPS above our guidance range expectations,” said Mark Benjamin, Chief Executive Officer at Nuance. “We continued to advance our strategic initiatives, accelerating our cloud transition across our core platforms in Healthcare and focusing on our AI-first approach in Enterprise. In Healthcare, we saw solid performance in our cloud-based offerings, growing cloud revenue 28% year-over-year. In particular, we benefited from strong performance in Dragon Medical &amp; DAX Cloud revenue, which grew 22% year-over-year driven by the ongoing transition of our installed base to Dragon Medical One, as well as traction in international, ambulatory and community hospital markets. Enterprise delivered another record revenue quarter, up slightly from its previous record in Q1&#39;20, driven by particularly strong demand for our Security &amp; Biometrics solutions.&#34;Nuance has deep relationships built with nearly every health system in the US and beyond.  This fits quite well with Microsoft&#39;s corporate focus.  Yes, Nuance also has a lot of IP, but I wouldn&#39;t expect any consumer facing changes (e.g. Cortana) in the near term.[1] https://investors.nuance.com/download/EX%2099.1%20Press%20Re..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think a lot of big acquisitions make &#34;sense,&#34; given the current market.The most successful companies have lots of cash, high share prices, and amazing cash cows. They could borrow for (almost) free, so resources are practically unlimited.  Their R&amp;D is already well funded. Most of their big, growth oriented endeavours are not cash-constrained. There are usually no factories to build or production to scale up.Google tried &#34;20% time.&#34; They tried &#34;let many flowers grow.&#34; Those things seemed ambitious at 2007-scale. In 2021 terms... new flowers need to be S&amp;P 500 companies to represent growth, instead of just clutter. &#34;Meaningful growth,&#34; for Alphabet, is a big number.How else does a MSFT, Google or (especially) FB put $20bn to work? Acquiring &#34;just works.&#34;Of course, there are in-house alternatives. Waymo is an in-house investment by Alphabet that&#39;s bigger than this Nuance acquisition... especially if you consider the $bns Waymo will continue to need until some unknown future date. Self driving is looking more hopeful (certainly to investors) than it was when waymo started.... but waymo is still a dubious investment.Consider that Google could have bought any car company, for about as much as waymo will cost eventually. Car companies have loans, so you could quibble the math... but details.Acquiring is easy. The path of least resistance wins &gt;50% of the time. We have that dynamic here, both in the human/managers sense and in the arbitrage-like incentives in the market currently."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s hard for me to know whether to feel bad for ES in this case. Did they bring it on themselves? Is Amazon too big and a bully?From my perspective, Amazon has made most of its profit price gouging consumers on bandwidth after vendor locking them into their ecosystem, where they bootstrap new services by wrapping open source software with some provisioning scripts, management dashboards and cookie-cutter API / console templates. Indeed, most of this is templated -- AFAIU, for example, each AWS service autogenerates its Boto bindings and parts of its console frontend via code generators. Amazon has really mastered the factory process of churning out new services, and when they find a popular one, they can invest more resources into developing it than the original team ever could.And therein lies the rub. If Amazon is improving the software in a way that the original team couldn&#39;t, it&#39;s hard to say that the community isn&#39;t benefiting. I think what strikes me the wrong way is that Amazon is not doing it for any altruistic reason. In fact, Amazon contributes very little to open source in general, considering how much they take from it. Compare them to Facebook (React, etc) or Google (tons of dev tools) or Microsoft (VSC, TypeScript). What does Amazon have? Firecracker, kind of? And now a fork of ES because that&#39;s the only way they could continue making money off it without violating the license a small startup put in place to stop them?Well, good for Amazon, I suppose, but I find myself instinctively disliking them for this. I&#39;m not sure what the solution is. Hopefully technologies like Kubernetes and Terraform will encourage big customers to become at least cloud-agnostic, if not cloud-independent. At the very least it would be great if Amazon / Google / Microsoft stopped gouging bandwidth at such absurd margins. Or not. Maybe it will be their downfall as startups differentiate along those lines. That would be ironic, coming from the originators of &#34;your margin is my opportunity.&#34;Personally I&#39;m doing my part by not building anything with vendor lock-in. It&#39;s great to be able to deploy to any cloud, if you value either robustness or flexibility."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there any good that done by Amazon to support OSS? Like ever. They started with cloning MongoDB and now Elastic with actually zero contribution to the community regardless of their insane profits. This is a clear single. Amazon can always clone and redistribute any open source software then lock it in for AWS. If we&#39;ve started to witness declining in OSS, well at least we know now who started the wave."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another trick that might be more practical for actually debugging is using the object shorthand. For example, instead of...    console.log(x, y);

which contains the information you need, but lacks any useful context, try...    console.log({x, y});

...which will print out like an object, including the key names."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve put over 200 tips like that on my website: https://umaar.com/dev-tips/Each tip has a textual explanation, and an animated gif if you&#39;re a visual learner (I know, I need to scrap gifs and move to regular videos).There&#39;s a lot of tricks there which can hopefully improve your development and debugging workflows. Let me know if there are specific things you&#39;d like to see. A few people have asked for how to find memory leaks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow there are some cool tricks here!In Firefox any objects you pass to console.log are expandable, so you can say console.log(&#34;my hash&#34;, h). It seems to behave the same when you say console.log(&#34;my hash %o&#34;, h).But there is a tricky thing that has really confused me in some debugging efforts: when expanded, the object display is &#34;live&#34;, so it always shows the current properties of the object, not the properties as they were when you printed them. But the unexpanded view shows them as they were. So for example:    h = {foo: &#34;bar&#34;}
    console.log(h)
    ▶ Object { foo: &#34;bar&#34; }
    h.foo = &#34;BAR&#34;

Then you click the triangle and you see:    ▼ {..}
    |   foo: &#34;BAR&#34;
    | ▶ &lt;prototype&gt;: Object { .. }

I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a bug or desired behavior, but watch out for it! In the past I&#39;ve used console.log(JSON.stringify(h)) to capture the full object as-is. I guess turning it back into an object would be even nicer, so you could have a deep copy to navigate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Now, would the journalists who wrote articles with titles that are a variation of &#34;RMS defended Epstein&#34; [1,2] apologize or at least correct their articles?  Also, now that RMS has explicitly clarified his position on these issues, can the people who leveraged his &#34;silence&#34; and &#34;bad behavior&#34; to oust him from the FSF at least admit that their motive was less about making the free-software movement welcoming and was more about getting rid of RMS?[1]: https://www.thedailybeast.com/famed-mit-computer-scientist-r...
[2]: https://www.vice.com/en/article/9ke3ke/famed-computer-scient..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Minsky defense was not the primary, most important reason RMS can&#39;t serve as an effective, inclusive leader for free software, it was just the one that got the most attention. This does nothing to address the numerous complaints of harassment towards MIT students, the _other_ times he spoke out in implicit support of pedophilia, the public gaffes that are unacceptable as a public representative (e.g. the foot skin eating thing), and the fact that the FSF under Stallman kinda lost to open source anyway and hasn&#39;t really done anything besides virtue signal to others about how pure and ethical they are."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s great, but the problem seems to be RMS&#39;s disruption of development activities. This doesn&#39;t change that. For example:https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2015-01/msg00...Imagine taking the time to publicly explain to an out-of-practice dev why some technical feature is needed, then being accused of a &#34;pressure campaign&#34; that requires the out-of-practice dev to consult privately, &#34;with people I have confidence in.&#34;Gnu devs have an impressive amount of patience and grace to put up with that. But I see a lot of other FOSS devs try to replicate RMS&#39;s unnecessarily aggressive rhetoric. They often shoot themselves in the foot with it, disrespecting and consequently losing valuable contributors who are otherwise aligned philosophically with the project in every way.That kind of disruption is at odds with every value FOSS devs claim to hold-- meritocratic, decentralized, etc. Even Debian put the hammer down when an out-of-practice dev tried to use permissions to disrupt the work of a new dev. Nobody sane and self-respecting should put up with this kind of behavior.Edit: clarification"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Taleb talks about the Lindy effect and some of the surprises in this article can be explained it.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effectThe rough heuristic is: the longer a technology has been around, the longer it will last into the future.That is, it&#39;s NOT the case that every piece of technology lasts roughly the same amount of time, and then is replaced.For example, a chair vs. an iPhone.  Which one will be used further into the future?  Almost certainly a chair.----Land lines have been around a lot longer than fax machines (both in the article), so they will likely outlive fax machines.Will HTML or JavaScript last longer?  Probably HTML, since it came first.What about ASCII or HTML?  Probably ASCII.These have a &#34;dependency stack&#34; issue, but it applies regardless.  And I think that is part of the phenomenon -- low level technologies that are widely adopted take longer to go away.  Plumbing, electrical (AC vs DC), land lines, TCP/IP, BIOS, etc.I can&#39;t find a link now, but there was a recent Kevin Kelly article about finding farming tools from a catalog in the 1800&#39;s still in use.   I think he said that almost EVERY one was still in use, or able to be purchased, which is a nice illustration of the point.  It takes a long time for old tech to die, and arguably it never does."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"His #1 can not and will not ever happen. The radio spectrum is a shared resource. The total information capacity of the usable spectrum, say from 100 KHz to 100 GHz, is massive but most of it has terrible propagation and all of it can only be used once at a time. Massive MIMO helps in dense city cores with lots of independent paths reflecting everywhere but it&#39;s still just one spectrum in practice.Whereas with physical transmission lines, be they cables, fiber optics, or whatever, each run can re-use the entire spectrum."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The 3D TV phase was so odd. It really seemed like an inevitability: there was a technological breakthrough, it was genuinely much better than what came before (the red and blue stuff), it was relatively inexpensive, and on paper it seemed like a strict improvement on the status quo (flat TV).But... somehow, I never actually found myself wanting it that badly at home. And I guess everyone else agreed because one day it just vanished.So few technologies follow a trajectory like that. Usually you either get a success or a failure, where successes only end once they&#39;re replaced by something new and strictly better. But this was truly a fad; it was kind of successful for a minute, and then everybody lost interest."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I noticed as young adult that I didn’t really worry or consciously stress, but my body had somewhat predictable reactions to situations that I would realize, in hindsight, were highly stressful. Those physical reactions sucked, and as they got worse over time, it really concerned me.At some point I was encouraged to go to CBT, which I did, but honestly it made things worse. I became hyper aware of how anxious I was at any moment, and the more I noticed the more it worried me.Years later I tried mindfulness meditation and found that it helped. But also, I finally hit a kind of turning point where I just realized that there was nothing I could really do about anxiety or the physical symptoms that came along with it. I decided to mostly try to quit noticing and thinking about it. And that really helped.I still feel stress and anxiety symptoms sometimes. They still suck. My conscious mind is still the last to recognize what’s going on. But, overall, I feel I can handle a lot more stress now than I could ten years ago without it ruining my quality of life, and more importantly I can recognize the stress, not worry too much about it so I can get through it, and then rest and recuperate (as soon as possible) and recover much quicker than when I was younger.I’ve concluded that the best advice is to learn not to worry about things. Unfortunately that’s easier said than done, and I’m not sure I have any advice on how to learn to do that :/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Eh, a gross oversimplification.Feeling troubled by being anxious in the modern world is a &#34;cerebral&#34; issue. The guy who mistook an innocent animal as a tiger and freaked out because of it didn&#39;t feel bad for feeling anxious for no reason. We do. Because it interferes with our daily functioning / responsibilities in the modern world.Anxiety is also very frequently comorbid with other mental disorders. Especially OCD or OCD like tendencies, depression etc. I am medicated now and feel a lot better but when my anxiety was worse, the chatter of my &#34;conscious&#34; brain murmuring about &#34;what if&#34; scenarios was the worst. My point is, yes, anxiety manifests itself in a physical way, big time, but that is only half the problem. The discomfort with being anxious, constantly thinking about the possibility of having an anxiety attack even if you are not physically anxious &#34;at that time&#34;, evaluating the &#34;what if&#34; scenarios, the constant planning to work around possible issues, all that torture are very cognitive pursuits and they were a lot of a bigger burden on my quality of life than experiencing an anxiety attack now and then."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the advice of focusing on how to turn anxiety symptoms down and moderate physical responses are fine, but it&#39;s kind of missing the point, at least for serious cases of anxiety. I suffered pretty badly from it in my early 20s (apparently typical age for this kind of stuff), and you go very quickly from particular anxiety attacks being the issue, to fear of anxiety itself being the bigger issue.An anxiety/panic attack is physically scary the very first time, but by the tenth time what you&#39;re really afraid of is the loss of control and the anticipation of anxiety. Chronic sleeplessness is often the same way. Dealing with literally sleeping better is one thing, but at some point the real issue becomes the mental concern with sleep itself.Dealing with physical anxiety symptoms is good, but if you&#39;re mentally anxious your first thought after dealing with an anxiety attack by breathing deeply is &#34;okay, but what if it doesn&#39;t work the next time?&#34;. It&#39;s that mental attitude that I think many people have trouble dealing with."</p>

E.g. Ansible, where YAML, JSON, module call DSL and Jinja are all mixed on top of the commands so you can bump into any of them."</p>

Not a particularly good setup for selling &#34;Chris-Tokens™.&#34;Not a bad thing, in the long run. It hurt like hell, the first few times, but I realized that I don&#39;t have the personal skills to &#34;sell&#34; myself (like being able to spew jargon, sound like I&#39;m TED-talking all the time, or beat LeetCode tests), so I can&#39;t blame folks for not wanting to &#34;invest&#34; in me. It is what it is. I come across as a socially-awkward dork, so people don&#39;t take me seriously. I&#39;m actually fairly good at what I do, but If I mention that, it comes across as &#34;arrogant,&#34; despite the enormous ocean of hubris that pretty much defines today&#39;s tech scene.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Instead of more palatable user tracking, how about we tell advertisers and internet companies: fuck off, we don&#39;t want any tracking? How about we hunt down and eliminate all features that allow cross-site information sharing? How about we treat attacks on user privacy as security problems of the web standards, à la Tor, and build technology that aggressively hides any user signature in any layer, from rotating IP and MAC addresses to user agents, referers and canvas leaks?But wait you say, how would the very useful internet ecosystem survive without advertising revenue? Well, there is nothing wrong with advertising per se, it&#39;s a natural part of a free market economy. It&#39;s ok to target ads to the user&#39;s search terms or social feed. The problem is that, in the pursuit of advertising revenue, a cutthroat economic competition pushed advertisers to mine more and more personal data simply to stay competitive. It&#39;s a low sum game: it doesn&#39;t bring much more money in advertising or make the internet significantly more useful, but it destroys the privacy of everyone. A spectacular market failure ripe for correction."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FLoC stands for Federated Learning of Cohorts which aims to target advertising better without it directly relying on singularly personal information.https://web.dev/floc/  FLoC enables ad selection without sharing the browsing behaviour of individual users.

  FLoC provides a privacy-preserving mechanism for interest-based ad selection.

  As a user moves around the web, their browser uses the FLoC algorithm to work out its &#34;interest cohort&#34;, which will be the same for thousands of browsers with a similar recent browsing history. The browser recalculates its cohort periodically, on the user&#39;s device, without sharing individual browsing data with the browser vendor or anyone else.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s a very interesting move. The patch seems fairly small, but now it&#39;s a patch that Brave needs to maintain and update every time they merge a new upstream version.That&#39;s what makes me wary of the whole Chromium fork concept. Every time Brave/Vivaldi/Edge/etc decide to take a different path from Google&#39;s they effectively add to their maintenance burden forever, even if like in this case they actually disable an unwanted feature.How long until the list of patches to backport for every new version of Chromium becomes so large that they have to pick and choose which one to keep maintaining and which one to give up on? If tomorrow Google decides to push a very deep change to the way, say, extensions are handled that makes them less effective at ad blocking, will Brave accept the burden to suddenly have to maintain a very deep fork of the browser in order to maintain old functionality?I&#39;m effectively FUDing right now, but my concern is genuine. I&#39;m very perplex that you can make an effectively anti-ad, pro-privacy browser based on the source code of one of the biggest ad companies in the world."</p>

That brings me to a question I have. GIMP has been in development for longer time. And supposedly it has a bigger team behind it. So how come GIMP is missing a lot of nice features like non-destructive editing, layer styles etc? I saw some of these features in its roadmap, but why is its development so slow?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I find more amazing is what an incredible equalizer IT is: An individual with nothing more than a computer (and $50 worth of rented production infrastructure) plus the right skills can build a project that makes a (well-deserved) million a year, from anywhere in the world.It also shows the power of smart design and keeping as much as you can client side. Attempting to move any of the actual work to the server side would create an unsustainable amount of a) additional development work, b) infrastructure cost, c) infrastructure operations work. It&#39;s also a great example that you truly can do everything inside a browser nowadays.Regarding the incredulous people who can&#39;t imagine how 12 TB/month cost only $50, the hosting provider may be taking a small loss on it, and make it up with other customers. At Hetzner, extra bandwidth (after you&#39;ve exhausted your included allocation) retails for 1 EUR/TB + VAT. A provider can afford to lose $10-20/month on a single customer, and kicking them out is probably not worth the effort and the risk of even the smallest amount of bad press/word-of-mouth."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"(author here)I thought I would answer to some of the comments here.&gt; It&#39;s their place, their rulesDefinitely true. And I am not going to try to go against those rules. But I believe I am allowed to voice my opinion about them.&gt; Use in-app purchases insteadThis is definitely a valid option, but that requires diving into Google Pay, which from what I understand is not the easiest API to work with. It also means I have to maintain additional code for Google Play. More not-so-fun work to do for a side project.&gt; Make it a paid gameAnother valid option, but given how everybody is used to free games on Android, I doubt it would get much success. It also does not help that Google Play disallows switching a published app from free to paid and vice-versa: it&#39;s a one-way decision.I might end up going that way though, because it has the advantage of not having to write store-specific code. Pixel Wheels is not Android only: it also works on Linux, Windows and macOS, so not having to deal with store-specific requirements gives me more time to work on the game itself. The game would still be available for free on F-Droid and for pay-what-you-want on itch.io.I also happen to run other open-source projects, and my goal with donations is to get people to support this open-source work, not just my work on this particular project. I don&#39;t expect to ever live from this: in my wildest dreams donations would let me spend a work-day per week or every two weeks to work on open-source projects."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently implemented Google Play billing in my app (after doing Stripe and Apple App Store) and Stripe was by far the easiest to implement/test/maintain.  Google and Apple not only take their 15/30% cut, their payment systems add a very non trivial amount of work (cost) to implement and maintain while offering none of the (automated) testing capabilities of Stripe.  Work that I&#39;m forced to do, even though I had already implemented Stripe.  All because they have a monopoly on their platform.For something as critical as payment processing, both Apple and Google make it an arcane journey into API documentation and stack overflow questions. 
Hoping to write a blog post detailing all of this in the near future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many comments here confuse paid apps or in-app purchases with donations. In fact, donations are sort of a blind spot on Google Play: They&#39;re forbidden through the platform&#39;s payment system (because it would be a price charged without service in direct return), but donation buttons are also forbidden. Since both are forbidden, it&#39;s not (just) commercial optimization by Google, but that just makes it weirder IMO.As a rule of thumb, don&#39;t include a direct link to PayPal, Patreon or similar, but create a dedicated page on your website listing those and link that page."</p>

So, I hooked up an IoT button to Lambda + Dynamo, created a UI and everything -- my wife only needed to press the button. Turns out my wife was generally too sleepy and forgot to press the button.

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26741829">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From a storage perspective, describing commits as snapshots seems like a bad mental model. Suppose I have a directory that is 100MB in size. If I take a snapshot of it, my snapshot would be 100MB in size. If I take a 2nd snapshot of it tomorrow, my 2nd snapshot would also be 100MB in size. My total storage needs would now be 300MB.Whereas if I had used git, and created 2 additional commits, each making a change to a small text file, my total storage size would be barely larger than 100MB. Describing the commits as a diff, as opposed to a snapshot, leads to a better intuitive understanding of why this would be the case.Not to mention other features the article discussed, such as cherry-picking. What does it even mean to &#34;cherry-pick a snapshot&#34;? In comparison, cherry-picking a diff and applying it to your current state, is far more intuitive.And let&#39;s not forget commit messages. If a commit is a snapshot, I would expect the commit-message to be descriptive of the entire snapshot. Whereas if a commit is a diff, I would expect the commit message to be descriptive of the diff. Which is exactly how most people use commit messages.Obviously both &#34;diffs&#34; and &#34;snapshots&#34; are leaky abstractions. If you insist on using the &#34;snapshot&#34; abstraction, you will need to resolve all of the above points of confusion by adding more complexity to your abstraction. And if you prefer to use the &#34;diff&#34; abstraction, you will eventually need to explain that a commit is actually a combination of diffs, along with some other metadata like a pointer to a parent commit. As a teaching tool, you can make either abstraction work. But I find it far more intuitive and useful to think of commits as &#34;diffs + some metadata&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why have so many people written long thoughtful explanations about how the author is wrong to suggest snapshots are a better mental model, and that you think all abstractions are leaky, but you find diffs a better mental model?The entire article is literally about how commits are literally snapshots. I would say people didn&#39;t read TFA, but a lot of people are quoting lines from TFA and then going on to argue with/expand on them in a way that is directly contradicted by the next few lines.I think it&#39;s because most of the people here have spent years working with git, and are so deeply attached to their understanding that they didn&#39;t hear most of what the article said.(Some commentators have pointed out specific oversimplifications the author makes like glossing over pack files, I&#39;m referring to the people who say a git blob is a diff when the entire point of TFA is that it isn&#39;t)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I believe that Git becomes understandable if we peel back the curtain and look at how Git stores your repository data.I agree, and like many, I have been saying that for years (nay, for more than a decade): and that&#39;s exactly the problem!You don&#39;t need to understand how an internal combustion engine works to drive a car... You don&#39;t need to understand how your graphics card renders stuff to develop a web page... You don&#39;t need to know how a brushless motor works to use a drill...There is a pattern there, and it&#39;s the one that makes sense.I&#39;ve read up on the internals of git a dozen times by now. But I only occasionally need to do something weird that makes me go back to it, so I usually forget the relevant bits.The trouble is that I&#39;ve used a distributed VCS that did not ask me to understand internals and it had a sane UI, and good model (like tree-like commit history, so a top-level commit log would only have merges, but you could dive deeper into individual commits if you so pleased). It wasn&#39;t perfect, but it&#39;s hard for me to accept that we have gone with a subpar solution where every &#34;tutorial&#34; starts with how you need to understand the internals! But you also need to memorise them, dammit!Just like I keep forgetting the Emacs rectangle editing shortcuts since I seldom use them, I&#39;ll keep forgetting the specifics of git internals that I might need once every 12 months.And it&#39;s not me, it&#39;s _you_, git!"</p>

The only thing consistently &#34;terrible&#34; about both of them is the often expressed lack of humility towards solutions you don&#39;t &#34;like&#34;, or more often, actually, solutions you don&#39;t understand.Gottfried Leibniz suffered no small amount of flak for his conclusion that the reason the world looks the way it does is because it&#39;s already &#34;the best of all possible worlds&#34;: you may think you see an improvement, but you lack divine understanding and therefore you don&#39;t see how it would actually make things worse.While this is in my opinion a silly idea, I think most people who work in tech could use a bit of humility influenced by this line of thought: if a solution exists today, and it has yet to be replaced, it&#39;s at least possible that it&#39;s over all the best solution, and the reason you&#39;re not seeing that is because of a lack of understanding.Of course this is not always true, but if nothing else it would lead to more interesting discussions than those stemming from someone saying &#34;if you&#39;re not using Kubernetes you&#39;re a moron&#34; and another replying &#34;learn how to sysadmin and you&#39;ll realize you don&#39;t need Kubernetes in the first place&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At scale software stops being a technology problem and becomes a people problem. And groups of humans don&#39;t scale.We naturally organize into hierarchies of small subgroups with limited  interaction boundaries. Each subgroup will adopt slightly different methodologies, have different tooling preferences, will have integration and communication overhead with others,  and so on.This can not be preventend, only mitigated. Which is perfectly fine. The important step is recognizing that software development is really not special [1], and that the limiting factor is the human element. Then you can build your organizational structures around these restrictions.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26713139"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The tooling is simply not there, so every software project keeps pushing the boundary of what is possible in its own unique fragile way.People don&#39;t want solutions to yesterday&#39;s problems. These are considered trivial and already solved, such as invoking a shell command (which just hides a lot of complexity under the hood). Noone will pay you for invoking existing solutions. They pay you to push the boundary.By tooling I mean programming languages, frameworks, libraries and operating systems. All of whuch have been designed for a single machine operation with random access memory model.This no longer holds true. In order to scale software today you need multi machine operations and no such OS exists for it yet. Only immature attempts such as Kubernetes, whose ergonomics are far from the simolicity that you&#39;d expect from a unix like system.And random access memory model breaks down completely, because it is just a leaky abstraction. For full performance memory is only accessed linearly. Any random access structured programming language completely breaks down for working with GBs of data, in parallel and on a cluster of machines.I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll push the boundary further if we keep piling crap on top of existing crap. The foundations have to change and for that we&#39;d better go back to the 70s when these ideas were being explored."</p>

Enable SR-IOV for your upcoming Xe DG2 GPU line just as you do for your Xe integrated graphics. Just observe the lengths that people go to for their Nvidia cards, injecting code into their proprietary drivers just to run this. You can make this a champion feature just by not disabling something your hardware can already do. Add some driver support for it in the mix and you&#39;ll have an instant enthusiast fanbase for years to come."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"GUI is better for discoverability of the most common scenarios (I can right-click to see everything that can be done with the file, including some third party programs). But it&#39;s bad for composing programs and interoperability, often it&#39;s impossible or very hard to automate (how many people are doing UI testing? there is a good reason it&#39;s not many -- it completely sucks)TUI/console is very good for interoperability/automation/muscle memory, but doing one-off things is harder.
If I don&#39;t remember the `df` command... what do I do apart from searching on the internet? Maybe searching man pages, but it isn&#39;t as fuzzy (e.g. `man -K &#34;free space&#34;` isn&#39;t very fruitful). 
In comparison, I know that if I start going through GUI, eventually I&#39;ll eventually find the free disk space info.It&#39;s interesting that there is some analogy to object-oriented and functional paradigms -- if I have a rich object in a debugger in Python, I can call dir() on it to immediately see what I can do with it. Whereas if it&#39;s a simple dataclass, I&#39;d need to search through code to find how I can use it. Might be a too far fetched analogy though.I think we need all of it, and also need to make the distinction less apparent. Would be nice to make GUIs more composable, and TUIs more discoverable. Ideally it should be a spectrum of interfaces, so you don&#39;t have to make a hard choice and can gradually move into the direction you want."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not sure if this is satire or not, but certainly the single worst case of using a terminal is file manipulation. Nothing will ever beat the right-clicks or Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V combos. It&#39;s just more natural to &#34;see&#34; things that you move.Now when it comes to more complex applications, I&#39;d stop using the CLI if I had to search the manpages or the internet each time for doing something I already did previously.
Since I discovered the Ctrl+R shortcut (for searching your history), it has been much easier. You read the manpage once, maybe you do an internet search, you enter the command and then you can find it back as long as it&#39;s still in your bash history (be sure to set HISTSIZE and HISTFILESIZE to correct values). I also have a DOCS.txt file where I put all the rare but useful commands I&#39;m afraid of losing. I don&#39;t need to be an expert in ffmpeg&#39;s options (... though I sort of am now), I can just look at my history or my DOCS.txt file!"</p>

Ctrl-C and Ctrl-VSo these 3-5 things do everything in the list in a GUI, and instead the author wants us to learn 35 different command/syntax combinations?As an aside, I&#39;d like to write an article saying &#34;You Don&#39;t Need Github To Write an Article&#34;. If you insist on using Github for that purpose, at least do it properly with a static site generator.[1] Did not bother with the rest."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I tried Nix a few days ago. I set it up on an existing Arch install. I installed a couple of packages with &#34;nix-env -i [package] and then tried to update them with &#34;nix-env -u&#34; as instructed in the official documentation: https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/#ch-basic-package-mgmtThis ended up breaking the entire install. After a few hours of troubleshooting I found that the reason it broke was that it updated itself from version &#34;nix-2.3.10&#34; to &#34;nix-2.3.10-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl&#34; because it saw that package&#39;s version string as a version bump. The suggestion in the github issue was to instead use an unofficial third party package for basic package management because this was a known, long-standing issue that is not likely to be fixed.https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/118481The experience came across as a massive red flag and I decided not to pursue it further."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I spend a few hours looking at nix about a year ago and found it impenetrable.I simply do not grok the syntax or what the functions do. I tried searching for the functions shown in the examples on the website to no avail. I searched packages, options, and even resorted to ctrl-f while clicking through the site &#34;documentation&#34;...It sounds awesome, but its in dire need of some better documentation if it wants to be accessible, IMHO.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nix has a heavy learning curve and requires learning the language to feel comfortable. However, overcoming that hump is incredibly rewarding and allows for taming your system in a way that, for me at least, changed the way I look at composing software.At mindbuffer[1] we&#39;ve started using it for our recent art installations. The big benefits for us are reproducibility, ease of deployment, and the ability to collaborate on the composition of the whole system. I.e. rather than sharing a README of how to install things one by one and hoping each of us has followed it correctly, we just work on the same set of config files via a git repo (like we would any other code) and can be sure we&#39;re all on the same page as a result.Very much looking forward to Nix 3.0 landing with all its UI improvements and flake support. It seems like these changes will go a long way to making Nix more accessible, and provide a smoother on-ramp to learning the language itself.https://mindbuffer.net/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m using Starlink right now.  AMA.I&#39;m in East Idaho.  Currently my dish angles itself to the north.  It rarely moves itself north/south, and slightly moves east/west throughout the day.  I&#39;ve read that right now it locks onto a single satellite, although they&#39;re adding multi-satellite support later.My speeds are inconsistent, and interestingly they start slow (around 60 Mbps) but after a couple seconds they&#39;ll get to 150-200 Mbps (which is awesome for downloads).  Latency is consistently in the low 30ms.  I get some downtime every day, so it really is a &#34;beta&#34; like they say.  I have a backup WISP.Setup was literally take dish out of the box, insert into tripod (included), plug in cables, connect to the wireless routers SSID and activate with the starlink app.  After that I put the included router into storage and plugged in my Protectli[1] running CentOS.  Everything works great.  My only complaint is the CGNAT, but given the difficulty associated with procuring IPv4 addresses, it&#39;s understandable.[1]  I love this thing. 
 Highly recommend:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, I&#39;m impressed! I thought it would take more than a decade to implement when it was announced, but it&#39;s here and it works. Just amazing.100/16 Mbps is pretty decent I guess, hopefully it doesn&#39;t go down as the number of users goes up. The latency is great imo, 40ms using satellites? I don&#39;t think anyone has achieved that before.Would a bigger dish work better or not?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The cell grouping is interesting. A colleague likes the outdoors, so he&#39;s preordered one for his Suzuki Jimny, to mount on it. I wonder if Starlink are considering this use case.I haven&#39;t been able to preorder mine, because we&#39;re planning on moving out from the city to a small village next year, but the Starlink website requires a street address.Our villages are quite primitive, no street names (I think it&#39;s cos nobody&#39;s thought of it). So, the nearest town where there&#39;s street names, is quite far.I was feeling uneasy about using it as an address, this article sort of cements that concern.I have 50/50Mbps fiber, but reckon we could still be served by 20 down if needed. Exciting!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Avoid functions in WHERE clausesAvoid them on the column-side of expressions. This is called sargability [1], and refers to the ability of the query engine to limit the search to a specific index entry or data range.
For example, WHERE SUBSTRING(field, 1, 1) = &#34;A&#34; will still cause a full table scan and the SUBSTRING function will be evaluated for every row, while WHERE field LIKE &#34;A%&#34; can use a partial index scan, provided an index on the field column exists.Prefer = to LIKEAnd therefore this advice is wrong. As long as your LIKE expression doesn&#39;t start with a wildcard, LIKE can use an index just fine.Filter with WHERE before HAVINGThis usually isn&#39;t an issue, because the search terms you would use under HAVING can&#39;t be used in the WHERE clause. But yes, the other way around is possible, so the rule of thumb is: if the condition can be evaluated in the WHERE clause, it should be.WITHBe aware that not all database engines perform predicate propagation across CTE boundaries. That is, a query like this:  WITH allRows AS (
    SELECT id,
           result = difficult_calculation(col)
    FROM table)
  SELECT result
  FROM allRows
  WHERE id = 15;

might cause the database engine to perform difficult_calculation() on all rows, not just row 15. All big databases support this nowadays, but it&#39;s not a given.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargable"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an aside, but a colleague years back showed me his preferred method formatting SQL statements, and I&#39;ve always found it to be the best in terms of readability, I just wish there was more automated tool support for this format. The idea is to line up the first value from each clause. Visually it makes it extremely easy to &#34;chunk&#34; the statement by clause, e.g.:  SELECT a.foo, b.bar, g.zed
    FROM alpha a
    JOIN beta b ON a.id = b.alpha_id
    LEFT JOIN gamma g ON b.id = g.beta_id
   WHERE a.val &gt; 1
     AND b.col &lt; 2
   ORDER BY a.foo"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Although it’s possible to join using a WHERE clause (an implicit join), prefer an explicit JOIN instead, as the ON keyword can take advantage of the database’s index.This implies that WHERE style join can&#39;t use indices.I can understand why some would  prefer either syntax for readability/style reasons.  But the idea that one uses indices and the other not, seems highly dubious.Looking at the postgres manual [1], the WHERE syntax is clearly presented as the main way of inner joining tables. The JOIN syntax is described as an &#34;alternative syntax&#34;:&gt; This [INNER JOIN] syntax is not as commonly used as the one above, but we show it here to help you understand the following topics.Maybe some database somewhere cannot optimise queries properly unless JOIN is used? Or is this just FUD?[1] https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/tutorial-join.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, what an awesome dive into some of the technical aspects behind one of my favorite tools for using the web. And I do think of it that way these days, it&#39;s fairly stunning on some sites to switch off all the block and see how they become genuinely unbrowsable. I remember seeing Gorhill discuss a few times over the years some of the reqs for uBO during certain times (like why it could no longer work with Safari following changes Apple made a while back), but so cool to have it all collected in one place.Having said that I&#39;ve also been fairly stunned recently to see how much difference a simple DNS blacklist system can make too. Not because it&#39;s a big technical achievement but because it isn&#39;t and in principle seems relatively trivial to work around. But as I&#39;ve been switching all my routing from UniFi to OPNsense, I&#39;ve gone ahead and tried out Unbound&#39;s basic built-in blacklisting. While it&#39;s no uBO, it works on every single device and browser including in apps and it seems like it really shouldn&#39;t, that more parties would just be proxying ads through their own infra and DNS. Been kind of an interesting illustration of technical vs economic influences in an ecosystem. I can see how proxying would add complexity and cost to setup so it must just be that few enough people do it the ad industry can&#39;t be bothered.But should that ever catch on (and it could, Raspberry Pi seems fairly well known) I expect uBO to be able to keep up with the cat-and-mouse long after DNS has been left behind. This piece helps underline how incredibly important maintaining a critical level of diversity in the browser ecosystem is. Just shortly ago there were a bunch of complaints again about Apple not allowing Chrome to be on iOS because it &#34;holds back the web&#34;, but what &#34;holding back the web&#34; looks like is certainly a matter of perspective..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Such a shame uMatrix was discontinued.uBlock Origin comes close, and surpasses in some ways (I used both for that reason) but lacks separate control of cookies, images, scripts, etc. So you can&#39;t accept a particular third party&#39;s images without also accepting its scripts, cookies, etc.I mention it mainly in the hope that we can popularise its maintained fork &#39;nuTensor&#39;.After trying uBlock (as in attempting to also cover what I used to use uMatrix for) for a few weeks I think it&#39;s insufficient and nuTensor is the better option for me, but it quickly won&#39;t be if ~nobody uses it and it falls by the wayside.Alternatively uBO could support the few details it lacks from uM? It seems like the problem basically was difficulty/time constraints in supporting both.. but I don&#39;t know why they were ever separate? There&#39;s plenty of overlap. If uBO had uM&#39;s granularity in &#39;advanced mode&#39;, that&#39;d be perfect."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;At browser launch, Firefox will wait for uBO to be up and ready before network requests are fired from already opened tab(s).&gt;This is not the case with Chromium-based browsers, i.e. tracker/advertisement payloads may find their way into already opened tabs before uBO is up and ready in Chromium-based browsers, while these are properly filtered in Firefox.&gt;Reliably blocking at browser launch is especially important for whoever uses default-deny mode for 3rd-party resources and/or JavaScript.Oof.  TIL.  That makes blockers kinda crippled in chromes, if you expect them to actually block things."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; For example, I once joined a team maintaining a system that was drowning in bugs. There were something like two thousand open bug reports. Nothing was tagged, categorized, or prioritized. The team couldn’t agree on which issues to tackle
&gt; I spent almost three weeks in that room, and emerged with every bug report reviewed, tagged, categorized, and prioritized.Honestly, this is one of those traps a team can fall into, where nobody feels empowered to ignore the rest of the business for 3 weeks to put the bell on the cat. The only person without deliverables and due dates is the new hire. And it takes a special kind of new hire to have the expertise to parachute in, recognize that work needs to be done, and then do it with little supervision.But he&#39;s right in general, that you can get some surprising things done by just putting in the time and focus. Which is why it&#39;s so utterly toxic that corporate America runs on an interrupt driven system, with meetings sprinkled carelessly across engineer calendars."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I joined a mentoring program targeted at recent college grads, I expected to be teaching things like interview prep, resume writing, negotiation skills, communication skills, and how to deliver results in a workplace.For about half of the mentees, that&#39;s roughly true. However, for the other half much of my mentoring ends up being about time management, following through on commitments, and putting in the effort required to get a job done. A surprising number of young people are graduating college without ever having had to work any job. It&#39;s particularly difficult for talented coders who breezed through easy CS programs until they land in a work environment where tasks are challenging, expectations are high, and the only way to get things done is to sit down and put in the effort.One of the best skills anyone can learn is how to sit down, focus, and get work done. In my experience, it&#39;s increasing challenging to convince young people that this is an acquired skill that they can practice and develop. There&#39;s a growing perception that traits like work ethic, focus, and motivation are fixed attributes that one is born with (or without) rather than abilities that are developed over time. It&#39;s frustrating to watch some mentees map out meticulous diet and exercise programs to improve their physical strength, but then turn around and tell me that they&#39;re only capable of coding for 2 hours per day as a sort of fixed upper limit. Like everything, the ability to work and focus can be developed over time with practice and dedication. It&#39;s worth it."</p>

When I played the first song I had learned for my sister, she was amazed. &#34;Wow, I could never play like that&#34;, she said, &#34;my fingers don&#39;t work that way&#34;. But when I broke down for her exactly how I&#39;d learned it -- by breaking the song down into manageable chunks of just a few notes each, practicing each chunk with each hand separately many times until proficiency was reached, stringing the chunks together until I could play the whole song separately on each hand, and then bringing both hands together and repeating the entire process all over again -- her amazement turned to a look of disappointment. It was a mix of both realizing that her brother wasn&#39;t actually a genius, and a sort of mild disgust that I&#39;d dedicated so much time to this activity."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those who don’t know much about this field, this seems incredible. The reality is that this a tech demo that Neuralink is using to practice the basics. For other research groups in this field, this is tech from 20 years ago.The current state of the art is humans, mostly quadriplegic people, with chips which let them control robot arms with enough accuracy to pick up small delicate objects, play games, and type by thinking words. Current state of the art implants let people get tactile feedback too - they can intuitively know the position of the arm they’re controlling and feel the amount of pressure on each finger tip.I had the pleasure of meeting a man with an implant in 2016 and the technology he was using was incredible. He could pick up a grape with his arm without crushing it and then eat it. If the arm was in another room, he could feel around with it to find objects. He described how the arm just felt like a part of his body when it’s turned on.To use SpaceX as an analogy: this isn’t a first flight. This is more like a static test fire. If Neuralink follows the SpaceX trajectory of driving down cost/increasing innovation, it results will be really out of this world. Stuff that would just sound bonkers right now."</p>

I wrote an article about this initial support series and what it took to make things work properly on this machine:https://asahilinux.org/2021/03/progress-report-january-febru...It still applies to what got merged; the past month was spent on clean-ups, fixes, and review feedback, but there are no major changes to the approach. This initial merge was quite complex as it has to touch a number of subsystems and core kernel code in order to support the M1&#39;s quirks, and it was CCed to ~20 people. Now that it&#39;s done we can more efficiently work on individual drivers and subsystems, so I expect the pace to pick up.If you would like to support my work on this project, I do have a Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/marcanI also streamed initial development on YouTube and will be resuming streams next week (patch feedback and git rebasing and munging doesn&#39;t make for very interesting streams, but now I&#39;m back to coding). Coming up I have some driver support other people have been working on, and then I&#39;ll be writing a minimal hypervisor that can run macOS as a guest, to help reverse engineer the hardware - this will be important for reverse engineering more complex drivers cleanly, especially the GPU kernel side.Until now we&#39;ve used a serial cable to debug/load kernels (needs a DIY arduino thing, an proper design I&#39;m working on which is still vapourware, or another M1 box), but Sven added support for the USB device controller and I&#39;ll merge it into our bootloader soon, so from this point on anyone will be able to do quick kernel iteration, debugging, and hardware exploration with just a standard USB cable and any other host machine."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Story about him (from the Guardian, via Reddit):Hargreaves was a yeoman aboard the destroyer HMS Wallace on which Philip, son of Prince Andrew of Greece, had been appointed first lieutenant - second-in-command - at the age of 21. In July 1943, engaged in the Allied landings in Sicily, the ship came under repeated bombardment at dead of night and its crew realised that they would probably lose their lives.It was then Philip conjured up a plan to throw overboard a wooden raft with smoke floats that would create the illusion of debris ablaze on the water. As he hoped, the German plane was fooled into attacking the raft while the Wallace sailed to safety under cover of darkness.Hargreaves recalled the terrifying events of that night on the website: &#39;It was obvious that we were the target for tonight and they would not stop until we had suffered a fatal hit. It was for all the world like being blindfolded and trying to evade an enemy whose only problem was getting his aim right. There was no doubt in anyone&#39;s mind that a direct hit was inevitable.&#39;There was no question but to accept that on the next run or the one after that we had little chance of survival. I had been through so much that the feeling of anger and frustration was as great as the fear I and everyone else felt.&#39;It was less than five minutes after the aircraft had departed and - if the previous space in time was approximately the same - we had about 20 minutes to come up with something. We couldn&#39;t steam far in that time, not even far enough to make the aircraft think we had moved.&#39;He continued: &#39;The first lieutenant [Philip] went into hurried conversation with the captain, and the next thing a wooden raft was being put together on deck. Within five minutes they launched a raft over the side - at each end was fastened a smoke float. When it hit the water the smoke floats were activated and billowing clouds of smoke interspersed with small bursts of flame gave a convincing imitation of flaming debris in the water.&#39;The captain ordered full ahead and we steamed away from the raft for a good five minutes and then he ordered the engines stopped. The tell-tale wake subsided and we lay there quietly in the soft darkness and cursed the stars, or at least I did. Quite some time went by until we heard aircraft engines approaching.&#39;The sound of the aircraft grew louder until I thought it was directly overhead and I screwed up my shoulders in anticipation of the bombs. The next thing was the scream of the bombs, but at some distance. The ruse had worked and the aircraft was bombing the raft. I suppose he was under the impression that he had hit us in his last attack and was now finishing the job.&#39;We lay there waiting for him to leave, which he did, and, in view of the solitary attacks so well spaced apart, we were convinced he would not return. It had been marvellously quick thinking, conveyed to a willing team and put into action as if rehearsed.&#39;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The virus does have an inexplicable feature: a so-called “furin cleavage site” in the spike protein that helps SARS-CoV-2 pry its way into human cells. While such sites are present in some coronaviruses, they haven’t been found in any of SARS-CoV-2’s closest known relatives.This is false.  First of all it should be stated clearer that there has been parallel evolution across several branches of coronaviruses which have independently evolved a furin cleavage site (so there is evolutionary pressure and advantage for coronaviruses to follow this path):https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187350612...And then the statement is just wrong.  The related sarbecoviruses found in Thailand have similar furin cleavage sites:&gt; The RacCS203 S gene is most similar to that of RmYN02 (Supplementary Fig. 3a). The two viruses shared part of the furin cleavage site unique to SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Fig. 3b) and have an almost identical RBD aa sequence with only two residue differences out of 204 aa residueshttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21240-1"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel that for people paying attention to COVID news, this has always been the case; there&#39;s never been any kind of conclusive evidence on the origin of the virus (that I&#39;ve read of). The article outlines three main possible origins - natural, accidental combination in lab, deliberate construction in lab. (There&#39;s a fourth option I&#39;ve seen floating around - deliberate release of a constructed virus.) It seems that most of the scientists in the article are considering the second option; however, right-wing media has apparently in multiple instances sought to take their work to push the third, or even fourth option.It is thoroughly unsurprising to me that most scientific publications would take a stance against releasing studies or articles considering option two or three, as right-wing media and politicians were/are fishing for anything with a suitable scientific veneer they could throw out as evidence of someone to blame. (And its not hard to see why - telling your constituents they have to deal with job losses, family deaths and lockdowns because someone in China ate a bat leaves people without something to blame, and the politicians tend to be the closest relevant people.) Given the amount of anti-asian racism/crime/murder we&#39;ve seen spiking in the last year, I think the publications&#39; stances  (and the more mainstream media) to lean heavily towards option one is understandable - no one wants to be the used as justification for hate crimes or political action a la the Iraq war buildup.Perhaps in another year or two things will have cooled down enough that stuff like this can be considered without collateral damage."</p>

What do you get out of posting them to another website?This question has always been weird to me, but apparently there are people who don’t experience “this thing is good, i wish to contribute” or “this has brought me joy, i wish to give something back”. I mean, thankfully there are still enough others that we can have Wikipedia, where you also don’t get anything in return. Not even “clout”. Sometimes someone will send you a thank you and that’ll make your day. Open Source is another obvious one, but it extends to the real world, too. Some people will plant flowers in public places or do yarnbombing or pick up trash in the neighborhood or whatever. Why do it? What do you get out of it? I mean, I don’t want to be harsh saying “what a dumb question”, but it just kind of makes me uncomfortable how it challenges something that should be celebrated.The next question about it being invasive is good and valid, but this one on its own just sounds like “why not content yourself with passively consuming”.

Interesting, not my cup of tea, but definitely interesting.Something else that caught my attention was how early he believes his interest for feet developed, as early as six and nine years of age. I wonder how this slightly amusing predilection grows and develops over time, as to even gain sexual connotation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; CPUs have somewhat plateaued in their single core performance in the past decadeIn fact for many cases single core performance has dropped at a given relative price-point. Look at renting inexpensive (not bleeding edge) bare-metal servers: the brand new boxes often have a little less single-core performance than units a few years old, but have two, three, or four times the number of cores at a similar inflation/other adjusted cost.For most server workloads, at least where there is more than near-zero concurrency, adding more cores is far more effective than trying to make a single core go faster (up to a point - there are diminishing returns when shoving more and more cores into one machine, even for embarrassingly parallel workloads, due to other bottlenecks, unless using specialist kit for your task).It can be more power efficient too despite all the extra silicon - one of the reasons for the slight drop (rather than a plateau) in single core oomph is that a small drop in core speed (or a reduction in the complexity via pipeline depth and other features) can create a significant reduction in power consumption. Once you take into account modern CPUs being able to properly idle unused cores (so they aren&#39;t consuming more than a trickle of energy unless actively doing something) it becomes a bit of a no-brainer in many data-centre environments. There are exceptions to every rule of course - the power dynamic flips if you are running every core at full capacity most or all of the time (i.e. crypto mining)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Historically, the Windows Command Prompt and the built-in Terminal.app on macOS were very slow at handling tons of output.A very old trick I remember on Windows, is to minimize command prompts if a lot of output was expected and would otherwise slow down the process. I don&#39;t know if it turned write operations into a no-op, or bypassed some slow GDI functions, but it had an extremely noticeable difference in performance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;&#34;Closing File Handles on WindowsMany years ago I was profiling Mercurial to help improve the working directory checkout speed on Windows, as users were observing that checkout times on Windows were much slower than on Linux, even on the same machine.I thought I could chalk this up to NTFS versus Linux filesystems or general kernel/OS level efficiency differences. What I actually learned was much more surprising.When I started profiling Mercurial on Windows, I observed that most I/O APIs were completing in a few dozen microseconds, maybe a single millisecond or two ever now and then. Windows/NTFS performance seemed great!Except for CloseHandle(). These calls were often taking 1-10+ milliseconds to complete. It seemed odd to me that file writes - even sustained file writes that were sufficient to blow past any write buffering capacity - were fast but closes slow. It was even more perplexing that CloseHandle() was slow even if you were using completion ports (i.e. async I/O). This behavior for completion ports was counter to what the MSDN documentation said should happen (the function should return immediately and its status can be retrieved later).While I didn&#39;t realize it at the time, the cause for this was/is Windows Defender. Windows Defender (and other anti-virus / scanning software) typically work on Windows by installing what&#39;s called a filesystem filter driver. This is a kernel driver that essentially hooks itself into the kernel and receives callbacks on I/O and filesystem events. It turns out the close file callback triggers scanning of written data. And this scanning appears to occur synchronously, blocking CloseHandle() from returning. This adds milliseconds of overhead.&#34;PDS: Observation: In an OS, if I/O (or more generally, API calls) are initially written to run and return quickly -- this doesn&#39;t mean that they won&#39;t degrade (for whatever reason), as the OS expands and/or underlying hardware changes, over time...For any OS writer, present or future, a key aspect of OS development is writing I/O (and API) performance tests, running them regularly, and immediately halting development to understand/fix the root cause -- if and when performance anomalies are detected... in large software systems, in large codebases, it&#39;s usually much harder to gain back performance several versions after performance has been lost (i.e., Browsers), than to be disciplined, constantly test performance, and halt development (and understand/fix the root cause) the instant any performance anomaly is detected..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was a teenager, my music teacher always had a copy of the Real Book around. I went to a local music store and was looking through their music books when one of the employees asked, &#39;is there something I can help you find?&#39; When I said the Real Book, he said, &#39;oh, we don&#39;t keep that out here&#39;... he disappeared for a minute and came back with a copy from the back room. At the time, I felt like I had been admitted into a secret club."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was learning to play the saxophone my instructor had an old copy of the Real Book. The transcriptions of songs by some of the jazz legends  would blow my mind. I thought the people being able to transcribe those were geniuses (still do). They had no sophisticated software to help them. It was all done manually by listening to countless hours of recordings over and over again. All those chord changes, harmonies, the extra fast tempo...That also reminds me of Phil Schapp. He used to run (probably still does) a radio program at Columbia University. Most astonishing encyclopedic knowledge of jazz!! Have a listen sometime. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_SchaapEdit: Added Wikipedia link."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a bassist. I got my Real Book in 1982. I was already playing in the high school jazz band, but as a suburban kid, I had zero exposure to things like jam sessions and live jazz performances. Nobody had taught me how to learn harmonies from recordings, so I was kind of lost. The Real Book gave me a way to follow recorded tunes and grasp what the players were doing. Later on, being able to play from &#34;lead sheets&#34; enabled me to play with musicians who were a lot better than me, and was really how I learned to play.But eventually, I was hauling a ton of fake books to every gig. About 20 years ago, I was running late, and decided to leave my fake books behind. And I survived. I had memorized most of the tunes that were played regularly in my locale, and forced myself to learn the rest by ear, on the bandstand.So I tell people that the two best things I&#39;ve done for my jazz playing were: Getting a Real Book, and getting rid of my Real Book. Today, those tunes are hopelessly overplayed, and I prefer finding bands to play with, who are willing to venture off the beaten path, with less familiar tunes or especially original material."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The purpose of qualified immunity is to permit officials to carry out their discretionary duties without fear of personal liability or harassing litigation.It applies to all parts of government. Didn&#39;t get the building permit for your kids horse barn? Sue the planning commission members individually. Animal control writes you a citation for Puddles not being on a leash? Unleash the lawyers. Health department gave your wine bar a bad rating? Sue the inspector personally.The way to fix policing isn&#39;t by making the rest of government worse. Reform unions for employees of the people. Create independent civilian oversight boards with the teeth to suspend and terminate. Invest more in mental health and drug rehabilitation services. Invest in educational resources to teach communities how to deal with law enforcement.Edit to add: People are confusing civil liability with criminal liability.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I understand the arguments that &#34;QI has reasonable goals in theory&#34;, but it is time to throw the baby out with the bathwater. If cops didn&#39;t want to lose QI, they should have held themselves to account for the last few decades. Maybe the unions should have spoken up when cops steal tens of thousands of dollars in cash from a suspect, and get away with it due to QI.San Antonio, TX will be voting in May on whether to disband the police union. &#34;Back the Blue&#34; types are saying it&#39;s Defund in disguise, that we won&#39;t be able to find good cops, and so on.Except several large cities in Texas don&#39;t have unionized police, and they do alright. Furthermore, the cops in San Antonio can commit really awful crimes, and still have months- or years-long appeals.Being a cop isn&#39;t a right, it is a privilege and a critical duty. It should be easy to fire bad cops. SAPD, if you didn&#39;t want your union to be busted, maybe you should have  held yourselves to a higher standard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the outside, the US has big issues with race, poverty, mental health and access to firearms. That makes policing very difficult and pushes towards a &#34;shoot first&#34; approach.But since the US refuses to address any of the issues, it&#39;s stuck trying to fix the problem without being able to fix the problem.What concerns me most (and I see it here in the UK too) isn&#39;t these issues themselves, it is the inability of people (media, politicians and everyday citizens) to have an adult conversation about any of it. If the US collectively said &#34;we accept these events as a downside of our way of life&#34; I might not agree but I&#39;d understand. Instead people act like they&#39;re surprised or pretend they can be fixed by tinkering around the edges. It seems quite dishonest..."</p>

Expect more to sign on to this idea; it is the ultimate tool for cancel culture proponents.- Foreword: I am not making a constitutional argument. Private companies now own most of the highways we use for speech, much less widespread speech. Sure, Newspapers and mail can be argued, but there&#39;s plenty of examples where they had to tolerate nasty messages for some self-imposed access to speech principles. Secondarily, nobody used a newspaper to talk to their auntie, while Twitch isn&#39;t Facebook or Twitter self-expression is not limited to certain platforms.

(Plus the platform is unusable without Adblock).Top streamers have been banned or lost partnerships for playing their own music[0], stating controversial political opinions[1][2], getting trolled by users who &#34;snipe&#34; streamers and shout vulgarities, or just accidentally showing movie clips with nudity [3]. From what I gather, the ban appeal process is byzantine and is heavily biased towards inaction. Oftentimes appeals are never even considered, or partnership staff plainly doesn&#39;t respond.The upsetting part is Twitch is such a great platform technology wise, and its competitors can&#39;t seem to recreate the same magic.
