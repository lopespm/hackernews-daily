								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s the note from Yvon https://www.patagonia.com/ownership/One of the most interesting parts of this is the choice to make Holdfast a C4.  They really wanted to make this a political organization, and were willing to forgo a staggering amount of tax savings - in fact, $17m in tax donating away a $3b asset.  Probably the least effective estate planning from a raw $ perspective in history.Major props to the family for doing this - this is now the definition of &#34;putting your money where your mouth is&#34;, and I hope this model is a success and serves as a template for others to follow."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; they really embody this notion that every billionaire is a policy failure.If only more people realised this. Instead we do the opposite and worship the system which make them happen.Very inspiring overall. I&#39;ve always heard good things about the company but never knew of the founder. There&#39;s something about seeing one carry such dignified ideals throughout their life, without wavering to societal expectations, that is so admirable."</p>

Seriously, stop issuing cards without chips and send new card readers to theses businesses. End of story.Is it because US businesses use deeply embedded card readers in custom POS machines that aren&#39;t modular?Everywhere I go in South America and Europe, businesses have portable readers. The card companies just sent them new readers and they were accepting chips overnight. Same when NFC was introduced.The US payment and banking systems are truly maddening."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had the opportunity to design my own set of wheels with a friend for my Mustang GT. I put a thread together with photos of the process from start to finish, it was a lot of fun. I don&#39;t have the Mustang anymore, but the wheels are stacked in my garage awaiting a future project. https://www.mustang6g.com/forums/threads/arcane-stellar-–-a-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One day, I believe car design regulations will be amended to allow fully electric braking (ie. no hydraulics, drums, rotors, or pads).   At that point, the motor can be moved into the wheel (unsprung mass = bad, but weight savings from not needing an axle or gearbox will outweigh this).  Suspension and steering design is then far easier, because there is no axle to need to keep straight.Braking redundancy will be achieved by having motors/brakes on all four wheels, and within each motor 3 independant phase coils with independant controllers, such that there are effectively 12 brakes on a car.   Normally the controllers work together for smooth braking, traction control, software differential, etc.  But even after 3+ failures braking performance should still be satisfactory for an emergency stop.Obviously braking energy needs to go somewhere.  In the happy case, it&#39;s regen&#39;ed into a battery.  If the battery can&#39;t accept it, it gets dumped into dump resistors.  If the dump resistors fail, it gets dumped into motor coils (of which there are 12 remember).  Obviously the motor coils will heat up very fast, so this is probably a one-use-only failsafe, like airbags.So the whole system (except the pedal itself) is 12 way redundant."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; When crashes do occur an engineer needs to spend time to diagnose how it happened and what caused it. Since Pingora&#39;s inception we’ve served a few hundred trillion requests and have yet to crash due to our service code.&gt; In fact, Pingora crashes are so rare we usually find unrelated issues when we do encounter one. Recently we discovered a kernel bug soon after our service started crashing. We&#39;ve also discovered hardware issues on a few machines, in the past ruling out rare memory bugs caused by our software even after significant debugging was nearly impossible.That&#39;s quite the endorsement of Rust. A lot of people focus on the fact that Rust can&#39;t absolutely guarantee freedom from crashes and memory safety issues. Which I think misses the point that this kind of experience of running high traffic Rust services in production for months almost without a single issue is common in practice."</p>

After downloading a QR reader app, taking a picture with my phone, uploading the picture to the app, then realizing there was too much glare and trying again, they eventually just gave me a beer and put a tally mark on a notepad.Just a few weeks ago I used a QR code to join a WiFi network and it took like 2 seconds (it found the network and entered the password for me).

In 1979, four of their best programmers left after demanding equity in the sales and were refused. Their CEO Ray Kassar famously said, &#34;You’re no more important to those projects than the person on the assembly line who put them together. You’re a dime a dozen. You’re not unique. Anybody can do ­a ­cartridge.&#34;. They left and formed Activision which led to a sequence of failures by Atari until they finally died unable to compete with the likes of Intellivision, Colecovision, and Commodore."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked for a company big enough to be in the HN headlines (sorry, have to stay somewhat anonymous) where development virtually stalled for a couple years after a mass exodus event. The CEO went on a rampage and fired some people on the spot for something they weren’t even responsible for, which destroyed the already fragile morale and created a steady exodus of good talent over a couple of years.It didn’t kill the company for several reasons, but primarily because:1) The company had enough momentum, revenue, and cash in the bank that they could go on hiring sprees to replace everyone. The new hires had a lot of churn when they realized what was going on, so they just kept hiring until enough replacements stuck around.2) Many of the employees who didn’t quit saw this as their opportunity to rise through the ranks and fill the voids. They weren’t wrong and it paid off for many of them in the form of rapid promotions and advancement. The CEO became more hands-off as he realized his micromanagement wasn’t helping, so they basically inherited a slightly better situation.After this experience, I don’t really see a developer exodus killing any big company with good momentum and decent cash reserves. As long as a company has cash flow they can spend their way into hiring replacements as long as it takes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Being a senior engineer is weird when looking retrospectively. I remember being a junior and experiencing what the author is talking about with respect to puzzlingly staring at my seniors when they could answer obscure questions.Now I do it and do the same things they did with me: facilitate my thought and troubleshooting process rather than give me answers. I think the people that are successful in Senior+ engineering are that way because of certain technical and character traits they&#39;ve developed.One is a willingness to be right in the long run. When I was a young engineer I would make my cases hard with data. As a senior engineer I sit back and let the machine mull for a while because I know that&#39;s what the engineering machine will do regardless of how technically right I may be. Another is knowing that right isn&#39;t always right. Sometimes the right answer is technically wrong, or the learnings of wrong need to be made before we collectively can be right. Another is a lot of patience; patience for myself, patience for others. I recently admitted I was behind on work because my power was out for three straight days. Young me would&#39;ve found a coffee shop and worked those days with a single monitor down to the bone. Senior me took my dog to the park.Not everyone makes it to senior, had I not forked my path in certain places I don&#39;t think I would have. My advice, relish your time as non-senior and ask lots of non-technical questions. The technical stuff comes over time and by necessity."</p>

He ended up switching majors."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Where I am often hung up in comparison is due to age. I dropped out of college and spent my early 20s learning agriculture and construction. Now I work in software engineering and my current manager is younger than me. Not only is he younger than me, but he&#39;s been able to climb up to an engineering manager in a shorter amount of time than I&#39;ve been working as a SWE. So I feel really lame - wasted so much time early in my life and still seem to be wasting time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yes it’s a negative feedback loop created by the very bad product decisions they made to optimize for local maxima of getting more ads revenue. You inject more and more ads followed by more and more suggested content, thereby reducing the in network content. The in network content doesn’t get as much of traction, therefore people stop posting. This in turn forces the feed to have more and more suggestions and a few stale in network posts from days ago. This drives engagement down from people who want to see in network content and they leave. So what is left is people who do engage with suggested content, pushing the product to make decisions to push even more suggested content. All of this continues till eventually fatigue sets in and a sudden rapid drop in engagement kicks in because your global maxima of a quality product was lost long time ago and your product dies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Crazy idea: FB should stop trying to lure people back from Tiktok with weird features and just lean in to its one remaining strength, which is that among social media sites, it&#39;s the most generic and boring and ubiquitous.  Being the default place for non-influencers to do quotidian stuff like hearing about school closings, joining the PTA or HOA, coordinating family gatherings, see your nephew&#39;s school photos, etc would be a pretty good little business.  And they already have all of that functionality built, so they could run significantly leaner, and hence not have to drive their remaining users away with excessive ads.This seems like a good idea to me.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Even though it is many orders of magnitude simpler than the real-world equivalent, I find that there is no better way of grasping the logistics of modern civilization than playing Factorio.In fact, it&#39;s probably in the Goldilocks zone: easy enough to play, but complicated enough to convey the kind of resource, energy and transport logistics involved in scaling a multi-step production process. It is like an illustrative toy model.The aliens even give the game a satisfying environmental and political dimension, though the mechanics in this respect are more straightforward, i.e., just kill the aliens. Though emitting less pollution with solar also helps."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Curious to see how well it translates to controllers. I know there is limited support on the Steam Deck, but I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s still subpar to traditional mouse/keyboard controls.From the link:Factorio was developed for 10 years with only keyboard and mouse in mind, so making sure the game is fully playable with controllers was no easy task. Playing with a controller is slightly slower, and will take some getting used to (just as it does when playing with keyboard and mouse for the first time). After becoming familiar with it, I find it very comfortable. I recommend everyone to play through the first levels of our tutorial campaign, as it&#39;s a great way to get acquainted with playing Factorio with a controller."</p>

This seemed like a monumental shift to me at the time, and me and my friends had just started to write our own freeware and shareware video games for the platform. I named our software company SloppyDisk Software. We stuck to that brand for around 10 years, releasing games like Sloppy Sokoban, Pong Wars, and Descender.Crazy to think that now there&#39;s just one disk supplier hanging on to a bulk order of floppies, supplying the whole world.Here&#39;s what sloppydisk.com looked like in its heyday, for those interested: http://web.archive.org/web/20070921170305/http://www.sloppyd..."</p>

Picking up a caddy of disks, thumbing through reading the labels, sliding them into the drive and hearing the motor whirr.Nowadays, my caddy has been replaced with a small plastic bag full of chips and thumbdrives. Even though my small bag can easily hold millions of times more data, the little chips aren&#39;t a joy to use. None of them have labels telling their contents. All of them are fiddly. They are obnoxiously easy to loose."</p>

There were still some numerically controlled machine tools running off paper tape. In 2019, NSA punched a crypto key into paper tape for the last time. As far as I can tell, nobody in the US still sells punched paper tape.Although if you really need it, you could get it made. I restore old Teletype machines, including the kind that printed on 5/16&#34; paper tape. I had a thousand rolls of such tape made up by a company in China, that being the minimum order, and I still sell some now and then to Teletype collectors."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This bit from the employee announcement about how they&#39;re handling equity vesting [1] is worth highlighting as a pretty classy move, all things considered:&gt; We’re waiving the one-year equity vesting cliff for all departing employees so that everyone has an opportunity to be a shareholder, regardless of your tenure. [...] All departing teammates will qualify for an extended option exercise period of 5 years, and we have extended it to 7 years in regions where we are legally able.It must be jarring to be on the receiving end of a layoff. In the grand scheme of things, a laid-off employee surely has bigger things to worry about... but I still think what they did here with the equity, especially the option exercise period, is a nice touch. Not many companies do this sort of thing, but they should.[1]: https://blog.patreon.com/a-note-from-jack"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Full post from Jack Conte&#39;s Instagram post:&#34;Hi everyone - I have some sad news to share: today, Patreon is doing a layoff of about 80 employees, about 17% of our team. This was ultimately my decision, so I wanted you all to hear directly from me about the reasoning.Before I do, I want to say two things: first, today will be painful for many people, and I am deeply sorry to the incredible teammates who will be leaving Patreon - they are good, kind, creator-first, exceptionally talented, and smart people.And second, I remember how nerve-racking it was when I was a full time creator - before starting Patreon - to watch companies that I depended on go through moments like this. So for those of you who rely on Patreon for your business and communities: I want to assure you that the company is making this move precisely for that reason - so we can continue to be a rock for your business.As the world has recovered from COVID lockdowns and entered a broader economic slowdown, it has become clear that the original plan we built doe he year, to support outsized growth through the pandemic, is no longer the right plan for the company.I take full responsibility for choosing that original path forward, and for the resulting changes today, which will be so difficult for our team.It&#39;s important to me that we continue to deliver for our creators and patrons with new features and products like native video, new content creation and organization tools, a wold-class mobile experience, and new ways for creators to grow their membership and strengthen their communities. To ensure that we make progress on that roadmap, we are increasing our investment in product, engineering, and design, which means decreasing our spend on other ares of the company.Ad difficult as this is fo our team, I know this is the right thing to do for Patreon, because it ensures that the company maintains a position of strength, even through an economic downturn, while continuing to deliver for our creators.If you want to read more about this decision, I just published the internal note I sent to our team this morning, and it&#39;s linked in my bio. I&#39;m going to stop posting here for a while to be 100% present internally for our teammates at the company. But I promise to come back in a bit - I will see you all soon.- Jack&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What does “taking full responsibility” even mean? Like people lose their livelihood and you can get away with “I take full responsibility”.Taking full responsibility mean taking a pay cut or stepping down or basically taking consequences for yourself first before others have to."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hard to overstate Godard&#39;s importance to the film world, both as a critic and a filmmaker. As a critic with Cahiers du Cinema he and others championed many forgotten Hollywood films and established one of the first recognizable &#39;canons&#39; of film -- one of the beginning points of film history as a subject. And unlike his predecessor and colleague Bazin, Godard went beyond theory to actually create films that embodied the radical new ideas about film that the Cahiers crowd promoted. I&#39;ve seen people in the thread mentioning Italian Neorealism, and some of the great Hollywood films of  the 50s, all fantastic examples of forward-thinking film art. But Godard and his contemporaries&#39; contributions were about synthesizing earlier developments with a pop-art bent in a way that destroyed established boundaries of the medium and paved the way for explosions of film creativity on the continent and beyond. His genius was finding a middle ground between directors like Hawks and Rosselini, or Ford and Renoir, and using that space to create indelible masterpieces. RIP JLG"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Le Mépris (Contempt) is by far my favourite movie, peak cinema. Absolutely stunning Mediterranean cinematography, beautiful coastal and indoor shots, a decent plot with Odysseus in the background, and certainly not hurt by Brigitte Bardot&#39;s onscreen presence. Overall unbeatable aesthetics.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0Ju0ONwGUWatching it is like taking a short vacation. Phenomenal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is hard to overstate how much Godard changed cinema, even in America. If you don’t believe me check for yourself. Open the best picture nominees between 55’-65’ and watch their trailers. Films like Marty/On the waterfront/12 angry men/To kill a mockingbird/The Caine Mutiny/Sweet smell of success is what movies were like in the late 50s.The acting/writing was pompous, actors talked like reciting Shakespear. The movies were about heros of impeccable character doing heroic things and there always was a happy ending. Movie shots followed strict guidelines and the creative head of the movie was the producer while the director was akin to a contractor, someone hired to film the scenes.Starting in the mid 60s there was a radical shift, topping the nominations we have films like Five Easy Pieces, The French Connection, The Godfather, One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, The Deer Hunter, Dog Day Afternoon, Taxi Driver etc. Actors would act and behave like normal everyday people facing everyday problems. The new Archetype is the Anti-Hero, someone with flaws/vices in their character, someone that viewers can relate to. We see the rise of the director as the auteur, the creative master of a film. Every known filmaking rule is being tested to it’s limits and broken by young experimenting directors.The catalyst for this change was the French New Wave, a group of young filmmakers tired of the old style of cinema wanting to do films about their own life and experiences. The poster boy for the New Wave was Jean-Luc Godard starting this revolution with his 1960 film Breathless."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I made an API for a bank...   I was a third party and made the API by screen scraping their webUI.   I sent their devs a link and initially there were positive messages going back and forth.The API allowed you to see balance, transaction history, and make payments.Before long, the API got quite popular, and lots of people were using it to make lots of payments automatically.You know what makes money laundering super easy...   a banking API so you can split the million dollars you want to launder into 1 million 1 dollar payments.   And an API client which lets you treat each login cookie and account as an object in python.Before long, the API and all users who had ever used it were perma-banned from the bank, because it was determined they posed too high a fraud/money-laundering risk.I&#39;m still salty because, after spending a week of my life building and refining that API, they banned me and 6 years later still claim they can&#39;t return the $350 that was in the account because they are still &#39;investigating&#39;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Anything that you can achieve with PDFs, presence, and persistence in a bank branch you can do with our API.Not sure how to take this. With a small tweak like &#34;you can eventually do&#34; I would let it pass without criticism.I work with bank cores, imaging, BSA and related middleware on a daily basis. The scope and complexity of these systems is incomprehensible to most. Many of our clients don&#39;t even try to think about how fucked up their business is. They prefer to hire Deloitte and other vendors like us to be stressed about it for them.To give you an idea of how comprehensive a &#34;full&#34; banking API is, our combined WSDL and XSD references total ~9 megabytes. This is before codegen. The final reference sources as generated into the .NET codebase total nearly 20 megabytes. This is just the types &amp; method signatures. The actual implementations live in an IBM system manufactured some time during the previous millennium.But, none of that really matters. Whatever API method you call against a specific bank will have behavior that ultimately depends on a million things specific to them _and the region within which they operate_. So, its not enough to simply integrate with this massive API. You also have to understand a multi-dimensional matrix of regulations, end-customer behaviors, technological constraints, active geopolitical affairs, et. al."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"W4 Games&#39;s CEO Juan Linietsky is the creator and lead dev of Godot. Their primary mission, from my understanding, is providing the non-open-source tooling and support that&#39;s needed to make it feasible to use Godot as an environment for developing console games. The SDK&#39;s and their APIs cannot be included in the FOSS Godot code directly.Juan shared a blog post about the state of console support in Godot shortly before the launch of W4 that gives some more insight: https://godotengine.org/article/godot-consoles-all-you-need-...Often time folks say that what Godot is missing is a &#34;killer app&#34; that shows that the platform is viable. I think that this could potentially go a long way towards that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve started using Godot (4.0-alpha) for some hobby game dev recently. In the past I&#39;ve done a fair amount with Unity and touched Unreal once or twice. Thoughts so far:Godot is far from perfect. It&#39;s definitely more sparse than the others in terms of features. I&#39;ve encountered some bugs (nothing show-stopping, and it&#39;s tough to say how much of that is just from using the alpha version, but it has impacted my flow). There are unfortunate quirks; for example, saving scripts always saves the whole scene, and saving large scenes can pause the editor for multiple seconds, which is a particularly annoying combination. The programming model is heavily OOP. The custom scripting language, GDScript, is a blessing and a curse; its tight integration with the engine comes at the cost of subpar tooling (and of course, just learning a new language with new quirks).But.Godot has the distinct feeling of being cohesive. It feels like it was designed by one person, who knows what it takes to make games, and set out with a holistic vision. Everything you might need to do has an answer, or at least a story. You don&#39;t get confusing mixed signals from different parts of the interface or from the docs; there&#39;s one, intentionally-designed way to do each thing. GDScript has its quirks, but it also has very elegant built-ins for doing engine-specific stuff that would be super clunky in a general-purpose language. Using Godot almost has the feeling of using (good) Apple software; somebody anticipated your needs, and made sure they&#39;d be met. Maybe not in the exact way you would have picked, but in a way that will work, and will fit in with everything else.That, combined with it being fully open-source, makes it feel like it has good bones. Especially in contrast with Unity - which felt like a growing pile of corpses being tossed on top of each other with each release - it&#39;s been so refreshing that it&#39;s singlehandedly gotten me back into hobby game dev. I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m wasting my time learning one half-baked API that&#39;s going to be replaced with another half-baked API six months from now. For every annoyance or missing feature in Godot, I have faith that things will continue to improve - because they&#39;re built on a solid foundation - or that I could at least build it myself if I really needed to.I believe in the vision and the future of this piece of software. And that makes it feel worthwhile to invest the time learning all its quirks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice! I don&#39;t think W4 has created any games though. To get some REAL traction, Godot needs some full well-known games published. Basically, we need a game to do to Godot, what Undertale and Nuclear Throne did to GameMaker.We have Wrought Flesh by Miziziziz, but other than that I can&#39;t think of a single game actually produced by Godot. I know it is capable of it, but we need a &#34;killer app&#34; to make it really blow up."</p>

I pick it up from time to time and enjoy chewing on one or two chapters of material.But I&#39;ve yet to figure out if the book actually has a specific thesis.  I know it&#39;s all about the power of interpretation and the way in which interpreting a formal system as self-referencing has the effect of completely blowing up the intended design of that system.  But can someone sum up how this connects to consciousness beyond the obvious way in which consciousness plays the role of the interpreter?  Or is that itself the thesis of the book?  Or maybe that consciousness is the originator of self-reference?Bottom line is that I think the thesis can be summed up in a few sentences, but apparently it takes a whole 800 page book to get to the point.  Would love other people&#39;s thoughts on what that point is ultimately.  By the way, as salty as I sound about it, I love GEB.  So don&#39;t get me wrong :)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The cost of building a consumer audio product is generally no more than 30% of retail. 30% COGS (cost of goods sold) is virtually a maximum for items sold at mainstream retailers.There’s nothing wrong with this. These are standard ratios, not some dirty secret.The cost of goods sold is only a fraction of the costs that go into getting products all the way into the customers’ hands and supporting them (customer support, warranty replacements, lost shipments, fraudulent orders, etc.). That’s not even counting the R&amp;D investment costs that go into making the product, as the post says.Salaries, warehousing, shipping, insurance, and all of the others costs of doing business add up.It’s not actually realistic to expect an entire company to be selling you a $300 product that costs them something like $250 to build. Every business in existence must build in enough margin to pay the people who do all of the work to make it happen and support it.If this seems shocking, consider that the COGS of software as a service products are much lower by comparison. Doesn’t matter, though, because you have to pay all of those expensive salaries to make it happen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems to apply across the entire Small Plastic-covered Electronics sector.  I worked for an instrumentation/sporting goods manufacturer among others and this reads like I wrote it myself.The CEO, even of a small operation, likely has no idea what the performance characteristics of their devices are.  They exist to raise capital and deal with paperwork.We operated at about a 25% bom cost which was muuuuch higher than it needed to be but we were the aforementioned $50 components assembled by baboons case.  The products were very high end meters and sensors with the electrical sophistication of a McDonalds toy, just using whatever the highest end parts Arrow et al would sell us.Like they aluded to, ultimately it&#39;s all the little stuff that gets you.  Packaging, whatever voodoo the S&amp;M team is up to, random IT bullshit, heath insurance, random FCC compliance stuff, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Years ago I visited a friend in emmm..., &#34;Europe&#34;. He was not home and the neighbour let us in.

There I heard the most lifelike sound I ever heard from any speakers. I wondered: these should be some crazy European brand... no brand names anywhere on the boxes.Later that night I asked about the speakers and he went: &#34;What? They sound good?&#34;It turns out his friend works at &#34;Insert big European brand, not only audio here&#34; and they decided to make a great pair of speakers. Then he brings home a measurement device north of 6 figure €s, and they tune it so that you would not be able to distinguish a person talking behind you, from the recording of them being played with these speakers... Or as close you can get to that.Then they take their product to the company only to be laughed at: &#34;for anything below 5000€, we don&#39;t use any part above 50€. You have parts north of 500, this is not feasible for the market.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a degree in Studio Arts in addition to being a software developer (and recently I&#39;ve started making a lot of creative work with AI). Back when I was in school, there was already plenty of debate about &#39;what is &#34;Art&#34;&#39;? It&#39;s always been hotly contested. Most of my teachers felt that &#39;technique&#39; was not Art. Others were more purists – life painters, etc – and felt that, no, technique is art.Duchamp poked the art establishment in the eye with his &#39;readymades&#39; (urinals on the gallery wall, etc.) Warhol with his &#39;factory&#39; making silkscreens.The &#39;reverse Monet&#39; (too lazy to link) that caused such an uproar when it was shared last week was ironic – apparently people aren&#39;t aware that the impressionists themselves were considered &#39;not artists&#39; by a lot of people at the time.The camera and photography made many painters sit up and say, &#39;hey, it can&#39;t just be about &#34;image&#34; anymore&#39; – enter abstract expressionism, fauvism, cubism, etc. Work that shifted the focus from the image represented in the painting (&#39;a window into a world&#39;) onto the surface of the canvas itself: Rothko, Albers, etc.The thing is, people have wild misconceptions about what this technology does. Many clearly think it&#39;s a photocopier. As if StableDiffusion is hiding copies of all these works inside. When in fact what&#39;s been done is to take all of this online knowledge and create an incredible new tool with it. Like a music synthesizer times a million.It&#39;s understandable why this technology makes people uncomfortable. There are legit fears about displacement, economic uncertainty, etc. But we are fundamentally tool makers – it&#39;s arguably intrinsically part of what makes us human (borrowing from Carl Sagan&#39;s &#34;Dragons of Eden&#34;).If I were back in the art department last century, I&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;d be really excitedly discussing how these new tools will enable entirely new forms of expression. And sure, there&#39;d be the old guard saying it was awful, and &#39;not Art&#39;.This is a really interesting debate – I just wish it scratched deeper than the surface more often than it does, with a bit more historical context."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Aside from the debates about &#34;artistic merit&#34; and the ethics of using AI trained on existing artists&#39; work, one of the key things is that this new technology allows anyone to flood a place with images.There are some scifi-themed subreddits that I visit that allow posting art, and at this point it feels like 50% of all submissions are Midjourney/Dall-E generated art. Fine, it looks ok, but there&#39;s such a low barrier to creating and posting these, it&#39;s beginning to drown out other valuable content. The article even speaks about this:&gt; In July, one AI furry porn generator was uploading one image every 40 seconds"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s important to keep in mind that these art communities represent one very narrow kind of art, one that is more focused on illustration and graphical style, and most often not the kind of art that major art institutions work with. In the past 5 years, AI-generated art has been accepted and incorporated in the contemporary art world, with major works produced by luminaries such as Pierre Huyghe (of Ideal), Trevor Paglen (Bloom), and Hito Steyerl (Power Plants). For these artists, the graphical potency of the generated images is usually only one factor of the work, which also centers on how the artists use the technology, its origins, history, and broader uses, and what it might imply.For this kind of artwork, the kind made by artists who feel threatened by AI, I’ve been thinking for a while that a computer could likely do it better. Intricate detail, repetition, sampling and recombination of popular styles, optimization for aesthetic popularity and mass appeal — these practices are all squarely in the domain of automation, data science, and marketing. We might call it the Netflix-ification of illustration art, but it’s quite different, because the tools for making are available to many. As an arts educator and artist, I welcome these new tools, as they allow easy experimentation for newcomers, but also as they reveal that art based primarily in deployment of technical skill and eye-popping graphics is missing something vital."</p>

I’m not convinced that the complexity and security burdens of a JavaScript JIT are reasonable, and given recent developments like Microsoft Edge’s Super Duper Secure Mode, I’m interested in pushing for best-effort JIT-less performance while keeping the codebase simple.Always excited to see new JS engines. I&#39;d be curious to see where LibJS&#39;s performance / code simplicity / memory balance tends towards over time."</p>

Having this new stack grow to the point where it is becoming a viable alternative is great to see."</p>

I&#39;m not saying it can&#39;t be done, it&#39;s just not that easy. I&#39;d bet $100 bucks that most, if not all, of these matches were accomplished using good old stalking (matching post times to manually reviewing video data).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The UK media (not just the BBC) continue to profess &#34;amazement&#34; at the speed and efficiency of the transitioning from a dead monarch to a living one. There&#39;s been much speaking in awed tones at the pace of the various proclamations, committee meetings, document signings, etc, as if this pace tells us why we should be impressed.Personally I&#39;ve found it borderline sickening.If there was a curtain that could have slipped, we all knew what would be behind it: a bunch of cherry-nosed coffin-dodgers with old-school-tie chums ensconced in the machinery of state, parliament, the military, whatever.Sure. Fine. Yadda yadda, blah blah. The &#34;deep state&#34; dancing hand-in-hand with the old school elites. Yuck. Disgusting but hardly a clear and present danger.But to see this machinery spring rustily, creakily into action has been truly eye-opening. Hitherto unknown people wearing ritualistic outfits have marched into public spaces in several cities, and declared that a member of the elite has been replaced, the continuum is unbroken. And this has been broadcast 24/7 by pretty much all media in the UK and in other countries. Elected representatives from all political parties have fallen into line.It is not okay to ritualistically march a bunch of military-state personnel into multiple public spaces across the country, under the protection of the police and with the consent of multiple international media outlets, and expect public passivity and capitulation.And yet, that&#39;s what has happened. And it keeps happening.It&#39;s bizarre in the extreme, and we really should not be okay with this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They aren’t being arrested for being anti-monarchy though.They are being arrested for being rude about it.Was the fella on radio 4 who stated to the entire nation that ‘King Charles and his family should be put in a council house and that the Monarchy should be abolished’ arrested? No.If you are going to attend a funeral, any funeral, be it the Queen’s or anyone else’s and hurl abuse or hold up signs with obscenities, you will be arrested.There were arrests in which the arrestee has been unarrested, when the police made a mistake. Like the fella who stated that ‘we didn’t vote for him’ when King Charles was pronounced King.You can, quite legally, protest the Monarchy. Being a dick about it and trying to upset people mourning will however be considered a breach of the peace or some other public order offence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The new law allows police to act in cases which they deem to be &#34;unjustifiably noisy protests that may have a significant impact on others&#34; or seriously disrupt an organization&#39;s activities.Doesn&#39;t take a political science degree to see what&#39;s wrong with this law. When cops get to decide what is a justifiably loud protest and what isn&#39;t you no longer have the right to protest. Protests are meant to disrupt, if you can&#39;t be loud about it then it no longer has its intended effect."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Riding a bike doesn&#39;t need to be the only or primary way that people get around in every city, all the time, for it to drastically improve quality of life for people living in cities the world over. Most people are capable of riding a bike - especially an e-bike - to get to where they&#39;re going. It&#39;s cheaper than a car, it can be faster than driving a car, and it is obviously better for both the global climate and the local environment.More than half of all daily trips in the US are less than 3 miles[1]. If cities give people the option to ride a bike for those shorter trips without feeling unsafe, a lot of people will ride bikes to complete those trips. That&#39;s shown over and over again. Change is hard, but a future with less cars and more trips by bike and public transportation is better, and possible.[1] https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1230-marc..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just bought a bike in Bangkok.To be honest it sat in my living room for a week because of the fear of riding it on these most dangerous streets. (Bangkok has bad reputation for accidents worldwide).But today I took it out.I rode to work and it was amazing. People here respect two wheels a lot and drivers slow down for you.Normally I’d walk to work for the exercise 3km. Which is about 45 minutes for me each way.But today the riding took about 10-15 minutes with a great cardio workout.I’ll take the bike out most of the week now instead of taking a cab.Here motorcycles are the mainstay. But I’ll stick with my bike for shorter distances and cabs for longer ones."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t understand take that this is not possible due to disabled people, winter, hills. Climate and city planning is an incremental problem. Just 2 new bike lanes significantly change the way I am able to commute, even far into the winter, and when it’s raining or snowing I switch to car or public transport. I live in a reasonably bike friendly city for us standards, and it’s clear that some overhauls have made the road much more efficient for cars themselves, pedestrians don’t stray out nearly as much into the road, as did the consolidation of parking spots into parking lots. Just go see some European cities for how not only public transport, biking and a more modern street layout make life better for almost everyone.For disabled people, having dedicated parking spots as well as a pedestrian friendly street layout makes life easier than having to navigate a busy street.Make the city better for bike doesn’t mean making it hell for cars."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m glad this research is being done. I don’t use cannabis, but I also don’t frown upon it. However some of the conversations on the use of cannabis recently have changed from “it’s a drug, but it isn’t that bad” to “it is completely harmless”. Which in my opinion is very dangerous and could harm entire populations before we have enough research. In my opinion, it should be considered similar category as alcohol, cigarettes, fat and sugar, a national health issue and research needs to happen asap on various short term and long term effects."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is this really surprising?Any time I had used cannabis I felt like my IQ dropped 20-30 points and I would lose hours of my day where it was difficult for me to learn. It made doing household chores not terrible, but brought out a lot of panic inducing moments and erratic behavior. I was thinking about a 100k other things while doing one thing. Later on I realized I wasn&#39;t even doing that one thing so well. Anything that drops cognitive abilities for a moment is going to be awful long term and especially for babies.I know a lot of people think cannabis isn&#39;t bad, but it is intellectually dishonest to disregard the broader effects of effects on cognition. I say that as someone who used to smoke a ton of cannabis.Not having to rely on drugs to find calmness has made a profound change in my life, and I can&#39;t believe that I used to turn to weed, alcohol, etc. when all I needed to be permanently (key word) happy was already present within me. Prior, when the effects went away I spent just as much time craving and suffering heavily.That being said I don&#39;t think it should be criminalized or anything like that. It is up to adults to do whatever, but it is useful to be honest as well. Not everyone uses it for epilepsy, none of the dispensaries here sell CBD products. Its all high THC products meant to &#34;fuck you up&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The amount of research over last decade has been huge, even outside of this. It used to be the only way companies could research cannabis was by getting really crappy samples from a government grow house, but with legalization the supply of research samples and the quality of researchers willing to work on it has grown considerably.This is a direct safety issue. I used to moderator one of the bigger cannabis subreddits and one of the bigger questions that always came up was whether it was safe to smoke while pregnant. The answer I always gave was that we just don&#39;t know, and so it should be avoided. The lack of research though meant that people couldn&#39;t make informed decisions, and the stereotype around cannabis being safe meant that people did not always err on the side of caution. Now there is something concrete we can point to."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"With a few tweaks (monospaced variant), it could make a great coding font.Coding fonts have essentially the same goal: make similar looking characters different: 1liI|, 0O, etc... Code naturally strains our visual acuity: we want to see as much as possible, it means that we may use a smaller font size than we would find comfortable reading text with. Single letter, punctuation, etc... can be really important, in regular text, you can understand even if you can&#39;t read all the characters. So a hyperlegible font can help coders, even those with good vision, and many coding fonts already have &#34;hyperlegible&#34; features."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I also find the website confusing, the font is available here however  
https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Atkinson+Hyperlegible"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminder that fonts are subjective.This one is good for specific people, not everyone. I can&#39;t use it because I find it overly rounded with tics.An example of a font that is also meant to be legible, but is on the squarish side, is Tiresias Screenfont.Increased legibility does NOT mean &#34;flow&#34;. Just because each character is more &#34;distinct&#34; does not mean that the whole word is able to be processed with ease. Important to evaluate them in body text.Also, one&#39;s cultural background absolutely affects which fonts are preferred. If you grew up with German blackletter writing, you&#39;re not necessarily going to like or appreciate a sans-serif font. In Germany&#39;s case, the change from blackletter to latin shapes happened fairly recently (WW2). It&#39;s happening now again, Kazakhstan has decided to stop using cyrillic and change to latin characters."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To be honest, what I love about legos is the free play aspect.When I play with my kids, (now 8 and 10), I find that the key thing is not what pieces we have (admittedly, we have a lot of pieces), or instructions, but developing some theme or challenge.The theme could be ‘space’ or ‘under water’ or ‘I’m going to build the taller possible leg structure’ or ‘I’m going to build a vehicle that can be blown across the floor with a fan.’  Once they have a theme, they will do amazing stuff.Also, I believe it’s important to have a big slush pile of pieces.  It’s amazing how much builds change when your are scrounging for piece X, and you see piece Y and think, actually…I see that this app is technologically interesting for the developer, but it doesn’t address my core problem: inspiring kids to get started on free creativity.  For that, I’d more like a Lego theme of the day app, maybe slightly inspired or guided by the kids ages or genders.  If I did that, I’d have the kids submit pictures of their results, and use those over time to assess and improve the quality of my suggested themes at different ages and Lego piles sizes (there is your AI, if you must).The pitch would be ‘inspire your kids to new creativity.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just tested it on my kids lego clone bricks; there are like 800 of them but they are almost exclusively basic shapes (1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 2x3, 2x4 and 1x4) in red/black/blue/green/yellow/gray. This is a picture of the box: https://static-v3.e-jumbo.gr/uploads/resources/137879/201611... ; you&#39;ll see they are exactly like legos.The app identified 400 pieces (of the 800) and unfortunately the resulting ideas were not possible to be constructed because it required pieces we don&#39;t have. Of the 50 ideas I was only able to construct 1 or 2 that had very few pieces.I tried it a couple of times with diferent layout in pieces or lights, nothing really changed.Sorry but it doesn&#39;t work, at least with my kind of bricks."</p>

Won the BAFTA and Peabody awards that year.It&#39;s a BBC documentary in six episodes about the conflict that caused the dissolution of Yugoslavia and the wars in the Balkans.It stands out among many documentaries for being a truly dispassionate moment-to-moment record of events. No sensationalism, no grand-standing, just the facts.If you&#39;re tired of the Netflix style of documentary — lots of talking heads quickly edited together for sound bites, dramatic music, re-enactments — then this is for you.

For the first time in my life I feel like I understood the “why” of how things work in American society. This film is probably best if you’re age 40+ and actually remember some of the events."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This really is a one-click installer, which is excellent. As far as I know it&#39;s the first and only one for M1. It&#39;s quite a polished UI, but there are a lot of features missing. The first ones that come to mind are:- No way to specify a seed. This is an important part of SD workflows, letting you redo an image with a slightly tweaked a prompt.- No way to specify a custom model. Alternative models (such as Waifu Diffusion) are fun to play with too.- No way to generate batches of images.- No way to specify which sampler to use.- No way to adjust the weight of specific sub-phrases, or use negative weights.There&#39;s also no img2img yet, but it sounds like that&#39;s a planned feature.Other GUIs such as https://github.com/sd-webui/stable-diffusion-webui, https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui have many more features - but not all will be trivial to port to M1.P.S.: For the people asking - yes, it can do NSFW images. I checked."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can confirm that this works great on the M1 Max. It has been taking less than a minute to run the model and generate the images. So far I have been really satisfied with the output. Let&#39;s please make one-click installers the norm for future technology. I love nerding out, but wading through dependency hell is not worth it most of the time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Diffusion Bee is the easiest way to run Stable Diffusion locally on your M1 Mac. Comes with a one-click installer. No dependencies or technical knowledge needed.Features:
- Full data privacy - nothing is sent to the cloud
- Clean and easy to use UI
- One click installer
- No dependencies needed
- Multiple image sizes
- Optimized for M1/M2 Chips
- Runs locally on your computer"</p>

I’m not sure why this is - I think it might be because no DNS has been configured in the TLD zone for these TLDs.I was also curious about this. It turns out that it&#39;s because dig interprets some TLDs as DNS record types (MD, MG, MR, MX) or DNS classes (IN and CH) of the same name! Not sure why, but when given only a type or class (without a domain name), dig actually queries for a list of the root servers, which explains the strange results. Looks like using the -q option to specify the domain name works around this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was responsible for the Turbo C (later Borland C/C++) run-time library in the late 80s and early 90s.Tanj Bennett created our original 8087 floating point emulator. It was real mode, 16-bit code, that kept an 80-bit float in five 16-bit CPU registers as a working value during its internal math calculations. If you ever coded for the PC you will appreciate just how precious register space was on the 8086/8088.It&#39;s been a few decades and my memory is fuzzy but I don&#39;t recall any critical places where the registers had to be saved and restored. He choose math algorithms and code paths specifically to keep all five live at all times. Tanj&#39;s code flowed with an economy of motion that brought to mind the artistic performance of a professional dance troupe. I did not have the math skill and could not have ever created it as he had. It brought me genuine pleasure just to read his code.Eventually, it came time to port it to 32-bits (real and protected modes.) I wrote new exception handlers and replaced the instruction-decode logic with a nice table-driven scheme but did not touch the core math library. It still ran in 16-bits under the hood exactly as Tanj designed it.Tanj, if you happen to see this, I have fond memories of your emulator. It was beautiful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nobody has mentioned Knuth’s corpus of work in Pascal-Web for the TeX ecosystem. This is code written for an era where there wasn’t an ecosystem of libraries for common tasks and even things like being able to access a file in random access order couldn’t be counted on. Even 7-bit ASCII couldn’t be counted on as a given (EBCDIC-based IBM mainframes were a significant element of the computing landscape still).Against all that, Knuth wrote code that could be ported to other systems (I first used TeX on an IBM mainframe running VM/CMS, then later on a VAX minicomputer running VMS, then on a PC with DOS, PC with OS/2, PC with Windows and now a Mac with OS X/MacOS. His presentation of code and internal documentation intermingled is something which I could see still being useful now, although sadly, literate programming seems all but dead now. I still go back to Knuth’s code to understand how to solve some problems on occasion even though it’s about 30 years since I last wrote a line of Pascal."</p>

There&#39;s no $20k phone that will be any better.It&#39;s like flying in first class and then having to queue up in the same immigration line as everybody else - except in that scenario you can pay your way into a priority lane.True, ~$2k is still a lot for a phone, but it&#39;s within reach of so many more people than the gatekept world of private banking and jets.This is not a comment about wealth disparity - it&#39;s about goods which seem to resist the impact of wealth disparity; where there is a relatively low upper bound on how good of a thing you can buy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Using three separate identification strategies we show that, controlling for own-vehicle weight, being hit by a vehicle that is 1000 pounds heavier generates a 40–50% increase in fatality risk. [...] We consider two policies for internalizing this external cost, a weight-varying mileage tax and a gas tax, and find that they are similar for most vehicles. The findings suggest that European gas taxes may be much closer to optimal levels than the US gas tax.In an environment of wealth inequality, this seems like another way that the wealthy can benefit: easily afford to drive heavier vehicles that increase their personal safety while increasing the lethal threats against the poor.How about instead: if larger vehicles are more dangerous for the population overall, then they should be banned for everyone, not only effectively off-limits to the poor."</p>

They have very different handling characteristics, and it&#39;s pretty noticeable a lot of their drivers lack the skill required to operate them safely.I mean the idea that you can sit your license test in a subcompact and then go out and drive a 4 door high displacement ute/pickup truck is pretty absurd on the face of it."</p>

This is in the Caddy 2.6 beta already: https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/releases/tag/v2.6.0-bet... - please try it out!Thanks to Marten Seemann for maintaining the quic-go library we use. (I still haven&#39;t heard whether Go will add HTTP/3 to the standard library.)Caddy 2.6 should be the first stable release of a general-purpose server to support and enable standardized HTTP/3 by default. HTTP versions can be toggled on or off. (Meaning you can serve only HTTP/3 exclusively if you&#39;re hard-core.)PS. Caddy 2.6 will be our biggest release since 2.0. My draft release notes are about 23 KB. We&#39;re looking at huge performance improvements and powerful new features like events, virtual file systems, HTTP 103 Early Hints, and a lot of other enhancements I&#39;m excited to show off on behalf of our collaborators!"</p>

They write:&gt; In this course, we’ll be looking for the following trifecta: (i) ideas that are non-obvious, even to the well-trained computer scientist, so that we’re not wasting your time; (ii) conceptually simple — realistically, these are the only ideas that you might remember a year or more from now, when you’re a start-up founder, senior software engineer, PhD student, etc. (iii) fundamental, meaning that there is some chance that the idea will prove useful to you in the future.In the first lesson, they discuss consistent hashing, and they seem to have achieved their goals.ETA: Must include this anecdote on the history of the algorithm:1. 1997: The implementation of consistent hashing given in this lecture first appeared in a research paper in STOC (“Symposium on the Theory of Computing”) [...] Ironically, the paper had previously been rejected from a theoretical computer science conference because at least one reviewer felt that “it had no hope of being practical.”2. 1998: Akamai is founded.3. March 31, 1999: A trailer for “Star Wars: The Phantom Menace” is released online, with Apple the exclusive official distributor. apple.com goes down almost immediately due to the overwhelming number of download requests. For a good part of the day, the only place to watch (an unauthorized copy?) of the trailer is via Akamai’s Web caches. This put Akamai on the map.4. April 1, 1999: Steve Jobs, having noticed Akamai’s performance the day before, calls Akamai’s President Paul Sagan to talk. Sagan hangs up on Jobs, thinking it’s an April Fool’s prank by one of the co-founders, Danny Lewin or Tom Leighton."</p>

As opposed to the way that linear algebra is typically introduced, this book focuses on concrete applications (like text analysis, image/signal processing, finance, ML, etc.) and eschews more arcane concepts (like eigen). To me, building practical intuition is the best way to learn* the subject.A more advanced but still accessible manuscript by Boyd et al: Generalized Low Rank Models (establishes connections between PCA/SVD and many other matrix factorization methods, and shows you how to roll your own): https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/glrm.pdf"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a really elegant point.&gt; Doing upfront authorization of powers is relatively efficient, and is also pleasingly self regulating. If an agency overloads or confuses its ex ante regulator, they simply won’t get permission to do things. This provides a strong incentive for clear and concise requests to the regulator.It is very easy for regulators, even well-meaning, to focus on what they require of an individual transaction.  But we live in a world where automation and dynamic workforces make it possible to break every expectation about how a system will be used."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That last line made me laugh, but it&#39;s funny because it&#39;s true. It&#39;s down to the &#34;sit where you&#39;re sitting&#34; effect.Noam Chomsky famously told Andrew Marr during an interview that he was sure Marr was sincere and believed everything he was saying, but if he&#39;d believed anything else, he wouldn&#39;t sit where he was sitting.It follows from that true observation that the only time such appointed watchdogs (whether oversight board members or news personalities) are actually doing something, is when they quit, or at least threaten to quit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find it interesting that the Dutch push to change the intelligence law coincides with a similar one currently taking place in my home country of Romania.I wonder if these are actually part of a more coordinated attempt to tacitly make the (broadly speaking) West more authoritarian and tightly controlled."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To be clear, this is an extremely tiny subset of JS. It looks like they only implemented the features needed to run a very specific function. For example, the only symbol allowed after &#34;new&#34; is &#34;Date&#34;, everything else throws an exception.It&#39;s still fun that it&#39;s there, but it&#39;s not as big a deal as it sounds from the tweet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anyone who has ever pulled a website from a script knows the pain that is Javascript. Normally you want to just get some text and work out the API actions but a lot of sites use horribly obfuscated Javascript -- either because that&#39;s what modern web development is (lolz) -- or because its part of their &#39;security.&#39; That means if you want to write browser-based bots properly -- you ought to use a browser. There are special browsers that run &#39;headlessly&#39; or are designed mostly for bot use. Like https://www.selenium.dev/ which plugs into a few different &#39;browser engines.&#39;But now you have another problem. Your simple script goes from being small, simple, self-contained, and elegant gem, to requiring a full browser, specialized drivers, and/or daemons running just to work. If you&#39;re using something like Python you just frankly don&#39;t have very good packaging. So it&#39;s hard to string together all that into a solution and have it magically work for everyone. What YouTube-dl have done is good engineering. Even though it&#39;s not a full JS interpreter: they&#39;ve kept their software lean, self-contained, and easier to use."</p>

But it did change my idea of what can be analyzed and measured. The beginning is repetitive. Some of it is very unorthodox. But it was very useful in detailing how to evaluate risk.How to talk to little kids so little kids will listen. I don&#39;t have kids and read it on a whim. I&#39;ve found it&#39;s excellent for communicating with people in general during conflict (especially patients). The author is a counsellor and describes real counselling sessions with parents who want better relationships with their children. I enjoyed how the author uses the same techniques on the adults and obtains the same manner of response as when used on the kids.Understanding Complexity is not a book but a part of the Great Courses. It&#39;s hard to say what it directly changed but it did affect how I view everyday life, from traffic to physiology.Hui&#39;s Approach to Internal Medicine was very helpful for transitioning from knowing about medical facts to practical medical knowledge useful to everyday care. It&#39;s focus is on &#39;approach&#39; rather than facts. It has a practical approach to medical issues. First distinguishing by ones in the same category of pathophysiology then practical approach to distinguishing issues within the category.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The key reason web frameworks dominate these days is that it&#39;s very hard to keep the UI in sync with state.That&#39;s it - that&#39;s the problem they solve. People started writing vanilla HTML/CSS/JS and struggling to make &#34;reactivity&#34; (hence React) work well when web applications got complex with a lot of state to manage. So we started building frameworks on frameworks and abstractions on abstractions and ended up where we are today.It&#39;s gone a bit far but the overall purpose is a valid one.(From someone who has used React professionally but uses vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for his personal website)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly, I&#39;m turned off by these frameworks. Javascript is an easy language, and these frameworks raise the bar to entry. Many will say they make things &#39;easier&#39; but that&#39;s not my personal experience. Some context: I wrote a lot of JS in the early/late 2000s (Anyone remember WebFX by Erik Arvidsson?). His follow-up gig became WebOS[0]Back then it was called DHTML or Dynamic HTML and then evolved into the HTML5 standard later on. The syntax of React &amp; Vue is just too weird for me. Frankly I&#39;ve reached a framework fatigue after learning jQuery inside out which was a hard-won battle, and then having to learn React/Vue/Svelte just to stay &#39;in the game&#39; is too much for me. Excuse me if I&#39;m biased here.[0] https://newmedia.fandom.com/wiki/Web_Operating_System"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The web was originally created to share documents, so interactivity and extra functionality was an afterthought. As the web became more popular, websites started to add more functionality similar to traditional software programs.Eventually, the original guideline of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity started to not really make sense anymore for many websites, because as pages became more interactive, the lines became blurred. If you look at a site like GMail, where does the page structure end and interactivity begin?With large parts of a page being interactive, it becomes difficult to manage all the state involved, especially if it’s a “live” page that updates in real time and may have several people viewing it.Frameworks were introduced as a way to manage state and allow websites to re-render efficiently without hard page refreshes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember when I was a young assembly programmer and I looked down on those obtuse C programmers who needed such a slow high-level language. After high-school, having read all those fantastic W. Richard Stevens books I simply could not understand why anybody on earth wanted to use C++ when C was easily capable of modeling complex object structures. When they forced us to use Java, I was deeply in shock: was this really a programming language or more a toy for little kids and why would they want to slow down computers to a crawl?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The &#34;letters to the editor&#34; are really fun to read -- it&#39;s like reading the HN comments of the time, with the same combination of insight and cynicism.&gt; In response to Gregg Williams&#39; editorial (&#34;The New Generation of Human- Engineered Software,&#34; April, p. 6), the mouse of Lisa, Visi On, and their predecessor, the Xerox Star, is a truly fascinating hardware device, and on those few occasions that I have seen these devices in use, I have been impressed. But the mouse is not revolutionary, and, as its name suggests, it is really nothing more than a rodent. Its functional predecessor was the light pen. Some years ago, light pens were fashionable devices for selecting a particular function, and they are still in use. But displays attaching light pens had to have an appropriate phosphor, and they were not as easy to program as function keys. About the same time, touch- sensitive screens were introduced, and they are still used in applications such as online catalogs in libraries; here, too, however, programming appears to be the chief stumbling block.&gt; If the name of the game is &#34;ease of use,&#34; the industry would be far wiser to develop touch-sensitive displays than mice. Because a display has no moving parts, it is likely to prove more durable than a mouse. And a finger placed on a display screen does not require additional desk space, as a mouse does. If an executive were having an office conference, don&#39;t you think he might rather touch his screen a couple of times than roll a mouse around his desk pressing buttons on it?&gt; There are, obviously, many considerations at work in the development of new products. My bet, simply stated, is that the mouse is not a viable product. At best, it will limp along like bubble memory. - John P. Rash, President, Acorn Data Ltd.There&#39;s also:- Several refutations to a previous letter which claimed CRT monitors are a radiation hazard- An engineer from Intel responding to criticisms of their FORTRAN compiler with &#34;those issues have been fixed in the latest version&#34;- Debate over structured programming and strong typing- Debate on what &#34;computer literacy&#34; means and whether the general population needs it (including a claim that WYSYWIG editors and desktop file managers do not make computers easier to use because &#34;a desktop manager is only a sophisticated analog for being able to copy one file into another&#34;)- Conversations on software prices and piracy- And, of course, someone pointing out a typo in an article."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The things that made C successful are rarely recognized even by its fans, but much moreso by its critics and competitors. Things it is most criticized for are among them. They have made C hard to unseat. Too-easy conversion between arrays and pointers is one such criticism, but such conversion was essential to its success.C++ succeeded not just because it can call C libraries -- most languages can -- but because it retained every advantage C has, even those that few recognize. C++&#39;s STL is a success because it built on what made C a success, deliberately. Alex Stepanov, anyway, understood. Most STL components are really just examples.Today we are locked in battle against C&#39;s weaknesses, particularly in how easy it is to exploit C programs. We lose that battle when new languages leave behind what made C successful. Too-easy accidental conversions bad; deliberate conversions possible, good.C got various other things subtly right, too: manifestly enough to make up for its blatant failings. If you would displace C, it is much more important to retain its strengths than to fix its flaws. You can do that without understanding by copying. Retaining strengths while leaving behind flaws requires understanding, which has proven too hard for most."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The profit motive is being blamed here for optimizing for engagement.But how do you assess progress when you remove all desire to monetize?I run r/WallStreetBets and &#34;quality&#34; is an extremely nebulous term.I look for things like &#34;novelty&#34;, &#34;thought-provoking / well reasoned commentary&#34;, &#34;original content&#34;, &#34;authenticity&#34;, &#34;self-awareness&#34; or &#34;primary research&#34;.

Or even &#34;number of tickers or quality-correlated keywords mentioned&#34;.All these metrics have very clear downsides, and if generally well-known, become useless. Interestingly, a score too high can also result in something being unlikely to be authentic.Another challenge is your relationship with users. Surprisingly, moderators are not innately adversarial to users, they can also promote content through other channels (discord, twitter) or sticky threads for a viewership boost.So, even without a profit motive, what do you do?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good article, though I think it missed explicitly making the point that the reason &#34;engagement&#34; is the metric is because that&#39;s what platforms monetize. Engagement is a euphemism for attention, and social platforms exist to sell your to advertisers.Since the article is written for &#34;community builders,&#34; understanding that engagement is a metric to quantify the advertising potential of a platform should make it obvious that people who aren&#39;t in the business of selling attention to advertisers don&#39;t need to copy social media and optimize for engagement; instead they should target better measurements of value creation for their community. Of course Goodhart&#39;s law[1] still applies.1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law(edited for readability)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I enjoyed the Monsters Inc reference and the turning of it on its head central to this piece.  But we&#39;ve said/argued this for years and at the end of the day engagement = ad reach = profits and until the economics there change any for-profit social media will gravitate towards engagement.  Hell ANY media gravitates toward engagement and outrage bait.  An actual community built around Mastodon seems possible, and there&#39;s community discussions around private group chats but they will always remain niche and not profitable.I don&#39;t get what https://savannahhq.com is and what the value add is there but that seems to be what he&#39;s interested in, niche + small communities."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked in public accounting with some major corporations as clients. Every single company I interacted with used SAP. It is the de facto software in its field and is deeply entrenched. Its UX is the most horribly wicked thing I’ve ever come across. We would conduct walkthroughs with process control owners that showed us what they would do in SAP to perform their job functions, and it would take multiple, intelligent people to capture all of the processes. The knowledge that the users at the client had built up was extensive and highly specialized. If something happened to that person, I don’t think you could quickly plug in a new person and have them take over. The initial learning curve felt far too high. I’m sure it gave those people a sense of job security.I feel there is a lot of room to develop better tools that are not so horrid, however, the process for replacing SAP will be long and close to impossible. SAP feels like one of those businesses that’s too big to fail because it’s so entrenched in the corporate world. Somewhat jokingly, I think it would be easier to switch the US over to the metric system. Any challenger will have to be massive, accept losses for over a decade to gain market share, and have incredible support for their clients if they ever want to takeover in the Fortune 500 world. Challenges too great for a mere startup to accomplish.It’s easier to just hire people to learn the SAP workflow and then hire external auditors to make sure the accounting policies are properly being followed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My mother works for a fairly large textile lab. For decades, they used an internally developed system for lab reports (they had a few programmers and admins they called the &#34;nerds&#34; that did nothing else than extend and maintain the system). The company switched to a SAP solution a few years ago. Chaos ensued. The SAP solution missed so many edge cases that a huge number of lab reports were either inaccurate or completely wrong because information was lost in SAP translation between different labs. Sometimes clients (huge international players) noticed the mistakes, which then led to costly product delays. It became so bad that communication between labs eventually had to be done on two levels - within SAP, and &#34;informally&#34; by mail, telephone, or by simply walking to the other lab, adding a huge time overhead to every report.SAP removed virtually every automation advantage of the old system, and added the additional complexity of navigating the SAP GUI. Because of this additional workload and the reluctance of the company to hire more people to counter it (after all, SAP was implemented to streamline everything!), employee turnover suddenly skyrocketed. Everytime I talk with my mother, she complains about the system and tells me that another colleague has quit. She only stays because she only has 2 years until retirement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am an SAP developer since kind of forever, my first job after university (since 2009). First I hated it, but the deeper I am entrenched, the more I see why you choose SAP: Because there really is no alternative. The data model is so complex because it is growing iteratively since the 80s. Hacker News is valuing businesses that adjust to the customer instead of going for some kind of purity. Another complexity especially now is the different paradigm changes in between. ABAP, the programming language of SAP, is quite nice nowadays. CDSViews are a great invention, and so on. There&#39;s really a lot of innovation buried in the bad documentation, it&#39;s getting better. In summary as bad as it is, I don&#39;t see an alternative for all of the backoffice work. SAP is really flexible and supports a lot of different processes. A thing that makes it so costly is a lot of time culture, no small releases, MVP, and so on. But you can be agile with SAP, especially if you move to the cloud."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well this part is very familiar:&gt;  its work was given prominence in the engineering operation by former Chief Technology Officer Michael Schroepfer, who announced last year that he was stepping down.At the end of 2016, I joined Twitter to lead one of the anti-abuse engineering teams. My boss, who led the effort, was great: loved Twitter, hated abuse, very smart. 6 months later the CTO, who had been behind the creation of the anti-abuse engineering effort, left. My boss, previously gung ho, left in a way that made me think he was getting signals from his boss. And shortly after that, said boss&#39;s boss said that our team had succeeded so well that there was no need for us. He scattered the engineers, laid of the managers, me included, and declared victory. We all laughed bitterly.What these have in common for me is a high-level executive launching a special team with great fanfare in a way that addresses a PR problem. But because PR problems are generally fleeting, as soon as do-goodery loses its executive sponsor, everybody goes right back to the short-term incentives, meaning things like &#34;responsibility&#34; go right out the door. At least beyond the level that will trigger another PR disaster.And if you&#39;re wondering why you don&#39;t hear more about things like this, you&#39;re not supposed to. At least for the managers laid off, it was a surprise meeting and then getting walked out the door. In the surprise meeting, they offered a fair chunk of money (for me, $40k) to sign an additional NDA plus non-disparagement agreement. I happen to have a low burn rate and good savings, so I didn&#39;t sign. But I know plenty of people who have looked at the mortgage and kid expenses versus the sudden lack of income and eventually signed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi, orsond from the fifth column here.The Fifth Column is a Minecraft hacking and griefing group. We created Project Copenhiemer which is a Minecraft server scanning tool. Copenhiemer scans the internet every 20 minutes for minecraft servers, logs players, server versions, mods and more.Originally we had created it to find players and grief their server worlds, highlighting how much information about players is leaked from Mojangs default server configuration. They have put some features into the game to stop this information from being leaked but have made it an opt in system which no one uses or is even aware of.We have become increasingly worried about the direction of Mojang&#39;s safety policies and we believe they are just playing lip service to the actual problems at hand.Online gaming and gaming coms has a seriously unaddressed problem with child safety.
Mojang&#39;s reasoning for chat reporting is to protect children. Chat reporting does absolutely nothing to solve this problem. You can report people for swearing, drug/alcohol references, etc. You cannot report a player for child exploitation unless they use the chat system to do so.As an example, I know one server admin that disabled chat entirely on his large server only to have pedophiles use in game signs to message and groom children over Skype and Discord.If Mojang were serious about protecting children, they would stop developing their paternalistic chat surveillance system and split multiplayer children and 18+ play from each other.For example, children should only be able to join under 18&#39;s Mojang hosted servers (realms) where conduct can be heavily monitored and 18+ players join multiplayer servers where children cannot play.It is clear they have thought about this problem for a total of 5 minutes and have shut down healthy &amp; reasonable debate about their solution to avoid embarrassment and scrutiny."</p>

part of a strategic shift of a portion of our security program, we have parted ways with five employees. We also partner with a number of external organizations to continuously develop our security capabilities and conduct regular security assessments to ensure we meet or exceed the highest industry standards.

I don’t know how much financial data they even store directly (I would assume best practices entail letting their payment processors store actual credit card and bank account numbers, for instance, although I’m aware that may be easier said than done depending on their infrastructure).While I do think Patreon is going to have Issues (tm) due to having accepted so much VC money, it’s not clear to me that these layoffs were forced by their funders—they haven’t accepted any money recently, and I haven’t heard anything that suggests their revenues have been dropping to a point where there’d need to do serious belt-tightening.(Also, to people who seem to think any creator could just slap up “a basic microblog” and get all of Patreon’s functionality, that kind of falls into the “not even wrong” category. Replicating what they do would be a lot of work even for the technically-minded, many creators who use them are not technical, and even if you pull it off, there are things that just literally can’t be duplicated as a solo endeavor: all of your patrons may be supporting multiple creators, not just you; patrons may discover other creators based on who their friends support and who those they support are supporting; creators who support other creators just have those charges automatically deducted from their earnings; etc.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"There seems to be some speculation that this is credit card details being hacked. Firing your _entire_ security team sounds like the sort of action taken if basic security practices are not being done. Until we know more, hold out on hiring these people.Xe has commented on this and is suggesting to simply enable 2FA to deal with security concerns [1], as apparently a more measured response to security issues at Patreon. This seems to be more self-serving advice rather than good advice [2], the better suggestion would be to simply move to one of the many alternatives.The assumption is that the login system is somehow insecure, instead of the bank details themselves being stored insecurely. (Hypothetically) If you suffered a large leak of payment details, when payment processing is your _main_ income revenue, and you find out your security team of X people at probably $100k+ a year for N years have done nothing to secure payment details, you too may fire them on the spot.Until Patreon explain why they fired their _entire_ security team, the best advice is to remove your card details immediately. You can always add it back at a later date, or use an alternative payment processor.[1] https://xeiaso.net/blog/patreon-happening[2] https://www.patreon.com/cadey(Edit: As pointed out, Xe didn&#39;t mention credit card details.)"</p>

Google lies about the astronomical number of search results, then only shows a few hundred at most."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;  The revenue-sharing deals that Google offers to browsers are essential to companies like Mozilla Corp., he said, because they offer their products to users for free.&gt; “The reason they partner with Google isn’t because they had to; it’s because they want to,” Schmidtlein said.Mozilla would disappear overnight if Google stopped paying them.Good riddance IMO (even though I love FF and it&#39;s the only browser I use). They haven&#39;t been able to build a sustainable business despite receiving hundreds of millions of dollars per year from Google. A flower shop on a street corner can get a better ROI.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m curious how much other major brands pay to stay in their placesCoke arguably pays megabucks to have giant displays in prime locations. Those locations have limited space so Coke taking up one isSimilarly, IIUC, companies pay to have their products put in conspicuous places in stores like Walmart, Target, etc. Only rich companies can afford to always get the spots that stick out the most.I don&#39;t know if those are compariable. Google pays Apple to be the default search engine seems no different than Coke paying to be the first soda on the aisle or to be featured on the edge of the aisle. People are still free to pick a different search engine or go into the soda aisle.Of course in retail another tactic is to make a bunch of products that appear to be different but are all basically the same. I think Crest or Colgate and 15 kinds of mouthwash all of which have the same &#34;active ingredient&#34; at the same concentration. The goal is to fill up the shelves with your products so there is no room left for the competition&#39;s products since shelf space is limited."</p>

It started as a hobby and sideline to my main work (which at the time was classroom teaching of the same content).  While I&#39;m no longer working in classrooms (pandemic plus other reasons led to this), I&#39;m still producing content, which I think is of good quality and worthwhile.The issue I have with it is that I refuse to produce attention-grabbing clickbaity titles or thumbnails.  I don&#39;t like the whole algorithmically-driven race to the bottom of the brain stem, and have zero interest in producing the same.  I&#39;ve had plenty of comments from viewers who say the videos are great and informative, but if I&#39;d just jazz things up a bit then I&#39;d get more views.I&#39;m just wondering how this will change (if at all) with this new program.  It takes a LOT of time to produce decent content, and even more if you&#39;re going to provide a course and backup materials etc.. Writing curricula is HARD work, and writing tests, etc., that are actually valid is reasonably challenging and time consuming.I currently get about £100 a month from YT, which definitely doesn&#39;t reflect the time I put into it (but I know it has other benefits as I sell a fair number of books partly as a result of the viewership).  I know that the beasts of the platform (3b1b spring to mind) would do really well from this (and deservedly so), but I do wonder if things really need to change to make YT work well for genuinely-produced non-clickbait educational content."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It just occurred to me, Zig could be a great learning-language for CSWhen I was in college we mostly used C++, which exposed (and thereby taught) a lot of core concepts around how computers and low-level languages work. But it was also a bit of a nightmare for... unrelated, obvious reasons.Rust is great for building software, but as a learning language I think it introduces too many additional concepts, has too many additional constraints, and has too many magical abstractions. Eg, doing manual deallocation helps you later appreciate what the borrow-checker does and why it existsZig is supposed to be C++ without all the pain and misery (esp around tooling). That could make it perfect for teaching people about pointers and heap allocations and working with bytes, with minimal extra pain and friction"</p>

I actually posted a link to the GitHub issue this morning. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32751317This makes a normal workflow with `watchexec zig test` basically impossible, since before I can even run the tests I have to spend time hunting down which variables are used/unused at the moment and (un)commenting them. And it seems like they&#39;re planning to double down on this by making you adjust even more trivial things like public/private and var/const before it will even compile your code. https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/335 https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/224Maybe I&#39;m a bad developer, but my code is never perfect the first time around. I always spend time experimenting and refining my designs. I want to find a design that works, and only then spend time polishing and prettifying before I git push.I do understand the reasoning (they don&#39;t want people committing poor quality code), but this implementation just seems completely backwards to me. It breaks the natural order. It&#39;s like saying we won&#39;t let you ctrl+s until your tests pass to make sure you don&#39;t commit broken code.

Stuff like a way to share volumes isn&#39;t supported, etc. Personally I find Dockers architecture a bit distasteful and Podmans tooling isn&#39;t quite there yet (but very close).Honestly I don&#39;t really care about containers vs VMs except the VM alleges better security which is nice, and I guess I like poking at things but they&#39;re were a little too rough for weekend poking.Is anyone doing &#34;small scale&#34; lightweight vm deployments - maybe just in your homelab or toy projects?

For me, one of the best parts of Docker is building a docker-image (and sharing how it was done via git).

We fine-tuned a BERT model to extract product mentions from over 4 million Reddit comments and posts with Named Entity Recognition (NER). The result is a list of the most popular products across many subreddits.No platform (including Reddit) is resistant to fake reviews and spam, but we think it&#39;s happening less frequently here for various reasons:- Redditors and other forum members are more interested in boosting their ego by showing their depth of knowledge on the topic (and correcting others on the topic), whereas corporate websites are more interested in raking profit by displaying (potentially) dishonest information.- Enthusiasts in subreddits are pretty good at spotting dishonest or fake content, which results in immediate downvotes. The whole karma system helps with trustworthiness.- Most subs are moderated well and spam gets removed quite quicklyThat being said, good fake reviews are technically almost impossible to detect, even with sophisticated network analysis of the reviewer&#39;s profile.Looria is still in Beta and we&#39;re working on improving our classification, summarization, and sentiment analysis.

They (IIRC it was the CIA) got into all sorts of shenanigans, dosing people (including CIA officers) without their consent.  Some people died and other people&#39;s lives were affected very negatively.  This was back in the 1950s- a time at which American had little or no conception of the concept of a &#34;psychedelic&#34; at all.Also, the Grateful Dead- whose parking lots were famous as large scale drug distribution sites- went from being counterculture to establishment in some ~25-30 years (the &#34;house band&#34; of the Clinton administration).We apparently live don&#39;t live in the strangest timeline, but it&#39;s definitely the trippiest one."</p>

Each of us is here for a brief sojourn; for what purpose he knows not, though he sometimes thinks he senses it. But without deeper reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people -- first of all for those upon whose smiles and well-being our own happiness is wholly dependent, and then for the many, unknown to us, to whose destinies we are bound by the ties of sympathy. A hundred times every day I remind myself that my inner and outer life are based on the labors of other men, living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same measure as I have received and am still receiving...I have never looked upon ease and happiness as ends in themselves -- this critical basis I call the ideal of a pigsty. The ideals that have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been Kindness, Beauty, and Truth. Without the sense of kinship with men of like mind, without the occupation with the objective world, the eternally unattainable in the field of art and scientific endeavors, life would have seemed empty to me. The trite objects of human efforts -- possessions, outward success, luxury -- have always seemed to me contemptible.My passionate sense of social justice and social responsibility has always contrasted oddly with my pronounced lack of need for direct contact with other human beings and human communities. I am truly a &#39;lone traveler&#39; and have never belonged to my country, my home, my friends, or even my immediate family, with my whole heart; in the face of all these ties, I have never lost a sense of distance and a need for solitude.&#34;-- Albert Einstein"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I approve (of both the release and the name).I see plenty of folks in here lamenting this release at all - in the hopes that the lack of it will push folks to Firefox.  It won&#39;t.  Those who care about this are already on Firefox, and frankly - Firefox isn&#39;t going to be the answer here (to be clear, this is opinion).I&#39;m also not thrilled at manifest v3, although for very different reasons than the adblocking limitations - I do lots of extension development, and I think the service worker approach taken is a bad mistake, forcing a distributed consensus model onto extensions without understanding the limitations that model imposes given how often extensions span multiple js contexts (across tabs/frames/content_scripts/windows/etc).Frankly - the environment is also still riddled with bugs... everything from docs that are wrong, to serious issues like a service worker not activating on simple, basic, required events (like chrome.action.onClicked, which is literally about as basic as it gets for extensions).Overall - my first impression of the manifest v3 upgrade was fairly neutral (it&#39;s not really solving any of my pain points, and it requires a lot of changes to support - but it seemed functional).  My opinion after porting several large extension projects to the space is... bad.  It&#39;s a bad set of changes as implemented in chromium right now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just so I understand correctly: This version removes *all* of the features that read or modify a user&#39;s data, so as to abide by the &#34;&#34;stated intent&#34;&#34; of MV3, rather than taking full advantage of all of the actual MV3 APIs? For example, this commit removes the &#34;scriplet injection&#34; and cosmetic filtering features, which AFAIK work perfectly fine on MV3?    if broad &#34;read/modify data&#34; permission is to be used, than there is not much point for an MV3 version over MV2, just use the MV2 version if you want to benefit all the features which can&#39;t be implemented without broad &#34;read/modify data&#34; permission.

Huh? But ... the &#34;read/modify data&#34; permission isn&#39;t getting removed by MV3? I don&#39;t understand how this follows. This is like saying &#34;Google implemented all of the same things we could do in MV2 in MV3, so we went ahead and removed all of the features anyway&#34;. I don&#39;t see any way to interpret this as anything except cutting off your own nose to spite the face of Google. It certainly doesn&#39;t seem to be a good faith attempt to reproduce the features of uBlock within the new technical framework of MV3."</p>

These are very technical so normally it&#39;s fantastic - EXCEPT if we start talking early or the prospect doesn&#39;t follow the invite and never joins the call, then they would get a transcript of my team&#39;s chatter. I learned to not allow Otter to join the call until everyone is in attendanceWhats more frustrating is that you can&#39;t disable this auto-email &#34;feature&#34; unless you are on a business plan of some sort.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a newbie in nuclear fusion, this explanation is the most interesting part:&gt; Lee Margetts at the University of Manchester, UK, says that the physics of fusion reactors is becoming well understood, but that there are technical hurdles to overcome before a working power plant can be built. Part of that will be developing methods to withdraw heat from the reactor and use it to generate electrical current.&gt; “It’s not physics, it’s engineering,” he says. “If you just think about this from the point of view of a gas-fired or a coal-fired power station, if you didn’t have anything to take the heat away, then the people operating it would say ‘we have to switch it off because it gets too hot and it will melt the power station’, and that’s exactly the situation here.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was at school in Abingdon, Oxfordshire (UK) around 1988 my physics class (A level aged 17) was somewhat enlivened by a visit by a bunch of clever chaps from JET at the Culham labs from up the road.This was the first time I heard the &#34;nuclear fusion is 25 years away&#34; joke and it was told as such.  We were also shown a graph of how many orders of magnitude away from ignition (for want of the correct word) by date.  It had an initial steep decline but then turned right quite sharply and had annoying looking tendency to avoid the magic value.Now, once you have ignition, you have to sustain it and extract power from it.  That&#39;s quite tricky too!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting to see that South Korea has such strong nuclear research facilities. Taiwan lost a lot of nuclear researchers in the past decades. Some of it due to US lobby work and some of it due to stupid governmental policies in the recent past.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Two things...First, looking through their design guide (https://www.wikihouse.cc/guides/design), the only thing they mention is that space (32mm in walls, I guess, and 70mm under ceilings) is provided.Given that the plumbing, electrical, ventilation, appliances, etc. are the majority of the cost of a home, I find this a bit odd.  A typical American full bathroom costs something like $5k to $20k (and up... way up) depending on the quality.  A kitchen can cost multiple times more.  Sure, you can build them cheaper, but that&#39;s the rub... most people who are in the market to purchase a home don&#39;t want low-end bathrooms and kitchens.  Or windows.  Or lighting.  Or wall fixtures.  Or anything really.Second, IMO, the problem with affordable housing is not a construction cost problem.  We can build small, livable (for various definitions) homes for $50k (or less) today, ignoring land costs.  But the regulatory costs, the land costs, the market demands all make building such homes a non-profitable endeavor.   Why build 20 $50k homes on the land and make $200k profit when you can build 10 $500k homes and make $1mil in profit?The affordable housing crisis in the America do not have a technical solution, only a socio-political one.  And since nearly all the power related to zoning, building costs, etc are managed at the local and state level, that means engaging with local politics."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really like the concept of this, it&#39;s basically a step further on from SIPs (structural insulated panels) by having standard composable blocks. The things I think are particularly good:- Standardising on screw pile foundations. Standard concrete foundations are often be about 30% of the build cost, with the quantity of earth removed and cement used it&#39;s a massive part of the carbon footprint of a home. For a &#34;light weight&#34; timber construction, screw piles are the future.- Having services recesses and notches built into the panels, and there is no need to batten the internal walls for boarding. this will increase the speed of construction significantly.- Being an &#34;Open&#34; standard allows any timber frame or prefab construction company to adopt it.My one concern (I wouldn&#39;t go as far as criticism) is that the panels have a somewhat complex manufacturing process by having to be CNC machined. Realisticly they almost always will be, but I would have liked to see the panels designed to be constructed a little more simply - you will always have to make changes on site.I wander why they went with ply over OSB, they have similar structural properties but OSB can be cheeper."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is overly complicating the process. If you want an open source DIY method of building a home, just learn basic framing and construction. It&#39;s not hard, lots of people have built their own homes, you just need some common sense and a willingness to learn.If you want to go all in on modular, wood based, zero carbon housing then learn how to build a timber frame house. If you really want zero carbon you can use only hand tools and harvest your own trees.Wikihouse seems more for people who want to buy something off the shelf, pretty much a kit house. That&#39;s not a bad thing since it takes a lot of effort to build something as big as a house and lots of people don&#39;t want to do that. But I don&#39;t think this should be sold as a solution for DIYers since the existing methods already satisfy the listed requirements."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"These blog posts have been great. I&#39;d love to see a deep dive on the query planner at some point.I&#39;ve done lots of benchmarking SQLite while writing ducks [1], and found some interesting stuff. It seems like SQLite will only use one index, even in cases where two indexes would better suit the query. Or, in cases where the query is fetching most of the table, it will use an index even though a full scan would actually be much faster.Don&#39;t get me wrong, SQLite is awesome, and it&#39;s quite possible to work around these behaviors. Just interested in why they&#39;re not built in.[1] https://github.com/manimino/ducks"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; SQL was originally designed for non-technical users to interact with the database, however, it&#39;s used almost exclusively by software developers peppering it throughout their applications.Interesting claim! In my experience, the # of data analysts / BI analysts / etc that write and have mastered SQL vastly exceeds the # of web developers (especially if we focus on developers actually writing SQL instead of using ORMs)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The EXPLAIN keyword is really awesome. It also allows you to quickly validate SQLite command text without actually executing it. We have found this to be useful for real-time validation of user inputs when working on SQL-based config tools.Note that EXPLAIN also seamlessly incorporates any application-defined functions, so you can validate everything is as expected. Useful when being clever with DSLs and such."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Of course, the other plausible explanation is that (at least at the time) Weird Al didn&#39;t know the difference between RAM and hard drive space (especially likely, because he&#39;s talking about defragging a hard drive).  In fact, I&#39;d be surprised if that wasn&#39;t what he meant.  I will, however, leave room for him knowing the difference, but intentionally being absurd (it is Weird Al, after all).That problem (referring to things that are not conventional fast, volatile random access memory as RAM) seems to have only gotten worse in the last twenty years - exacerbated, I believe by the increased use of flash technology (SSDs, etc - which have, admittedly blurred the lines some).It also doesn&#39;t help that smart phone and tablet manufacturers/advertisers have long insisted on referring to the device&#39;s long-term storage (also flash tech) as &#34;memory&#34;.  I doubt that will ever stop bugging me, but I&#39;ve learned to live with it, albeit curmudgeonly.Whippersnappers! :-D"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting point that RAM has basically not moved up in consumer computers in 10+ years... wonder why.The article answers its own question by pointing out SSDs allow better swapping, bus is wider and RAM is more and more integrated into processor, etc.But I think this misses the point. Did these solutions make it uneconomic to increase RAM density, or did scaling challenges in RAM density lead to a bunch of other nearby things getting better to compensate?I&#39;d guess the problem is in scaling RAM density itself because performance is just not very good on 8gb macbooks, compared to 16gb. If &#34;unified memory&#34; was really that great, I&#39;d expect there to be largely no difference in perceived quality.Does anyone have expertise in RAM manufacturing challenge?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think a big piece that is ignored is how much normal compute/memory usage has been shifted to the Cloud.I no longer need to have local resources to do amazing things. I don&#39;t need an 10GB+ GPU in my phone to be able to hit some website and use AI to generate images. I have fast web/email search capabilities that don&#39;t require me to have a local index of all of it. I can spin up a remote compute cluster with as much RAM as I need if I want some heavy lifting done, and then throw it all away when I&#39;m finished.&#34;Back in the day&#34; we would try to build for all that we could perceive we would do in the next 5 years, and maybe upgrade memory half way through that cycle if things changed. We ran a lot of things locally, and would close apps if we needed to open something needy. I think also systems have gotten a lot better at sharing and doing memory swapping (see comments about SSD helping here). Back in the old days, if you ran out of memory, the app would just not open at all, or crash."</p>

The second I lose trust in that kind of service, I don&#39;t just stop using it, I will most likely never even consider coming back as a customer and I will warn people against them.

I&#39;m happy for the new investment, but I hope they don&#39;t start adding new things just for the sake of growing.Also - to the people who analyze funding rounds - $100M sounds like a huge amount to me.

It&#39;s the CLA that allows them the ability to dual-license for the server.The VCs must really believe the company can produce a product based on Enterprise sales which would deliver a value North of $1B. And perhaps they can, as Bitwarden as we know it could be considered a strong beachhead to allow them to expand into other auth markets that have high value (hello Okta, Auth0, etc).But this doesn&#39;t seem that scary for Bitwarden users at this point."</p>

If US healthcare spending were a country, it would have the third largest GDP in the world. Accidents of history and the massive federal beauracracy created the crazy monster of ICD/CPT codes that results in the very clumsy way of pricing healthcare services that results in this massive matrix of data.As pointed out elsewhere there is a tremendous amount of cost distribution that goes into the code matrix and this plays a large role in negotiations with health insurers as well. Ground is given in one set of procedures and lost in others.This is a big step in shining light into areas that need it to improve the system overall."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work in data at https://www.carrumhealth.com/, and I&#39;ve been parsing this data for weeks. The transparency prices allow us to meaningfully negotiate with providers, and make tangible, incremental progress toward cheaper health care. Providers and existing insurance carriers leverage information asymmetry to control the market otherwise.For context, we bundle the 100&#39;s of itemized costs into a single, static bill per surgery type. In doing so, we&#39;ve built a custom virtual-network with the most efficient surgeons. These surgeons are able to meet the volume and quality requirements to allow for lower margins. We&#39;re able to get negotiated rates that are 10-40% cheaper than traditional insurance contracts when we have data that we trust.Unfortunately, this data alone isn&#39;t enough to properly determine prices because organizations will spread costs across procedure and billing codes that often occur in aggregate groups. For example, in a joint replacement surgery, some organizations may dump the cost into the billing for the implant itself, while others may put it under the procedure code. You have to gather billing data en masse to see which charges occur together, then combine this pricing data to determine what costs will actually look like for someone experiencing a procedure.It&#39;s a nightmare!"</p>

I used to work with the HPSC leads and paid attention to it. This is one of many parallel threads for next-gen computing, including snapdragon and others. Yes, it will be rad-hard. That was a program requirement and is mentioned in the press release. As such, it fits a particular mission profile.There is no existing compulsion for missions to use HPSC. This is a technology development program seeking to meet the requirements of missions. It&#39;s great news they converged on an architecture!As part of their development, HPSC folks will seek mission partners for tech demos.

ESA has been using a custom SPARC V8 rad hard architecture: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEONI&#39;m currently using a dual-core 90 MHz processor that is relatively advanced and has good performance for many applications.  It has error-correcting memories (SDRAM, cache, registers) and a lot of integrated peripherals (spacewire, serial, ethernet, 1553, CCSDS) that help reduce board complexity.Next up in the pipeline is an 8-core 1 GHz monster:

This is a new design from SiFive and there&#39;s not a huge amount of SiFive IP around yet to demonstrate how good (or otherwise) their verification is.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At a previous company I worked at, we had an issue with our software (Windows-based, written in a proprietary language) randomly crashing. After some debugging, we found that this happened whenever the user made some specific actions, but only if, in that session, the user had previously printed something or opened a file picker. The culprit was either a printer driver or a shell extension which, when loaded, changed the floating point control word to trap. That happened whenever the culprit DLL had been compiled by a specific compiler, which had the offending code in the startup routine it linked into every DLL it produced.Our solution was the inverse of the one presented in this article: instead of wrapping our routines to temporarily set the floating point control word to sane values, we wrapped the calls to either printing or the file picker, and reset the floating point control word to its previous (and sane) value after these calls."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Julia package ecosystem has a lot of safeguards against silent incorrect behavior like this. For example, if you try to add a package binary build which would use fast math flags, it will throw an error and tell you to repent:https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/BinaryBuilderBase.jl/blob/...In user codes you can do `@fastmath`, but it&#39;s at the semantic level so it will change `sin` to `sin_fast` but not recurse down into other people&#39;s functions, because at that point you&#39;re just asking for trouble. There&#39;s also calls to rename it `@unsafemath` in Julia, just to make it explicit. In summary, &#34;Fastmath&#34; is overused and many times people actually want other optimizations (automatic FMA), and people really need to stop throwing global changes around willy-nilly, and programming languages need to force people to avoid such global issues both semantically and within its package ecosystems norms."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem here is that enabling FTZ/DAZ flags involves modifying global (technically thread-local) state that is relatively expensive to do. Ideally, you&#39;d want to twiddle these flags only for code that wants to work in this mode, but given the relative expense of this operation, it&#39;s not entirely practicable to auto-add twiddling to every function call, and doing it manually is somewhat challenging because compilers tend to support accessing the floating-point status rather poorly. Also, FTZ/DAZ aren&#39;t IEEE 754, so there&#39;s no portable function for twiddling these bits as there is for other rounding mode or exception controls. I will note that icc&#39;s -fp-model=fast and MSVC&#39;s /fp:fast correctly do not link code with crtfastmath.As a side note, this kind of thing is why I think a good title for a fast-math would be &#34;Fast math, or how I learned to start worrying and hate floating point.&#34;"</p>

Slight warning that it&#39;s written with some Buildbarn knowledge in mind.https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-adrs/blob/master/0009-nfsv4....Fortunately, fuse-t doesn&#39;t make any of my work unnecessary.

After glancing over the API I guess it&#39;s because FPEs are too high-level to implement FUSE properly, but I&#39;d be glad if you can share any details to satisfy my curiosity.[1] https://developer.apple.com/documentation/fileproviderEDIT: Errata, I assumed it was open-source, but it is not.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A4 is so ubiquitous around me (Europe) that, no matter its merits or not, it&#39;s really a major PITA when you get documents that are not A4.  They don&#39;t line up nicely with the A4 stuff.  They don&#39;t go gently in the A4 folders / sleeves / pockets / ring binders (files) / etc.Typical offenders in my case are medical bills printed on dot-matrix printers.I don&#39;t even know if there&#39;s perforated continuous stationery/form paper with tractor holes that, once you strip the holes, is A4 sized?  I guess it&#39;s really uncommon if it exists for I don&#39;t ever recall seeing any actually used.Now don&#39;t get me wrong: hearing the song of a dot-matrix printer makes me happy (brings back lots of memories as my first printer was a dot-matrix one) and it&#39;s nice that that tech is still in use here and there.  I just wish the dot-matrix printers in Europe would use A4 continuous paper (which may or may not even exist).And don&#39;t get me started on oversized continuous paper that is not perforated: this is the kind of stuff that can trigger obsessive-compulsive disorder!I guess all this rant to say that even in Europe, where A4 is ubiquitous, you still have places using other sizes than A3/A4/A5 etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article sadly misses the root of the An sizes. A0 has an area of 1m^2, setting its dimensions and defining the rest of the sizes. Quite genius!The B sizes start at B0 with a length on the short side of 1m, then follow the same pattern. The C sizes, often used for envelopes, are defined as the geometric mean between the equivalent A and B size.As a child of an architect, when I was a kid my dad would bring old A0 drawings home as paper we could draw and paint on the back of. Loved it.-

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is great, because Unreal is a C++ project that&#39;s not so easy to just Rewrite In Rust.It&#39;s also nice it uses bevy&#39;s ECS. It&#39;s made to fit Rust&#39;s type system and borrow checking model, and is highly parallel. It&#39;s really awesome how easy it is to distribute work across cores with it, without risk of heisenbugs thanks to Rust&#39;s data-race-safety guarantees.I know game development sees traditional software best practices as not applicable to them, but then games struggle with showstopping bugs and single-core performance bottlenecks. I hope someone will bet that Rust, despite being stricter and seemingly slower to iterate with, can be a net benefit from lower defect rates. Rust users outside of game dev praise the &#34;if it compiles, it&#39;s usually correct&#34;, and that junior devs can be told not to write unsafe code, so they can&#39;t cause UB and memory corruption."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great, because Unreal is a C++ project that&#39;s not so easy to just Rewrite In Rust.True. Although rewriting Nanite in Rust would be useful. Nanite is a very clever data structure for meshes. It&#39;s brittle, and full of internal relative addresses within the data item, so it&#39;s very vulnerable to buffer overflows. If it becomes widely used outside of UE, it might become something that gets supported in GPU hardware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am always skeptical about these type of projects. Out of the box Unreal Engine supports C++ and Blueprint.The problem with C++ is the slow compile times, and if you make mistakes the engine crashes. In general you produce stuff slower by using  C++.Blueprint is a visual scripting tool, it compiles fast. But it stores code as a binary blob in source control. And I&#39;m personally not a fan of visual scripting, I would prefer scripting by just writing code.So generally I prototype in Blueprint and then rewrite in C++ later on. I would love an intermediate language that has fast compile times and saves as a source file instead of a binary blob.The problem is most of the projects that integrate with another language get abandoned after a while. MonoUE was abandoned, USharp was abandoned, now the newest attempt to integrate UE with C# UnrealCLR looks abandoned. SkookumScript doesn&#39;t support UE5. Haxe support for UE was abandoned.Do I really want to risk writing a ton of code in a language that might not support future engine versions? To be honest, I don&#39;t want to take that risk."</p>

With recent developments in AI, there is renewed discussion about cheating as the best AIs have no trouble beating anything from PLO to NLHE.It was only a matter of time before this started to spread offline, and just a few weeks ago, I heard a story from a friend of a friend who caught a player using a device similar to this during a private game he was hosting. It&#39;s only a matter of time before these sorts of devices continue to spread, and I&#39;m not sure how the world will respond.It would be a huge deal to cheat at events like the World Chess Tournament, but the consequences of getting caught will likely stop at complete disgrace.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I did fairly well in the test (I didn&#39;t remember that you couldn&#39;t shift into the sign bit), but it really helps highlight how stupid the C promotion rules are. In C as soon as I have to do arithmetics with anything but unsigned ints all sorts of alarm bells start going off and I end up casting and recasting everything to make sure it does what I think it does, coupled with heavy testing. Now add floats and doubles into the mix and all bets are off.Rust not having a default &#34;int&#34; type and forcing you to explicitly cast everything is such an improvement. Truly a poster child for &#34;less is more&#34;. Yeah it makes the code more verbose, but at least I don&#39;t have to worry about &#34;lmao you have a signed int overflow in there you absolute nincompoop, this is going to break with -O3 when GCC 16 releases 8 years from now, but only on ARM32 when compiled in Thumb mode!&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These examples do look scary. However, in my 16 years of experience of mostly writing In C, I have never found a single chance that I need to actually use the expressions that I got the answers wrong.Never mix unsigned and signed integer comparison unless you know exactly what you are doing.And never do arithmetic on boundaries definitions like INT_MAX, they are boundaries , why you need to compute a derived value on boundaries?If you do not need arithmetic behavior, do not use signed integer, use unsigned. Because computer does not understand sign, so if you do not need a sign, do not use it.You do not need to be a language committee member to write C , you just need to understand the reason behind its design."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Found a disappointing bug in the test:  (unsigned short)1 &gt; -1 

Correct answer is: implementation-defined.The left operand of &gt; has type unsigned short, before promotion. On C implementations for today&#39;s popular, mainstream machines, short is narrower than int; therefore, whether it is signed or unsigned it goes to int.In that common case, we are doing a 1 &gt; -1 comparison in the int type.However, unsigned short may be exactly as wide as int, in which case it cannot promote to int, because its values do not fit into that type. It promotes to unsigned int in that case.  Both sides will go to unsigned int{*}, and so we are comparing 1 &gt; UINT_MAX which is 0.Maybe the author should name this &#34;GCC integer quiz for 32 bit x86&#34;, and drop the harder choices like &#34;implementation-defined&#34;.---{*} It&#39;s more nuanced here. If we have a signed and unsigned integer operand of the same rank, it could go either way. If the unsigned type has a limited range so that all its vallues are representable in the signed type, then the unsigned type goes to signed. My remark represents only the predominant situation whereby signed and unsigned types of the same rank have overlapping ranges that don&#39;t fit into each other: the unsigned version of a type not only lacks negatives, but has extra positives."</p>

I&#39;d no previous experience at all with running my own mailservers and had always been put off by how complicated it seemed.Even with a non supported configuration setup [running the mailserver for my domain on a separate VPS from the domain itself] MIAB setup was pretty easy. I had it installed and was up and running in no time. I then spent a couple of days setting up the various DMARC MTA-STS policies etc. [most of that time involved looking up what they were and why I needed them!] and [after testing with an unimportant account] migrating the rest of mine and my family&#39;s and friends&#39; emails across from Gmail. I was able to import half a dozen accounts from Gmail with about 8GB of emails between them, using ImapSync [1]So far [fingers crossed] it&#39;s been almost painless. Giving the lie to the commonly held belief that running your own mailservers needs constant hands-on maintenance. My MIAB setup runs quite happily on a $5/month Linode [I checked the IP was not on any blacklists, before I started] and the whole thing has been pretty much &#39;fire and forget&#39;. MIAB sends me weekly reports on what&#39;s been happening. Software updates are a one-liner in the terminal and I&#39;ve had no trouble whatsoever with Google, Microsoft etc. as regards the mail not getting through.If you&#39;ve always hankered after running your own mailserver but [as I did] thought it was too difficult and required too much &#39;hands on&#39; tinkering, I heartily recommend you give MIAB a go.DISCLAIMER: I run a couple of dozen email addresses on 3 or 4 domains on my MIAB. Probably sending and receiving a few hundred emails a week between them. YMMV if you&#39;re a heavier user than this.[0] https://mailinabox.email/[1] https://imapsync.lamiral.info/"</p>

The tactics were different, but the goal is effectively the same.The key differences are Kiwifarms is targeting individuals personally. And that they’re doing it kind of randomly, for the lulz.

If cloudflare doesn&#39;t reinstate the website after dealing with said immediate danger they claimed was the reason to remove its protection it just shows how hard you can shut someone down by just twitter outrage.If the threat really was so dire, and if there really was something of the sort sure i can see allowing the obvious DDOS in the background go thru and take the website down. But not reinstating it after the time they were claiming to buy by doing it was already bought it means if you scream loud enough on twitter, even while having an obvious army of arsonists behind you, the firefighters will just stop serving said target.Sure, cloudflare is a private company and all that, nobody questions it, but it doesn&#39;t make it any less unsettling."</p>

And that if we did want the entire world to live a life that includes things like that, we just don&#39;t have the energy right now.EDIT: I kept thinking about this and it doesn&#39;t stop at just basics. It&#39;s also things like living in a comfortable, well-manufactured home. Being able to buy toys for your kids. Taking airplanes to visit family or to vacation.

Not only does this allow for analysis, it also makes it, in theory, falsifiable.If the article is right and all it takes is around a doubling of the current global energy, at 1.1% population growth and a global annual increase in energy usage of 2.5%, this gives around 50 years before we start producing enough energy to push poverty levels below 1%."</p>

&#34;The difference is about 1.5-2%, statistically significant, and persists during the 20 business days following the (legalization) event.&#34;[1]This is more like a useful hint for short-term traders, not a long-term effect.[1] https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yay. Recreational marijauna user here and opioids scare the crap out of me. Had to take 10 oxycodone after a surgery and if they can hand those out they can hand out marijauna capsules or whatever. It&#39;s really that simple."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Surely I&#39;m not the only person for who cannabis just makes pain far worse. In fact I know I&#39;m not I&#39;ve heard it from other people.Opiates are spooky, but ... they work really well."</p>
