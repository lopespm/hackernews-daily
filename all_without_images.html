(And yes, we&#39;re still going to solve this problem and then there won&#39;t be any more of these annoying notices.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You know how, during a big programming project, you have to keep the devs from going &#34;this codebase has a lot of technical debt, let&#39;s rebuild the whole thing using Rust and Kubernetes and Deno and move the hosting to Azure and switch databases and use microservices and...&#34;?Designers are exactly the same way. Just as technical fiddling is fun and interesting, making new designs from scratch is just as fun and interesting. And, just as fixing bugs is tedious and boring, tweaking designs is tedious and boring.I&#39;ve been on both sides for a lot of years, and I have to keep a sharp eye on myself to keep from spinning my wheels on distractions.Even the Pope had to keep Michelangelo focused on the Sistine Chapel and not wander off to work on his tomb."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently left a boutique agency of 5 years and I can definitely resonate with this one. Our agency aimed to catch big fish, and we did, but since they are hard to land we&#39;d pick up small jobs in the meantime, just like the project that you&#39;re describing here. In my perspective, this isn&#39;t someone deliberately ripping you off. I imagine they intended to ship at the cost they quoted, but the team didn&#39;t adjust their working style to match your price point.All the variations of the logo and design mocks are clearly overkill for a $15k project. The design team had time to fill and wanted to provide lots of options for you to pick from, as they typically would on a larger project. Those variations are an expectation for $100k clients, and you got the $100k customer treatment, but unfortunately not at a discount.The reality is, small jobs like this are effectively make-work projects for an agency. They typically don&#39;t pay enough to be an effective use of time for the agency, but are a way to stay in the black between higher value projects. Small customers become &#34;nuisance&#34; customers as soon as a something better is landed. The team members being swapped out as they are needed elsewhere and newly joining team members then need to re-contextualize and regain momentum, all on your dime.Your takeaway is correct, don&#39;t be a small fish for an agency. If they&#39;re busy they won&#39;t take your work, and if do show interest, they are desperate for work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"More anecdotal evidence: a few years back I wanted to get out of the work situation I was in. I looked around, had some interviews, had some offers. None of the postings had salary ranges, as is common where I live.My eyes, however, were set on a specific small company because I liked their product. The process was long and involved multiple meetings, a take-home problem, and stretched over 2 or so months. I was upfront about what my salary expectations were (wasn&#39;t looking for a raise, just a lateral move). They said we discuss salary when you meet the founders, i.e. the last step before getting hired, but they also didn&#39;t tell me that my range was way off.Turns out I had played this 9 week game and turned down other offers just to be severely low-balled by them. Maybe they saw that I really wanted the position and thought they could get away with a low offer.Obviously, I rejected their offer on the spot. I also promised myself to never, _ever_, be fooled like that again. We talk money before I invest any significant amount of time or I walk."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We just went through a large hiring cycle. We posted two versions for every job posting- one with salary ranges and one without.The ads performed equally well in regard to total responses with the better candidates responding to the ones without salary ranges.And... before you say, perhaps your salary ranges were bad, they weren&#39;t. Our salary offerings are very aggressive to the developer&#39;s benefit. In my opinion, salary is a sign of respect from you employer.If your primary reason for responding to an ad is based upon salary you are not going to be happy where you work. I promise. Of the top reasons people are happy at work, salary is way down on the list. [0] It is important, it makes it possible to pay bills, but it isn&#39;t what makes people happy.Meaning, if you are looking for a place you will enjoy working, do not start with salary.[0]https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2014/12/15/the-top-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My former employer had a lot of trouble hiring and getting applicants even though we paid very high wages. They asked for my help. Naturally, they hadn&#39;t posted the salary range. I changed up the listing to talk about what we provided as a company for the employee and why we were such a great place to work and included our high salaries. We immediately had trouble keeping up with the number of applicants.If you pay well, they will come."</p>

However if thousands of people die in thousands different places, it is ignored and considered a fact of life.When a plane or train crashes, we stop everything and redesign the entire network to prevent this from happening again.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It is widely recognized that there is an epidemic of suicides among current and former military personnel, especially those who have been on active duty in a combat theater... There were 3,481 combat deaths in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Since 9/11, there have been over 30,000 military suicides. Over 20 soldiers a day take their own lives.Pet peeve: while I really like the general point of the article, I wish the author had actually provided statistics that support the claim they are making here. 30k suicides sounds like a lot, but what&#39;s the base rate in the general population? The numbers provided don&#39;t actually tell you whether the rate of military suicides is higher than civilian ones, and that kind of undermines the point. To be concrete I&#39;m looking for something like &#34;the base rate of suicide is X% chance per year, whereas amongst soldiers it&#39;s Y% chance per year, suggesting a risk factor of (Y-X)% caused by military service.&#34;A quick search finds some research (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_veteran....) that suggests the rate of suicide among veterans is 1.5x the base rate, which is substantial. Using those numbers suggests that 10k of those suicides quoted above were specifically attributable to military service (and 20k would be &#34;baseline civilian risk of suicide&#34;)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Never owned a car of my own until two years ago. Our car has been hit three times in the last two years. Once totaled on the high way (another drivers fault) and twice while parked. Roughly 50K in damages across the two cars and 3 months in the shop doing repairs. We spent 20K on a new car after the old one was totaled and insurance paid out a fraction of what a similar car would cost. We&#39;ve paid close to 2K in deductibles, way too much for car insurance from a company that doesnt give a shit about us, and close to 1k on car cameras and backup batteries.Thankfully we havnt been hurt but we got lucky. When the car was totaled it was in heavy traffic going 40+ mph and caused a 4 car pile up. I know people who have died in accidents or had their kids die. My immediate family was incredible lucky to not be killed by a drunk driver in a very bad accident early on in my life.Driving sucks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It’s impossible to overstate how funny the shenanigans get when you combine a technologically incompetent legacy big Co. with one of these big professional services firms.The IT consulting firm will tell you they have experience with literally everything. They’ll dig up a case study from one of their 400 offices somewhere, claiming to be experts on whatever the topic is. Meanwhile, in actuality, your project will be staffed with a team of 24 year old kids where this is their first assignment. And it doesn’t matter anyways, because the people who worked on the original case study are long gone and would never communicate with other offices even if still around.Meanwhile at the big company, you’ll have the opposite problem. A team of people with decades of experience, but who don’t really know anything about anything other than how to make their corporate machine not fire them. They’ll think they know what they want, and will confidently tell you…but in actuality, these people have zero understanding of technology or even how their business runs. And who can blame them, they’ve spent a 30 year career not doing or risking anything specifically, so its hard to learn how anything works with no feedback loop.It then becomes a delicate dance, can the consulting team learn how to do the thing they sold the client fast enough, before the client does their best to try to ruin the project out of sheer hubris and incompetence.This case is famous for being one where the dance went so bad it became a meme."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Content Management – Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) was the tool of choice to update and revise the content that appears on the website.&#34;If you want to blow a massive development budget AEM is a great choice; otherwise I&#39;d advise you to pick a different content system.This decision alone probably sunk multiple millions of dollars.The platform license alone for their operating scale was probably a half million or a million.  What you get with that license is... the world&#39;s most complex and difficult content management system, that you now have to develop your whole platform around.  Since it&#39;s so difficult to learn and work with you basically need a full time AEM specialist team, which again blows your budget up potentially in the range of millions of dollars, and then continues to burn strong every time you need any kind of update."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"HAMT: Hash Array Mapped Trie.  This data structure makes efficient immutable data possible.  You can update a list of a million items, and keep a reference to the original list, by changing 3 or 4 references and some bytes.This should replace copy-on-write for scripting languages.  I really want to see it in a JS spec soon.  There are libraries that can do it, but they add translation penalties and extra steps.  I’d complain less if I could use Clojurescript professionally, because it and Clojure are built around them.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_array_mapped_trie"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The union-find data structure / algorithm is useful and a lot of fun.The goal is a data structure where you can perform operations like &#34;a and b are in the same set&#34;, &#34;b and c are in the same set&#34; and then get answers to questions like &#34;are a and c in the same set?&#34; (yes, in this example.)The implementation starts out pretty obvious - a tree where every element either points at itself or some thing it was merged with. To check if two elements are in the same set, check if they have the same parent. Without analyzing it, it sounds like you&#39;ll average findRoot() performance of O(log(n)), worst-case O(n).There are a couple of simple optimizations you can do to this structure, the type of things that seem like they shouldn&#39;t end up affecting asymptotic runtime all that much. The first is that, whenever you find a root, you can re-parent all the nodes you visited on the way to that root, so they&#39;ll all be quicker to look up next time. The other is that you keep track of the size of sets, and always make the larger set be the parent of the smaller.And neither of those actually do anything impressive alone, but if you use both, the algorithm suddenly becomes incredibly fast, with the slowest-growing (non-constant) complexity I&#39;ve ever heard of: O(the inverse of the Ackermann function(n)). Or, for any reasonable N, O(4 or less)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cache-Oblivious Data Structures: https://cs.au.dk/~gerth/MassiveData02/notes/demaine.pdfA vaguely related notion is that naive analysis of big-O complexity in typical CS texts ignores over the increasing latency/cost of data access as the data size grows. This can&#39;t be ignored, no matter how much we would like to hand-wave it away, because physics gets in the way.A way to think about it is that a CPU core is like a central point with &#34;rings&#34; of data arranged around it in a more-or-less a flat plane. The L1 cache is a tiny ring, then L2 is a bit further out physically and has a larger area, then L3 is even bigger and further away, etc... all the way out to permanent storage that&#39;s potentially across the building somewhere in a disk array.In essence, as data size &#39;n&#39; grows, the random access time grows as sqrt(n), because that&#39;s the radius of the growing circle with area &#39;n&#39;.Hence, a lot of algorithms that on paper have identical performance don&#39;t in reality, because one of the two may have an extra sqrt(n) factor in there.This is why streaming and array-based data structures and algorithms tend to be faster than random-access, even if the latter is theoretically more efficient. So for example merge join is faster than nested loop join, even though they have the same performance in theory."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I started reading the article I thought the title was a bit click-baity for Science. But then I noticed that the theory it refers to was not the amyloid hypothesis itself, but the toxic oligomer hypothesis that emerged later. That theory is pretty much the main potential explanation on why every single drug targeting Aβ failed that still keeps Aβ fibrils relevant. It&#39;s a very convenient theory because it keeps the main original observations about the fibrils relevant while explaining why therapies that target them don&#39;t work.One part that is really important that is mentioned in the middle of the article is that these systems are very difficult to handle, and it&#39;s almost impossible to make many of them nicely reproducible. Fibril and oligomer formation depends a lot on the environment and reacts to tiny differences.I find this kind of fraud deeply frustrating, there is so much wasted effort in the wake of faked high-profile results."</p>

How could this guy responsible for this mess?And if what he published was wrong, why this was discovered only 18 later if thousands scientists are working in the field?My understanding is that there is a need to find a scapegoat for the amyloid-β and pointing to an obscure guy is in the interest of many big fish.[0] https://www.statnews.com/2019/05/21/alzheimers-disease-amylo..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I believe the reason cat gets interrupted when we press Ctrl+C is that the Linux kernel on the server side receives this \x03 character, recognizes that it means “interrupt”, and then sends a SIGINT to the process that owns the pseudoterminal’s process group. So it’s handled in the kernel and not in userspace.Also interestingly, the use of \x03 for this purpose is a default, but it&#39;s not hardcoded. You can change it with the stty command.For example, if you runstty intr &#39;^X&#39;then your interrupt character sequence will be Ctrl+X instead of Ctrl+C (!).In order to make this change, the stty program actually has to call into the kernel with an ioctl call (TCSETS or a related ioctl, for &#34;terminal control set settings&#34;).You can learn more about this ioctl on Linux in the ioctl_tty(2) man page, and you can see the various settings that can be changed this way withstty -a(It&#39;s a little bit confusing which things are handled by the readline library and which things are handled by the kernel, as the kernel&#39;s ability to support some rudimentary line-editing features on an interactive terminal long predates libraries like readline. I think readline might actually disable kernel interpretation of some of these control characters when it starts accepting input, and then re-enable them when it stops, but I&#39;ve never looked into that.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The client sends l and then immediately receives an l sent back. I guess the idea here is that the client is really dumb – it doesn’t know that when I type an l, I want an l to be echoed back to the screen. It has to be told explicitly by the server process to display it.Of course the client may be really dumb! Here is a 1930s teletype used as a Linux terminal:https://youtu.be/2XLZ4Z8LpEE?t=656If you would not do it that way, you would run into all kinds of synchronicity problems. How could you be sure that, after rapidly making 50 keystrokes, every keystroke was received by the other end, in that order?"</p>

Here’s an old chart from the 60s that explains it:https://programesecure.com/ascii-values-table-generator-in-c...Unfortunately if you just see the character codes with the decimal, hex, and octal next to them this logic is obscured.

Go look at the small business initiatives by each branch of the U.S. military; many are now posting lists of open contracts that you can bid on for an incredible array of things.Browse through those lists and find something you can build.I really believe the U.S. military is in the midst of a large scale transfer of military spending from traditional large defense contractors to smaller, innovative companies. The Air Force has even opened its own venture capital arm and is actively investing in small businesses. Most, if not every, branch in the military publicly posts contracts for small businesses to bid on.I think Anduril is a great example of the possibilities in the &#34;new&#34; defense space.What&#39;s interesting is this shift is very reminiscent of military manufacturing in Japan during World War 2; much of the manufacturing was actually done by small businesses of &lt; 30 employees in &#34;garages&#34; scattered around the country instead of very large factories. That was one of the reasons American bombing by Superfortresses was so ineffective at first, and one of the reasons incendiary bombs began being used.Happy to provide more detail on this. I&#39;ve been thinking about this space for awhile."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to be the education director at a makerspace and now run a 3D printing company selling small plastic parts and teaching entrepreneurs how to start small manufacturing businesses at home.Few thoughts:- Focus on your hobbies and other industries you know well. What problems exist? Where can you make things better? Are there problems people mention over and over again?- CAD modeling is often THE fundamental skill needed for people to bring their ideas to market. You can make CAD models that look almost real using software you can get for free. This allows you to work backwards, first determining if there&#39;s a market, and also working out many of the design flaws before making somethingIf you&#39;re just excited to make stuff, and want to get your hands on something, you can do all kinds of things in a tight space.- 3D printers are small and provide many automated opportunities
- Laser cutters are dead simple to set up and use to make real products and are easy to automate. 
- CNC machines can be had for under 5k and are super powerful
- Portable MIG welders have a small footprint and welding tends to be in high demand
- Leather working tends to be high perceived value though automation is limited
- Soldering and electronics repair requires little space but again, automation is limitedI&#39;ve got loads of other ideas too but I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s good for now. My contact information is in my profile if you&#39;d like to talk more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I started making jet ski tread mats out of astro turf in my garage last year. Dead simple to cut, margin is super high ($60 for a standard set of three on ~$8 worth of material), and time spent per unit from roll to package is something like 15-20 minutes. It was fun and made about $30k over the summer months but I stopped when I moved back to the west coast.I could have handled the whole operation in a spare bedroom if I didn&#39;t have a garage, and there are plenty of areas where I could have dropped the time required or the cost. I never bought the turf in bulk and I used household scissors to cut from a template so buying a roll and cutting with something more effective may have netted me more. Niche leisure products in spend-y verticals typically do well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It might be worth mentioning a famous abdication which caused a lot of consternation, albeit in another game.  I love this story but may have gotten some details wrong.Marion Tinsley was world checkers champion from 1955-1958, then took a break, then again from 1975-1991, when he resigned in protest (at age 64).  He was utterly dominant; indeed it is hard to think of a competitor in all of history more dominant over his sport or game than Tinsley.In 1990 Tinsley decided to play Chinook, the best checkers computer program in the world.  Chinook had placed second at the US Nationals so it had the right to enter the world championships, but the US and British checkers federations refused to allow it.So Tinsley resigned his title.  Tinsley then played Chinook in an unofficial match (which he won).This power play really stuck it to the federations: nobody wanted to be named the new world champion knowing Tinsley was fully capable of crushing them.  Eventually everyone came to an agreement to let Tinsley be the &#34;champion emeritus&#34;.Tinsley played Chinook four years later, at age 68, still probably the best player in the world.  But in the middle of the match he complained of stomach pains and withdrew after only six games (of 20), all drawn.  Tinsley&#39;s pains were real: he later died of pancreatic cancer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Time to change the format. It&#39;s understandable you don&#39;t want to spend your whole career preparing for these long matches all the time. For the challenger it&#39;s 6 months of preparing, but for Carlsen it would&#39;ve been his 6th time of preparing for this in a few years.They have also become less entertaining. 12 matches is long (edit, 14 now), but no one dares to take any risks. Caruana was just defensive and all games ended in a draw. Karjakin they both at least won each their game, but still had to go to rapid tie-breaks. And against Nepo it was a steamroll, understandably meeting him again isn&#39;t that exciting.It&#39;s also almost impossible for a new person to get a chance. Even Carlsen didn&#39;t like the format and didn&#39;t participate in the Candidates for a few years, and when he first did he almost didn&#39;t win it to be allowed to play the WC match. Even though he clearly was the best player at the time.I wonder how this will affect the status of the title, when it&#39;s in practice is now a title-fight between the second best players.Also what will happen to the hype in Norway? Each WC match has so far been live streamed on all big news pages, biggest TV channels etc. It will still be a Christmas tradition to watch the rapid WC tournament I guess, but I&#39;m afraid this will lead to less coverage. But just to tell how big Carlsen is in Norway: This is the top news on all outlets at the moment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Obviously this raised the issue of Bobby Fischer. The article mentions this but doesn&#39;t really go into the details.Fischer beat Spassky in Rejkyavik in 1972 for the World Championship. This took almost 3 months (July to September) and there was controversy, disagreement and negotiation about where and how it would take place. This had the backdrop of being a Cold War proxy too of course.Interestingly, Fischer didn&#39;t play competitive Chess after this. He was set to defend the title against the eventual challenger, Anatoly Karpov, in 1975. Fischer too didn&#39;t like the tendency for draws and proposed a format of first to 10 wins (with Fischer retaining the title in case of a 9-9). This was rejected and Fischer ultimately abdicated and never played competitive Chess again. He also became a semi-nomadic recluse too.But it also wasn&#39;t Fischer&#39;s first hiatus from the game. There was the 1972-1975 gap but also anotehr in the 1960s. He clearly seemed like a troubled guy.I&#39;ve always found it fascinating the level of commitment required to play Chess at this level. I certainly have never had any interest in that (nor the ability, to be clear). No one really seems to know how to solve this without going to a more blitz like format.Chess at the highest level seems to revolve around memorizing a whole book of openings and defenses while being able to take advantage of mistakes but also finding novel approaches in standard openings and defenses but now it seems you have to go fairly deep into a game before you go off-book."</p>

The website will check if a teamviewer font is installed (using javascript). If the font is found, the web site assumes that teamviewer is installed. The teamviewer installer also registers a protocol handler in the operating system.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"My proposal:1. Browsers should ship with a set of fonts used just in the web browser that web designers can count on. Right now, there isn&#39;t a font I can count on finding in Chrome on all platforms. This especially matters for non-English languages, where a different system font can lead to a website that looks very different.2. Browsers should not load fonts installed in the operating system. It&#39;s a fingerprinting vulnerability. And it also causes issues where the system-installed font is unexpectedly different from platform to platform. For example, Arial is different across platforms, especially once you consider non-English languages."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My car (Lexus) and my iPhone X:The car detects iPhone presence, like, 50% of the time. If it does detect it, it shows me a couple of half-naked shaved guys hugging each other and begins playing &#34;Songs of Innocence&#34; the moment I turn the ignition on. I tried deleting this song from the iPhone, but it auto-magically restores itself somehow, as if it is in the telephone&#39;s firmware. The image of men hugging in shade is baked into my mind forever at this point.As I want to set my plans in silence, I press stop on the dashboard. I set my Google Maps navigation, turn the knob to increase the volume so I could hear instructions, and this triggers &#34;Songs of Innocence&#34; to continue playing and the second burst of outrage in my cardiovascular system. I press the stop the second time, and at this point can continue on my journey - but should I try to increase the volume again, I have to remember the hugging men are always there.Once (or twice), the phone just went berserk and couldn&#39;t stop playing them. I tried everything, but the Songs were playing, and the men were hugging while I was doing 70 mph on the motorway. I had to reboot the phone, but after the reboot, the car was unable to pair with it.I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a Lexus problem, or an Apple problem, but what I know is that I really fucking hate U2."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried to learn why BT is still somehow painful to use, and the article basically does not have an answer.My take from comments here and my experience:- Makers of BT devices can&#39;t agree on many important common things (easy discovery / pairing mode, priority, etc), and have little incentive to seek agreement. It&#39;s like phone chargers before USB.- Makers of BT devices tend to cut corners and/or add not-entirely-standard features. They &#34;save&#34; on writing a good driver. They care little if devices made by their competition don&#39;t work reliably or at all in the mix. (And even sometimes their own!)- RF noise makes radio interfaces like BT inherently not always reliable. But the user never notices when a small EM storm rages nearby, for the user it&#39;s just &#34;damn bluetooth glitches for no reason at all&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yeah, but thats hardly news, we have known that for decades. Otherwise direct serotonin releasers would be the most useful ADs. But these mostly give people nausea and serotonin syndrome. ADs work mostly by being FIASMAs, reducing inflammation and oxidative stress, increasing neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, increasing the activity of other monoaminergic systems, and the serotonergic portion is mostly explained by downregulation of 5-HT1A autoreceptors due to chronicly high extrasynaptic 5-HT levels. This also explains the delayed action of ADs.At least this is my knowledge from when I last researched this topic in depth.But that would be a little bit too much for the general public, so it is simplified, to this annoying effect that everyone talks of &#34;low serotonin levels&#34; where in fact the underlying systems are way more complex."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Other clinicians say, however, that the notion of depression being because of a simple chemical imbalance is outmoded anyway, and that antidepressants remain a useful option for patients alongside other approaches including talking therapies.This is the key line in the summary.The concept of attacking an idea no one really believes is really a straw man.More importantly the modern practice of medicine is &#34;evidence based medicine&#34;, not &#34;mechanism based medicine&#34;.
That means treatments are tested as to if they work, not how they work.
Ideally in multiple well run double blinded randomised controlled trials with at least some against treatment as usual.
Unlike the past when we thought more about how they might work, theorising something is off about someone&#39;s humors and adjusting with leeches.Anyone looking for a truly mind bending result should look at Hjorth et al. 2021 [0], the study recruited people with social phobia and gave them all an SSRI (escitalopram). Half were told they were getting a sham active placebo and &#34;should not expect to get better&#34;, half were told &#34;you&#39;re getting the known effective treatment&#34;.Headline result being told you are being treated leads to 4x as much response with brain changes in the dopamin networks.In the meanwhile, rather than worry about how antidepressants work, why not take a look at electroconvulsive therapy which has proven time and again to be the most effective treatment for depression. Yet we have no idea how it works, other than knowing a decent seizure in those without epilepsy makes you less sad? What on earth.[0] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-021-01682-3"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a theory which I can’t substantiate, just anecdotes and conversations I had throughout the years. But, I’m convinced a lot of depression/anxiety stems from thinking too much and that in turn is caused by an ever complex word with looser and looser guidelines or norms.I’m not making judgements weather this is necessarily good or bad but rather observing.In the past, even as recent as the 50s but certainly before the 20th century, a persons course in life was mostly determined at birth.You’re born, you play, you grow up, work the fields or a job, get married, have kids of your own and die. Society was more rigid and pretty much funnelled you through a “tried and tested path”, for good or for worse. And the lack of information made things “simpler” in a way in the sense you had a small number of people to get input from. Take child rearing for example. Many modern people worry so much and research ways to “optimise” their children for example ( I’m thinking of a lot of questions I saw on the parenting stack overflow ) whereas in the last, you’d just ask your own parents. And, since they were older, the assumption was they knew what they where talking about, even if it was not necessarily true. Same with health, same with sexuality, relationships, a lot of things.Essentially lack of information and a rigid social structure meant fewer choices which meant less thinking. And less thinking meant less depression and anxiety.Now when you have a world of information at your hands, you have way more things to think about, to worry about and to look for information on how to fix or improve.I’m not sure medication, even “working” one is a sustainable solution to what appears to me to be an environmental problem rather than a biological one."</p>

I thought it might be fun for me to make some videos of these and share them, with the full support of the owners/teams behind this stuff. They gave me extra access, let me film everything over 2 days (3 full days of work considering the remote location in another state etc), and I put my first video up on YouTube showing off a prototype vehicle that was going for a world record.The video went pretty viral... 8 digit views, got me 5 digit subscriber count, was posted on dozens and dozens of news sites and blogs and shared widely. I was excited, off to a great start with this whole YouTube thing.No music, no audio other than the engine sounds, absolutely zero reason anyone could possibly do a copyright strike... right?Nope, some church minister in some tiny country did a copyright strike saying they own the rights to the word &#34;spirit&#34; in my video title (it was part of the name of the vehicle itself)... so they got all the money I earned from that video + I got a strike on my channel and a scary warning from YouTube saying my entire Google account could get banned including my Gmail. I disputed it with a very clear explanation of the situation, and they quickly reply saying they sided with the complainant and they&#39;ll be ignoring all future disputes.Fuck YouTube/Google.Edit: I went back to find the emails from Google and realised the story is even crazier than I remember. YouTube never reviewed the dispute, they let the person making the claim review their own dispute!!&gt; Hi [Name],&gt; After reviewing your dispute, [Dodgy Fuck&#39;s Name] has decided that their copyright claim is still valid.&gt; Copyrighted content: Spirit&gt; Claimed by: [Dodgy Fuck&#39;s Name]"</p>

She even has the physical copy of one Apollo 12 scene which she telecine&#39;d to digital, uploaded, and then an unclear party made a claim against that video which is currently successful.She also discusses &#34;Visual Claim&#34;[0] and how this will make things worse and how copyright trolls have nothing to lose with doubling down on illegitimate claims.One issue I have with her is her insistence that alternative video platforms, such as Odysee/LBRY, will never have a chance against YouTube.

If work was somehow desirable in and of itself, it would be the other way around: the working class would describe those lucky enough to have a job.People complaining that &#34;nobody wants to work anymore&#34; are usually people not working themselves, who fail to understand that in order to find someone willing to do your own laundry, you have to pay them a fair wage."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of folks here arguing that the focus on TikTok is unfair, given the data collection practices of domestic corps like Facebook.  From a privacy point of view, this argument is well-founded, but I think it&#39;s tangential to the argument TFA is making, which is: this data collection done by a foreign government and exploited for surveillance or espionage is a national security risk.I get it.  We want corps to stop hoovering up our data because they can use it to manipulate us with advertising, and they can mishandle it such that other bad actors can exploit it.  I&#39;m with you, this is a valid concern that we should address.  But I think TikTok&#39;s specific case warrants additional concern because it&#39;s all that, plus it puts a geopolitical adversary in control of the data, countless devices, and a media channel central to the current cultural zeitgeist.I don&#39;t think it&#39;s reasonable to wait for general regulation of social media corps while TikTok continues to do its thing, particularly if targeted action against TikTok is politically viable.Edit: typo"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems an intractable mess.- Our phone hardware and operating systems are intrinsically insecure.- There is no practical/effective data gathering regulation (and I&#39;m not sure
   it&#39;s possible to craft any without destroying innovation)- All social media companies are doing it, leading to jeers of &#34;hypocrisy!&#34;- All governments play the same games, reducing the arguments to
   &#34;Whose side are you on?&#34; That&#39;s effectively meaningless in a
   globalised world. The consequence is more nationalism and an ever
   more fragmented splinternet.- The only proposed solutions amount to more authoritarian,
   controlling and regulatory responses.What can we do?There is a solution. Stop protecting these companies. Burn down
WIPO. Tear up practically all &#34;intellectual property&#34; laws. Revoke
millions of patents. Repeal all DCMA type laws regarding reverse
engineering. Kick trademark and brand protection law to the curb.The real problem is gargantuan monolithic, captive audiences that
exist because incumbent monopolies enjoy protectionist measures that
amount to a giant international trade racket.Creating a real market that forces radical interoperability would
solve many of the problems we see today. Who would care about TiKToK
or Facebook if they were one of 500,000 small &#34;Social Apps&#34; that
connected to a standardised international network.Hell, we could even give it a catchy name, like &#34;The Internet&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been a software dev since the 90s and at this point, I&#39;ve learned to basically do things like audit trails and soft deletion by default, unless there&#39;s some reason not to.Somebody always wants to undelete something, or examine it to see why it was deleted, or see who changed something, or blah blah blah. It helps the business, it helps you as developer by giving you debug information as well as helping you to cover your ass when you are blamed for some data loss bug that was really user error.Soft deletion has obvious drawbacks but is usually far less work than implementing equivalent functionality out-of-stream, with verbose logging or some such.Retrofitting your app and adding soft deletion and audit trails after the fact is usually an order of magnitude more work. Can always add it pre-launch and leave it turned off.If performance is a concern, this is usually something that can be mitigated. You can e.g. have a reaper job that runs daily and hard-deletes everything that was soft-deleted more than n days ago, or whatever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Views are a simple solution to this problem.  Pretty much all moderns RDBMSs support updatable views, so creating views over your tables with a simple WHERE deleted_at IS NULL solves the majority of the author&#39;s problems, including (IIRC) foreign key issues, assuming the deletes are done appropriately.I feel like a lot of developers underutilize the capabilities of the massively advanced database engines they code against. Sure, concerns about splitting logic between the DB and app layers are valid, but there are fairly well developed techniques for keeping DB and app states, logic and schemas aligned via migrations and partitioning and whatnot."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The concept behind soft deletion is to make deletion safer, and reversible.&#34;That&#39;s one part. The other part is that in many industries you have regulatory data retention and audit requirements. This is arguably the most valuable and common reason to perform Logical deletes."</p>

So I should be getting paid better right? Have always been paid worse than my SE peers even though there&#39;s x5 - x10 as many of them.* Know lots of SEs who moved from EE because money was better (chief complaint from them is that SE is easier but they don&#39;t care because job less stressful and again more money).* Have never met an SE moving into EE.* I am now at a junction point in my career where I will either: Leave EE completely and work in something else (probably SE or IT), start my own EE business, consult in compliance of EE products (had one gig for a while and it paid well). Why? because money.And I don&#39;t want fast cars or huge houses or any of that absurdity (although A house would be nice). Just living comfortably would be nice.

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32151609">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you are like me and wondering &#34;What makes carbon different from Rust or Zig?    1. The ability to interoperate with a wide variety of code, such as classes/structs and templates, not just free functions.

    2. A willingness to expose the idioms of C++ into Carbon code, and the other way around, when necessary to maximize performance of the interoperability layer.

    3. The use of wrappers and generic programming, including templates, to minimize or eliminate runtime overhead.

In otherwords, what carbon can do that Rust can&#39;t do, is take a C++ class with a `foo` method and call that method.  Or create a class with a `foo` method and call that method from C++.  Probably one of the biggest hurdles to get over in C++ interopt.  Most don&#39;t do that, instead you&#39;d make a C function binding and struct and move data/invoke functions through that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not immediately obvious from this page and GitHub org, but this is a Google led project. It&#39;s led by Chandler and the c++ toolchain team. I have no idea of it&#39;s endgoals or how open to non-Google ideas it will be."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the end of the safety document:&gt; Overall, Carbon is making a compromise around safety in order to give a path for C++ to evolve. C++ developers must be comfortable migrating their codebases, and able to do so in a largely automated manner. In order to achieve automated migration, Carbon cannot require fundamental redesigns of migrated C++ code. While a migration tool could in theory mark all migrated code as unsafe, Carbon should use a safety strategy that degrades gracefully and offers improvements for C++ code, whether migrated or not.&gt; That does not mean Carbon will never adopt guaranteed safety by default, only that performance and migration of C++ code takes priority, and any design will need to be considered in the context of other goals. It should still be possible to adopt guaranteed safety later, although it will require identifying a migration path.That&#39;s very interesting and pragmatic. It would be interesting if they can eventually come up with the same level of safety guarantees via a different path than Rust&#39;s borrow checker.-------------Since one of their goals is to automatically translate modern C++ to Carbon, I do wonder how well that is going to work in general.I definitely welcome an alternative to C++ that would be easier to read and understand. That would be a benefit to the world."</p>

This would suggest a restful api is not made for system-to-system communication, but requires human mediation at every step of the way, which is precisely not how api’s are used. In short, this definition of restful api’s can’t be right, because it suggests restful interfaces aren’t api’s at all.

Hypermedia is just an expansion on what text means to include temporal anchors within a media stream; most researchers have dropped the distinction.&gt; Hypertext does not need to be HTML on a browser. Machines can follow links when they understand the data format and relationship types.So, to me, a proper format is something like...id: 1234url: http://.../1234name: foodepartment: http://.../department/5555projects: http://.../projects/?user_id=1234This is hypertext in the sense that I can jump around (even in a browser that renders the urls clickable) to other resources related to this resource."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My interest in science started when a friend and I folded a few paper planes, tested them over a small downhill section outside my house, made notes about what worked, tweaked and experimented with new designs, and so on. It blew my little mind that with structured experimentation you could design things that actually got better with each generation. Where would the improvements stop?With hindsight, I realise that most of the improvements we measured were really just statistical noise. We never had a control plane, so if one by accident flew better one test, then we would tweak something and then we would naturally see regression to the mean, but we would record that as a tweak that made things worse.To little me it was a lesson in deliberate design. To grown-up me I guess it&#39;s a lesson in how easy it is to delude yourself without proper experiment design and statistics.Anyway, then after seeing my interest my father brought me an early Windows program that contained animated instructions on some paper plane designs. One of them was vastly superior to anything I had ever seen. But with the years, I forgot how to fold it. I had been looking for it for over 20 years when a few months ago, I wanted to show my son (of two years) a good paper plane and guess what? I think I&#39;ve found the design! But it took a blurry YouTube video and some trial and error. I ought to write it down some day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In fourth grade we had a paper airplane contest, but they had a restriction on the design: a circle about the size of a quarter was on the page, and no fold or crease could go through the circle.The circle was located a few inches above the exact center of the paper.Anyway I made a &#34;dart&#34;, and just offset the angle a little to avoid the circle. It was good, and most of the competition was incredibly bad. And a few maybe had a bad launch. One throw only.One clever design was submitted by a duo composed of my two worst nine year old enemies: Derek and Derek&#39;s sidekick. It was basically a UFO (saucer) made by carefully crumpling the edge until it was a nice size to throw. They threw it sidearm with one finger hooked around the rim.It really sailed, maybe went twice as far as the second best plane: my plane.But their plane was disqualified on the grounds that it wasn&#39;t a plane. So, I was deemed winner.For the announcements the next morning, my name was announced as the wrong-gendered version (something like Jesse announced as Jessica) and it definitely didn&#39;t feel like a win anymore.I still like paper airplanes, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My favorite paper plane is the one that is explained starting at 03:00 here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BNg4fDJC8AOut of all paper planes I tried, it has the best flying capabilities by far.Form and function really come together in this one. It looks beautifully simple and elegant. And that&#39;s also how it flies. When you throw it from a rooftop, you are in for quite a show. It often flies loooong smooth circles. If you are lucky with the wind, it can stay in the air quite a while.I do not use A4 paper though. I prefer A5, which is half the size of A4. I usually tear an A4 into two equal halves and use one of them.I also do not do the crease at 04:18. Without it, the paper plane is even more beautiful, because you can put it on a flat surface and it stands on its own."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To everyone replying with their coffee preferences, you may be missing the point. This post isn’t about coffee, it’s about people and experiences in life being more important than products. It’s about a product’s quality being defined not by its substance but by its reminder of things that can’t be purchased. It’s one of the most beautiful posts I’ve seen in a long time. Hope you look beyond the coffee.Edit: Hope I didn&#39;t come across as too harsh to folks replying with their favourite coffee styles. I think I find myself in a near-constant state of, &#34;but what about the things that matter&#34; when spending time in VC/Startup/SV/AI/crypto/etc. culture. I know more unhappy-but-wildly-successful people here than I can shake a stick at, and I think we (as a community) are hugely complicit in pushing a consumerist culture where stuff&gt;people. I was deeply moved to see a piece surface to HN which poetically argued for the opposite value set, and I had a moment of frustration when it wasn&#39;t clear that it was coming across to people in the comments. :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve gone through several coffee phases, some bordering on extreme — extremely sensitive weighing, timing, $2,000 grinders, $10k espresso machine, etc.My happy medium is just doing basic pour overs, but with really good locally roasted coffee. To me, this is the cheapest and best approach.In fact, even if pour overs require too much work (weighing, timing), then just do drip. But do it with quality coffee.Quality is really about roasting time and date. You don’t want old coffee (anything older than a few weeks isn’t good), and low temp. Dark roast is burnt. It’s not a flavor. It’s used to remove the taste from shitty beans. If you use quality beans you want light to medium. This usually isn’t an option with quality beans anyway. They typically only sell the coffee roasted one way. So in most cases, you won’t even have to worry about.Anyway, I guess my point is the opposite of the article. You don’t have to drink shit coffee to save money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was a really beautiful post.As for coffee, like many other parts of life (movies, food, and music especially), I find that I like it very good or very bad—as long as it’s not down the middle, I can find a time/place to enjoy it.I have a fairly expensive Rocket Espresso machine, I’ve learned some latte art. I have every coffee making contraption out there. And I enjoy all of it, at times.When I’m in a hurry I’ll make instant or go to a gas station. Totally fine and the gas station coffee is kind of a favorite of mine for long trips in the car.What I almost never do is buy Starbucks because to me, it feels like that middle-of-the-road experience. I’m not making a statement about the company or the culture or anything like that. It just feels like going to Applebees or something (yes you’re out to eat, but shouldn’t you just go somewhere nice or, on the other hand, somewhere cheaper/faster where you don’t have to tip?). It’s too acidic and too expensive for what it is. I’d rather pay for something nicer or go cheap."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When speaking about Sardinia they keep saying that their diet was mostly vegetarian:&#34;The classic Sardinian diet is plant based, consisting of whole-grain bread, beans, garden vegetables, and fruits. Meat is largely reserved for Sundays and special occasions. Sardinians drink wine moderately.&#34;Truth is that the Shepherds (the centenaries are mostly found in this group) were actually eating more animal protein and fat compared to the rest of the population.https://snipboard.io/gbi9JY.jpgThey can keep lying to most people just because you can&#39;t understand Italian but whenever people from those towns are interviewed they always repeat that they were not vegetarians. 
Here a quick translation from this yt video:Graziano who got to 102 
got asked if he got to 102yo
because he had always followed a
mediterranean diet.
He asked what&#39;s that?
It means that you always ate vegetables.
Vegetables are bad for you, I 
ate the grass of 100 sheeps because
I ate the sheeps. And indeed
he only ate meat, meaning that this whole
alimentation thing should be checked again.https://youtu.be/LQTocSMm7tw?t=647"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read the books and enjoyed them.- To respond to one criticism seen widely here, the authors claim to have validated ages with historical municipal birth records in all the Blue Zones. I cannot speak to these particular zones, but I&#39;ve been doing genealogical research on my own ancestry and I am absolutely blown away by the ubiquity and detail of both municipal and Catholic church records in Sicily in the 1800s.  Preunification Italy was under the rule of various northern European countries and was heavily influenced by their standards of record keeping. I cannot say if this applies to the other countries in the book, but generally speaking, just because these records are old doesn&#39;t mean they are bad.- One thing that was very notable in the books but isn&#39;t discussed very much is that, with the exception of the Loma Linda cohort, the Blue Zone areas are all quite poor. They all primarily eat food they are able to grow or harvest themselves, out of necessity, which encourages simple and consistent diets. They have routine, simple lives that are made fulfilling by concentrating on community, family, and friends.  They are content with what little they have and do not strive for more than they need.I found the books quite inspiring.  I think the lessons learned are good, even if they won&#39;t get me to 100.  In any case I&#39;ve felt much better and lost weight on a closer-to-Blue-Zone diet than I did before."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One Ikarian in particular, Stamatis Moraitis, moved to America when he was 22 years old to pursue the American dream. He was a painter, and immediately started having success, bought a house, married, and had 3 kids. At the age of 66 years, he developed terminal lung cancer. Instead of dying in America, he decided to move back to Ikaria and moved in with his parents. He started breathing the air, drinking the wine, and eating a Mediterranean diet. After a few months, he planted a garden not planning on ever getting to harvest the vegetables; 37 years later he has a vineyard producing 200 L of wine a year. His secret he says? “I just forgot to die.”This is where I think the article loses its credibility significantly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I planted some thousands of trees in Iceland in the noughties. I believe the program was funded by Alcoa to offset the carbon produced by an aluminum plant they were building on the island. They paid farmers to plant trees on unused land, and the farmers hired and hosted us to do the work. It was an amazing way to see the country. We mostly planted larch, birch and alder from what I remember. It is a very beautiful country, like an arctic Hawaii."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Planting forests increases the overall amount of carbon stored in biomass, but the forestry program is also designed to harvest trees for use as fuel or building material (from the main article linked in the post):&gt; &#34;In the meantime, Iceland’s forests have begun to produce wood for a small timber market. Forests planted between 1950-1970 are now supplying around 5,000 square metres of wood per year: miniscule compared to industries abroad, but a start. The Icelandic birch, Siberian larch, Sitka spruce, lodgepole pine and balsam poplar are producing quality wood of equal or superior quality to that which Iceland imports from abroad. Yet an overwhelming 80% of the trees felled are burned as fuel in silicon smelting.&#34;Iceland has a silicon production industry, which relies on geothermal electricity interestingly enough.  The wood is included to grab the oxygen from silicon dioxide to produce elemental silicon metal (being emitted as carbon dioxide).  Overall, if they could eliminate the coal from the mix, this would be a carbon-neutral fossil-fuel free silicon production system:https://www.pcc.is/&gt; &#34;Silicon metal is extracted from quartzite, aided by the addition of wood chip and coal, in electric arc furnaces at temperatures of around 2,000 degrees Celsius. The new plant obtains its key raw material quartzite primarily from PCC’s own quarry in Zagórze, Poland. However, the related logistical costs are more than outweighed by the advantages of electricity procurement. And the dust emissions generated during silicon metal production are almost completely removed from the ambient air by high-performance filter systems installed in the PCC plant. Taken as a whole, therefore, the production process offers exceptional sustainability credentials.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been donating some money every month to an Icelandic tree planting project to offset my carbon emissions after reading an article on HN about how the Vikings cut all trees of the island. I find the numbers fascinating :&gt; Forests and bushes now cover over 2% of Iceland, Vísir reports. That number may not seem like much, but since 1990, the surface area covered by forest or shrubs in Iceland has increased more than six times over – from 7,000 hectares to 45,000. In 20 years, the number is expected to be 2.6%.And from another article :&gt; The Forest Service intends to deliver six million plants this year, says Þröstur, which is equivalent to pre-crash levels of production. “It was around five million last year, and four million the year before that. This is a rapid increase. Then we need seven to eight million next year, which we may not manage, and ten to twelve in 2025.”"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My favorite feature is &#34;video-sync=display-resample&#34;. This gives you perfect frame pacing by synchronizing the video to vertical refresh and resampling the audio to match. If you set your refresh rate to an integer multiple of the frame rate, every frame will be shown for the exact same time. The audio resampling compensates for very small discrepancies between speeds by imperceptibly changing the audio speed. It&#39;s similar to the proprietary DirectShow filter &#34;ReClock&#34;, but AFAIK ReClock does not dynamically adjust the speed to compensate for clock drift like MPV does, in which case you could theoretically still get imperfect frame pacing. (I haven&#39;t actually used ReClock so I could be mistaken here.)Also great is MPV&#39;s support for arbitrary OpenGL shaders. This can include very complicated shaders, e.g. real-time neural network upscaling:https://github.com/igv/FSRCNN-TensorFlow/releasesSD video can look surprisingly good after upscaling with this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I highly recommend doing what I have done most of my career. Get a job at smaller to medium sized non-tech company. Every company, in any industry, has computers. They need you. You don&#39;t have to work with a bunch of tech or finance people. You can get a job working with chill people in some other industry with a better culture.When it comes time to negotiate, negotiate HARD. And not just for money, but especially time. Ask for so much that you think they will laugh or be scared away. If they say no, you lose nothing. Eventually the right opportunity will appear. I didn&#39;t think anyone would say yes to a 4-day work week, but I kept asking. Eventually someone said yes.The one worry I am having these days is how long this strategy will remain viable. As SaaS and low/no code solutions proliferate, it makes little sense for non-tech companies to build when they can buy. This is especially true as engineer compensation continues to rise. Engineers who congregate at SaaS companies can build better products than a handful out on their own who are building a solution for just one company. Increasingly, the only engineers that non-tech companies need are people to manage their data, people to glue the SaaS APIs together, and maybe some frontend people to put a custom interface on it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think most people here can. That&#39;s why, when people have enough money to retire, they DO retire, and not continue working. Work for most people is trading  time and physical and mental health for money. In our profession, we got it better than most, but the underlying principle is still the same.Also, there are definitely better and worse companies. I&#39;m currently in the best job of my life (well paying, fully remote, very little meetings, no micromanagement, using interesting and cutting edge technology), but it took me 15 years to get there. The catch is that such companies don&#39;t have to hire that often (because people don&#39;t tend to leave them), so most openings at the market in any given moment are from shit companies where average tenure is 18-24 months and half of the staff has low-grade depression. The job market is essentially a market for lemons, unfortunately."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel exactly the same. Programming professionally for a decade sucked all the joy out of it.My personal hypothesis is that we’re increasingly being treated like assembly line workers. We’re not paid to think but to implement the poorly thought out hare brained schemes from the higher ups who have no clue about programming. This externalizes all the cost of poor quality software onto the developers (unmaintainable code, constant outages…) while  reaping the short term benefits for themselves (promotions, raises)."</p>

It&#39;s true though - the Government missions involved, where this type of data is relevant, face rather compelling offerings especially in complex times; e.g. immigrant/refugee surges where understanding the flow of people up to the border is important for stability.All of this data comes from Big/Small/all tech; usually branded as &#34;ad tech&#34; or &#34;mobility data&#34;. And the supply chain is rather murky, masked, and rebranded/repackaged numerous times between a network of data providers &amp; downstream businesses.Working close to Government... I&#39;ve never seen any mission specifically seeking large-scale citizen-based tracking capabilities.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every person, living and dead, has been uniquely identified and is tracked in near real time.Source: I read the news, don&#39;t suffer from amnesia or willful ignorance.We used Seisent (since bought by LexisNexus) in the mid-aughts. At the time, every person in North America was accounted for, with pretty good coverage of the Caribbean and Central America. The NSA bought a few clusters, then wove in their own datasets (phone use, location tracking, credit cards, library usage, email, etc).There are many entities maintaining all encompassing panopticonic demographic databases. Governments and publicly traded companies. This is not refutable.Ironically, in the USA, both voter registration and gun ownership are explicitly excluded. Because reasons. (You can&#39;t manage what you don&#39;t measure.)We could, trivially, resolve all the policy food fights over vote registration &#34;fraud&#34;, gun ownership, and conducting the consensus. Turn all those flash points into simple database queries.We could, trivially, outright stop all anonymous trolling and disinformation.

The gist is: can&#39;t eliminate ad links? Then have an app &#34;click&#34; all of them randomly so that counters become irrelevant. So there is this link that identifies user X?, well then write an extension that distributes and &#34;clicks&#34; it around on say 1000 other machines in a p2p way so that it becomes meaningless.I have no idea if it&#39;s doable in this FB context, but usually when links can&#39;t be anonymized, the next move is to make them produce irrelevant data by adding noise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I haven&#39;t used Facebook in quite a while, but when I did I had a set of userscripts to defuse this tracking. It worked similarly to Google link stripping, by defusing the JavaScript that rewrote the link between the time you clicked it and when your browser opened it. Initially I built it because the free wireless internet in my apartment was unreliable and the redirects could be enough to prevent a page from opening. My method was pretty blunt - I removed element entities that held the target URL, and that broke the listener function. A later iteration would actually unset the listener event. This all worked because it seemed important to FB that you be able to see where the link would take you (e.g. by hovering). I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Facebook&#39;s paternalism (and Google&#39;s for that matter, but I haven&#39;t seen it from them, though I mainly use DDG now) now led them to add this &#34;protection&#34; directly to links as they&#39;re served up. I can&#39;t tell from the article whether that&#39;s the case, and at this point I&#39;m not going to log in to FB to figure it out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would love to stop using Facebook, Instagram or Whatsapp, but I would really need to criple my social life if I&#39;d give up on any of these. And I&#39;m not even a very active person, it&#39;s just that so many people I want to engage with have a huge chunk of their lives tied to one of these.I can&#39;t understand the people saying there is a free market choice here, this can only be solved with simple regulation that targest large platforms.If the SEC can use its judgement on what constitutes a security, than we can have a social media comission to oversee Facebook."</p>

I mean, really—Orwell?I&#39;m referring to the omission of this passage: &#34;I should like to put it on record that I have never been able to dislike Hitler. Ever since he came to power—till then, like nearly everyone, I had been deceived into thinking that he did not matter—I have reflected that I would certainly kill him if I could get within reach of him, but that I could feel no personal animosity.... that several commenters pointed out:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32135108https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32133675https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32130897All: in the future, if you notice something like this, could you please send us a heads up at hn@ycombinator.com? We can&#39;t read all the articles or comments, but we do read all the emails, usually within a few hours. We will be especially grateful if you point out a howler as massive as this one.Edit: I couldn&#39;t resist diffing the bowdlerized text with the gutenberg.net.au one and the eliding of that bit is the only difference between the two, other than punctuation. How embarrassing.Edit 2: it turns out that bookmarks.reviews is guilty only of blogspam. They got the thing from https://www.openculture.com/2014/08/george-orwell-reviews-me..., which links to https://carnegiecouncil-media.storage.googleapis.com/files/v... (via https://boingboing.net/2014/08/17/orwells-review-of-mein-kam...). That looks like a decades-old copy of the 1968 edition, edited by Orwell&#39;s widow. I doubt that it was she who dropped that sentence—I bet it was whoever reprinted the essay. Considering that Orwell specifically wrote &#34;I should like to put it on record&#34;, that took some brass, or lack thereof.The degree to which Orwell practiced intellectual honesty is an endless marvel. If there&#39;s one thing we should learn from anybody, it&#39;s that from him."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting that this version is an edited version, and unclear when the changes occurred.The full version[1] includes this:&gt; I should like to put it on record that I have never been able to dislike Hitler. Ever since he came to power—till then, like nearly everyone, I had been deceived into thinking that he did not matter—I have reflected that I would certainly kill him if I could get within reach of him, but that I could feel no personal animosity. The fact is that there is something deeply appealing about him.In the linked version that is represented by &#34;...&#34; which is easy to miss[1] http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks16/1600051h.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, there&#39;s a lot to be said about Hitler and fascism and propaganda and all the other fascinating topics Orwell brings up here, but I&#39;d just like to point out how routinely excellent Orwell&#39;s analysis is.  Of course I mostly see the best bits brought out and dusted off, no doubt he did mediocre stuff as well, but it is worth noticing how often it turns out that Orwell, nearly a century on, still has plenty in his writing worth revisiting."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One practice that&#39;s helped me is to always cancel immediately, which translates to only paying for one month. Ie. for spotify, netflix pay for the subscription, immediately jump through the hoops to cancel.Forgetfulness turns into money savings, and as a bonus I get to review whether I am getting much out of it. Especially for tv like disney/netflix/apple tv, I often run though everything interesting and don&#39;t have much else to watch with them.Also psychologically there&#39;s resistance to a boring to do that involves loss. I will put off &#34;go to netflix and figure out how to cancel.&#34; So do that work when you are excited to see the new show."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is it typical to spend so much on software subscriptions? I pay for Spotify and a cheap VPS if that counts but that&#39;s it. I figured the average person probably has one or two media subscriptions (Netflix, Disney, Spotify, etc) and nothing else."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I think may be underrated by many:We cancelled Amazon Prime, and besides the annual fee, we noticed that our household retail spending went down significantly. It turns out that when it takes more than 1-click to buy stuff… we buy less stuff.As far as convenience, one of the reasons we felt it was time to cancel is that we can just as easily get almost anything we wanted from Amazon direct from the seller or via Target/Best Buy/B&amp;N/B&amp;H. Surprisingly, this is often cheaper than Amazon (and almost never more expensive). While there’s a bit of added friction to think for two seconds which store to check, the benefit of fewer impulse buys seems worth it. Plus, we haven’t ended up with any crappy knockoffs since we bailed on Amazon."</p>

(Below is the answer translated by deepl).I don&#39;t want to talk about China, I want to talk about Russia.Can Russia become the next technological powerhouse? Of course not.Because the ceiling of Russian intelligence or wisdom is Putin. There is no one in Russia who can claim to be more intelligent than Putin. Russia can do without anyone, but not without Putin. Although we do not know whether Putin has any relevant qualifications or experience in the industry, all Russian businesses and professions depend on Putin&#39;s guidance and must hold up Putin&#39;s ideas and banners, otherwise they will not be able to move forward. Putin is the ceiling of Russia. How can a country with a ceiling become a technological powerhouse?Look at the United States. Who dares to direct the work of Musk, whether Trump or Biden? Who dares to direct the business strategies of Apple and Google? I find that in the US, it seems that anyone can say they are smarter than the president, it seems that anyone can say they are smarter than the president. The technology companies in the US seem to be able to run smoothly without the guidance of Biden&#39;s ideas, and they seem to be able to develop technology without raising the banner of Biden&#39;s ideas, and they seem to be doing quite well. I find that the US is a country that has no ceiling in terms of intelligence or ingenuity, and that is always improving.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The background for this is that most existing UI toolkits are a poor fit for Rust.Rust doesn&#39;t like having shared mutable state, but event-based UIs have a global event loop and can mutate anything at any time.Rust works best with strictly tree-shaped data structures, but event handlers turn trees of widgets into arbitrary webs with possibility of circular references.Rust prefers everything thread-safe, but many UI toolkits can&#39;t even be touched from a &#34;non-main&#34; thread.Rust&#39;s object-oriented programming features are pretty shallow, and Rust doesn&#39;t have inheritance. That makes it awkward to model most toolkits that have deep hierarchies with a base View type and a dozen of Button subclasses.So instead of retrofitting mutable single-threaded OOP to a functional multi-threaded language, there&#39;s a quest to find another approach for UIs. This change of approach has worked for games. Rust wasn&#39;t nice for &#34;class Player extends Entity&#34; design, but turned out to be a great fit the ECS pattern."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the web really killed the idea of &#34;native&#34; widgets. I think the rise of web apps just got everyone used to the idea that controls are just going to look different everywhere.

And in windows, microsoft really killed it themselves by constantly updating their own apps with non-standard widgets that everyone else wanted to clone (I remember the longest time it seemed like the only new things of note in every new version of ms office was how the toolbars looked).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like Scratch - my kid uses it and I worked briefly with the guy who made Blockly, the underlying visual programming toolkit - but the programming environment makes many things far too complicated with its singular focus on sprites.It&#39;s very, very difficult to do things as simple as display a number on screen. My 7yo was making a number guessing game, and to display a two-digit number we had to make two sprites that had 10 &#34;costumes&#34; (0-9) then do modular math to select the costume for each digit. Sprites also have their own code, and if you duplicate one and edit the code the edits don&#39;t apply to the duplicate - so there&#39;s no user library or abstraction power at all.This made dealing with Scratch far more complex and time-consuming than the logic of the game my kid was making, which is the exact opposite of what you want in a learning environment. I don&#39;t really want to focus on the idiosyncrasies of Scratch when teaching programming.Some simple text and drawing commands, user-defined functions, and a library would go a huge way towards making Scratch simpler. There are some other Blockly-based environments that may have this... but they&#39;re not as popular."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is great that Scratch can be used as an introduction to programming, but that is not why it was created. It was part of the MIT MediaLab &#34;Computer Clubhouse&#34;[1] project where it would be used to enable a remix culture of cute animations and even simple games. Scratch&#39;s implementer, John Maloney, had already helped create a programming environment for kids called EToys[2] using Squeak Smalltalk, just as in the first versions of Scratch (later rewritten in Flash and then in Javascript).So the comments about how it is hard to do in Scratch something that would be trivial in Basic or some other language are not surprising. It is an animation system that allows you to use programming to increment that.As others have pointed out, a system with the same visual as Scratch but design for actually programming is Snap![3] so it is just a matter of using the tools for what they were created to do.[1] https://web.media.mit.edu/~mres/papers/Clubhouse/Clubhouse.h...[2] http://squeakland.org/[3] https://snap.berkeley.edu/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those who are interested and may not know; Bill Watterson also ghost-drew a few strips for the comic Pearls Before Swine (part of an arc beginning on the 2nd of June 2014[0] and continuing till the 8th). There are a couple of neat references to who it is behind the better art (anyone who&#39;s read Watterson&#39;s complaints on shrinking panel space in print media will be familiar with the guest character&#39;s comments) and I recall an old blog post by the artist of Pearls describing what it was like to work with Bill (terrifying; the thought of the postal worker just chucking these, the only comics anyone had gotten out of Watterson in years, onto his porch in the rain was horrible), but I can&#39;t find it.[0]: https://www.gocomics.com/pearlsbeforeswine/2014/06/02EDIT: Nevermind, found it! https://stephanpastis.wordpress.com/2014/06/07/ever-wished-t..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been running a Calvin &amp; Hobbes bot for ~20 years now.  Back when Google Reader was a thing, the bot published an RSS feed which had greater than &gt;1M subscribers.  It&#39;s now a bot on Reddit (/u/CalvinBot) with &gt;700k karma.During that time, I&#39;ve tried to be very mindful of Watterson&#39;s copyright and make sure I don&#39;t violate it anyway.This had led to some interesting &#34;bugs.&#34;  Specifically amuniversal.com only publishes the comic strip as a GIF.  But the official Reddit mobile app has a bug.  It treats all GIFs as a video &amp; disables other image features, like zooming.  The nature of C&amp;H is such that very often want to zoom to see all the wonderful details Mr. Watterson put into the strip.Because of that I routinely get complaints about it being in a GIF (&#34;GIFs are for movies!&#34; the whippersnappers say) and tell me to publish them as JPG or PNG.  Now converting a GIF to JPG or PNG is trivial, but there&#39;s no way I can do so without violating his copyright.  I&#39;d have to host the converted image myself, which I don&#39;t have the right the do.So I won&#39;t do it.It&#39;s minor, but knowing Watterson felt so passionate about copyright, I think it&#39;s important to honor.  But because the team at Reddit won&#39;t fix the bug, the complaints continue to come rolling in.  Enough that I wrote a FAQ about it:https://www.reddit.com/r/CalvinBot/comments/bdxb6h/why_are_p...If any C&amp;H fans knows anyone on the team at Reddit, I&#39;d much appreciate it if you could ask them to fix it."</p>

Monetizing a thing immediately called into question its integrity, and more importantly, the integrity of the artist. But then an interesting thing began happening in the late 90’s and early 00’s. The idea of selling out lost its negative connotation.It did? I completely missed that, but it&#39;s probably because I&#39;m old..."</p>

(Author misinterprets appearances of `www.domain` and `domain` in his source list as errant duplicates, when in fact that may be an indicator that those `www.domain` entries also have significant `subdomain.www.domain` extensions – depending on what Majestic means by &#39;subnets&#39;.)• Many sites may block `curl` requests because they only want attended human browser traffic, and such blocking (while usually accompanied with some error response) can be a more aggressive drop-connection.• `curl` given a naked hostname likely attempts a plain HTTP connection, and given that even browsers now auto-prefix `https:` for a naked hostname, some active sites likely have nothing listening on plain-HTTP port anymore.• Author&#39;s burst of activity could&#39;ve triggered other rate-limits/failures - either at shared hosts/inbound proxies servicing many of the target domains, or at local ISP egresses or DNS services. He&#39;d need to drill-down into individual failures to get a beter idea to what extent this might be happening.If you want to probe if domains are still active:• confirm they&#39;re still registered via a `whois`-like lookup• examine their DNS records for evidence of current services• ping them, or any DNS-evident subdomains• if there are any MX records, check if the related SMTP server will confirm any likely email addresses (like postmaster@) as deliverable. (But: don&#39;t send an actual email message.)• (more at risk of being perceived as aggressive) scan any extant domains (from DNS) for open ports running any popular (not just HTTP) servicesIf you want to probe if web sites are still active, start with an actual list of web site URLs that were known to have been active at some point."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I strongly dislike the idea of automatically jumping into a folder when there’s only one match: it feels like a feature optimised for very slow typers that actively penalises fast typers, because it makes things generally unpredictable: will one character be enough to navigate, or two, or three? It depends on the siblings, and if you type more characters than are required, you will be penalised by ending up somewhere else as the remaining letters are fed to the next level down that you haven’t even seen yet. My general habit in navigating is to type three characters and press Tab, because that’s almost always sufficient, and is plenty fast. I have a very few places where I’ve learned to do other things. Under my habit, I could end up as much as two levels down from where I wanted to be."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting.OTOH, people have named a number of similar tools, and I&#39;m going to point out &#39;mc&#39;
 aka Midnight Commander, which is part of most linux distro&#39;s, and is a clone of the 1980&#39;s Norton commander. Its designed to be a command line TUI helper, sorta like the project here, with not only cursor/etc based directory navigation but copy/rename/delete/etc functionality just a keystroke away. Its fairly convenient because it overlays the command line rather than replacing it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a lot of comments on this thread pointing out typical bandwidth usage of popular streaming services, games etc and claiming that there&#39;s no need for higher bandwidth connections.There&#39;s an important point that I think people are missing, which is that the bandwidth usage of internet services is going to be carefully tuned to balance quality and stability at typical internet speeds. When a large portion of consumers have &lt; 100Mbps down of course all services are going to use &lt; 100Mbps of bandwidth - you don&#39;t know what kind of stuff you&#39;re missing out on because of these slow internet speeds, because nobody is making it available, because it wouldn&#39;t work.The most obvious thing that we already know we&#39;re missing out on is video streaming quality. You&#39;ve possibly already noticed that low contrast dark scenes and scenes with snow/rainfall don&#39;t look very good on Netflix/YouTube/insert streaming service here - this is because these are the kind of scenes with the most obvious sacrifice of quality from video compression. (It&#39;s also possible you haven&#39;t noticed this, because streaming services generally avoid producing content that doesn&#39;t play well with their video compression)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With how slowly these proposals roll out, 100/20 won&#39;t be enough. As others said, there is a lack of both competition and pricing to worry about too.In a major tech hub like San Francisco, where I live, it&#39;s possible to get 1gb/1gb in some areas for under $90, but which those are isn&#39;t consistent nor wide spread. Home cell coverage at 100/20 is spotty at best, and there is only one flat rate vendor (T-Mobile Home, no Verizon Home yet). For those outside of the Bay Area exurbs, I can only imagine the horrors of Comcast/Xfinity or only DSL people must deal with.Looking forward, the FCC is assuming that people are just watching Netflix, Tiktok, and making angry Karen posts on Nextdoor. We&#39;re not sure where web3 will lead, and how much bandwidth will that take: Distributed file systems/data privacy? Fast crypto transactions? Metaverse/VR/AR glasses/contacts? And what about latency?1000/500 should be the FCC goal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem, in the USA for most people, is Comcast.Downspeed hardly matters. It&#39;s been plenty for decades. Upload speed has stagnated. I uploaded as fast in 2003 as I do now in 2022. And as others have said, it&#39;s not so much about 1 fast provider as many providers and choice. In my comcast monopoly my plan started at $60/mo in 2011 and without any changes on my end and no change in my upload speed that price has increased to it&#39;s current $105/mo. In addition to the price increases they&#39;ve implemented a new system of total data transfer limits ((up/down)+internal overhead) meaning even if I could have a faster connection it&#39;d mean nothing if I used it in the first week and then got hit with multiple $10 overage &#34;fees&#34;.But I don&#39;t have a choice. It doesn&#39;t matter how good, or bad, Comcast is. They&#39;re the only game in town."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s actually some science behind this diet. Potatoes are the highest scoring food on the satiety index. https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/15-incredibly-filling-f...Basically they&#39;re the most filling food per calorie. So if you subscribe to the idea that losing weight is mainly about how many calories you consume, a potato heavy diet should be effective.And an all potato diet, while monomaniacal, even more effective.Eggs and fish are also very high on the satiety index. If you threw in pretty much any vegetables and spices of your choosing and just stuck to those along with potatoes, even with a cheat day or three you&#39;d have a very healthy diet which I bet most people would lose weight on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I spent a few weeks eating only potatoes and vegetable oil, several years ago. It wasn&#39;t for weight loss, it was because I was breastfeeding, and my baby had some kind of protein sensitivity we couldn&#39;t nail down. Potatoes turned out to be a safe food for him, so that&#39;s all I ate for a while. As it happens potatoes are my favorite food, and I had vegetable oil available so I could eat fries/chips/crisps, but even then I can&#39;t imagine doing it without a similarly serious motivation. When my choices were &#34;listen to the baby cry in pain every time he eats&#34; or &#34;eat potatoes until the allergist appointment,&#34; it was an easy choice. Otherwise I wouldn&#39;t last long on the potato diet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only reason the potato diet is interesting to me (and presumably the reason it&#39;s interesting to the https://slimemoldtimemold.com/ folks) is the likely relationship to their environmental contaminant hypothesis for the public health issue of increasing body weights since 1980, outlined in a series of posts here: http://achemicalhunger.com/In short, while the variety and satiety explanations make a lot of sense subjectively for an individual on this diet, they don&#39;t match up with the empirical data on weight gain since 1980. Here are a few phenomena that are not explained by this hypothesis:* The inflection point at right around 1980. There&#39;s no specific change that occurred in 1980 that anyone can point to that indicates a major change in variety of food in the average diet.* The correllation of weight gain with location in watersheds: high altitude locales where surface water has not moved very far (e.g. Colorado) exhibit the weight gain phenomena much less than locales deeper down in the watershed (e.g. Mississippi and Louisiana)I&#39;m not interested in fad diets or disordered eating because they have a track record of bad long term outcomes, but I am interested in the potato diet as a blunt tool for taking action on this hypothesis, which looks pretty compelling to me. And if it doesn&#39;t work out, that&#39;s fine, too!"</p>

That’s all the vim most people need.The fact that less is installed on many more systems than nano is a testament to the bad assumptions too many devs make about who will be using these systems in the future. And yes, it’s not hard to &#34;apt -y install nano&#34; except at work where we have proxies and internal repos, so now I need to use vim to reconfigure apt sources just so I can use a more normal editor that doesn’t require arcane incantations to perform basic config file editing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really want to like vim and I love some things about it, like the ability to move chunks about with only the keyboard. But so many things about it kill me. Like, why can&#39;t I hit right at the end of a line, and move to the next line? Who thinks that is a good idea? Also, why do I have to have a special mode to insert things? Having to change modes just seems so complex and unintuitive. And why does the help system never tell me what I want?The frustration is that probably there are fixes for all these things, which if I were an expert I would know. But meanwhile I can use an ordinary visual text editor and I don&#39;t have to learn anything new."</p>

TikTok has not really been rewarding creators fairly, and pushes the idea that organic growth is possible, and that people have become really successful, but many creators realize after months of working for little to no reward that it&#39;s a false narrative.There are billions of accounts on these platforms yes, but the main question is are they actively posting, engaged, and satisfied?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Heya, I&#39;m the author of the article. I&#39;ve been working on Kandria full time for close to two years now, and on-and-off for some years while I was doing my Master&#39;s at ETH. The engine it&#39;s running on, Trial, is a few years older still, and initially just started out of the good ole university boredom and curiosity. Games is how I got into programming when I was about 6, and that particular fever hasn&#39;t left me yet it seems, ha ha!Kandria itself started as a &#34;more serious&#34; attempt at a game after I&#39;d been making jam games with Trial for some years. I wanted to create something bigger, and had just finished playing through Celeste, so I just set out to replicate its mechanics in my own way. You can still find some demos of those very early days on my YouTube channel, if you&#39;re curious. In any case, the project went through several big changes until it turned into what it is now. During the pandemic in 2020 I finally decided to drop out of my Master&#39;s to pursue the project full time. At that point I also brought on a couple more people to help with the writing, art, and sound.We&#39;re currently also running a Kickstarter to get us some extra funds for the project. It ends on Thursday 14th, 12:00 CEST, so there&#39;s not that much time left in it. If you&#39;d like to support our work, please have a look: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shinmera/kandria
The campaign page has a lot more details on the project and the team, if you&#39;re curious about that.In the article I primarily cover the programming parts, giving a surface overview of the technologies involved and at least giving a brief hint at the methodology I employ to create games. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve left out a lot of details that you might be curious about, so if you have any questions, please feel free to ask and I&#39;ll try my best to answer!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a nice write up.The dark side is that they&#39;ve put years into developing the core infrastructure to empower their Lisp game journey. Ideally that&#39;s all usable by others to &#34;stand on the shoulders&#34;, so to speak, but that&#39;s always a challenge.I honestly have never had to work on a &#34;running image&#34; of any consequence. I&#39;ve never worked on anything more than a few thousand lines of code. I&#39;ve never needed any kind of source level &#34;step&#34; debugging. The ability to redefine a function quickly, I just throw in some prints to figure something out.Reloading the entire source file was always fast enough to now warrant hunting down any of the more interactive mechanisms available. This is all across using simple vi, or emacs, or even LispWorks.  (defun l () (load &#34;src.lisp&#34;))

Just save the file, and type that.All that said, my current low level fantasy is something akin to Electron, only with Common Lisp. First class DOM, first class event hooks, into a CL runtime that you can deploy cross platform. Dunno if that exists or not.I&#39;m sure at some point my codebase will grow to the point where I would need to &#34;level up&#34; and become more intimate with SLIME, packages, system definitions, etc.I&#39;ve just not crossed that threshold yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;&gt; One thing I do have to mention though is that the workflow in Lisp allows me to create these support libraries much faster than I can in other languages.I&#39;m at that stage in my lisp journey (~18 months) where i know enough to be dangerous to others around me, i.e. i&#39;m still a lisp n00b but have completed a few lisp &amp; scheme books and written enough projects that i feel fairly productive. BUT i haven&#39;t reached, never mind come out the other side of, the &#34;trough of disillusionment&#34; yet. So everything lisp is unreasonably tainted with a positive glow in my mind.TL;DR i still think lisp is pretty awesome. It&#39;s my newest hammer and everything looks like a lisp-shaped nail these days. So i have to be deliberate and careful not to over-use lisp but it&#39;s totally changed how i write js for example. It&#39;s infected my brain.Here&#39;s the thing - that workflow statement by the OP is a fair chunk of the attraction to lisp for me. Before lisp i &#34;knew&#34; what a REPL was - i&#39;ve been using python since i switched wholesale from Perl in the 00&#39;s, i thought you couldn&#39;t teach me anything new about REPLs, even quasi-REPLs like Jupyter were entirely familiar and &#34;basic&#34; to me. If you&#39;re a lisper, you know i was wrong about that, if you&#39;re not a lisper you&#39;re probably wondering what&#39;s the big deal.The other chunk - and i&#39;m only really scratching the surface so far - has been macros. I think so far i prefer the non-hygenic type, but i haven&#39;t gone through Let over Lambda yet (although the book is on my bookshelf and is only 2 titles away from being started)For me, lisp opened my eyes to a way of working that i just wish i could fully replicate in other languages. Lisp has made me re-appreciate python and js in different ways now.If you want a really short version - Brett Victor&#39;s famous inventing on principle talk sums it up for me (he was using JS there, so there is hope...)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I tried to pick up Rust a few years ago, but there were too many sharp edges. I thought it was a nice language, but was too early for actual use. I played with some libraries (Apache Arrow, etc) and it was nice.About 2 months ago I wanted to use Arrow within Elixir, which required me to start using Rust again (Elixir uses Rustler to safely convert from Rust &lt;&gt; Elixir without theoretically crashing the beam). I am amazed how far it&#39;s come, and I&#39;ve actually been using it a lot over the last few months and haven&#39;t ran into any major issues. There is a fair amount of information out there, and the documentation as the OP pointed out is really fantastic.The libraries are really good now, and I&#39;ve had no issues using it on Linux or on my Macbook M1. Incredibly impressive speed results. SIMD is a game changer.Major shoutouts to arrow2 and Polars, I love using it for data analysis :)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love rust.  I didn’t find it difficult to learn and at this point several others I’ve introduced it to also haven’t.  I’m baffled as to where that reputation comes from.I get that it makes you think about what you’re building a little more than something you can throw together like Python or Ruby but if the end goal is software that works correctly, getting there definitely isn’t harder with rust.  It’s the complete opposite :/."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been thinking to myself whether I should pick up Go or Rust as a new language this year.Coming from a NodeJS background, Rust looks a tad more complicated but it looks cooler. There are also more job listings looking for Golang than Rust which makes me wonder if Golang might be a more rewarding investment?What would be a good use case of Rust than Golang cannot do given its extra complexity and potentially lesser monetary reward? Any advice on which I should pick as a new language to learn?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got my first paid work writing software because I got lucky on GitHub.Back in college, I simply commented on a peer&#39;s issue made for a local hackathon. He was confused about what direction to take for a webapp, and didn&#39;t have any experience in any frameworks. I just suggested Rails, and gave a few highlights for it and pointed him towards some starter guides.Within a couple hours a well connected student (I believe he ran the CS club) saw my comment, and forwarded it to an alumni who was doing local Rails work.I actually didn&#39;t have any experience in Rails beyond the tutorials of the day, and I made that clear. But he liked the look of my GitHub and was happy to give me the job.It was pretty good money for a college student. I recall not really knowing what to expect hourly wise, and when he brought up payment I wasn&#39;t able to give an answer so he immediately said 50/hr. To me, I was truly expecting like half of that. I tried to keep cool as I accepted.  My pricing mindset was definitely anchored by waiting tables, where 50/hr is something you might get if you got a really lucky shift and required busting ass. So to get that much for _sitting down_? Oh boy.After settling on the price, he stepped out of the room for a bit. This was a shared co-working space, and I recall looking over to the guy next to us (who I could tell was paying some attention to our conversation) and saying I did not expect that much money. He happened to work for Uber - and he agreed that I got a very good deal. Not sure why I remember that detail.Anyway: yes, working in public, and even being helpful in public, certainly can pay dividends."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The drastic move to organic farming is puzzling.Any level headed person, forget a politician, would want to experiment first, see the results, gauge and then expand selectively. That is common sense.I guess when you are a dictator ish government and you rule the country with an iron first, the institutions of the state stop being anything and simply become rubber stamps.This also underlines the importance of self sufficiency in necessities. A country ought to feed its people, provide basic services like power and medical facilities on its own, without depending on imports."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; But the most boneheaded, bizarre mistake that the Sri Lankan government made was a disastrous plan to shift the entire country to organic agriculture. In April of 2021 the government banned the import and use of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers. This devastated Sri Lankan agriculture, since, as it turns out, fertilizer is really really important. Production of tea — Sri Lanka’s main cash crop — fell by 18% in a year. Production of rice — the main food crop — fell by even more.From https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/05/sri-lanka-organic-farmi... :&gt; By 2020, the total cost of fertilizer imports and subsidies was close to $500 million each year. With fertilizer prices rising, the tab was likely to increase further in 2021. Banning synthetic fertilizers seemingly allowed Rajapaksa to kill two birds with one stone: improving the nation’s foreign exchange situation while also cutting a massive expenditure on subsidies from the pandemic-hit public budget.&gt; But when it comes to agricultural practices and yields, there is no free lunch. Agricultural inputs—chemicals, nutrients, land, labor, and irrigation—bear a critical relationship to agricultural output. From the moment the plan was announced, agronomists in Sri Lanka and around the world warned that agricultural yields would fall substantially. The government claimed it would increase the production of manure and other organic fertilizers in place of imported synthetic fertilizers. But there was no conceivable way the nation could produce enough fertilizer domestically to make up for the shortfall.You don&#39;t get anything &#34;for free&#34;, and cutting supports like this will inevitably doom a sputtering economy, when the actual solution was almost certainly more government spending, not less.The US is actually lucky to understand this at the deepest levels of policy and law making, with massive aid packages to prevent total collapse. Even Europe tried harsh austerity in the wake of 2008, and the fad lasted way too long there.The Sri Lankan leader&#39;s hostile attitude towards the Sri Lankan population is what made protesters storm the leader&#39;s home."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first part of the article about how Sri Lanka would get foreign currency 
(swap, export or borrow) almost completely ignores the well documented devastation of the tourist industry, where people bring euros or dollars, due to covid19 and shutdowns of travel.Yes I suppose it falls into the category of swap, because people bring euros and exchange them for local currency to buy local goods and services. But it was a big part of the &#34;swap&#34; that vanished for 2+ years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In 2005 my wife and I lived in a part of the USA that had no Costco within a half day&#39;s drive.  We soon secured jobs in a part of the USA that had two (two!) Costcos in the same city that we would live.  True story - before we even looked for housing, I went online and joined Costco.  Years later my diabetic cat even had a Costco pharmacy account (best place to buy insulin by far) and received a discount for being without health insurance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related to the story&#39;s underlying topic, as an immigrant I find significant attitudinal/philosophical differences in how I regard saving money and spending money versus, for example, my American coworkers and friends, especially younger ones who grew up around relatively well-off families.  Maybe the affection for Costco embodies that.   I&#39;m sure I sound like an old fart for saying this, like &#34;those younguns don&#39;t know the value of a dollar any more&#34;.By comparison at least, they are much freer with their money and don&#39;t have the same baggage about it.   An example especially apparent for me is their willingness to spend on clothing, where I just can&#39;t bring myself to do it.  Maybe just not having been brought up around parents who were ever dressed that nice, or allowed me and siblings to be.   Or for example, their lack of concern about overpaying for small things, which yes in the bigger picture, who cares if you&#39;re overcharged for a drink once in a while?I suppose it&#39;s because the information or concern about not having money was already passed down or imposed on me as a lesson early in life (whether intentionally or not).  Sometimes I view it as an advantage as I see that my friends (those spending freely) will encounter those lessons when they get married, have kids, etc. and need to save.   On the other hand, I wonder if I&#39;m just handicapping myself with that baggage and not allowing myself to enjoy the freedom that a good income now brings, and living too  much in the restraints of my family&#39;s past..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing that is missing from this simulation is that (at least some) ant species walk straight back to their nest once they found some food. They do this (as far as we know) by accumulating each step they take into what is called the &#34;home vector&#34;, effectively integrating the whole path they took. That way they always know which way is &#34;back to the nest&#34;. There is a vast amount of papers on the topic. Some (personal) highlights:If you put the ants on stilts they will follow the same home vector, but because each step on stilts is effectively longer they will overshoot the target: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Fig4-Odometry-by-stride-...If the ant is placed close to the nest after gathering food, it will still follow its home vector ... away from the nest: https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2004...Crazy little buggers these ants."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think I can count the number of kernel changes I&#39;ve submitted on one hand, but I work on core virtualization that involves a lot of pretending to be hardware and (these days) a lot of poking directly at hardware registers.I would say James Mickens sums things up nicely in &#34;The Night Watch[0].&#34; For example, you mention debugging with logs and metrics -- this snippet came to mind:     “Yeah, that sounds bad. Have you checked the log files for
     errors?” I said, “Indeed, I would do that if I hadn’t broken every
     component that a logging system needs to log data. I have a
     network file system, and I have broken the network, and I have
     broken the file system, and my machines crash when I make
     eye contact with them. I HAVE NO TOOLS BECAUSE I’VE
     DESTROYED MY TOOLS WITH MY TOOLS. My only logging
     option is to hire monks to transcribe the subjective experience
     of watching my machines die as I weep tears of blood.”

Mind you, I absolutely _love_ working on low-level stuff, and I wouldn&#39;t trade the time I get to spend actually doing that for anything. That said, the complexity of modern operating systems, CPU architectures, interconnects, and peripherals creates opportunities for frustration and confusion that honor no bounds of reasonability or decency.[0]: https://www.usenix.org/system/files/1311_05-08_mickens.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked in the kernel team many moons ago helping improve the performance and then built the .net clr later. Also worked on a NT Filesystem called Cairo. So I guess I have experienced both kernel dev and backend framework dev.Kernel code is amazing, especially the parts written by the early members like DaveC, MarkZ and others.For me the biggest part was working with a group of extremely smart people who were very nearly the best programmers in the world.I really miss that outside of Microsoft. I would imagine that you can get the same experience if you worked with the Linux kernel dev team or some of the other few places in the world like FAMGA where you can work.My suggestion is to go for it. 
After leaving MS I found peace by working with the open source community and open source software.Hope that helps, happy to discuss further."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bad stuff:1. There will be a lot of infrastructure complexity in the kernel, just prepare yourself for that. Even worse bugs! You&#39;ll be fixing a lot of bugs, or looking at a lot of bugs, and most of these bugs are from other teams who are interacting with your component! Just order a copy of Windows Internals and get yourself familiar with how thing work.2. Old ass engineering systems. Just as the interviewers said you will spend a lot of your time waiting for Windows builds.Good stuff:1. Work life balance is amazing actually. Most of the time there&#39;s very little pressure for you to get work done, as long as you&#39;re doing something no one really bothers you.2. Since you said you hate designing systems, good news, everything has been designed for you! Your, job will mostly be implementing new features for a component.3. Windbg is actually great and I will die on this hill. You might have to print some debug logs but you won&#39;t be looking at metrics because there&#39;s whole teams dedicated to doing that stuff. There&#39;s also tools which quickly spin up VMs for you to do some live kernel debugging.Meh stuff:1. The pay, could be better. That might change soon though."</p>

principle of &#34;ends&#34; [1]. A genuine random act of kindness cannot occur
if it&#39;s being filmed.  Filming the act turns it into a virtue

Truly I tell you, they already have their full reward. But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.&#34; Matthew 6"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Man, not putting Fully Qualified Domain Names in code has been such a recurring source of pain in my software life. You make so many assumptions about the way people parse domain names and all of them are wrong. Vendors do all kinds of things to &#34;simplify&#34; their workflows internally and sometimes they just parse URLs and domains in all kinds of ways that break your brain.Reminds me so much of the way &#34;smart&#34; telecom engineers bastardized SS7 to ship new features onto legacy telco infrastructure. SS7 is like 20M lines of C. You can&#39;t really change it without breaking it in many other places, AT&amp;T used to have a metric which was something like &#34;for every 10 lines of code you alter in SS7, you create 8 bugs in other parts of the code.&#34; So &#34;smart&#34; telecom engineers would take existing fields in the SS7 logic and use them for different functions inside of their telco. A billing field could instead be used as a feature flag for some sort of customer state, but only inside of the telco&#39;s network (and re-written back to the compliant SS7 standard when the data was headed out of the network). This was called encapsulation and wrapping and un-wrapping packets just in time was the source of many many problems in my telecom life.Just in time editing of network packets at the boundary is always fun. Most of the problems that would happen would come from forgetting to rewrite back to SS7 and transmitting the internal codes out."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thanks Justine, you&#39;re doing the Lord&#39;s work here.One of the best introductions I&#39;ve seen to pledge() is Kristaps Dzonson&#39;s writeup on it that you can find here [1]. The whole website in general is furthermore a guide on how to write webapps in C, which may sound like a crazy idea to some people who have written it off as everything from an elaborate joke to a security nightmare that nobody should ever consider doing [2], but for people like me who end up having to write that kind of code in constrained execution environments it&#39;s been extremely enlightening and I really appreciate knowing how to do it more securely. If pledge is something I can access in Linux it really helps me out for things in the future going forward, I hope to create some cool things with it![1] https://learnbchs.org/pledge.html[2] https://learnbchs.org/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh god yes please. If pledge() makes it into the mainline kernel, we OpenBSD-type people seem less weird when submitting patches for some syscall &#34;nobody uses&#34;.Many OpenBSD ports contain pledge() support. Steal all you can. OpenBSD does &#34;hoisting&#34; in many userland programs, meaning all the open calls and such take place at the very start but isn&#39;t actually parsed until after we have locked ourselves in with pledge() and unveil(). I hope this also means many non-base programs are redesigned in this manner."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi jart,I noticed that you&#39;re missing the sendfd promise. Is there a reason for that omission? Also you&#39;ve added a number of extensions that perhaps should be documented as such.Also there&#39;s a pretty significant undocumented difference between your implementation and OpenBSD, in that promises are by inherited across exec in yours, and not on OpenBSD.OpenBSD experimented with that by specifying the second argument as execpromises, but discovered that it was extremely difficult if not impossible to write meaningful execpromises in the parent for potentially unrelated programs, it&#39;s also happening too early before dynamic linking, and before the program has had an opportunity to &#34;initialize&#34; or &#34;do privileged stuff&#34; and call pledge(2) later itself with more accurate knowledge of what to self-restrict. As such, no calls with execpromises set to anything but NULL/0 exist today. I&#39;m curious how to reconcile those differences."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"About a decade ago, I briefly worked for a company with the same business model. Since most Windows installers require Administrator privileges, the DLLs that they side-load will inherit these elevated privileges and can scan the user&#39;s machine for anything they are interested in.The way this software worked (as far as I can recall): The installer bundled a DLL from which only a few minor functions were exposed to display offers within the host process. Usually, the only thing the client portion of this DLL needed was a HWND. During initialization, the DLL stored a copy of itself in the user&#39;s temp directory. The host application unknowingly then used rundll32 to load this copy as a separate (also elevated) process. This process would run at least as long as the calling process would. Once in place, the process would scan the user&#39;s computer for specific use patterns (geoinformation; MS Office presence; what language; etc.). In order to retrieve the latest advertising &#34;offers&#34;, the DLL called home with this information over a secure pipe and checked for updates. This data was stored and referenced if the same user invoked the DLL again at some point. Only at this point would any actual targeted ads be displayed in the client application&#39;s window.Things may have changed since then - these were the pre-Windows 10 days - but if it&#39;s anything like this, it&#39;s wise to avoid the Unity installer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a very nasty case of insomnia 7 years ago. Without going into details of my associated illness, I went 2-3 months with almost no sleep due to hypnic jerks/sleep starts. When I told people I couldn&#39;t sleep, they assumed I just had difficulty falling asleep, but I literally could not fall asleep. It is terrifying. For whatever reason, whenever I miss a significant amount of sleep (one or two nights) I get very bad sleep jerks to the point I would start to fall asleep 30+ times a night and then wake back up immediately. The only two ways past it I found was a benzo sleeping pill or alcohol and both were hit and miss (just to inhibit the jerks - I had no problem starting to actually fall asleep). Even then, my body seems to build up massive adrenaline after sleep deprivation, so I would wake up 1-2 hours later in a cold sweat and have to start all over. The more sleep I miss, the worse it gets, and after you miss several nights in a row you get VERY &#34;sleep anxious&#34;, and so the cycle continues. Once I&#39;m caught up, I&#39;m fine and the jerks disappear completely, but it takes a while. I just had another case of the jerks this year for the first time since then but I was able to get over it in about 3 weeks this time. Still, it freaked me out as I had considered myself past that and had gotten a little bit careless.The point of this long winded intro: Don&#39;t take sleep for granted. If you sleep well, cherish it. Ever since this time I keep immaculate sleep hygiene. I go to bed on time, at the same time, get daily sunlight, don&#39;t eat before bed, and 9/10 times I&#39;m asleep in minutes and sleep great. I still have occasional early wake insomnia, but for the most part sleep well.Occasionally I think about things like mentioned in this article and what the long term effects will be, but mostly I just don&#39;t worry about it. There isn&#39;t anything I can do about it at this point except try to sleep as best I can from this point forward."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like no one read the entire article, and it&#39;s partially the fault of traditional newspaper writing style for sticking the juiciest stuff up from, but the article concludes there&#39;s no consensus on what chronic sleep deprivation does to humans.&gt; Nevertheless, many scientists said that the new research should not be cause for panic. “It is possible that sleep deprivation damages rat and mouse brains, but that doesn’t mean that you should get stressed about not getting enough sleep,” said Jerome Siegel, a sleep scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who did not contribute to the review.&gt; Dr. Siegel noted that neural injury comes in degrees, and that the extent of sleep deprivation’s effect on the human brain is still largely unknown. He also expressed concern that undue worry about the long-term effects of sleep deprivation could lead people to try to sleep more, unnecessarily and with medication.The opinion of a single review paper on effects in mice is not conclusive science. So, in other words, there&#39;s no news here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"With 4.0 getting more and more advanced features [0] and Unity merging with an Ad company [1], Godot is looking like it could be an attractive proposition for a lot of Unity shops.[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32003065[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32081051"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As much as I&#39;d like to use Godot, there are two features missing that I really don&#39;t think I could do without:- Asset store. I totally get it, handling payments, curating, etc. are a huge task... but man, I&#39;m a coder, and I don&#39;t have the funds to pay an artist or a musician full time. Being able to just go buy a pack of trees for $20 or something is a huge timer saver.- Animation re-targeting. It seems like there&#39;s a 3rd party plugin for this but it also seems like it hasn&#39;t been updated in a year. In unity I can buy a big pack of animations for pretty cheap and reuse it on almost all my humanoid characters. That&#39;s huge. I think this can be done in Blender or Maya, but it&#39;s so seamless in the engine compared to using a 3rd party tool."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using Godot for hobby projects on-and-off for a while now, and overall I vastly prefer it to Unity. The scene hierarchy of Godot is a better mental model (for me) than the GameObject/MonoBehavior ever was.That said, I have a _few_ items that I think are absolute showstoppers for solo-dev side projects.1. The asset pipeline is simply not as clean as Unity&#39;s. The ability to drop a .blend file in the project in Unity is so underrated. In Godot FBX imports are unreliable, texture imports misbehave frequently, and rigging goes wrong even in the recommended file formats. There&#39;s a lot less clarity around the path to getting real assets in game, which can be a major pain point for solo devs.2. Along the same lines, there is no equivalent of Unity&#39;s mecanim. With Unity, if you can model and rig a character in Blender, you can pull free mocap or other animations from the asset store and get to work. In Godot you&#39;re still best off authoring your own animations for each character. This drastically increases the amount of time spent making assets.3. Godot is in a weird spot version wise for anyone who wants to use C#; the beta version of 4.0 is rapidly approaching, and guarantees to break any project you start in 3.x --- but 4.0 still doesn&#39;t come built with C# support. Hopefully this gets resolved soon."</p>

I recommend a popover on hover to explain what this means. You probably thought about a log of different icons but might be worth polling for a few or letting the user pick one of a few a preference (At first I thought it &#34;wasn&#39;t working&#34;)* It would be nice to be able to add meta to the session, i.e. &#34;1:1 with joseph&#34; that automatically gets timestamped for start and end. Then be able to show the graphs from a day of meetings stacked.* Analysis would be good. Being able to say how many others are in the meeting so it makes more sense when there are longer gaps.* Someone mentioned additional recommendations, that would be awesome if it had a guidance mode where I could fit a template over this thing and have it help keep the meeting on track. 5 mins introductions / waiting for quorum, 5 mins agenda, 10 mins topic 1 etc.I realize the idea for this is to be a simple private app and its great at that. If necessary, I&#39;d suggest offering something more complex that might require greater buy in privacy wise so it can do more.I&#39;d still recommend requiring zero network requests as you&#39;ve done on this version, even though the analytics might be useful.I use an network filter and manually allow connections from apps.Starting with this high level of privacy is how you get someone like me to be comfortable allowing your app to run on my machine."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; “If there is the infrastructure, if there is the channel by which police can request footage without a warrant or consent of the user, under what circumstances they get it is out of our control. I worry that because it’s decided by the police and by somebody at Ring, there will be temptation to use that for increasingly less urgent situations.”Many people (I would argue anybody with common sense) predicted Ring would get used as a surveillance tool. This quote correctly states the nearly-inevitable next step, which will also be ignored."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO the primary utility of Ring is for Amazon to surveil their delivery contractors, without a doorbell cam it’s trivial for a delivery person to set the package on the porch, photograph it as “proof of delivery”, and then walk away with said package.So the deterrent effect is good for the consumer in that it prevents theft, and good for Amazon because they can contract out to just about anyone to deliver packages, no trust required (or, “trust but verify”)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My next door neighbor (we share a wall) had their bicycles stolen twice, so they installed Ring (floodlight) cameras in both the backyard and the front porch. After a year, the cameras have yielded no added security, or caught any &#34;bad guys&#34; as far as I can tell and from what they told me.What I realized, is they use it to keep track of their kids, funny cat videos that trigger the recording, and most importantly, as a 2 way radio to talk or listen to the kids. That last point, well, I found out they can also listen to my conversations an my kids.I asked them to point their front porch camera so that it doesn&#39;t record my front driveway, just theirs. and they lost their shit. They confirmed they record audio and video. They asked if there was a problem. I said no problem with them. I&#39;m not comfortable with the audio/video recording me or my friends conversations if company comes over to talk to me on my porch or driveway.I really didn&#39;t need to tell them anything, it&#39;s self evident why someone wants a camera point away. Needless to say, after I asked them in the winter, one of them refuses to speak to me and crosses the street and avoids me.These people use surveillance to supervise their kids, and don&#39;t care about the fact that their neighbors (me) could be recorded, and they could be hacked or footage access by random people, because Amazon isn&#39;t exactly the king of privacy.I believe these cameras haven&#39;t decreased crime. They also don&#39;t really add more security. It&#39;s a shame though they are everywhere, with disregard for privacy right on people&#39;s property. So yes, I&#39;m biased. I have no love for Ring."</p>

I think this is coming to an end. Corporate boards and officers no longer represent the best long-term interests of the companies and shareholders they represent. It’s also a very precarious legal status as an arbitrary judicial ruling can make or break a company. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the corporate bubble is based on arbitrary tax codes that both advantage corporations and push worker savings into the stock market.Even if these conditions continue unabated, the cash flows from working class into the stock market will eventually hit equilibrium with capital extraction from the owner class. If the extractions return to the same markets, then things stay in equilibrium. They won’t, however, because the tax advantaged assets are different for them. They may seek hyper-volatility, or government bond shelters, but will generally avoid the assets on the working class tax treadmill.There are fundamentals to financial assets that have nothing to do with “number go up”, and these will ultimately dictate reality, with the caveat that “the markets will remain irrational longer than you will remain solvent”.  Rationals get wrecked too, except every once in a while when one gets lucky on their timing and makes so much money that they become a hero and we make movies about them. We cheer because it gives us hope that our intuition will serve us too. Unlikely.This is all to say that such charts are using an inductive hypothesis to predict an inherently anti-inductive phenomenon. People tithe and sacrifice to their church for a promise of rewards in the afterlife. The stonk religion is the same; well worth the price for your peace of mind. True or not, you’d be a mess without it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having all lines normalized so they start from a common point at x = 0 would be helpful. That would allow reading the total returns as percentage of the initial (1987) investment and compare them.Similarly in the drawdown chart, if it starts at 1987, it makes no sense to start the dollar at -81%. If I am looking at a chart from 1987 to 2022, I want to see how the dollar did compared to other assets in that time period."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If the goal is to demonstrate relative performance over time, wouldn&#39;t it be useful to use a normalization such that all lines either start at the same point (e.g. simulating investing X amount) or ending at the same point (showing requirement to get to X final amount)?"</p>

Only Slack and Teams (in browser) seem to have incapable development teams behind them, who are comfortable with gaslighting unsuspecting users into using Chromium-based browsers, furthering web mono-culture.There are so many issues with Teams, that I am wondering, what they are even working on. Surely they cannot be bugfixing all day, if so many bugs remain after years. We&#39;ve had 2-3 years of pandemic now. What the heck are they doing!? They could have made the business.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Depending on if you count it as a serious programming language, Racket has pretty much all the contract stuff. It has dedicated syntax for contracts, tight integration with the module system, and contract-random-generate attempts to generate a value satisfying a contract so writing an auto fuzzer wouldn&#39;t be too hard. In fact, I think Racket&#39;s system predates Clojure since there was the 2002 paper &#34;Contracts for Higher-Order Functions&#34; discussing it and Clojure first appeared in 2007.The only reason I would ever use Clojure instead of Racket would be if I needed to work with the JVM ecosystem or the browser via Clojurescript (which are compelling reasons).Totally agree about a good calculator language."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sounds like the same anti competitive behavior that MS was punished for two decades ago. Making it a requirement to only boot software approved by them excludes a whole range of competitors from using the same hardware. Making that a condition for OEMs to even get a license is the problem here.Lenovo is otherwise known for supporting Linux on their laptops. And yes I know you can jump through hoops and fiddle with scary (for ordinary users) bios options to &#34;fix&#34; this. The point is that you shouldn&#39;t have to and this is a bit too convenient for MS to keep competitors off laptops.Basically, what is needed here is a neutral certificate authority not controlled by a single company with a reasonable process for independent operating systems to get a certificate.I recently ran into this trying to boot linux on my old imac. Ubuntu actually works but forget about arch, manjaro, and a whole lot of other distributions. Imacs have no off-switch for secure boot that I know off."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"HP should open OS/8 and RT-11, the two big influences on CP/M.  OS/8 is kind of remarkable, running on a system arguably less powerful than the first 8-bit home computers (I would say they are closer to PIC microcontrollers, but with more RAM):https://www.pdp8online.com/os/os8/index.shtmlPDP-8 memory is heavily paged.  There are 128 word pages- direct addresses can only reach within the current page, and literals (immediate data including addresses to other pages) have to be allocated out of this current page along with the instructions.  Second, there are 4K-word fields.  So you need to use far jumps and returns to access outside the current field.  This is just like PIC microcontroller pages.OS/8 reserved only two pages for itself.  Things like the command interpreter were swapped out to disk or DECTape.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DECtapeIf the application needed device drivers, it got to choose which pages the drivers would occupy- meaning the device drivers had to be written as position independent code.  Also I think each driver was limited to two pages.."</p>

There was an easter egg that made it say Microsoft or wasn&#39;t it spelled MicroSoft? Either way a company nobody had ever heard of.CP/M had the aura of being something for real pros. Read some journal articles and it looked really complicated. But without suitable hardware I had never any chance to touch it.In 1983 I went to university where beginner courses happened on VAX/VMS and my definition of &#34;pro&#34; got shifted."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For the professional (or former professional) astronomers among us, I will make my somewhat amused observation that what people are most paying attention to is not really the distinguishing features of JWST.People seem most impressed by the apparent increase in resolution of the images, which is not from a certain point of view the hardest thing to do .  HST might have done that if its instruments had been of different pixel size or imaging array size / focal length.   Ok, the much larger mirror is an achievement.   But anyway, the resolution of the images is often not what really is the limiting factor for photometric observations.  Yes it is sharper/higher resolution, but that wasn&#39;t the key selling point.The new thing is observations in the IR, which is somewhat a technical footnote in many gushing announcements of these images (or some discussion here too).   And the general public knows little about that detail&#39;s importance, especially since the images are stylized / colored anyway to look just like RGB images that we are so familiar with.   But everyone can easily appreciate a sharper image.Anyway, still a momentous achievement.  And thank god we have a scientific field where stunning images was enough to get the public to support a $10B project.**Edit to add: I did not mean to detract from or diminish anyone&#39;s appreciation of the images and accomplishment at whatever level they are enjoyed.   And of course many here are technically knowledgeable about the IR aspect.   I just write to point out that for the most headline-grabbing images and newspaper writers, the sharpness of the images over the actual IR frontier is what grabs the attention."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s a backyard telescope versus Webb: https://twitter.com/AJamesMcCarthy/status/154694183270093209...More comparisons on Twitter, some zoomed in:- https://twitter.com/Batsuto_/status/1546899241880240128- https://twitter.com/Batsuto_/status/1546900387931766784- https://twitter.com/JBWillcox/status/1546881033597075457- https://twitter.com/jason4short/status/1546626672488632321I&#39;m not a physicist, so I&#39;ve only recently learned about redshift. Hubble&#39;s deep field images were very dark red/orange because further objects appear redder (into infrared) before they disappear to the observer. Webb&#39;s sensors are more red/infrared-sensitive than Hubble&#39;s, so along with extremely fine, super-cooled optics using exotic materials to align and capture every single photon, its red sensitivity allows Webb to peer deeper, further, and dimmer than we&#39;ve ever been able to before.And I&#39;ve read that the &#34;spikes&#34; coming off the brighter stars are generally from stars in our own galaxy and they&#39;re not lens flares. They&#39;re caused by the edges of the telescope. Hubble&#39;s stars would have 4 spikes in a cross; Webb has 6 in a snowflake because of the shape of Webb&#39;s mirrors having 6 sides. Or something like that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Question for anyone who happens to be an expert: Is there any way to quantify how much better Webb is independently of the amount of time used to take the exposures? Like, could Hubble achieve the same quality of images as Webb if it was given 100x (or whatever) more time exposure?I&#39;m trying to understand how much the improvement is &#34;speed of convergence&#34; vs. &#34;quality of asymptotic result&#34;.

Hubble took many exposures over weeks, which normally would allow for reliable reduction of noise, webb took some shots over the course of hours and there’s hardly any noise to see.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Meta - I am honestly surprised, and sightly appalled at the general attitude in these comments (and also in yesterday&#39;s thread).Uber has essentially not just broken laws, but outright exploited workers/drivers... and people comment &#34;Aah but the local taxi mafia was bad&#34;...??!? I&#39;m sorry but that does not justify exploiting workers. That does not justify using political influence to enter/gain markets. This isn&#39;t some messiah coming to save us all from the &#34;horridness of local transport&#34;.I&#39;m not saying that having Uber as a player is necessarily bad, mind you. But it&#39;s possible to have some positive benefits for some people while hurting a lot of others. I sincerely doubt too many HN users have driven taxis, but my conversations with Uber/regular taxi drivers hardly painted a favorable picture of Uber. (Nuance - please note that my taxi drivers doesn&#39;t represent all drivers. There will be happy and sad drivers, my point being it&#39;s not always sunshine and rainbows... which the article speaks about too.)I wonder if this being a YC owned communication platform affects/biases users (some of whom I&#39;m sure are YC founders etc themselves), however the ratio of apathy/&#34;taxis were already bad&#34; to &#34;Uber shouldn&#39;t exploit workers, nothing justifies it&#34; is disappointingly low.(I know this is a particularly ranty comment and I had kept quiet on the last thread but seeing the same type of comments here pushed me.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My personnal experience.
I come back from a trip in romania - bucharest.
At first I didn&#39;t take Uber but tried for the regular Taxi from the airport.
All of them requesting ~40USD.
At the end I go with one who put the meter and indeed arrived to 200 Lei (~40 USD). I payed in euro because I didn&#39;t have enough local currency, hopefully I had some and the driver accept.Taking some information it&#39;s way too much, but would I have argue with how the meter was operating anyway?Now, I need to comeback to the airport at 4am.So instead, I reserve a airport transfer from the airline itself, pay in advance something like 30 USD this time.And... no one show up at 4am. Mobile phone of the transfer is not answering... I never heard of them *So I install Uber, hopefully it&#39;s working, enter my visa (from my country, no need for local currency at all), after 10 minutes, someone very nice take me and I just paid like 15 USD to get to the airport, at 5 in the morning, with the invoice by mail.How do you compete with that? Taxi business need to reflect. And every country is the same strangely, it&#39;s as universal than taxes: you can&#39;t escape!* Edit: In fact I know what happened, and there is nothing to do, because I looked at the invoice and on the third page of the voucher PDF there, it&#39;s said that I needed to call 24h before to confirm the transfer... They don&#39;t call, you have to call. Even after the first confirmation I already did for confirming the pickup address some days before, I wasn&#39;t feeling paranoid enough. So you can&#39;t say nothing because I didn&#39;t read the last page, but it&#39;s a dumb heavy process, do people changes their mind and decide to live forever in the country frequently?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Shocking stuff like this, weaponising drivers against city governments to do Uber&#39;s bidding to lobby:&gt; MacGann insists that Uber drivers were seen by some at the company as pawns who could be used to put pressure on governments. “And if that meant Uber drivers going on strike, Uber drivers doing a demo in the streets, Uber drivers blocking Barcelona, blocking Berlin, blocking Paris, then that was the way to go,” he said. “In a sense, it was considered beneficial to weaponise Uber drivers in this way.”&gt; The files show MacGann’s fingerprints on this strategy, too. In one email, he praised staffers in Amsterdam who leaked stories to the press about attacks on drivers to “keep the violence narrative” and pressure the Dutch government.Uber was weaponising their workers (while fighting as hard as possible to not call them workers and pay for workers&#39; benefits) against local governments, they were behaving like a tech-mafia, a mob with sprawling power across the globe.What the actual fuck?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the interesting aspects of giving a shit is that it will lead sometimes to you doing things which are not in your short-term selfish narrowly-defined &#34;best interest&#34; but because you give a shit you&#39;ll do it anyway.  Some of these lead to long-term value that is very significant but you can&#39;t know at the time.I was once asked by a client (bank) to take a call with one of _their_ clients (a pretty important hedge fund). I did this as a courtesy even though I thought our product wasn&#39;t appropriate for the hedge fund.  Anyhow I get on the call and it&#39;s the COO, the Chief Investment Officer, the CTO and a couple of other _very_ important people at this big fund. (ie a much more senior call than I really expected).  Anyway, because I give a shit, I told them our product wouldn&#39;t really be right for them and explained why.  They thanked me and I heard nothing more of it.Until a couple of years later where I offered a job out of the blue because one of the people on the call had been impressed by how I had dealt with it, and by pure coincidence his partner was a recruiter who was tasked with headhunting for a CTO role and he said &#34;hey you should check this guy out&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everyone saying it doesn&#39;t scale is missing the point.Scaling is a winner-take-all, venture capital mindset. The article is about service businesses, which do not need to hit web scale! We are talking about services here not your web startup.Even beyond services, giving a shit and building saas is not impossible. In fact, I wish more tech companies started small and stayed small. I absolutely want to run a digital small business and I want to give a shit, it makes the building feel purposeful instead of this product-led growth at all costs bullshit.I hope we see a software middle class grow in the next decade. Middle class tech companies are going to be coming from the bootstrapper + founder focused funds (TinySeed / Calm) and they are going to have a distinct advantage if they understand their strategy/context in their chosen verticals."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Are you saying I can outsource my shit-giving activities?Sign me up. I&#39;ve been unable to give a shit for quite some time. I wish I could give a shit, but the world has become a pretty ugly place, in large part because of deliberate attempts to demoralize those who give a shit.You see it all over the place on social media. People do a weak-ass form of shit-giving in the form of &#34;raising awareness&#34;, the least conceivable level of effort for something you wish you could give a shit about, but don&#39;t actually give a shit.Of course even if somebody tried to GaSaaS, the space would promptly fill with people giving as few shits as possible for as much money as possible. Too many major charities do that: they&#39;ll take your money and spend it mostly on advertising for other people to give their money, too, and very little on the things you&#39;d expect if they actually gave a shit.I know TFA is more about the business sense of giving a shit, but I&#39;d love to see somebody able to give a shit in a larger sense. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t give a shit because it seems nobody gives a shit any more -- except the people who are passionately devoted to making sure other people feel miserable instead."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sorry if I miss something obvious, but how is this not solvable by the compiler?I&#39;m a huge functional programming evangelist, but high-level stuff like this does not belong in a low level language bytecode like WASM.Wasm should only care about two things: Security and Performance.With the standard blowing up like crazy we&#39;ll get neither. Worse, we&#39;ll cemenent the current duopoly of browser engines, because we&#39;ll make it (again) so complex that no-one can create an alternative.We shouldn&#39;t have GC, Exceptions or Tail calls in WASM, as long as the compiler can provide them.What we should have is multi memory support and memory read permissions, because without them WASM lacks basic security primitives.[1]Reference types maybe.

They all — all, 100% — interrupted my attempt to give them some money.&#34;This is a good touchstone to use for &#34;you&#39;ve overoptimized your site, tone it back&#34;. I am also taken aback every time I&#39;m on a site, I&#39;ve got something in my shopping cart, I&#39;m headed for the &#34;check out&#34; button, or I&#39;m even on the checkout page, and some stupid interstitial pops up. Dude, I&#39;m trying to enter my credit card information! Back off! Especially stupid for a &#34;sign up for our newsletter&#34; popup; we all know that unclicking the &#34;yes, we can email you every 17 seconds from now until the heat death of the universe with valuable offers from &#39;our affiliates&#39; which we define as &#39;anyone we share a species with&#39;!&#34; box on the checkout form is mandatory, and if we don&#39;t see it immediately we&#39;d best go hunting for it. You&#39;ve already default populating the checkbox to &#34;yes&#34; on this very screen, get out of the way!Less unbelievably stupid, but related, is when I&#39;m examining product X and just after I scroll down a bit to read more you pop up something related to... well... anything other than product X! I&#39;m signalling interest in product X as hard as I can, and you&#39;ve AB tested that this is a great time to jangle your keys over there instead? Your AB testing is stupid and can&#39;t possibly fail to be some stupid statistical fluke or other terrible error. What fisherman goes out on his boat, hooks a fish, and then rushes to throw another completely different lure out to the hooked fish and get them on that hook instead?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve talked about this on HN but I&#39;ll say it again.A couple years ago, after being an Android fan for the better part of a decade, I finally bought myself an iPhone and pried myself away from Google&#39;s ecosystem wherever I could. And Apple didn&#39;t even need to do any work for me to make this decision. It was the years of abuse from Google that you experience when you decide to use a Google product or service. And a big part of that was the constant A/B/C/D/E/F testing. I never felt like I was using a complete product, everything felt like a constant beta that could be changed or rearranged at any point, and I was just doing free testing work for them while they harvest all my data.Every app update was a risk of the app rearranging itself, or features appearing/disappearing. Eventually it didn&#39;t even come from app updates in the Play Store, and new interfaces would just appear one day when a server somewhere marked your account as being in the group that gets the new UI. This app that you were familiar with could at any point be rearranged when you open it on any given day. Then maybe a week later you open it and it&#39;s back to how it was before. A button you thought was here suddenly isn&#39;t, and you question whether something actually changed or if you&#39;re losing your mind. It&#39;s a subtle gaslighting that eventually I couldn&#39;t stand any more.To me, A/B testing means you don&#39;t respect your users. You see them as just one factor in your money machine that can be poked and prodded to optimize how much money you can squeeze out of them. That&#39;s not to say a company like Apple is creating products out of the goodness of their heart, but at least it feels like it was developed by humans who made an opinionated call as to what they thought was the right design decision, and what they would want to use. And in my 2 years of owning an iPhone, I&#39;ve never opened my reminders app to find out that it&#39;s completely unrecognizable, or my messages app has been renamed or rethemed for the umpteenth time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with AB testing is that it&#39;s a short-term strategy. For example, if a news site runs AB testing with headlines, they&#39;ll find that bullshit clickbait headlines get more pageviews than concise, accurate headlines, but the constant use of clickbait headlines will over time destroy overall traffic to your site. More frustratingly, sites run by smart people tend to fall into a balance where the worst articles get the most alluring headlines."</p>

When I read this story I basically thought &#34;ok, but you&#39;re going to spend a load of money pumping but there&#39;s no way there&#39;s liquidity for you to actually perform your dump&#34;. But if you look up DOCK today you&#39;ll see its market cap is $14m and it&#39;s daily traded volume is $1.5m. I would get it that you could move some of these coins using a few bill boards and some sponsored ad reads if they were tiny volume traded, but the implication of this is that millions of dollars are moving back and forth every day on a coin that has absolutely nothing going for it. Who is doing that? There can&#39;t possibly be retail moving in and out of this stuff. Really I kind of assume this all has to be wash trading right?"</p>

By sweeping through very small and very large zoom levels, you can make peoples&#39; fingers trace out a diagonal line from top-left to bottom-right as the registered point moves with the underlying voronoi canvas as it scales up and down.Side note: how hard would it be to reduce the time delay between identifying a point and displaying an image?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is not a historic low, but a definitive low. There are several reasons for this.- in time of a crisis, the world seems to ralley around the dollar, as it is backed by the strongest economy and the strongest military.- this crisis has hit Europe hard, as it is not only close to the war, but of course, too dependant on Russian oil and especially gas.- there was a lot of inflation internationally, the US federal bank was the first to raise interest to combat inflation. The EU lags behind and is limited in action due to the fear of destabilizing some of its member countries with too high of a debt.Consequently, there is a lot of good reason for the Euro to be weak at these times. However, if the energy crisis can be solved and the war contained, a weak Euro also is also pushing exports from the EU. So there is a lot of reason for this trend to be stopped, if not reversed, until the other extreme is reached again."</p>
