								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Teams doesn&#39;t have to be good to succeed. It just has to exist. It&#39;s not even very important how good it is. Given it exists, IT will make everyone use it on Microsoft&#39;s behalf regardless of how bad it is.Or another way to look at it is that the real customers for Teams are IT departments. It makes their lives easier because they don&#39;t have to do anything and it meets all the compliance requirements they are supposed to enforce.Which in turn reflects that the real customers of IT are regulators and auditors. Nobody with decision making power actually cares whether any of the software in use in enterprises works well or not."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My 2 cents of venting on this sorry excuse of software- Backtick formatting in a chat post only works after typing the closing backtick, deleting it, re-typing it- Text copied from a conversation is polluted with names and time stamps. &#34;I really want this feature&#34; said nobody ever- The mute/unmute button is hard to find, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever attended a Teams meeting without someone struggling with this. Teams should change its name to &#34;You&#39;re on mute&#34;- Multiple windows, I never know which is the &#39;main&#39; window, which is the meeting window, where are they, which has focus- Too hard to know which chat you&#39;re replying to, who is in it- Updates in chats are not consistently acknowledged, you have to change focus, and back again. Even then the &#34;Activity&#34; tab still shows unread items that I have read- Random crashing- Random communication freezes, everyone else is chatting, I don&#39;t see any updates nor notification of any problems until I restart the app- &#34;Reply&#34; is sometimes in the chat context menu, sometimes not.- Media handling is inconsistent, sometimes I can&#39;t paste photos, sometimes I can- The size of the text chat column in a meeting cannot be changed and is very narrow, forcing you to find the same chat in the &#39;main&#39; window"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Long ago Microsoft had MSN Messenger, which was one of the leading messaging apps. It worked well, and many &#39;normal&#39; users were using it. Then Microsoft dissolved the team behind it and screwed up the product so bad with bloatware and ads that everyone moved to WhatsApp (except in the US where people went back to texting).Then Microsoft came out with Communicator, renamed it to Lync, which was a corporate messenger/meeting software. It used its own server, that could federate outside. It worked very well. They added LiveMeeting as a separate app for meetings, built on the same protocols. Our company used it with the &#34;roundtable&#34; camera from 2008, and it all worked amazingly well. We had meetings with people joining in from home and other offices over the internet using inexpensive webcams, 15 years ago.Then they bought Skype and it went downhill from there. I don&#39;t know what happened, but they took a lot of time integrating technologies from Skype (peer-to-peer) with their own tech (which was more telecom/server based) and tried competing with ever-changing perceived competitors by copying parts of their features and UI, without ever making any feature really good. They integrated everything into a single program, Skype for Business, now renamed Teams, and made it bloated and obnoxious. Just try to get it to not start at login... It&#39;s like MSN all over again.I think the Communicator/LiveMeeting software combo they had 15 years ago would still (conceptually) do pretty well as messenger/meeting software now, when modernized. It was much less intrusive and behaved like nice software that you actually wanted to use."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A summary of the original findings by the European Commission (1):&#34;By decision of 18 July 2018, the Commission fined Google for having abused its dominant position by imposing anticompetitive contractual restrictions on manufacturers of mobile devices and on mobile network operators, in some cases since 1 January 2011. Three types of restriction were identified:1. those contained in ‘distribution agreements’, requiring manufacturers of mobile devices to pre-install the general search (Google Search) and (Chrome) browser apps in order to be able to obtain a licence from Google to use its app store (Play Store);2. those contained in ‘anti-fragmentation agreements’, under which the operating licences necessary for the pre-installation of the Google Search and Play Store apps could be obtained by mobile device manufacturers only if they undertook not to sell devices running versions of the Android operating system not approved by Google;3. those contained in ‘revenue share agreements’, under which the grant of a share of Google’s advertising revenue to the manufacturers of mobile devices and the mobile network operators concerned was subject to their undertaking not to pre-install a competing general search service on a predefined portfolio of devices.&#34;1: https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/p1_3862705/en/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cool. The EU does have its [many!] faults. But they have a pretty good track record when it comes to consumer rights and consumer choice. Next up I&#39;d like to see them do the same for the plethora of incompatible cordless power-tool systems out there as they did with insisting all mobile phones standardise on a USB connector."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The fallout from this should be interesting. This fine is a substantial part (roughly 25%!) of Google&#39;s overall revenue from the EMEA region (Europe, Middle East, Africa), of which the EU is probably like 90%, at least, of the total, so it&#39;s probably toing the line of actually making the EU unprofitable to Google considering the costs of future compliance to avoid being fined again. Worse: this was not as steep as the fine could have been, they could&#39;ve fined them about double this amount under current regulations, but chose not to. Probably because that would have pushed Google&#39;s EU operations into the red for sure and made the decision easy for them.To be sure the company won&#39;t be in trouble financially, their global revenue can cover the fine, but that doesn&#39;t stop the EU from potentially being a net loss for the company going forward. Abandoning the EU would be a drastic step, though. It&#39;s going to be interesting to see how they adapt to this. Another fine on this scale and I think they will pull out."</p>

Seems like we&#39;ve been building toward this, the interactivity of the internet was the paradigm shift (to use a 90&#39;s term). EDIT: I realize it isn&#39;t news messing with youths&#39; self-esteem (well, in some cases it is), but it is related in that the media is custom-made to drive engagement at all costs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As with all studies in the social sciences, one of two principles apply.First, if the conclusions are counterintuitive or unexpected, then when you look closer, you will find that the methodology is garbage and that it does not support the conclusions given.Second, if the conclusions reflect things that you believe are true, when you look closer, you will find that the methodology is garbage and that it does not support the conclusions given."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I took a long break (maybe 5 years or so) but I have recently started using both FB and Instagram and have been surprised at how positive my time has been on these platforms. On FB I have been finding interesting local groups and events (just moved to a new city) and on Instagram, I have been enjoying seeing updates from real friends.On the other hand I recently deleted Twitter from my phone. I love twitter for getting interesting infromation and staying up to date with news, but the whole culture there has just turned into cheap dunking on one another, and its just guaranteed to leave you feeling angry about something. Extremely disruptive to mental state.I spend some time on the TikTok-like products as well (youtube shorts / fb reels) and have found them to be just a really easy way to completely waste an hour for no reason whatsoever. Less disruptive to mental state than twitter though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I hate all these click-bait articles. Losing weight is simple, it&#39;s just CICO. Calories In, Crust of the earth OutEdit: I feel like a lot of people are arguing about something that should be considered totally uncontroversial, basic physics. Before you get all worked up over this, please look up Yuri Gagarin. His weight loss journey absolutely proved that it is possible to lose 100% of your body weight through simple orbital mechanics and hundreds of people have followed in his footsteps and experienced similar results. There is not room for debate, this is a proven weight loss method and what the I&#39;m suggesting is essentially a very similar thing, but one that could help a lot more people at once."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kind of a meta comment, it&#39;s always interesting to see / hear that when a somewhat well-known author writes a new book, you see interviews with them cropping up on &#34;all the usual&#34; places, other outlets write about it etc.It&#39;s nice with something like &#34;What if? 2&#34;, because Randall is an interesting podcast guest, and there are just so many different things to talk about.It&#39;s a bit more annoying in other cases, where within two month you hear the same author on 5 different podcasts, and the author says the same thing on each of them. Time to use the skip button.I guess that&#39;s simply how it works nowadays in publishing: writing the book is work, but then you also need to spend quite some time promoting it, in the hopes not only that it boosts sales, but also that the boosted sales put the book in some bestseller lists, boosting sales even further."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So I wondered if I could lose some weight if I teleported on top of Everest and started searching for formulas. Apparently, this question is already answered and the answer is yes - I could lose half a pound.https://www.quora.com/On-top-of-Mount-Everest-is-the-force-o...So yeah, if you have resources to shave off that much of Earth surface, then you have resources to construct a high enough building to lose those 10 pounds which would have been a lot easier."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is amazing. It&#39;s truly bizarre that 5.1 surround sound, or HDR, or spatial audio, would be proprietary paid formats -- I mean, what if someone told you there was a license for stereo audio?And sure it&#39;s in Google&#39;s self-interest so that they can bring these technologies to YouTube without paying anyone else. But it benefits everybody, so this is really fantastic news for everyone if it&#39;s something that takes off."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We are seeing a deeper and deeper split between Google (webm/VP9, webp, AV1, strongly pushing their formats) and Apple (HEVC, HEIC, Atmos, completely boycotting Google&#39;s formats), with Microsoft caught in the middle, supporting neither that well.Apple&#39;s stance is especially interesting because it&#39;s unclear to me what they gain by pushing license fee encumbered formats."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is already an open media format (edit: for object-based immersive audio), it&#39;s called SMPTE 2098. Granted it&#39;s basically the mutant stepchild of DTS and Dolby ATMOS, but it does exist.The real problem isn&#39;t the hardware manufacturers but the content producers. Dolby engages in blatant anticompetitive behavior that basically requires hardware manufacturers to support their codecs and make it impossible to innovate on the actual media formats in a way that might compete. For example: paying for content to be released in atmos or giving away the tools to author it for free."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It was deeply disturbing to me that throughout the COVID epidemic many highly credentialed doctors and researchers were getting de-platformed for anything that remotely questioned the government&#39;s position on anything related to COVID.Science is about asking questions, testing hypotheses and independent research corroboration.  There have to be checks and balances.I expect the chilling effect from this experience will remain in the scientific community for a long time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me the core of this issue is that sometimes government officials truly believe their missions are more important than free speech. They may think that their job is actually to suppress free speech unfortunately.Especially common is for national security to override free speech in the minds of government officials. They can easily convince themselves that they need to suppress certain viewpoints in order to save many lives. It just coincidentally also saves their own jobs.I think unfortunately that young people would prefer less free speech and for the government to enforce more confirming perspectives.One other core issue for people who want the tech companies to stop listening to government to consider is the fact that the government has police, guns, prisons, and legal sanctions available to enforce it&#39;s policy decisions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The central issue in these cases are the difference between the following two scenarios:1. The CDC or other government agency says &#34;We believe X is misinformation, do with that advice what you will&#34;.2. The CDC or other government agency says &#34;We believe X is misinformation, and if you don&#39;t act on that, we will penalize you in some way&#34;.The former is perfectly legitimate, and exactly what e.g. public health agencies ought to be doing: offering opinions and advice to the private sector and public. The latter is a first amendment violation.Presumably, some of these cases will also turn on whether there was an implicit regulatory threat in the &#34;recommendations&#34; given. In some cases, according to this article, the threats seem to have been fairly explicit."</p>

I&#39;ve heard from friends that work at these companies that recent hiring freezes have actually made managers more hesitant to fire low performers because anyone they fire can&#39;t be replaced and they&#39;d rather have a low performer than no one at all. The team dissolving process seems to sidestep this management hesitation to fire."</p>

Both look pretty strong, so I am not sure how cuts are justified or why Zuckerberg has a negative outlook, especially since 2021 was such a great year for both.Do American executives, investors, and start up owners not have the guts for even a moderate stock price drop? I guess the reaction is to cut staff, or threaten to, when there is a whiff of negativity. Fuckin weak."</p>

Although there exists some off the shelf underwater lidar solutions https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YevvMcc6Zu4 and underwater drones, it&#39;s likely to be too turbulent (and with air bubble) for them to stay in place at a known position to work properly out of the box (but maybe not because it seems to be possible to scuba dive the strid https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUamSryCUK4)."</p>
