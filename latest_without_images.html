								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very typical of Apple, using opaque approval procedures. They&#39;re acting like bullies because they didn&#39;t get what they wanted and because they have the money/power to do so. Apple wanted to buy FlickType but they didn&#39;t agree on the price or Eleftheriou didn&#39;t want to sell (I doubt it), and so from then onwards started the downhill ride. I fully support Eleftheriou on this just for the principle, but if I were in his place I would have agreed at a very large sum from Apple (even lower from what I had in mind) just so that we could all be happy right now ;-)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Meh. The problem is FlickType requires network access during use. The App store licensing is ok with keyboards, it&#39;s not ok with keyboards that get network access. This, Apple perceives as a major privacy issue-- one for the possibility of keylogging, but also for the broader possibility of the always-on logging that the weather apps are infamous for.edit:

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is an incredibly well produced podcast episode on these ex-NSA engineers working for the UAE that came out a couple of years ago. Check out Darknet Diaries Ep47: Project Raven [1].Synopsis is that the UAE hires ex-NSA employees as &#34;penetration testers&#34; and when they enter the country for cybersecurity work, some are pulled aside to be briefed to an opportunity called &#34;Project Raven&#34; to assist Emirati intelligence with targeting, allegedly in the interest of counter-terrorism. The thing is, only Emiratis have &#34;hands on keyboard&#34; while the US engineers sit beside them and guide them, which supposedly dodges any legal concerns. Those who Jack interviewed decided to leave Project Raven when it became clear they were targeting dissidents, human rights activists, and later, Americans. As you might imagine, ex-NSA employees who target US citizens for a foreign government are breaking the law. I do wonder if it&#39;s these ex-Project Raven engineers that have led prosecutors down the road to where we are now.[1] https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/47/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Co-founder here. It feels incredible to be sharing Replay with all of you. It&#39;s been a labor of love the past five years!Replay started off as a simple experiment in what would happen if we added a step back button and rewind button to the Debugger. We quickly realized two things. First, nobody uses breakpoints. Second, being able to share is so much more powerful than being able to rewind.Here’s how Replay works today. Somebody on the team records a bug with the Replay Browser and shares the replay url with the team. From there, developers jump in and add print statements. The logs appear in the Console immediately so you don’t need to refresh and reproduce a thing.Over the past year we’ve talked to hundreds of users, recorded 2.5 million replays, and worked incredibly hard to ensure Replay would be fast, secure, and robust from the get go.Want to check it out? You can download Replay today. Can’t wait to hear what you think!Interested in learning more, here is our announcement blog post https://medium.com/replay-io/launching-replay-the-time-trave..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a JavaScript framework author, and was one of those fortunate to get early access and honestly it is the most useful tool I&#39;ve ever used in the debugging space.Sometimes things are complicated. Often there is a need to do digging to uncover the issue. Being able to move forward and backwards and even jumping between seemingly disjoint parts of the timeline are all at your disposal with Replay.Replay has saved me hours of time. And that isn&#39;t hyperbolee. On a couple occasions due to laziness and familiarity I&#39;d do stuff the traditional way and be stuck still after hours (sometimes days) on the same bug. With Replay I was able to shorten that time to about an hour on even the trickiest of bugs.So stoked to now have Replay available to others to help record reproductions of their bugs."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28536672">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hackers tend to use quotes as balanced delimiters like parentheses, much to the dismay of American editors. Thus, if “Jim is going” is a phrase, and so are “Bill runs” and “Spock groks”, then hackers generally prefer to write: “Jim is going”, “Bill runs”, and “Spock groks”. This is incorrect according to standard American usage (which would put the continuation commas and the final period inside the string quotes); however, it is counter-intuitive to hackers to mutilate literal strings with characters that don&#39;t belong in them. Given the sorts of examples that can come up in discussions of programming, American-style quoting can even be grossly misleading. When communicating command lines or small pieces of code, extra characters can be a real pain in the neck.— http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/writing-style.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a programmer, I’d prefer a combination of the two:Dr Johnson kicked a large rock and said, as his foot rebounded, “I refute it thus.”.as I think it’s weird that a punctuation mark inside a quote can end the sentence that contains the quote.I’d argue like this: in the above case there are two sentences, the quote and the sentence that contains the quote. Both need to be terminated with a period."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got in a heated debate about this with a technical writing instructor. Namely, I was ending a question with a quote along the lines of&gt; Why did Jake believe the AI was “going to kill us all”?The instructor wanted me to put the question mark of the outer sentence within the quotation marks despite the quoted text not containing a question mark.&gt; Why did Jake believe the AI was “going to kill us all?”I felt like doing so changed the meaning of the quote, and it felt like a misrepresentation. This being the “correct” way to do it has always irritated me.I ended up rewording the sentence so it wouldn’t end with the quotation, and have just actively avoided ending sentences in quotes ever since."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It looks like one of the authors is on HN with us.  Can you offer any insight into the cause of the confusing language in the &#34;Science News&#34; piece?  It reads like it was written by a bot not a human.In the sentence &#34;With the theory physicists Gregory Breit and John Wheeler were able to prove that when two high-energy photons collide, a positron and an electron arise, i.e. matter is formed&#34; shouldn&#39;t the word be &#34;predict&#34; not &#34;prove&#34;?A more flagrant example of a strange word choice for a human science writer to make is &#34;A direct conversion would require a laser that emits gamma-ray photons in a highly concentrated steel.&#34; Shouldn&#39;t the word &#34;steel&#34; instead be &#34;beam&#34;?  This seems like the sort of thing an uncomprehending bot might do, conflate those two words.Are my the nits I&#39;ve picked, above, unfounded? Does the author of the original paper have any information which might suggest that an actual human wrote the &#34;Science News&#34; piece?If not I would suggest that we&#39;ve got a bot on the loose!  Eeek!Further, I think I&#39;m seeing rather a lot of &#34;content&#34; floating around recently which smacks of machine origins.Also, to Daniel... Great paper.  Amazing stuff!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was surprised because I thought the Breit-Wheeler Effect has been demonstrated already. It just looks like what they mean here is single photon (or really, two photon), not the so-called strong field Breit-Wheeler that was demonstrated at SLAC and with powerful lasers for decades now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have had this mental question about &#39;what time is it when photons collide&#39;.  Given that a photon could have been travelling for a million years colliding with one that has only been travelling for a microsecond, and from the photon perspective there is no passage of time and no distance.I then kept reading things that tell me photons don&#39;t interact, which saddened me because I like the question.  This now appears to not be the case, is there a specific condition under which photons can interact like this?"</p>

Just really basic stuff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"GitLab team member here. I&#39;d like to add some additional context to my previous comments [1][2].Due to a security concern in which a profile containing a file extension would not load [3], we do not allow usernames that end with file extensions (ex: .mov). As noted by many folks here, these are associated with a MIME type but are not MIME types themselves. It is not related to preventing an injection or any such attack vector.The error message for this check incorrectly included MIME type rather than file extension. This has been updated [4].Additionally, there was an issue with how the actual check as it did not include the leading dot. The leading dot was added to the check in a subsequent MR [5].Thanks for all the feedback.1 - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=285357392 - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=285381663 - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/262954 - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/70374/...5 - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/65954"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; One more quick tip: unlike box-shadow, the filter property is hardware-accelerated in Chrome, and possibly other browsers.In Firefox, everything is hardware-accelerated. And the `will-change` property is largely obsolete. (I personally wish they had stuck to the old translateZ(0) hack which was obviously a hack rather than defining will-change, since WebRender—what lets Firefox do all the rendering on the GPU—was already well underway and had demonstrated that something like will-change wasn’t necessary, though it was still a few more years before it was stabilised in Firefox.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, this is way beyond what I expected. Josh consistently illustrates and explains these concepts extremely well. I really enjoy it.I hadn’t considered the idea of colour matching to simulate raytracing. It looks great, but I’m not sure when I’d have a product to work on which would be complimented by this treatment. Maybe I work on boring stuff. Perhaps if it was done with enough subtlety I could get away with it.I also wonder if it could become troublesome if you had nested ColourWrapper components. I suppose the most recent wrapper would take precedence, or it could be designed as such. Maybe I’ll give it a shot."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Speaking not to this study in particular necessarily, I strongly agree with the general point. Science has really been held back by an over-focusing on &#34;significance&#34;. But I&#39;m not really interested in a pile of hundreds of thousands of studies that establish a tiny effect with suspiciously-just-barely-significant results. I&#39;m interested in studies that reveal robust results that are reliable enough to be built on to produce other results. Results of 3% variations with p=0.046 aren&#39;t. They&#39;re dead ends, because you can&#39;t put very many of those into the foundations of future papers before the probability of one of your foundations being incorrect is too large.To the extent that those are hard to come by... Yeah! They are! Science is hard. Nobody promised this would be easy. Science shouldn&#39;t be something where labs are cranking out easy 3%/p=0.046 papers all the time just to keep funding. It&#39;s just a waste of money and time of our smartest people. It should be harder than it is now.Too many proposals are obviously only going to be capable of turning up that result (insufficient statistical power is often obvious right in the proposal, if you take the time to work the math). I&#39;d rather see more wood behind fewer arrows, and see fewer proposals chasing much more statistical power, than the chaff of garbage we get now.If I were King of Science, or at least, editor of a prestigious journal, I&#39;d want to put word out that I&#39;m looking for papers with at least one of some sort of significant effect, or a p value of something like p = 0.0001. Yeah. That&#39;s a high bar. I know. That&#39;s the point.&#34;But jerf, isn&#39;t it still valuable to map out all the little things like that?&#34; No, it really isn&#39;t. We already have every reason in the world to believe the world is drenched in 1%/p=0.05 effects. &#34;Everything&#39;s correlated to everything&#34;, so that&#39;s not some sort of amazing find, it&#39;s the totally expected output of living in our reality. Really, this sort of stuff is still just below the noise floor. Plus, the idea that we can remove such small, noisy confounding factors is just silly. We need to look for the things that stand out from that noise floor, not spending billions of dollars doing the equivalent of listening to our spirit guides communicate to us over white noise from the radio."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the article:Ernest Rutherford is famously quoted proclaiming “If your experiment needs statistics, you ought to have done a better experiment.”“Of course, there is an existential problem arguing for large effect sizes. If most effect sizes are small or zero, then most interventions are useless. And this forces us scientists to confront our cosmic impotence, which remains a humbling and frustrating experience.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the weird thing is that a bunch of people in tech understand this well _with respect to tech_, but often fall into the same p-value trap when reading about science.If you&#39;re working with very large datasets generated from e.g. a huge number of interactions between users and your system, whether as a correlation after the fact, or as an A/B experiment, getting a statistically significant result is easy. Getting a meaningful improvement is rarer, and gets harder after a system has received a fair amount of work.But then people who work in these big-data contexts can read about a result outside their field (e.g. nutrition, psychology, whatever), where n=200 undergrads or something, and p=0.03 (yay!) and there&#39;s some pretty modest effect, and be taken in by whatever claim is being made."</p>

You really can&#39;t get more user hostile than this, where you care more about extracting money from transactions that you&#39;re not a part of than making life easier for your paying customers.Apple let Amazon sell books using their own payment system because Amazon sold a lot of books on their own Kindle platform that Apple wanted users to be able to read on iPhones, but as soon as Apple&#39;s platform was the biggest one they altered the deal to squeeze more money out of it.

Still not a huge fan, but you can still see the tendrils of his influence that still affect today&#39;s world (adobe flash EOL last year, this stuff by not allowing you to buy books on the kindle/amazon app on iphone, continuing to control hardware and software experience).
