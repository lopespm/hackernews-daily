								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thanks for creating this content, this looks pretty good and it was a good time for me to refresh my basics about computer networks.I tried checking the content with my kindle (a Kindle Touch paperwhite 6 inches) and the first chapter rendered pretty good, with images and text aligning as intended. However the second chapter did not render the first figure and beyond. Chapter 3 rendered OK, similar to Ch 1.A few more feedback if that helps for enhancing the format even more:
- Colors, and references to those do not work on a kindle. I only saw one minor use of colors (red, green) in Chapter 1 so that&#39;s not a blocker.
- For some reason, the kindle browser doesn&#39;t put left and right margins on the page, so the text uses the full length of the device.
- Links are rendered with a pale gray, sometimes hard to distinguish.
- Figuring out why the Chapter 2 did not render would definitely help."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like walkie talkies are something all network engineers need to play with. Furthermore, remember that real world telephone and radio networks were in fact... Networks. (Called &#39;nets&#39; in the radio world)Ethernet, and 802.11, are both based on the concept of a singular channel shared by many individuals. When Alice talks, she says &#39;I&#39;m Alice calling Bob, can you hear me Over&#39;.Alice is the source address. Bob is the destination address. Over is the stop code/stop bit signifying the end of frame. The payload is &#39;can you hear me&#39;.-------This is everything up to layer 3. But if you wanted to send a radio/telegram across the country, you need one more layer, IP4 or the ARRL protocol (American Radio Relay League meets on the air at predestinated times to pass messages to each other on Ham radio frequencies. It&#39;s a human network)I&#39;m Alice, calling the Eastern Operators. I&#39;d like you to relay a message to Bob for me. The message is &#39;Can you Hear me&#39;, Over.This is a radio frame like all others, but an additional layer has been added. The radio operator has its own protocol built on top of the Frames.------Dave may overhear all of this chatter, but Dave knows to stay off the channel (otherwise he will cause interference). Only if Dave is addressed specifically would Dave respond (Ex: This is Alice, calling Dave. How are you doing? Over)We can see that the operator is itself just another person on the network. The operator may have a message from the rest of the world.This is the Eastern Operator calling Alice. I&#39;m relaying a message from Bob. The message is &#39;I got your message Alice!&#39;. Over.This is how a router may take a message from the greater internet and pass it to your local network."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Seeing Like a State&#34; by James C. ScottI started my career in international development, and the book above provides a dozen case studies on states using scientific management, stats, etc. to try and control their growth/populations/economies and failing miserably.It is a beautiful book in that it illustrates how difficult it is to actually manage a country and economy well, especially if you are trying to completely change it (i.e., &#34;develop&#34; it, solve poverty, etc.). It humbled me as a 22 year old &#34;professional&#34; wanting to fix the world.&#34;The Death and Life of Great American Cities&#34; by Jane Jacobs is a close second to this theme of economic, technocratic development.EDIT: I notice 22 upvotes. WOW! If you are a fan of this book or curious to hear more, please comment. Happy to elaborate. If you want a third book, The Evolution of Civilizations[1] is another fun one here. It tries to apply scientific principles and hypothesis testing to historical analysis![1] https://10millionsteps.com/review-evolution-of-civilizations"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What a great question!The book that got me into neuroscience was Phantoms in the Brain by V. S Ramachandran and Sandra Blakeslee. A 22-year old book that wowed 20-year-old me.  Principles of Neural Design by Peter Sterling and Simon Laughlin is a more recent book. It is brilliant, beautifully written and probably should be required reading for anyone looking to do graduate studies in neuroscience. In a field inundated with data and siloes and jargon, it bats for a focus on jargon-free understanding of principles that can explain much of the complexity. It was hugely inspirational for us when doing our own book (plug alert!).I hope that Journey of the Mind: How Thinking Emerged from Chaos, a book I co-authored, a book which drew inspiration from these two books, is able to do the same for many looking to study neuroscience and AI now.Phantoms in the Brain https://www.amazon.com/Phantoms-Brain-Probing-Mysteries-Huma...Principles of Neural Design https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Neural-Design-MIT-Press/dp...Journey of the Mind https://www.amazon.com/Journey-Mind-Thinking-Emerged-Chaos/d..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"PiHKAL by Alexander and Ann Shulgin is on its face a book about love and chemistry. Taken together it becomes more of a treatise on how psychopharmacology is a method of personal and sociological analysis. Drug use becomes a psychological tool to manifest the phenomena of the mind that are normally hidden, and novel synthesis becomes a tool to then access the areas of the mind unexplored throughout history. Aside of all this, the Shulgin&#39;s story is one of absolute dedication to science in the face of its many impediments: internal psychology, interpersonal relations, social stigma, technical innovation, and authoritarian censorship."</p>

There have been a lot of things which have disappeared over the years – such as apps bundled with Windows 3.x which have disappeared in newer versions (for example, Reversi or Cardfile) – but which were never sold as independent products, do they count? And what about stuff which is discontinued but has an upwardly compatible replacement – Visual C++ is the successor to the Microsoft C/C++ line going back to the 1980s, in a somewhat similar way VB.NET is successor to the Microsoft BASIC line going back to the 1970s. Microsoft Mail was replaced by Exchange/Outlook, etc. Xenix, OS/2 and LAN Manager were effectively replaced by Windows NT, the POSIX/Interix/SFU/SUA subsystem was effectively replaced by WSL.

What is described in this article is, unfortunately, a common case with some big tech companies.I&#39;ve recently started an experiment to send data deletion requests to 600 data brokers and document what happens. It&#39;s dark patterns all the way down.The solution is to escalate your request to the local data protection agency (attorney general in case of California). I believe that if enough of us do this it will make a difference, even in the case of Amazon.Following this realization we&#39;ve recently added an optional features which will follow up with you some time after a request is made, and depending on the outcome, offer to automate the escalation process."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I loved Photon. Proton added a lot of nice touches, but I never understood why would you want to turn the tabs into buttons. Tabs is a great metaphor from the real world, and they take less space. I don&#39;t see a single advantage of styling them as buttons. The whole point is that they&#39;re visually connected to the currently visible page.Thankfully however I don&#39;t care too much because I can still completely hide the tab-bar with my userChrome.css, and use &#34;Tab Center Reborn&#34; to have my tabs on the side instead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve always found the UI after IE6 / FF2 to look &#34;off&#34;, and that&#39;s likely because they started using non-native controls, drawing their own instead of relying on the platform UI.Firefox’s Redesigned Preferences Feel More like the WebThat expresses exactly what&#39;s wrong --- the native UI controls are predictable and accessible and styled with the rest of the OS, and as the cascade of dialogs above it (I&#39;m not sure how that&#39;s even possible --- getting to &#34;Offline Data&#34; From &#34;Exceptions - Saved Passwords&#34;?) shows, you can actually see that you&#39;re controlling the browser and not merely a page inside it (related article: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30697329).Another important change is the introduction of a skeleton screen to make the start feel fastI&#39;ve never heard that term before, but whenever I see things like that, I&#39;m reminded of fancy progress bars and such --- the real problem is that you need one in the first place, and instead of fixing the underlying problem of why it&#39;s taking so long, you try to hide it..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me Firefox’s UI design started going off the rails with Australis and Photon, where its UI began to be a major component of Firefox as a brand. I much preferred v1-v4 where Firefox felt more focused on being a tool that fit well into your desktop instead of trying to stand out.I’m sometimes tempted to try to start a Firefox fork that returns its UI to a “smaller part of a larger desktop” look and feel, but then I remember how impossible it would be to maintain that over time. Wish Gecko was still embeddable so one could just write a new UI and not have to keep patches maintained."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The issue with crypto is that reasonable use cases are early, and don’t attract attention except for niche communities.There’s a few big ones, for example, filecoin right now has created a commodity market for storage that is currently 10,000 cheaper than S3 in some instances. (See file.app for stats)But realistically, the interesting projects are very small and hard to find.However, scams and ponzi schemes, by their nature are very public, easy to find, and have lots of people talking about them (often for financial gain).Everyone building anything sane is so tired of having to explain that their thing isn’t a ponzi, isn’t an nft thing, and isn’t shilling proof of work, that they don’t post to hacker news, and so they exist outside of your bubble.Crypto is like the story of the blind scientists studying an elephant. The first one touches its trunk and says “it’s a snake!”, the next one touches its tusk and says “it’s a spear!”, the next one touches its side and says “it’s a wall!”. None have the correct answer, because no single party has a full view.The crypto skeptics are as irrational as the crypto optimists: firm believers in their own view, based on an incomplete information."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This format is interesting at first but when it starts getting to 5 paragraphs of dissecting each phrase, it gets too much. Reminds me of the someone-is-wrong-on-the-internet, point-by-point-repliers in internet forums circa 2006."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article (or, rather, the commentary in the link above on the article) talks about the fallacious notion of &#34;market cap&#34; in regards to cryptocurrencies. That is to say, e.g., multiplying the number of bitcoins in existence times the current market price is a silly metric because the entire market would never be able to cash-out at that maximum price.What I was wondering was: is there a better number? e.g., is there a way to calculate the amount of USD put into a cryptocurrency across a timeframe? What I&#39;m imagining is a metric like (sum of all bitcoins bought by USD purchase price) - (sum of all bitcoins sold by USD sale price) = amount of USD that has been put &#34;into&#34; bitcoin. That first glance, one might expect this number to equal zero, but it should be greater than zero because of the new coins created by mining."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The NES is in some sense a composite-only system. While there is an RGB mod, it&#39;s quite invasive[...]This is something that a lot of even very plugged into retrogaming people don&#39;t really get about the NES and RGB mods. I think it&#39;s very counterintuitive for people now that there is no part of the system that operates in actual &#39;color&#39; information. The NES&#39; video output is composite from start to finish[1], with palette entries corresponding to approximate output frequencies for the color subcarrier.So there is no canonical palette for the NES - the colors produced by games varied by region, a little bit by unit, and especially because NTSC had trouble with stable color even by TV.So people imagine that RGB or HDMI mods of the NES are somehow tapping into a missing layer of raw color information, but what it&#39;s actually doing is intercepting communications with the PPU and modelling (on an fpga) an extra PPU that does operate in RGB, and then constructing a new video signal from that.And then you have to pick a palette, because there isn&#39;t just one.I have an RGB modded NES (a US toploader) but I doubt I will ever buy or make another one. At this point I think it&#39;s better to just use an upscaler, which will produce no less authentic a picture. The main benefit imo of the rgb mod is that there&#39;s less interference so the picture is clearer, even if you just output reconstructed composite from it.[1] There is actually a model of NES PPU that outputs RGB, it was used in the PlayChoice arcade machines (which generally used RGB monitors, not composite) and it has a palette that most people agree is ugly as sin."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There were so many things the NES did right.For instance the color palette was designed with aesthetics in mind:  it had 56 colors that you&#39;d want to use,  compared to the 216 colors of the web safe palette that must have been chosen by a physicist because 60% of them make me want to puke.The Atari 400 and 800 had an elaborate system for game-friendly video that couldn&#39;t touch what the NES did with tiles.  They did amazing things with the TI-99/4A (like simulate framebuffer graphics with tiles so long as you didn&#39;t need to cover the whole screen...  a trick you couldn&#39;t do with the character ROM talked about in this article) but it didn&#39;t have the brilliant end-to-end engineering of the NES...... And of course the ability to extend the hardware with the cartridge took advantage of the falling cost of electronics AND fit with the business model that the cheap console is subsidized by expensive games."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Principally the thing it did right, having lived through the era, is bring a real video game home with Super Mario Bros.At the time I had a C64 and an Atari 2600, but would spend every quarter I could dig up at the arcade at the bowling alley next door playing pretty much anything, but especially Super Mario Bros.The Nintendo was the first console to bring the arcade home and it was absolutely revolutionary."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My wife and I were just talking about this yesterday. She is an extremely specialized surgeon and she is horrified by the academic publishing in her area of expertise. It is often utterly wrong and conflicts directly with her experience. I&#39;m not sure she&#39;d agree with the reasons mentioned in this article here as the main issue - although we have personally seen less ethically motivated doctors publishing research to help line their pockets via the industry. In her opinion the main issue is that academic doctors HAVE to publish in order to advance their careers. So you end up with a never ending stream of terrible research, churned out by doctors that are not experts in doing research and that actually spend most of their time doing other things. This happens even at the best centers; at least in her area of expertise. I don&#39;t know what the solution is, but I do know that whenever she has needed treatment for herself she generally ignores most of the research and talks to the most experienced surgeon she can find."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Evidence-based medicine, more than the indeed important issues raised in the article, is mostly impaired by the absolutely abysmal average quality of clinical research papers. The absolutism of higher-ups combined with their unrivalled (in the scientific world) statistical ignorance is hurting science more than anything else. And there&#39;s a reason to that: MDs are not scientists. We&#39;re highly-skilled workers, and more of the blue-collar kind."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After reading this article I find only one problem with it, and that is the title.The problem the authors have so perfectly characterized has nothing to do with the emphasis on evidence that medicine requires, but on the distortion imposed on the system by large pharmaceutical companies.The reality of the obstacles standing in the way of rigorous testing for drug or therapy effectiveness does not make evidence-based medicine an illusion.In fact, the authors actually make a strong argument in favor of evidence-based medicine, by stating the need to acknowledge these biases. And that the reason for all these biases is greed."</p>
