								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Don&#39;t put Cloudflare in front of a Cloud egress bill. i.e. don&#39;t do this: Azure|Amazon &gt; CloudflareAlways use your own proxy where the egress is well within your free tier, i.e. do this: Azure|Amazon &gt; Hetzner|Linode &gt; CloudflareWhy?Because Cloudflare cache is a massively multi-tenant LRU cache and whilst hot files will be cached well (and with Cloudflare Tiered Cache even better - but this itself is a cost) anything else is still going to expose you to some degree of egress cost.When I exposed AWS to the web I paid $3k per month to AWS. With Cloudflare in front of AWS I paid $300 per month to AWS. With Linode in front of AWS and behind Cloudflare I paid $20 per month to Linode and about $12 per month to AWS.A Linode, Hetzner instance... or any other dumb cheap web server that comes with a healthy free tier of bandwidth is all you need to set up a simple nginx reverse proxy and have it cache things to disk https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/content-cache/conte..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ah the old cloud provider switcheroo. Yip this is the way they make money. They make it easy to setup some gigantic hugely scalable website then hit you with a gigantic scaled up bill. AWS would do this as well.Team I&#39;m in at the moment is in the early stages of cloud adoption but the company in total has fell hook line and sinker for AWS. When I mentioned the cost there is always an excuse.The main one being that you don&#39;t have to hire sysadmins anymore as that&#39;s taken care now by AWS. Ah yes but they have actually been replaced with a &#34;DevOps&#34; team plus just our department now spend &gt; £1 million per year to AWS in hosting costs. A 20% reduction in those fees could pay for a few sysadmin(s).The next one is that no other vendor would be able to supply the kit. You know StackOverflow is able to run on a single webserver (https://nickcraver.com/blog/2016/02/17/stack-overflow-the-ar...). Plus many of the other providers have loads of instances available.I mean I&#39;m not against cloud it&#39;s just not the cheapest option if you choose one of the big 3 providers. I use a company called scaleway (https://www.scaleway.com/en/) they have all the essential cloud services you need and everything else you can run yourself in docker or k8s."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ouch. If Troy Hunt of all people can make this mistake, it can happen to anybody. HIBP is an awesome service funded totally by donations, so it&#39;s too bad this happened. Of course Microsoft is happy to hide behind their confusing pricing model and let customers overpay for Azure without alerting them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I experienced something similar building an internal tool on GSuite. I had a large file with sequences of 9 digit numbers specific to our use-case, all tied to names of people (employees). Whelp, at one point the tool I was working on stopped working, and it was flagged as apparently containing social security numbers (which I suppose matched the character length).Whelp, on the admin panel, you can get a report of those files, and then mark it as a false positive. Which I did. But then nothing happened, and nothing changed. It was no use.The hilarious bit: It did, of course, allow me to make a copy of the file in question, and then just point the resource I was building to the new file, which was exactly the same. Weeks later... so far, so good."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; How do you deal with Microsoft&#39;s crap on a daily basis? Any similar stories?My advice is that, unless you are developing for Windows is don&#39;t. If you need the Adobe tools, you can get them for Macs and, since M1, Macs offer a lot of bang for the buck while being a perfectly usable Unix machine, they are an excellent choice.If you don&#39;t need tools that aren&#39;t available on Linux, then Linux is a really good option. Hardware support may be an issue, so I always recommend the most boring machines possible - Intel, with integrated graphics - and only get components you know will work well with Linux."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been using Nix and NixOS for a while and I&#39;ve seen four core advantages:1. Nix store: what the article covers: multiple versions of the same package, &#34;virtualenv for everything&#34;... etc2. Reproducibility: because package definitions are self-contained, I can pin and reliably reproduce everything for my packages. And I do mean everything.3. Flexibility: Nix works for system packages on NixOS as well as user packages on any Linux or macOS. I&#39;ve been sharing like 70% of my system config between Linux and macOS, and I don&#39;t know of any other tool that can do that.4. Programmability: package definitions and config are extensible and composable. Yes, learning an ad hoc language to do this is a pain, but once I learned it I got a higher-level and better-abstracted way to define and combine packages than any other tool I&#39;ve used. It&#39;s like going from C to OCaml. At this point I&#39;ve started hating Dockerfiles because they can&#39;t easily be composed and don&#39;t provide any real facilities for abstraction.Ultimately, Nix took system management from feeling like an operational activity—maintaining and changing a bunch of mutable state to run the system—to declarative programming. Learning curve aside, making system management a reproducible programming activity with no system state to worry about has been a massive improvement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried using NixOS on a laptop for a month and switched back to Arch a couple of months ago. It was an interesting experience - I never used functional programming language before, but nix was pretty ok as a configuration language. It looks like funny version of JSON with functions.Debugging it was a real pain though - I was trying to write (or copy from someone else config) a function to recursively import all modules from a folder and the error messages were hard to understand with stacktraces ending somewhere deep in standard library.The other problem was with nixpkgs, i.e. I haven&#39;t found a clear list of packages that were going to be updated. Jetbrains IDEA was updating very slowly and when I wanted to pin a version of it simply overriding version variable in the overlay was not enough - there were also some other linked variables. Emacs package from custom overlay constantly tried to compile itself, requiring me to check build status on hydra build system.In the end I decided that it&#39;s not really worth it. I don&#39;t have many systems and services to manage and for a raspberry pi and a vps multiple docker-compose.yaml files in git repo is enough. 
I think Henrik Lissner (author of Doom Emacs) wrote a really good piece about why someone should choose to use NixOS - https://github.com/hlissner/dotfiles#frequently-asked-questi..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;&#34;&#34;The first is relatively simple: they developed their own programming language to do configuration, which is not very good and is extremely difficult to learn. The vast majority of people using NixOS do not understand the language, and simply copy/paste example configurations, which mostly works until you need to do something complicated, at which point you&#39;re completely high and dry.&#34;&#34;&#34;Maybe this is nitpicking, but: the Nix language is about as straightforward as &#34;JSON plus functions&#34;. Maybe that is difficult for people who haven&#39;t had an experience with pure/functional programming?Though, yes, the way Nix is used can be quite complicated/sophisticated. -- Even if all of Nixpkgs were translated to JavaScript, I think it&#39;d still be complicated to understand. (Though I suspect using a more general purpose language would allow for more footguns).+1 to the sentiment that most of the time you can get by just fine, but when you can&#39;t, NixOS is more difficult to make progress with compared to other Linux distributions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like the flow direction compared to standard SQL.  SQL is supposed to read like a sentence I suppose but I have many times looked at it and really wanted things to be in a more logical order.My main suggestion would be to be a bit less terse and introduce a bit more firm formatting.  I&#39;m not a huge fan of the term &#34;split&#34; and feel like jazzing that up to &#34;split over&#34; or even just reviving &#34;group by&#34; would improve readability.  Additionally the aliasing could use work, I&#39;d suggest reversing the assignment to be something closer to `use salary + payroll_tax as gross salary`.  In terms of firm formatting, unless I&#39;m missing something there isn&#39;t any reason to allow a filter statement before any aliases - so you can force two fixed positions for filter clauses which would make it always legal to reference aliases in filters.On the brief topic of form vs. flexibility.  SQL is a thing that, when complex, is written by many people over the course of its lifetime - removing the ability to make bad decisions is better than enabling the ability to write simple things even simpler - those silly do nothing queries like &#34;SELECT * FROM customer WHERE deleted=&#39;f&#39;` are written once[1] in a moments time and never inspected again.  The complex queries are what you want to optimize for.1. If they even are - with ORMs available a lot of those dead simple queries just end up being done through an ORM."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like it, it&#39;s readable, unlike some SQL alternatives I&#39;ve seen it doesn&#39;t make me feel like I&#39;m dumb and don&#39;t understand what a query even is.I can&#39;t decide if it would be better or worse if it stuck more closely to SQL keywords. You use &#34;from&#34; and &#34;select&#34;, but not &#34;where&#34;, &#34;order by&#34;, &#34;group by&#34;. There&#39;s some danger of it being in an uncanny valley of SQLish, but I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;d prefer just using those terms verbatim (including the space in &#34;order by&#34;... that style is less common in modern languages but it&#39;s not really that much harder to parse).I&#39;d like to see more examples of joins and composing SQL. Does this language make it easier to make more general SQL queries? Can I take two queries and squash them together in a reliable way? I feel like I end up with a lot of theme and variation in my queries, often involving optional filters.I might even like a notion of encapsulation that could help this query language when it&#39;s embedded in other languages. Like if I could say, in the language itself, that a query has certain unbound variables (and not just ? or other placeholders). This language seems like it would be better for generating than SQL, and sometimes generation is just necessary (like in any application that supports data exploration), but for most common cases I&#39;d hope to avoid that. Defining inputs and then making whole filter sections or other statements conditional on those inputs would help here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Now this is actually nice, unlike the other suggestion posted today[1].Maybe I&#39;m just too used to non-standard extensions of our database but the SQL example could, at least for our db, be rewritten as    SELECT TOP 20
        title,
        country,
        AVG(salary) AS average_salary,
        SUM(salary) AS sum_salary,
        AVG(gross_salary) AS average_gross_salary,
        SUM(gross_salary) AS sum_gross_salary,
        AVG(gross_cost) AS average_gross_cost,
        SUM(gross_cost) AS sum_gross_cost,
        COUNT(*) as count
    FROM (
        SELECT
            title,
            country,
            salary,
            (salary + payroll_tax) AS gross_salary,
            (salary + payroll_tax + healthcare_cost) AS gross_cost
        FROM employees
        WHERE country = &#39;USA&#39;
    ) emp
    WHERE gross_cost &gt; 0
    GROUP BY title, country
    ORDER BY sum_gross_cost
    HAVING count &gt; 200

This cuts down the repetition a lot, and can also help the optimizer in certain cases. Could do another nesting to get rid of the HAVING if needed.Still, think the PRQL looks very nice, especially with a &#34;let&#34; keyword as mentioned in another thread here.[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30053860"</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30066969">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To be honest, this feels like a PR stunt since we all know if you add &#34;YC is bad&#34; and share it on HN, people will look and react. I haven&#39;t heard of Bolt, I&#39;m not familiar with the space at all. I use Stripe because the product just works and I can trust my business with it. Seeing a CEO who publicly complains turns me away from even wanting to try the product.On a related note - I helped review a little over 100+ YC applications since getting in myself in S20 as a way to give back. There were a lot of bad applications or just ideas that seemed over saturated (a social media for some niche as an example). Literally tens of thousands of people apply for YC every batch. I personally recommended around 20 with around 15 getting interviews and around 10 getting in. I only recommend companies that I personally would want to invest in if I had the capital. YC has funded a handful of competitors in my space (PaaS) and I actually had calls with them to exchange notes and see where we could help each other."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think if you get over the drama here and implied &#34;dirtiness&#34;, the main result is still a bit interesting.Even if you exclude the implied carteling and take everything he said with a grain of salt, the outcomes of this incentive structure are clear: once SV (i.e. the YC centered VC machine) gets into a space and has a main horse, SV can no longer incubate new innovation/competition in the space. It can also very likely become predatory to the potential innovators that SV is supposed to support.At a more macro scale, this means that YC will fade in the same way as everything else does because it won&#39;t be able to entertain a wave of innovators, and they will, as he did, seek and build the next SV."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Public fights can occasionally be net positive for one of the participants, but your arguments will be publicly scrutinized and they better be watertight. If the logic you presented is your best work, then I can easily see why you&#39;ve experienced some trouble in getting people to support you.Let&#39;s start with the very first argument you presented: getting rejected by YC is a clear proof of collusion.Getting rejected by YC happens to tens of thousands of applicants each batch. Your chances of getting accepted increase disproportionally if you can show progress since the rejection. To react the way you did is a contrarian move. And it kind of fits the pattern - to publicly insult every VC on Stripe&#39;s cap table is also a contrarian move. Not to mention that you also made it clear to all your future potential talent that there&#39;s this thing about you not being liked by the VC community in Silicon Valley.I will skip all the little jumps to conclusions that you also presented throughout your thread, and will instead focus on the big picture here. The whole time I was reading your thread, I was waiting for the triumphant finish (eg: today we&#39;re announcing that we stole Stripe&#39;s biggest customer). Instead, all I heard was that Stripe is unbeatable, which sounded quite depressing from your company&#39;s point of view. I wonder how this will make future fundraising or deal closing any easier. Another contrarian move.I am not in a position to criticize you because clearly you&#39;ve gotten very far and something that you&#39;re doing must be working. But whatever it is, it&#39;s super contrarian. So rather than presenting the Stripe-Bolt competition in the light of a mobster movie, I think a Rambo analogy would be more appropriate - a traumatized but highly skilled fighter declaring war on everyone and their grandmother."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Funny enough, I decided to play with FreeBSD for personal projects in 2020. I gave up and I am reverting all my servers to Linux in 2022, for the opposite of the reasons mentioned in this article.* Lack of systemd. Managing services through shell scripts is outdated to me. It feels very hacky, there is no way to specify dependencies, and auto-restarts in case of crashes. Many FreeBSD devs praise launchd, well... systemd is a clone of launchd.* FreeBSD jail are sub-optimal compared to systemd-nspawn. There are tons of tools to create freebsd jails (manually, ezjail, bastillebsd, etc…) half of them are deprecated. At the end all of your jails end up on the same loopback interface, making it hard to firewall. I couldn&#39;t find a way to have one network interface per jail. With Linux, debootstrap + machinectl and you&#39;re good to go.* Lack of security modules (such as SELinux) -- Edit: I should have written &#34;Lack of good security module&#34;* nftables is way easier to grasp than pf, and as fast as pf, and has atomic reloads."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The reasons are, for a large part, not on the technical side. I was surprised, because this this a lot of work for little visible gain. Here are the reasons, slightly abbreviated:&gt; The whole system is managed by the same teamMostly philosophical.&gt; FreeBSD development is less driven by commercial interests.Mostly philosophical.&gt; Linux has Docker but FreeBSD has jails!IMO, this comparison is a mistake. In the Linux world, systemd&#39;s nspawn is very similar to Jails. It&#39;s a glorified chroot, with security and resource management. All the systemd tools work seemlessly with nspawn machines (e.g. `systemctl status`). Containers à la Docker are a different thing.BTW, I thought the last sentence about security issues with Docker images was strange. If you care about unmaintained images, build them yourself. On the other side, the FreeBSD official documentation about Jails has a big warning that starts with &#34;Important: the official Jails are a powerful tool, but they are not a security panacea.&#34;&gt; Linux has no official support for zfs and suchFair point, though I&#39;ve heard about production systems with zfs on Linux.&gt; The FreeBSD boot procedure is better than grub.YMMV&gt; FreeBSD&#39;s network is more performant.Is there some conclusive recent benchmark about this. The post uses a 2014 post about ipv6 at Facebook, which I think is far from definitive today. Especially more since it &#34;forgot&#34; to mention that Facebook intended to enhance the &#34;Linux kernel network stack to rival or exceed that of FreeBSD.&#34; Did they succeed over these 8 years ?&gt; Straightforward system performance analysisThe point is not about the quality of the tools, but the way each distribution packages them. Seems very very low impact to me.&gt; FreeBSD&#39;s Bhyve against Linux&#39;s KVMThe author reluctantly admits that KVM is more mature."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The characterisation of systemd in this post really bothers me, particularly this:&gt; 70 binaries just for initialising and loggingIt’s just not true. Those 70 binaries provide much more functionality than an init system, they can cover a significant portion of system management, including a local DNS resolver, network configuration or system time management. You can dislike the fact everything is so tightly integrated (which feels ironic given that the post goes on to praise a user space from one team), but let’s at least be correct about this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"GitHub Actions with act to test stuff locally is actually pretty usable. We use on-prem k8s-hosted runners to get access to servers/clusters with limited internet access, works great.But as always with “”gitops”” themed tools I think it’s pretty awkward to handle rollbacks. Either you take the stance that master is the source of truth and let the CI/CD tooling revert commits if deployment fails, or you store that state elsewhere and allow e.g manifests to diverge from git.I would be curious to hear how other people do it"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While dealing with an unfamiliar project recently, being able to run actions locally with act[1] was a great time saver for me:[1] https://github.com/nektos/act"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Word of advice, if you are thinking of running self hosted runners and use Actions for your organisation, do yourself a favour and check them out in a year or two and use something like Argo Workflows or Tekton instead.GHA isn’t a product thought for GH private organisations, you will find that every much needed feature for this use is very low in GH roadmap."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"YAML was intended to be a superset, but it isn&#39;t quite, which is about the worst case scenario. See https://metacpan.org/pod/JSON::XS#JSON-and-YAML , for instance.(I am an absolutist on this matter. To be a superset, all, that&#39;s A L L valid JSON strings must also be valid YAML to be a superset. A single failure makes it not a superset. At scale, any difference will eventually occur, which is why even small deviations matter.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Are people not even reading about what they are using?Always read documentation or you will get burned by something completely innocuous. For example, that’s how you get Norway missing in your config file with YAML:  NI: Nicaragua
  NL: Netherlands
  NO: Norway

Oops, “NO” evaluates to false like 10 other reserve words."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a love-hate relationship with YAML.Hate:- human-wise ambiguity of its syntax (If I understand correctly, you &#34;can&#34; indent array items, but you don&#39;t have to. And than one guys says &#34;OK, I&#39;m gonna indent&#34;, and another guy says &#34;Nah. I&#39;m not gonna indent&#34;)- still no support for datetime as a first class citizen- strings usually don&#39;t need quotes, until they do (I prefer to always quote)Note that two of the above points are about allowing inconsistent styles, which is a thing I hate.Love:- it supports comments whereas JSON does not. If the IETF ever officially updated JSON to support C-style inline (and maybe block) comments, I would absolutely ditch YAML."</p>
