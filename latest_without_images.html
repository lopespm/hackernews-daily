								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thank you, whomever did this!  I asked for it in a comment recently.This video basically is making fun of a common situation of Google at the time, where a person wants to serve up some data for analytics, but the sysadmins expect the person to follow a process intended for much more complex and high availability services run by teams of skilled engineers.It parodies SRE as a BOFH sysadmin, even though in general SRE are quite easygoing and helpful.It helped poked fun at a number of overly stuffy processes and also helped push people to make hosting modest datasets (like this 5TB one) easier."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Background: https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2021/10/30/5tb/This video was hugely influential on changing the way Google does internal tools and operations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These kind of organizational problems happen everywhere, that doesn&#39;t bug me. What bugs me is when leadership knows about it and doesn&#39;t care. After low-level engineers stick their professional neck out to complain in internal town halls and through feedback forms, and leadership gives some bullshit answer that doesn&#39;t address or even acknowledge the problem. It would be less infuriating if they just said &#34;I don&#39;t give a shit.&#34; It&#39;s the weasel words and pretending the problem doesn&#39;t exist that infuriates me. A lot of the time it doesn&#39;t even take much work at all to begin addressing the issue, like a working group for continuous improvement of highly-painful high-value processes. You don&#39;t even have to solve it. Just attempt to address it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is really cool.  I&#39;m 30 right now, and only just recently finished my bachelors and have been looking to get a PhD, but it&#39;s really hard to find a program that will let you work full time while doing it. It doesn&#39;t help that a part of me does sort of feel &#34;too old&#34; to do this sometimes.  The PhD system in the US is really tailored around the assumption that you haven&#39;t entered the corporate world yet.Anyway, it&#39;s really inspiring that someone almost three times my age pushed himself through the program. I guess it&#39;s important to remember that you really shouldn&#39;t give up on your dreams."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is very inspiring. I too am young and been in the work force for several years, but unlike the other comments in this thread I am
not settled down as an older student returning to school.I am willing to give up a high paying salary to return back to school as a PhD student and I am
not tied down with a mortgage or anything else.I find mathematics simply too interesting to not learn at the highest level. Working in industry will simply not teach me the material I want to learn. I’m considering going back for either a  PhD in Math or a math heavy PhD in CS. I read math textbooks for fun and worked with tutors to ensure my proofs are done correctly. I can do this for hours on end without external motivation. I taught myself a lot of math and can see myself doing this as a career. I want to do research.Most people my age say the same things in the comment sections in this thread (tied down to a mortgage, make too much money to return). I’m glad generalizations like these don’t apply to me and can’t wait to get back to school"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a university student in my last year of undergrad, I&#39;ve been tempted to go work as a software engineer, even though I&#39;m interested in doing research. The opportunity cost just seems too large to give up. Working as a SWE will allow me to earn a massive income in my 20s, during which I have few defendants and a lot of leisure time. While many of my peers are planning to do graduate school right away, I feel like my quality of life would simply be better by going to work in industry right now.With that said, I still love learning and diving deeply into topics like math and the history of science. I hope that I can one day retire off my savings as a SWE and return to graduate school (maybe in my late 30s or 40s). Has anyone done this before? Is there a stigma against graduate students (both Masters and PhD) who are not in their 20s?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of the engineering math associated with splines (NURBs) and surface approximations came from Citroen, Peugeot and Renault, the car makers, in the mid-20th century. I read a great book on this back in the 80&#39;s and can&#39;t remember the name. It was about the early days of CAD and its origins.Like, the control points on splines were called &#34;ducks&#34;, which were weights attached to spring steel suspended from the ceiling of the studio, which caused the steel to bend into particular shapes computed mathematically beforehand by the design engineers. These curves were used to guide model making. It was a fascinating book."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is the way. I wish this were taught in computer science class, development bootcamps, operations team onboarding, anywhere there is a procedure that is even slightly complicated to automate. It is the absolute best solution there is.* Documentation of the entire procedure is contained in one place. No need to go sifting through 20 different sources of documentation. This lowers the human emotional barrier to &#34;just get it done&#34;, as people will always avoid things they aren&#39;t comfortable/familiar with, or don&#39;t have all the steps to. This central point of documentation also enables rapidly improving the process by letting people see all the steps in one place, which makes it easier to fix/collapse/remove steps.* Automation in small pieces over time avoids the trap of &#34;a project&#34; where one or more engineers have to be dedicated to this one task for a long period of time. Most things shouldn&#39;t be automated unless there is demonstrably greater value in the cost of automating them than the cost of not doing so. Automating only the most valuable/costly pieces first gives immediate gains without sinking too much into the entire thing.* One unified &#34;method&#34; to encapsulate any kind of process means your organization can ramp up on processes easier, reducing overall organizational cost.* In the absence of any other similar process, you are guaranteed to save time and money.I would say that the only potential downside is if someone decides to &#34;engineer&#34; this method, making it more and more and more complicated, until it loses its value. KISS is a requirement for it to be sustainable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I did this after seeing this before on HN. There were a few processes that were manual that benefitted from the technique in the article.Learn from my folly: I even called them “do nothing scripts,” referencing this article. However; I was judged by peers for not writing the full automation versions as they didn’t appreciate the idea of gradual automation (programmer hubris?). Saying “do nothing scripts” in meetings did catch the awkward attention of leadership.As a description, “do nothing” communicates a lot. As a brand, “do nothing” can use some improvements.My short prescription of turning “do nothings” into “do some things” into “do all the things” didn’t help. We had some new people join the team and they had fun turning the do nothing scripts into a document. * Sigh *I still build these type of process description scripts still. I usually don’t advertise them to peers until they do some of the things nowadays."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My experience in corporate IT convinced me that even if an entire release could be automated down to a single press of a giant red button (and even if undoing the release could be another, single button), then culturally our organization would still figure out a way to turn the pressing of that button into a six hour ordeal requiring the participation of twelve people."</p>

I haven’t worked in 6 months and I’m struggling to find a larger meaning to my life beyond getting yet another tech job. I’ve considered going to college for a math degree, moving to my parents home country, and joining the military (among many other options) over the last few months.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Super frustrated by the state of videos for kids on youtube, especially in the arts and crafts department, i decided to launch  a channel and start creating my own content. Basically, all videos start half decent but for some reason end in a big noisy mess, weird sounds, spoiling food, questionable product placements, zero creativity and always incentivize more watching and trapping viewers in the infinite ‘next video’ loop.Instead, one of the goals for my videos will be to take a step back and inspire to create, zero commercial interest, not too much distractions and something parents can trust.Still in the process of figuring out all the parameters, camera, editing, setup etc but its a lot of fun learning new skills. I have a million ideas for the content already so enough work to be done. If there is little to no ‘success’ in terms of viewers, i really don’t care since i enjoy all aspects of it and im building a nice catalog of creative videos to watch with my kid later. I have no public videos yet (coming very soon) but here are two samples of what to expect:https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_3e0tawk45Ehttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mBZStuxOUlc"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hah this thread is perfect. I just finished building my new four axis robot arm design. It’s all open source. Three months ago I started playing with a new planetary gearbox concept, where the first stage is in the middle with second stages on both sides. The first sun is driven by a shaft that goes through a hole in the second stage sun. The result is a very balanced joint design with parallel outputs. A good configuration for weak materials like plastic. And then the gearboxes and the frame are all integrated together, so this is not something where you assemble a gearbox and bolt it to the frame. The gearbox members and the frame members are unified.I’m very happy with it so far! Video here:https://twitter.com/tlalexander/status/1455320442642714625?s...It’s open source, CC0 licensed. Please fork the design files here!https://cad.onshape.com/documents/d663661f8c0c34e7a29bbfa6/w...EDIT: you may prefer to watch the project and wait to fork it until I have fleshed out a few more things. In that case feel free to star this git repo and I will update it as I make progress.https://github.com/tlalexander/brushless_robot_arm/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Does a history of enforcement help in cases like this? The article itself says that Truth Social is &#34;antithetical&#34; to Mastodon&#39;s values, but that there&#39;s nothing they can do about the usage of their software other than license violations. It sounds like they have a bias to enforce their license in this case.If Mastodon has a weak history of enforcing their license to other organizations, does it weaken the case? I&#39;m wondering if selective enforcement in the software-licensing world hurts the authority or credibility of a license, in the eyes of the law.My wondering was somewhat inspired by the way Nintendo aggressively polices the appearance of its video game trademarks on places like YouTube and basically the rest of the internet. I hear an argument is that if they don&#39;t aggressively enforce their trademark policing, their legal position wouldn&#39;t be as strong if they want to pursue a big violation in the future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This (possible but technically not yet a) license violation has gotten more press for OSS licenses and enforcement than anything before, I think.Certainly more press than the Vizio thing, which will actually impact a lot more people if anything comes of it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; As far as personal feelings are concerned, of course we would prefer if people so antithetical to our values did not use and benefit from our labourAnd sensible people would prefer that license violations would be published and pursued fairly, and personal feelings kept personal, rather than creating a soft list of people and perspectives whose online/computing freedom is less important than others."</p>

Except for marginal cases, it&#39;s not about how good you are at your job. You just have to be liked while being sufficiently good.It&#39;s also why the perennial &#34;hiring is broken&#34; posts and threads miss the point completely: really they&#39;re just trying to find someone they like.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"General grumpiness about this particular design decision aside, it appears that since the T2 Macs, the main SSD was being used to store core system firmware. On T2 I think it&#39;s BridgeOS that sends the EFI image to the Intel side to boot it, and it does the firmware verification and loading.This setup has a benefit; namely, it is now impossible to brick the system with a bad BIOS/EFI flash, and you&#39;ll never need to use a hardware SPI flasher to recover. Just like the iPhone, you can enter Boot ROM DFU mode, which can&#39;t easily be overwritten, and restore all of the firmware on the system that&#39;s writable.This is great for restoring systems to a known good firmware state, including SSD, EFI, BridgeOS, RecoveryOS. On a normal system, there is plenty of non volatile storage that is difficult to recover or reset.The primary argument against soldering the SSD, or really any other part, down like this tends to be that &#34;Oh, now you can&#39;t just save money by upgrading it yourself|replacing it when it breaks&#34;. On the other side, these machines are engineered as appliances that should achieve a certain degree of reliability. The SSD is reasonably considered to last the &#34;lifetime&#34; of the product, and should it fail, I don&#39;t consider the inability to externally boot to be a huge problem, since whatever failure damaged the SSD is statistically likely to compromise the reliability of the rest of the board. Any failure is grounds for &#34;rework&#34; of the board on a hardware level if necessary,up to and including repair/replacement of the onboard flash, and not just a simple workaround in my opinion. Note that they don&#39;t force you to actually USE the internal SSD - you can still netboot or USB boot I think. It just has to work.Trivia:
-At least on T2 systems, the flash memory itself (the NAND chips) on the mainboard can actually be swapped between units after a DFU restore by unsoldering them and transferring them.The person that did this on YouTube notes that a common reason for SSD failure on T2 machines is due to SSD power regulator circuitry being located close to the intake vents on the side of the MacBook Pro. They recommend that users of these machines open them and clean the dust out often, since dust buildup on the actual power regulator combined with moisture sometimes causes a short circuit, sending high voltage to the SSD and damaging it.This kind of failure (high voltage parts close to low voltage ones, close to liquid damage prone areas, without any underfilling) is documented by Louis Rossmann. It is, however, not always feasible or possible to entirely prevent."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Article is from May but received no attention, and I believe most people are unaware of this; the Mac needs an iBoot on the internal drive in order to boot from any volume, and thus cannot boot from an external drive if the internal one has failed."</p>
