								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Second, AMP is bad for security. By design, AMP confuses users about what site they’re interacting with. Users think they’re interacting with the publisher, when in actuality the user is still within Google’s control. User-respecting browsers defend the site as the security and privacy boundary on the web, and systems like AMP intentionally confuse this boundary.They&#39;ve actually been pushing to confuse that boundary even more since 2019, with their Signed Exchanges specification[0][1]. In essence, when you (unintentionally) visit an AMP page from Google Search, the URL typically starts with google.com/amp/websiteyouwantedtogoto.com. Signed Exchanges is essentially a way to drop the &#34;google.com/amp/&#34; bit, as demonstrated by one of the animations on [0].Even Cloudflare supported this and rolled it out on their free tier[2].[0]: https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2019/04/instant-lo...[1]: https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18402628/google-amp-url-p...[2]: https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-amp-real-url/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kudos to Brave - they&#39;re a sometimes weird actor, but some of their initiatives are commendable, and they often do what Mozilla should have, but didn&#39;t.I rarely end up in AMP pages on my mobile, but when it happens I immediately feel like I stepped on a turd, and promptly backtrack / close the tab before it hijacks my back button, half the screen, standard controls (including doing something weird to scrolling) and other unpleasantries like banners whose &#34;x&#34; somehow overlaps my browser&#39;s bars, and are therefore out of reach (and said browser bars somehow do NOT autohide when scrolling, unlike on normal pages)Getting AMP results from Google search has been one of the drivers leading me to switch to DDG, so congrats Google, one less customer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everything you need to know about AMP is in one very specific section of the spec:&#34;AMP HTML documents MUST...contain a &lt;script async src=&#34;https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; tag inside their head tag&#34; [1]Meaning, &#34;Your content must load and run some Google controlled javascript, that does who-knows-what to your content and end users&#34;.In the past, that&#39;s included injecting a big header that pushes your content down, hijacking swipe events on your page, an [X] button that looked like it would delete the AMP banner header, but instead navigated away from your page back to google, etc.[1] https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/spe..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"These are boogieman policies that have zero influence on the root cause.Foreign investors jump into the housing market because the current system ensures that the supply of housing is limited so it is an attractive way to park your wealth.But that is not the root cause.The root cause is the system that is geared to keep houses always appreciating via supply constraints: aggressive zoning, discretionary permitting, NIMBYism.Until we liberalize zoning, legalize building, and reject the idea that houses have to be appreciating assets, the issue will continue.As it is often the case, politicians go for the headline with the highest electoral ROI, rather than tackle the real issues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a homeowner in Toronto and I don&#39;t think this will help. They&#39;ve eliminated a small number of buyers from the market but have added other incentives like a first home buyers tax credit that will only fuel the fire - Australia tried this with tragic results.&gt;&gt; working with provinces and territories to develop and implement a Home Buyers’ Bill of Rights and bring forward a national plan to end blind bidding.Blind bidding is where multiple parties submit a sealed bid on a property. The realtor and seller review these bids behind close doors and then often request subsequent rounds of bids from the bidders *without telling them the current winning bid, or who&#39;s bid is winning*. Bidders end up out-bidding themselves.IMHO blind bidding is an unethical practice that should be outlawed regardless of its impact on housing prices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A quick look at the data suggests only about 2% of properties in Toronto and Vancouver are owned by overseas investors. Yes, housing is priced at the margin, but this won&#39;t do anything at all to prices over the long term.I&#39;m sure this will be wildly popular politically, because people LOVE the idea that some foreign boogieman is the reason their children can&#39;t afford homes anymore.It&#39;s much easier to outsource your problems to some outside &#34;other&#34; then deal with the much harder task of introspection over the poor housing policy that you and your neighbors have voted for over the last 60 years.Like all cities in areas with heavy-handed zoning regulations, abuse of historic preservation clauses, and filibuster-style city council meetings blocking new construction...the issue is one of supply.It&#39;s the same problem in literally every developed country on earth right now. The industrious, forward-looking people who originally built the cities during the major growth phase died...and then their kids grew up believing that the way things ended up was somehow divinely ordained. Never to be changed or built upon again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting concept. However there are a few issues that surface quickly (this is all assuming a feed through scanner and not a flatbed).#1 - It rotates AND scales to fit. It&#39;s not obvious until you rotate a stupid amount, but pages don&#39;t shrink when scanned for real.#2 - The scanning rotation is way too uniform. Most scans twist a bit, typically near the top when more of the page is in the scanner to straighten it out.#3 - With #2 there should be some stretching/skewing that isn&#39;t uniform.#4 - The noise is way too uniform as well. It looks like static. Typical scanned documents have noise that is much more variable. You also get other scanning artifacts like streaks for dirt on the scan head.#5 - The page ends often aren&#39;t even and introduce artifacting as well.#6 - Needs an option for chewed up staple corner and/or holepunch."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ooh! I have a mockingbird in my yard that I can try this on! I counted 20 different songs the other night, and it was probably a lot more, I just stopped being able to distinguish. They can have a repertoire of over 200! I  was actually wondering if something like this project existed, or maybe just an app really, but then hadn&#39;t thought about it since (I&#39;m just an insomniac, not a bird watcher). Very cool.If you don&#39;t know about the North American mockingbird, they fly up to a high perch at night and claim a yard sized area of territory by reciting all the songs it knows, as loud as it can. Over and over again, until it is exhausted. The little psychos. Thus impressing all the lady mockingbirds in the area. Apparently they do a little dance as well, but given it&#39;s usually the middle of the night when this happens, I haven&#39;t seen it.They used to drive me nuts until I read up on them. Now I try to count how many songs they know."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"BirdNET and Pl@ntNet have to be my favorite uses of AI to date. A true use of technology for the greater good.I&#39;ve actually been thinking about automated bird recognition for a while now, I live underneath a flight corridor for migrating common cranes (near Berlin). I&#39;d love to be able to one day track their migration across the continent in real time using data from crowdsourced base stations.I wonder if migrating birds could be identified in flight using optical/radar/audio. If anybody else has had similar ideas I&#39;d really love to chat on this topic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It would be very cool to have network of these listening to calls while birds are migrating at night. With a large enough network you&#39;d get an amazing way to visualise large scale movements which are generally completely invisible. Wiring up the eastern seaboard around Massachusetts, southern Spain, the vast steppes around the Caspian Sea or pretty much anywhere else would be incredible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think there&#39;s a valid concern with this; a concern which is not necessarily distilled down to &#34;big brother&#34; or &#34;corporate overlords&#34;.Google is so large that any stance they take, no matter how minuscule, has immense influence.Case in point, from this article:
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/02/technology/google-maps-ne...&gt; For decades, the district south of downtown and alongside San Francisco Bay here was known as either Rincon Hill, South Beach or South of Market. This spring, it was suddenly rebranded on Google Maps to a name few had heard: the East Cut.&gt; The peculiar moniker immediately spread digitally, from hotel sites to dating apps to Uber, which all use Google’s map data. The name soon spilled over into the physical world, too. Real-estate listings beckoned prospective tenants to the East Cut. And news organizations referred to the vicinity by that term.My point is, it might seem like a small, inconspicuous change.  But at Google-scale, this actually has an impact on the real world, and personally I don&#39;t feel confident with Google deciding what words are the correct words."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s the announcement from Google: https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/03/more-assisti...You could think of it as Google wanting to police people, OR you could see it as Google seeing that a ton of people use Grammarly and clearly want this feature. (Remember, Google Docs is used for lots of formal docs. It&#39;s not a chat app or Twitter clone.)As it turns out, a lot of people choose to be inclusive and non-inflammatory."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t really know how I feel about this, the headline is a bit jarring but I guess it is from their own documentation.But without more than the one &#34;landlord&#34; example, it is hard to really get a feel for what this may be doing. That is a strange example though... I have never seen anyone complain about the word &#34;landlord&#34;.Regardless, I don&#39;t like the idea of Google or any company having the power to dictate what is socially acceptable or not in what should be a private document.Especially when important context will likely be missed.To add. I am gay, I have certain use cases for the related &#34;F&#34; word. I can almost guarantee it will complain about it... but using it is also my right. And some people find &#34;Queer&#34; offenses and some do not, I have seen some heavy debates about it in the community. I would not want Google to take a stance on that.Edit: I was curious to test this theory for myself. It looks like this is only in a workspace document and not google docs as a whole right now. So... maybe someone else can confirm what happens?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Me: 20 years in the defense space business. Stating my own opinion.This is basically right. The problem with space imagery is that almost everyone who wants it has a niche use case, and those few organizations without a niche use case (the US Weather Service, various militaries, etc) generally want imagery that&#39;s so specialized to their own problem that they have to spec, buy, and operate their own orbital assets.Take Ukraine as an example. Leaving aside the moral question of whether a satellite imagery company should be profiting off the Ukrainian war, Ukraine appears to be using commercial orbital imagery providers to figure out Russian troop movements. That use case is not one any commercial provider anywhere is going to build an ML model for. But analysts working on behalf of Ukraine can absolutely either use raw pixels or develop their own ML algorithms that run on top of the raw pixels to find Russian tanks.And almost every other potential user is similar. They&#39;re all looking for something different. Oil companies want to pre-screen drilling locations. NGOs want to look at deforestation in Brazil or methane leaks in Saudi Arabia. You could even go all the way down to individuals -- at the right price, individual farms might want to look at relative growth rates of corn in their fields, or soil moisture levels, etc. Or they might want to count heads of cattle or sheep, or... or... or.The point being, outside of weather, which we already know how to get to end users without having them subscribe to an orbital imagery provider service, every customer is different, and what they want from the pixels is different. It&#39;s basically the long-tail problem. In order to be profitable you have to fill an enormous number of niche use cases."</p>

The juice is never worth the squeeze.¹ Count cars. Count airplanes. Count ships. Segment land cover. Track oil inventories. Estimate biofuels. Measure water levels. Etc. Etc. Etc.I see that he outlined a few exceptions at the footnote… I&#39;ll also add Plaid. I think this guy is making some huge generalizations that don&#39;t hold up beyond his industry.But that said, I recently downgraded two potential startups based on data feeds to personal projects because I realized that nobody really pays for data, and if there is any value then the providers will figure that out inevitably…Another recent example: I&#39;ve been using Deliveries for Mac and iOS for over fifteen years, a very simple, perfectly-designed, laser focused app. Both Amazon (not surprising) and Fed Ex (quite surprising) have decided that freely providing delivery dates to consumers is too valuable to leave to third parties, so the beloved app is shuttering sometime this year.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was an agronomist I used satellite imagery a lot for monitoring farm crops for our customers.  Started in the early eighties going up in a Cessna laying on my belly where the passenger seat was sticking a 35mm camera out a repair port.But that got old and started researching satellite options.  Problems was our company entire sales area was three West Michigan counties.  All the companies wanted to sell me, I forget the term but say a tract (scene?), that was half the state.I didn&#39;t have a problem with the price per acre but wanted to buy by the section or 640 acres.  It didn&#39;t make a lot of sense to buy the township but they wouldn&#39;t even sell me by the county.  At the time probably 5% of my customers wanted this service and only wanted to buy just part of their acreage.I asked all these vendors why they couldn&#39;t sell me by the township.  They routinely answered they&#39;d lose money because they couldn&#39;t sell the rest of the tract.  I said now you understand my problem, at a certain point you&#39;ve got to break up a tract or give up on the market.  Most of the company&#39;s ended up leaving ag.I eventually found a company that would sell by the section at a higher but still manageable price.  Course then I discovered that in four flyovers a season the majority had clouds over the field and you couldn&#39;t see anything ;&lt;(.  Such is the pain of being an early user in any field.FYI The military has satellites using radar to see through the clouds, but in thirty years that tech hasn&#39;t made it to the commercial operators.The answer I think is automated drones that fly a circuit.  The tech has been available for a few years but the government won&#39;t approve it for that use.  In fact the FAA won&#39;t even let a Detroit company demonstrate they could successfully evade objects, they ran out of funding and shut their doors ;&lt;(."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting, the separate compute and storage tiers is another system going that direction which I think is becoming almost the standard at this point, especially for &#34;cloud-native&#34; things designed to run on k8s. From what I can tell (it isn&#39;t very explicit on this point) they are avoiding a distributed consensus at the storage layer and instead relying on a single writer/multiple reader model with the single writer being enforced by assignment of the tablets in the compute tier, with the tablet being responsible for writing to multiple storage nodes for durability? (But I might be wrong)Assuming yes this approach, I think, is under utilized and is pretty similar to how Apache Pulsar works (my day job),but I am not sure how many distributed RDBMS have tried it out, will be cool to see how it evolves! It isn&#39;t clear how they ensure the assignment of a tablet to only a single compute node, but I think that is an easier problem relative to distributed consensus at the storage tier."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seems random developers were targeted as well as European Parliament members (and more):&gt; Jordi Baylina is the technology lead at Polygon, a popular decentralised Ethereum scaling platform. He is also an advisor on projects related to digital voting and decentralisation, and has built a widely-used privacy toolkit. He was extensively targeted with Pegasus, receiving at least 26 infection attempts. Ultimately, he was infected at least eight times between October 2019 and July 2020.&gt; Baylina received a text message masquerading as a boarding pass link for a Swiss International Air Lines flight he had purchased. Targeting in this case indicates that the Pegasus operator may have had access to Baylina’s Passenger Name Record (PNR) or other information collected from the carrier.Scare stuff that not just random text messages can infect you (we knew this) but combined with harvesting other data (like PNR), they can time to exploit messages with other actions you do (like buying an flight ticket) and get you that way.I was scared of receiving random text messages already, but easy to just ignore them as they have nothing to do with me. But if I buy a flight ticket and receive a text message that looks relevant to me, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d be able to guess it was actually malicious. Scary stuff.Edit: The more I read, the worse it gets:&gt; Another common mode of targeting was to masquerade as official notifications from Spanish government entities, including the Tax and Social Security authorities.The messages also used SMS Sender IDs to masquerade as official agency accounts.&gt; Notably, fake official messages were sometimes highly personalized. For example, a message sent to Jordi Baylina included a portion of his actual official tax identification number, suggesting that the Pegasus operator had access to this information.Seems clear at this point that the official Spanish government was behind these attacks, or the official registries got hacked (together with various delivery companies). Both are bad, but that signs are pointing to the earlier makes it even worse.It seems that the Spanish government can&#39;t help itself to give more fuel to the fire that is the fight for Catalan independence. Who&#39;d want to belong to a state that constantly suppresses and surveillance you?"</p>

Are there guidelines?For example, if I am Microsoft CEO, would it be okay if I use the closed source iPhone from a competing company? Or perhaps these people use special hardened devices?Because even Apple CEO uses iPhone, and Pegasus apparently could hack any iPhone with zero click. So what prevents acquisition of highly valuable inside information by NSO or its customers (sensitive data about the company, iOS source code, implanting malware by infecting Apple engineers for the next exploit, etc)?"</p>
