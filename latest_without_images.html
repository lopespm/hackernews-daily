Many days, it&#39;s the first thing I open in the morning and/or the last at night, and I sure am thankful that amid the firestorm of superficial engagement maximization platforms, there&#39;s at least one site that consistently leaves me feeling more informed, enlightened, and rational. Happy Holidays, HN!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The greatest gift to my technological knowledge has been HN. The vast treasure trove of tips, tricks, tidbits, guidance, and wonder I have been given is a great thing. Though the World Wide Web has gone cold and misty in many ways, there are still many Santas riding through HN, coming down my chimney, and delivering me shiny wisdom every morning. Cheers to you all!!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’d just like to take a moment to say how much I appreciate HN and all the work put in by dang and the moderation team. Everyone here really cares about keeping discussions lively and respectful. This is a wonderful community to be a part of!Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays everyone!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I would really say that &#34;running your own email&#34; is a set of things that can be done independently:- Getting your own domain and using a provider such as fastmail or proton is a first step that gives you lots of security fom arbitrary. Because you own the doorstep, you can change provider without having to inform all your contacts of the move. You&#39;re also more secure from unilateral moves from your provider.-Hosting your own mail server means that you are responsible for the persistence of your mail. It&#39;s a nice artisanal thing to do, and you may be satisfied to know that no one is reading your mail.-Sending your mail yourself is the real hard part, because you need a stable IP that is accepted as a legitimate mail sender. Moreover, you need to monitor this property in the long term. Every mail server has their own way to choose who is a legitimate mail sender, and it&#39;s an ongoing pain to check that.You&#39;re not forced to go all the way, you can simply pick a domain to secure the frontdoor, or you can host your mail server without sending mail by yourself, etc. You can also self-host, and change your mind later without much impact.I personally would incite everyone to do at least #1 for safety reasons, #2 if you want to fiddle with the system to know how it works, and to avoid #3."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing running your own SMTP/IMAP protects you from is faceless lockouts. My partner was locked out of her Hotmail account and no matter how much evidence she provided Microsoft&#39;s shame-faced automated system refused to give her access. No court of appeal, nothing. Turns out she has an important email regarding her Indefinite Leave to Remain in the account containing a UAN she now needs access to in order to apply for a Biometric Residence Card to ensure she can continue to work in the UK. Fuck big email providers, I say. Legislation needs to be passed to make them accountable when locking-out users from their accounts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Someone should try &#34;artisanal email server&#34; using cloudron or yunohost !
the bigger problem is that &#34;authoritative&#34; email monopolies such as Gmail, 365 and the other big ones arbitrarily define and impose what is a legit email server or not and even with better score than gmail an &#34;artisanal&#34; email server can suffer from being classified into spam by the big tech players just because they can and will do anything to maintain their monopoly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"HTML and CSS alone are really powerful. I decided not to use any JS on my personal site, but you can still have:+ collapsible sections with `details` and `summary`[0]+ footnotes, with navigation to/from with anchor tags. You can even apply CSS on the currently selected footnote.[1]+ Semantic web that is compatible with everything and has sensible defaults so you can focus on what you&#39;re actually doing!+ Tiny deploys and page loads. Single KBs (with brotli compression) for long blog posts. Just `scp` and Nginx keeps serving.I can&#39;t think of anything else I want. And when I think of it, I can probably build it on top.[0]: https://maddo.xxx[1]: https://maddo.xxx/thoughts/an-introduction-to-product-strate..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is something I&#39;ve always wanted for virtual textbooks. A single .html file with all the JS, CSS, images as inline data blobs, etc. For most physics, math, CS, etc books, this should be possible. It would make it trivial to download the book for offline use and share it with others. Other than the raster images, the entire content of these types of books would probably fit in a couple MB of text. The use of #anchors or other smart URL manipulation would also make it easy to share internal hyperlinks if you want to tell a friend to look at chapter/section #foo_bar of the book."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well, TiddlyWiki[1] has been going it for 17(!) years. It&#39;s a very mature, polished, and extensible engine for wikis, blogs, and personal knwledge bases.The entire thing (including the editor!) is a single .html file. By default, even images are embedded.For my ADHD Wiki[2], a resource that talks about ADHD with a copious amounts of relatable memes intertwined with the text, I chose to just use images in the same directory instead of embedding them; so you might need to do some work to download that page (I think File -&gt; Save as.. can give you a readable static version on some browsers).Anyway, somewhat surprising that people are stumbling into how much you can do with just one well-crafted .html file. Look ma, no node.js, no (no)SQL database, no nothing except for one file for one website (and that file isn&#39;t even that large, given what TiddlyWiki allows you to do).TiddlyWiki can be run on node.js, but I don&#39;t see much reason to. If I want to make changes, I use the built-in editor, and then the &#34;Save...&#34; button generates me the .html of the updated version. Save it over the old one, upload over ftp, done. No deployment process to speak of.And, at that, the feature set rivals (and, at times, exceeds) that of, say, Wikipedia.(And for math nerds: it supports LaTeX via a KaTeX plugin. Maybe you can&#39;t copy-paste your entire thesis, but it&#39;s pretty damn close to real-time full-featured LaTeX).[1]https://tiddlywiki.com/[2]https://romankogan.net/adhd"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"“How to change your mind” by Michael Pollen.I read a lot of books, and this is one that caused a change in my life. The succinct summary is that psychedelics are misunderstood and there is more and more research showing their potential, especially in the treatment of trauma.I had a difficult childhood. It’s something I still struggle with personal interactions because of this, even after years of therapy. After reading Michael Pollen’s book I thought this might be something that could move the needle on my day-to-day quality of life.I found a shaman and did an 8 hour blindfolded mushroom trip. Similar to what’s outlined in the book. Previously I’ve never done anything more than weed occasionally.It had a profound impact on me. The way I describe it is like jumping off a diving board into a deep dark pool, and the pool is you. Then spending hours there.I don’t know if I’d do it again but I learnt a lot about myself. I won’t proselytize here either, because the research is still early. There’s also risk because you put a lot of trust in someone who’s there with you while you’re high. But I do recommend at least reading the book."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Dispossessed, by Ursula K. Le Guin.It identified so many of the &#34;edges&#34; of society and how I think about and interact with the world, on a daily basis.Without a doubt one of the best books I&#39;ve ever read. Maybe even the best.The only other book that came close this year was Robert Sapolsky&#39;s A Primate&#39;s Memoir."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I haven’t finished this yet (only at the start of chapter 6) but The Scientist and Engineer’s Guide to Digital Signal Processing [0] has been excellent so far. DSP is one of the subjects I’ve wanted to learn for years but could never get my head around, mostly (I think) due to bad instructors and very math-heavy explanations. This book is finally demystifying it for me, with explanations that go for intuition over mathematical purity.The book is even freely available on the author’s site! I wish I’d found this years ago.0: https://dspguide.com"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Charlatans begone.  2x is a fashion statement and Ive been learning at a much faster rate for quite some time.The real answer to speed learning, is to watch the video at 200x, in a concrete room buried ten meters deep, with your nose pressed pensively to a 50&#34; flatscreen surrounded by a frigid black ocean of PA speakers and amplifiers.  Ive found that in five to seven hours, Ive fully comprehended the video as it &#34;repeats twice&#34;, ad infinitum.now, the volume is critical as it is not to concede 110db at any time.  this promotes learning at 200x the volume of the original video.  At the end of your learning session it is important to remain unclothed, as this promotes the knowledge to absorb into your body fastest whilst the room leaves you in inscrutable darkness, to succor a distant memory of the learning materials interdisciplinary themes and objectives.Once youve climbed from the pit --and washed the learning jelly from yourself--  then you will have attained full and complete knowledge of how to properly tie a tie, or water a houseplant, or whatever you should need to learn.  The pit will remain there for you should you ever dare to utter another question in wonderment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m a bit puzzled by the recurring apparition of articles about learning faster on HN.I don’t think I have suffered from the speed at which material covers a subject since I left school. Finding interesting material, properly structured with a good balance of introductory and in depth coverage and giving solid insight into a topic remains challenging — it already was when I was a student to be fair. Good teaching ressources are the exception rather than the norm. Finding the time to properly conceptualise and deeply think about what I’m trying to learn has been challenging. But the speed at which I can consume teaching material is not something I remember being bothered by this past decade. Thinking about it more often than not I wish I could actually go slower rather than faster.I’m curious about how the experience of others commenters differ here as it’s obviously a topic of interest to some in this community."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"(Note: full study PDF is on researchgate)I would take this with a giant grain of salt:1.)  N is in the hundreds of students, all with similar backgrounds - likely a highly specific population.  It may not generalize well.2.)  The videos were pretty short: 3-15 minutes long.3.)  The overall effect size is pretty miniscule - it would make little practical difference.4.)  The video topics were roman history and real estate appraisals.It will be interesting to see if this generalizes (to longer durations, more technical topics, more diverse population, etc.), but given the above I wouldn&#39;t change any personal habits based on this study."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What I find most amazing about it is that this has been about a decade in the making - Valve started their Linux compatibility initiative back when Microsoft threatened to hurt Steam with Windows 8 and Microsoft Store requirements.How dedicated they are to this effort is impressive - they first failed big with the Steam Machines when support was very half baked, but now they&#39;ll try again with the Deck just as compatibility is coming along much better.I guess Linux gamers can largely thank Microsoft for this one!As a Mac user I&#39;m a bit disappointed they stopped their efforts on that front, since the new processors are quite capable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Starting at Win7 the telemetry and invasive advertising ramped up to the point where I don&#39;t feel I can customize the Desktop to what I want without heavy tweaking.And if that amount of tweaking is necessary why not go Linux instead.So got rid of my Win10 install, went with KDE Neon+Steam. And now I wonder what took me so long.I haven&#39;t tested my entire Steam library yet but my top 10 games run perfectly, some times with some changes to the Proton version but beyond that even workshop mods are available.I am seriously impressed and can&#39;t imagine myself going back at all.If only Adobe would release their software in Linux, then, I could ditch MacOS too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My daily driver is Ubuntu 20.04, and I stopped dual booting with Windows back in December 2019, which up to that point had been the way I did all of my gaming.I haven&#39;t looked back since.Sure, there have been some games that haven&#39;t worked. Some of those just needed some tweaking, and for some I just waited a bit until Proton caught up. For the rest that still don&#39;t work, I am content with just shelving until such time that they work.I have been consistently surprised at what games actually work through Proton. For instance I played Titanfall 2 &amp; Battlefield 1 without any issues this year. On Linux.I probably spend around 200$ each year on video games, and this initiative by Valve will be the sole reason I will continue to do so (and not having to run a Windows instance in my home)."</p>

White officers, some city officials, and many white residents see the Black union as unnecessary, a stubborn refusal to move beyond the city’s ugly racial history. Black officers said that sentiment reveals a misunderstanding of why the union exists: It isn’t to win special rights for Black officers, they said. It’s to demand they be treated equally.&#34;This passage should have been earlier in the report. Before, the report emanated a stench of trying too hard to find racism behind every rock.Instead, the reporter later describes a story of a bureaucractic racket - primarily driven by state powers and labor, to promote corruption &amp; nepotism, which has disproportionately impacted black officers."</p>
