								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good for him.These companies touting their solutions for creating a more connected world can&#39;t have it both ways. Apple was able to ship the M1 and roll out new iterations of many other offerings since the pandemic hit. They&#39;re just fine.Apple didn&#39;t collapse since the pandemic hit, and the flexibility offered by remote work is far more valuable to lots of people than the loss of in-person collaboration opportunities. We deserve to have input into how we work best and if that means walking away from companies run by egomaniacs that need to see butts in seats, then so be it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know about Apple, but I do have a ton of experience consulting for multiple F500&#39;s. Many at these companies who want people to come back to work are just middle managers who find it harder to justify their jobs since remote work has become so prevalent. They simply can&#39;t grasp how work can get done without them telling people what to do. And of course the easiest way to do that without requiring much thought is to see their underlings in person."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m trying to hire for a position right now and it has dragged on for months for two reasons:1) WFH is now limited to 1 day per week, and a 3 month probationary period where new hires don&#39;t even get that.2) Salary. It&#39;s still a job seeker&#39;s market and my workplace is not keeping pace. It&#39;s spec&#39;ed for 3 years of experience but salary is about the median for a new graduate w/o professional experience. I&#39;m happy to train someone but if I rework the job class to allow for new grads then HR will lower the starting salary. So, I&#39;m hoping to find someone who&#39;s a new grad but had a part time job or internship or any other non-coursework experience the could be even the least bit argued as adding up to the required experience. (the position is basically a data wrangler / sql jockey / light analysis position, but it directly supports the main revenue-generating operations of the organization so there is real $$$ lost by having this position empty. ::Grrrrr:: end rant.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I appreciate the writing style, but this article is shockingly naive to me.Convenient consumer products tend to sell better than less convenient ones, even if the product is worse. That&#39;s the entire story. People have finite time, so when they receive more income they will tend to spend it to reduce the time they spend doing things that they don&#39;t care about.I for one hate spending time doing all the things that the products in the article make more convenient, and happily pay more so I can spend my time on other things.  * I don&#39;t like shaving, so I optimize for razors that get the job done faster (more blades, easier to swap a new blade)
  * I don&#39;t like cleaning pans, so I buy pans I can clean faster and don&#39;t have to &#34;season&#34;
  * I don&#39;t like filling bags with tea, so I buy tea bags that are pre-filled
  * (nespresso) I actually enjoy the ritual of making espresso, so I use a real espresso machine
  * I bike every day to and from work, so I take it a step further and buy an E-bike with no shifter
  * I don&#39;t want to fiddle with chromecast or fire stick, so I just use my TV&#39;s built in smart features
  * (inner city shops don&#39;t sell individual pieces of fruit) I live in SF, it&#39;s very easy to find individual fruits here
  * I don&#39;t like going to grocery stores, so I pay to have groceries delivered to me

My time is precious to me, so instead of spending money on luxury items I spend money to save time. Evidently so do most other people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I believe that many things stated in this post are correct, this still has that hard &#39;old man yelling at the internet&#39; odor.If you are to compare stuff, stuff like modern razor cartridges and double-edged razors, you ought to mention the convenience side of the things. I hate being the devil&#39;s advocate, but shaving with 4-blade cartridge designed for easy shaving is still &#39;miles&#39; ahead compared to shaving with double-edged razor. Miiiles ahead. And I use a double-edged razor 9 out of 10 times, so I would know a thing or two about it.And that&#39;s not to say that are overly pricey. They are. Plus, if you account for different prices in different regions, the price difference is even more concerning.The same is also true for some other appliances/services mentioned - tea bags and coffee machines are not just &#39;superficially convenient&#39; they are wildly more convenient.EDIT: As one person said in the comments down below, &#34;What this article completely misses, is that there are more than two options.&#34;. That was my whole point, and I&#39;m sorry if it came out the wrong way. Shaving is a personal preference, and you are free to do it however you like; but saying &#39;Shaving is too expensive and is a demonstrative example of how most consumer products are designed to extract more money from you rather than to improve your life, or the world, or to be in any way remotely good.&#39; is just incorrect and insane."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Other examples of products that seem to exhibit a similar trend, where purported convenience leads to higher prices&gt;Cooking equipment: essentially indestructible Cast Iron skillets transition into teflon pans. The newer pans perform worse, and must be replaced on a shockingly regular basis. They also seem to be poisonous.They have their uses. I wouldn&#39;t try frying eggs in a cast iron, for instance (technically you can, but it requires an absurd amount of oil). Also, claiming that they &#34;seem to be poisonous&#34; without any qualifiers is a little misleading. To my knowledge they&#39;re only poisonous during manufacturing (ie. the precursor chemicals) and when they get too hot.&gt;Nespresso machines, and other coffee pod brands, replace many styles of coffee brewing. Provide much worse coffee, at a higher price but are superficially convenient.Why are they only superficially convenient? They seem pretty convenient to me.&gt;Televisions moving from being screens which accept input, to self contained &#39;smart&#39; devices that require software updates and thus have a shortened useful lifespan.I thought it was the other way around? ie. smart TVs are cheaper than dumb TVs because they&#39;re subsidized by ad revenue. Also, the claim itself doesn&#39;t really make any sense. Even if you stop getting software updates, that doesn&#39;t prevent you from using it as a dumb display."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was at Bell during the options “debate.” I think something that this otherwise wonderful article misses is that some believed that commands were never intended to be the only way to use the system as the shell was intended to be just one of the many user interfaces that Research Unix would provide. From that perspective, it was entirely reasonable to believe that if a command was so complex that it needed options than it was likely more appropriate for one of the other user interfaces. I believe this is unfortunately now understood by some as it shouldn’t exist. However, because of the seemingly instantaneous popularity of the shell and pipelining text it became synonymous with Unix. It’s a shame because McIlroy had a lot of interesting ideas around pipelining audio and graphics that, as far as I know, never materialized."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unix history is always fascinating.&gt;None of this explains dd.This one really made me think. I have never thought about dd before. Although I have wondered about other commands. Perhaps the author should also have added some command options not requiring a minus prefix, e.g. tar, ps.The manpage [0] reads:In the first (legacy) form, all option flags except for -C and -I must be contained within the first argument to tar and must not be prefixed by a hyphen (`-&#39;). Option arguments, if any, are processed as subsequent      arguments to tar and are processed in the order in which their corresponding option flags have been presented on the command line.
In the second and preferred form, option flags may be given in any order and are immediately followed by their corresponding option argument values.[0]: http://man.openbsd.org/tar"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I believe the oldest program that uses subcommand is the version control system SCCS, from 1972IIUC, other non-Unix operating systems commonly used the subcommand style for normal interactive use; it was the style used by the normal command shell, and all commands in those operating systems therefore followed this style.  The operating system (or its shell) was responsible for enabling easy use of this style by adding completion support (commonly using the ESC key, IIRC).  This older style can still today be seen in Unix tools like ftp and telnet, which uses this style for its internal command line interface.  Another tool using this style, which many might be familiar with, is the multi-platform Kermit.Unix therefore has been rather late in adopting this style, first in gradually adopting tools which uses the subcommand style (ip, git, etc.), and later with support in shells for programmable completion support where a program can optionally register completion hooks for the user shell to use, making it finally come up to the level of those older operating systems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some of the entries seem incorrect: &#34;USB 3.2 (USB 3.2 Gen 2x2) and &#34;USB 4&#34; (USB 4 USB4 Gen 2×2) should have the same nominal data rate of 2500MB/s, they&#39;re 2 lanes (x2) of 10GB/s. Though they are apparently coded differently electrically, so they&#39;re distinct protocols.The tables would benefit from mentioning the coding (8/10 or 128/132) as IMO it&#39;s one of the most confusing bits when you see the effective data rates:* USB 3.2 Gen 1x2 has a nominal data rate of 10G (2 lanes at 5G) with a raw throughput of 1GB/s (effective data rates topping out around 900MB/s)* USB 3.2 Gen 2x1 has the same nominal data rate of 10G (1 lane at 10G) but a raw throughput of 1.2GB/s (and effective data rates topping out around 1.1GB/s)The difference is that Gen 1x uses the &#34;legacy&#34; 8/10 encoding, while Gen 2x uses the newer 128/132 encoding, and thus has a much lower overhead (around 3%, versus 20)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The problem that GraphQL was trying to resolve is real: reasonably-sized REST projects usually ended up inventing their own awkward, ad-hoc mini query languages on top of REST.But GraphQL as a solution is not great. It looks nice in the first place, but there is too much hassle to deal with.P.S. I&#39;ve seen quite a fraction of GraphQL projects actually using Node.js as the backend. If that&#39;s the case I would recommend TRPC[0] over GraphQL - it&#39;s more seamless and straightforward.[0] https://trpc.io/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my relatively naive opinion, graphql exists to solve a few things (which are mostly benefits for large scale companies):1. Reduce the total number of HTTP connections required to get the data for a specific component or page. Imo this is presumably less important with http3 but the driving force is probably similar for both.2. Give backend-for-frontend style services more autonomy to provide an interface that works for a specific feature on the front end without coupling it to specifics of how the backend organizes resources3. Allow performance issues with frontend query logic to be addressed without changing anything on the front endI think the situations where it would be useful are large teams that want to operate more independently where the overhead of dealing with graphql is worth it.An example being someone trying to render a component for a list of comments. It would be great if the front end could just write some &#34;magic&#34; query that gives them everything they want and they don&#39;t have to worry about batching requests to specific endpoints and the order in which they should make those requests. That doesn&#39;t mean the problem magically goes away, but it&#39;s now someone else&#39;s problem and that&#39;s good: the app development can free itself from things it shouldn&#39;t care about."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve used GraphQL on several projects now, with small teams (2-5 devs) where we control the front and back end, and for that case, it&#39;s actually been really good. It provides a solid contract that is easy to get wrong with a REST API. (Will the server send IDs as ints or strings? Will it accept either? Which params are optional? What shape does the data come back in, an array of results, or an objects with results nested somewhere? etc.) I&#39;ve even setup CI to fail if it finds queries on the front-end that don&#39;t match the schema. And of course it&#39;s easy to request exactly the data you want on the front -end.A big downside is that the tooling is immature, and all subject to big changes. And I haven&#39;t written a server meant for public consumption, but that does add new layers that you can kind of ignore when you trust the client."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love this move by Shopify.  As a merchant (in Canada, where typical shipping prices are extortionate) I&#39;d love to give Shopify more money (but presumably less than we pay 3rd party shippers) for better overall delivery service for my customers.As a buyer, I&#39;d love to spend more with not-Amazon and get comparable service.I&#39;m increasingly disappointed with Amazon. It&#39;s full of knockoff crappy products with unrelated 5 star reviews.  That eroding trust in Amazon is pushing me to smaller brands who have a face and stand behind their product for key purchases.  This move by Shopify will just accelerate that transition away from Amazon.Just waiting for the search bar to shop every Shopify store so I have a viable alternative to Amazon to buy whatever I need."</p>

Shopify has a real opportunity to fill that void.Amazon was known for maintaining high quality of their catalogue. But since opening up their store front for third party sellers it’s resembling flee market by the day. For example they had a very strict policy of one product one page I.e Single Detail Page (SDP), indexed by ASIN. But now exact same product has multiple ASINs. You don’t know if it’s a fake or genuine."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s convenient that GitHub Markdown supports graphs natively, and I&#39;ve used Mermaid there successfully. However, I was fairly disappointed with Mermaid itself; I found the syntax irregular and non-intuitive (the syntax for every different graph type feels like it was designed by different people working independently), the documentation was sparse (though it exists at all, so I&#39;ll give it points for that), and worst of all the error messages were atrociously cryptic and entirely unhelpful.That said, I also found the default styling and layout of the generated graphs to be far more attractive than Graphviz/dot, though I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s attributable to Mermaid or GitHub.Which is to say, altogether probably a step forward, but still lots of room for improvement. Please, start with the error messages!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good thought.My immediate response is &#34;yeah, I really didn&#39;t get the games other people were playing in junior high,&#34; which is the time frame the article evokes for me.I feel like the gotcha is you have to realize - at least sometimes - that there are still games you don&#39;t get. It&#39;s easy to feel like, &#34;at ${year - 1} I was such an idiot, glad that&#39;s over now.&#34; You&#39;d be surprised how many years in a row you can feel that way before the meta realization sinks in.Understanding other people is like learning to play &#34;Have You Got It Yet?&#34;[1]:&gt; When Pink Floyd gathered in January 1968 for one of their first rehearsals as a quintet, Barrett shared a new composition he called “Have You Got It Yet?” The song sounded straightforward, but the band became confused as they tried to join in and learn the number. The melody and structure seemed to shift on each run-through, with Barrett gleefully singing a chorus of “Have you got it yet? Have you got it yet?” at them.&gt; Eventually they realized that Barrett was changing the arrangement each time, deliberately making the song impossible to learn. “We didn’t get it for quite a long time,” says Gilmour in Rob Chapman’s book A Very Irregular Head. “I remember the moment and the song well.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Science and technology and other nerdy pursuits can be really valuable, and certainly don’t require you to be judgmental of others.The problem, as I’ve seen it is that people who are bad at some of the other ‘games’ that make a meaningful life lean too heavily on  science and technology as a coping mechanism. That coping mechanism could be many things: nerdy pursuits, alcohol, video games, etc.Whatever your pursuit, if you’re being judgmental of most other people, then you’re probably missing something big and should take some time to reflect on what that is for you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There was a comment on HN about a year ago by somebody that grew up in India, and being Pakistani i relate to it a lot as well.Specifically, it mentioned that these &#39;games&#39; and people choosing one or two games out of a great number of games available out there seems like a uniquely North American thing (as far as we can tell from our own limited exposure to other societies).So while you folks had the jock, the nerd, the artist etc. , we had schools, teachers and parents that taught us we should strive to excel at everything, i.e. play every game and try to play it well.Its a little disappointing to be put into a bucket by North American folks because they assume everyone is good at just one or two games. Not trying to be disrespectful, but i personally also think a little less of people that take so long to come to the realization that the author did in the article. A little ironic, if you think about it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great technical article as always, and apologies for not responding to the meat of the article, but I tend to look at declarative UI with some degree of skepticism. Raph, do you think this general approach can eventually be scaled up to develop complex and highly interactive applications such as DAWs, video editors, and graphic design software? At least based on my experience with SwiftUI, I find the paradigm easy and satisfying to get started with, and great for prototyping and widgets, but quickly run into roadblocks whenever trying to build creative software that&#39;s not just a view around a database. Or do you see this as just another tool in the UI toolbox, and not necessarily mutually exclusive with imperative and immediate mode UI? Curious to hear your thoughts!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really cool work. My impression after reading the article is that it’s significantly inspired by SwiftUI, but without the magic annotations (@State, @Binding, @EnvironmentObject, @StateObject, etc.). It will be interesting to see how Rust handles the fully-statically-typed view tree, which has been really pushing the limits of the Swift compiler.Question for the author: perhaps I missed it, but how do you plan to handle view trees that change based on state (ie SwiftUI’s IfElseView + viewbuilder)?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the answer to this is no, but I&#39;ll ask anyway.Is there any concern with the allocation for the view/widget tree every cycle? I know it&#39;s retained mode so the most important resources (graphics) are cached between cycles, but I&#39;m wondering if the trees ought to be allocated out of arenas or something so that the allocating/freeing every cycle isn&#39;t undue performance penalty.(I&#39;m not sure what existing regained frameworks do.)"</p>
