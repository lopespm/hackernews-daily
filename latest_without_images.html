								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a good essay.It&#39;s interesting to contrast it with some of the psychological/self-help literature around being your &#34;true self&#34;, where the true self is fluid and amorphous and avoids being rigidly defined.  Or with Drew Houston&#39;s commmencement address [1] - &#34;That little voice in my head was telling me where to go, and the whole time I was telling it to shut up so I could get back to work. Sometimes that little voice knows best.&#34;  Or Steve Jobs [2] - &#34;Again, you can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. 
 So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.&#34;Don&#39;t ignore your emotions, particularly the niggling feelings that make you do things that seem to have no purpose in your grand plans but nevertheless draw you along.  Don&#39;t ignore reality either - that&#39;d be putting art galleries online - but oftentimes our subconscious has a better grip on reality than we give it credit for.[1] https://news.mit.edu/2013/drew-houstons-commencement-address[2] https://singjupost.com/full-transcript-steve-jobs-stay-hungr..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; during the first year of grad school I realized that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax.I had a similar realization during grad school about a lot of the popular topics at the time (early 2000s). I even used to call them &#34;the hoaxes of computer science&#34;. Things like grid computing or formal methods of software engineering had a lot of resources behind them, but nobody was able to use the results. Instead, very different formats of these ideas are what took root: cloud computing and advanced type systems.&gt; the low end eats the high end: that it&#39;s good to be the &#34;entry level&#34; option, even though that will be less prestigious, because if you&#39;re not, someone else will be, and will squash you against the ceiling.I wish every grad student had been forced to memorize this statement. Build something useable, not clever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This comment really resonated with me, I found myself in this exact situation at 25, in a &#34;very prestigious and selective place&#34; for AI nonetheless. It took me a couple years to realize the smart people are just playing the game, the unsuspecting losers are &#34;playing it straight&#34; and getting endlessly frustrated. I found my balance by, frankly, taking advantage of a system that is FUBAR. Incidentally, I also took some art classes and because they were not for credit, I just flowed and drew ( https://lingxiaolingdotus.firebaseapp.com/art ). Tbh I felt more alive placing some hasty marks on paper than I ever did doing &#34;research&#34; in a lab.&#34;I&#39;m only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns. Here I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in the hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again about to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine, but they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the students wouldn&#39;t require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn&#39;t require the students to learn anything.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I did an internship with a very profitable Swedish mobile game before the pandemic, and it was really interesting to see the doublethink: everyone knew we were making a drug, but people avoided speaking of it in that way. It was always &#34;our most engaged players readily spend on in-game items&#34;, and never &#34;the most addicted users spend money so they can continue playing&#34;It was a great workplace, but I don&#39;t think it was adding much value to the world."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d add that algorithmic feeds are another part of the triad (quartet?), and probably the worst offender. Personalized addictive content is on the rise (tiktok, YouTube, even Facebook and Twitter curate your newsfeed &#34;for you&#34; ), and these ml-determined feeds drive engagement to the highest possible levels, leading to an incredible waste of time, a distorted world view (mostly the posts with the highest engagement will be those that call for outrage, which leads to radicalization [1]), and just in general a society where our information consumption is determined by black boxes with opaque goals that do not optimize for the common good.I attribute a significant part of the political rift and radicalization that has occurred in the western world in the past few years to specifically this feature, the algorithmically determined, engagement maximizing, feed.[1] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00550-7"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I still haven&#39;t fully grasped that we reached this point of perversiveness online. We have brilliant minds and a ridiculous amount of money working on making Alabama&#39;s soccer moms click more ads, and we have reached the point of making people addicted to websites to reach that goal.Obviously this is nothing new, and the cigarette industry has been profitting off addiction for decades, but I never expected the same thing (except the very immediate threat of lung cancer) to happen to tools that could have been optimized for so much good instead.And the worst part is that some of it is just so incompetent. I&#39;ve been trying to break away from Facebook for a while, and recently (the past year or so) I started realizing that my Facebook feed always shows me the exact same posts in the exact same order for days, to the point where I know exactly what post will be first when I open the website. Where is all the Facebook money going? What are these people working on? What are they doing?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Amazon has a problem with fake reviews and it seems they are ok with it.I bought a replacement screen from Amazon and it wasn’t working properly. I thought I did something wrong so I contacted the seller/manufacturer and they told: oh yeah, it‘s defective, we‘ll just give you your money back. I agreed and then the person said „cool, now in order to process your request, please click these buttons on Amazon” and they sent me a screenshot showing how to leave a 5 star review. wtf.I refused and asked them to process the refund. First they said they can’t process the refund technically without me pressing those buttons and then that their job depends on it.I requested a refund through Amazon and tried leaving a 1-star review saying that the product was defective and the seller tried to condition me into giving them a 5 star review. This review was not accepted by Amazon, saying that seller feedback should be given on the seller page.  This does make sense if you have multiple sellers selling the same product, but it was not the case here. These guys were the only ones producing and selling it and if the score of 5-star reviews is from people being coerced to leave a review, then it should be there, not on the seller page where it’s very easily buried.In the end I also contacted Amazon support with screenshots and I had to explain the problem 3 times as the customer representative said they didn’t understand what more can they do since I already received my refund. I’m the end, they said “they forwarded the message to the proper department, have a nice day”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazon loves fake reviews as long as they are 5 star. The more it looks like people buying stuff using amazon are happy, the better that marketing is for Amazon. Look at all these people who are so happy to be buying stuff on Amazon, so much better than the alternatives.Amazon could clean this up and then watch the average drop. From the removal of the fake fives but also it makes it look more &#34;socially accpetable&#34; to leave 4 and 3 star reviews. So it costs Amazon to do the right thing by the people parting with money for stuff so they don&#39;t.Amazon are well aware of /their/ incentives and when their incentives align with what looks to me a lot like fraud they&#39;ll play the plausibly deny game.Or perhaps I&#39;m wrong they don&#39;t know and there&#39;s nothing they can do. Amazon employees will probably confirm that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like the fake reviews are merely the tip of the iceberg.Over the last 5-10 years, Amazon&#39;s main shopping website seems to have gone from a reasonably reputable location to an internet cesspool to rival ebay or craigslist.For example, looking for an item one is presented with a wide variety of almost identical products from a wide variety of almost identical, completely unknown brands, with no trust or confidence in any of them.Now obviously, these brands/products are most likely nothing to do with Amazon, they&#39;re just using Amazon as their storefront, and sometimes fulfilment, but it still reflects upon Amazon, and ultimately taints their brand with the same brush.Maybe Amazon makes more money in this way, by taking a cut of this flow through various service fees, but for me it makes Amazon less useful to go to when I don&#39;t know exactly what I want already, and more often pushes me to go direct to a more trusted source."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you haven&#39;t tried SQLite, please do. For years I ignored SQLite and used MySQL (it does the job) but once you see how fast SQLite is, and advantages of having a DB contained in a single file... just go play around with SQLite instead of ignoring it for years like me. It&#39;s neat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An interesting consequence of this characteristic of SQLite is that it makes it a really good fit for GraphQL.GraphQL has the N+1 queries problem pretty much baked into it. You can work around it to a certain extent with a lot of effort implementing data loader patterns, but someone will still likely be able to cow up with a query that triggers a cascade of SELECTs.Or, because &#34;many small queries are  efficient in SQLite&#34;, you could use that instead.I built a Datasette plugin that exposes a GraphQL API to an existing SQLite database and it works so well that I switched from being a GraphQL skeptic to a GraphQL advocate.https://simonwillison.net/2020/Aug/7/datasette-graphql/Here&#39;s an example nested GraphQL query that executes 32 select queries. It&#39;s pretty snappy: https://datasette-graphql-demo.datasette.io/graphql?query=%7..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have only worked with PostgreSQL and when the wife(Accounting Professor) needed a DB to teach their students SQL, I heartily took her down the SQLite path because of its simplicity. It may not have been the best decision as I see her now fighting with its warts like1. No type checking! Declare a column as int in DDL, and insert a text, SQLite happily stores it without an error :-(2. No full outer join... instead my wife taught the students the standard SQL syntax and told them to use UNION with SQLite because it does not support that syntax. This is where it gets annoying.I can’t recollect, but there were issues with views as well which sounded really weird.I now think the choice of SQLite is more nuanced than I believed it to be."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wonder how difficult it would be to implement a language for specifying Factorio factories without worrying about physical layouts. This post provides a lot of good insights into how that could be done. Once a factory is specified, a compiler could turn the high-level specification into a blueprint or a valid save file to be loaded up in the game.Of course, the compiler would have no way to lay out the factory with respect to available resource deposits. Maybe that would have to be part of the specification as well? Or maybe the programmer (player?) could pass an empty map file as a compiler argument.Also, this doesn&#39;t give any consideration to the tech tree or enemies within the game. I guess those could be compiler flags, as long as we&#39;re dreaming.Look, all I&#39;m saying is that it would be really cool to be able to check factories into version control."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can definitely see the point the author is trying to make, and I agree that it naturally lends itself to a functional model of how the game works.On the other hand, and this is speaking as someone who has played the game for an embarrassing number of hours all the way into endgame &#34;megabase&#34; territory: my mental abstraction of the game isn&#39;t really functional. It&#39;s directed graphs. Sure, the two views can be equivalent representations, but I find thinking about the game as a directed graph (and reasoning about throughputs in a graph representing a network) to be the perspective that gives actionable insights most readily."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Factorio is a genre-defining game, and I think the number of clones is a testament to that.Factorio is often compared to programming, but it&#39;s closer to Excel where the logic and the output live in the same space. The game does a great job letting the user build with programming-like constructs without them ever having to understand any theory."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yeah, it is horrifying to think about how much air pollution we inflict upon ourselves. It&#39;s very hard to stop even in a two-person household, because so many of the &#34;products&#34; most people in the Western world are used to buying and using since an early age are violators. I am blessed with being quite sensitive to most of them, so it&#39;s an endless struggle with partners and cohabitants.Basically anything bought new has it: furniture, clothes, cars, anything plastic, dyed, glued, particleboard.&#34;Cleaning&#34; products: sprays, detergents, most &#34;soaps&#34;, shampoos, creams, conditioners, have this type of crap in them.Even most stuff which claims to be &#34;eco-friendly&#34; is bullshit, and has all the same crap in it if you look at the ingredients.And it feels like online there is a whole army of &#34;rational scientific defenders&#34; ready to jump into action anytime I mention it. It feels like there is a whole playbook for discrediting this type of comment, and calling into question how &#34;scientific&#34; it is, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Keep in mind this is a meta-analysis using data published in papers that are up to 30 years old and from overseas including China, then applying it to California&#39;s carcinogen list (prop 65) and California commute times.I am sure a followup study will be done to see if this is actually a problem in the USA in 2021.The article is published here (Open access) : https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016041202...Edit: I found this news article from 2003 discussing the issue of carcinogenic new car smells and how manufacturers were trying to eliminate the the dangerous smells while simulating what consumers expect a new car should smell like:https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a15133792/new-car-smel..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So here&#39;s what I&#39;d love if other people here could help me understand.Sensitivity to VOC&#39;s is extremely dependent on the person. My father, for example, had the carpet redone cheaply in his office, and worked there happily 8 hrs/day without smelling anything and without any ill effects.For me, on the other hand, the smell was noxious but bearable, but I&#39;d start to feel lightheaded after about 15 minutes in there. My brother would get a terrible headache after just 5 minutes. (And this is us as adults, same size as him.)Memory foam (e.g. in a pillow) also affects me, even after it&#39;s offgassed for weeks. I don&#39;t smell a thing, but it gives me a burning sore throat after I&#39;m close to it for a couple of hours. But again, zero effect on my dad.And so my big question is: I&#39;m well aware that people have drastically different responses to VOC&#39;s. But does that mean VOC&#39;s harm people differently too, or are we all harmed the same?In other words, does my dad have some kind of &#34;protective&#34; genes where the VOC&#39;s don&#39;t bother him because they harm him less, so he doesn&#39;t avoid them? Or are my brother and I better off because we&#39;re super-sensitive to them, so we escape the harm he might be suffering?It seems like such an urgent public health problem, especially given how many people use memory foam mattresses and pillows. It just boggles my mind that I get a sore throat after just a couple of hours with one, while other people sleep peacefully all night."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What went wrong is that the Texas legislature which owns Texas-specific grid process to avoid interference from the Feds didn&#39;t figure out how to also ensure Texas generator companies got compensated for weatherizing (and ensuring it was done).How many of the 24+6 recommendations from the NERC/FERC review of last time this happened in Texas (hint:2011) were taken up by the legislature or those at ERCOT they delegated responsibility to or the power generation providers?https://www.nerc.com/pa/rrm/ea/ColdWeatherTrainingMaterials/...The eye opener to me from skimming the 2011 recommendations is that there was no explicit rating/SLA for a power plant&#39;s acceptable temperature operating that could be used by planners for assessing the risks of an upcoming weather event by policy planners. It&#39;d seem pretty basic to be able to ask &#34;How many plants do we lose when temperature drops below X&#34;? 
 Dunno whether they fixed trying to create such a basic measurement for Texas plants, but it doesn&#39;t seem like it.If you want to know some of the specifics about what &#34;winterization&#34; means in practice for a power plant including natural gas ones, you can read some of the details in that report.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love this. I started laughing when I read the description. I laughed because a Harvard physicist (funded by people like Bill Gates) had the same idea to use cooling towers for their DAC project in Carbon Engineering (linked in your post). But as you say, it is still expensive. They are bragging that their design took hundred of man years!And then you two guys come in with the idea that in hindsight seems completely obvious, use all the cooling towers already out there! The most start up thing ever.I used to be an engineer at an ammonia plant. Many of them already capture and sell CO2 from their process. So they have the infrastructure to compress and sell CO2 already on site. The plant I worked at was in Augusta, GA. Might be worth checking out ammonia plants as a growth market."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Huh, smart idea to piggyback off existing infrastructure. Have you contacted Stripe Climate? They are directing money from stripe businesses to fund carbon removal, and they just put out a call for new companies to contact them.Believe I saw it within past 7-10 days on Patrick Collison’s twitter. Here’s the link. Has details and an application: https://mobile.twitter.com/orbuch/status/1359926307149148162Btw for anyone with a business using stripe: stripe climate is now open for anyone worldwide. I set it up to contribute 1% of my revenues. And it should be deductible as a marketing expense: Stripe let’s you out it on your checkout, invoice and receipt. The founder of Nomadlist found it increased his conversions. Haven’t tested it personally but plausibly it’s actually profit generating.Probably the most impactful climate decision you can make with your business, takes 30 seconds to set up, and may boost your revenue.https://stripe.com/climate"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you&#39;re not injecting the CO2 underground in a stable form, how does this reverse climate change? It sounds like it&#39;s simply a cheaper option in some circumstances for sourcing CO2 from the air (compared to traditional solutions by Airgas). Not to take away from your efforts! I think this is a fine improvement to CO2 process needs if you can replace more expensive air extraction techniques, but it doesn&#39;t contribute to improving climate change without sequestering the harvested atmospheric CO2."</p>
