								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Former AWS engineer here.I worked on a pretty critical product in AWS (big AWS service with lots of traffic) and I can safely say that it&#39;s totally up to your manager and pre-existing conditions which make up the job. My manager was great as a person but would always lack in my career-oriented goals (bigger projects, promotions, etc)But what really sucked for me was the pre-existing conditions. Our on-call was pretty bad (40-60 tickets a week) and there was very little investment being put in to improve it. We had a lot of little scripts here and there which would solve extremely specific situations but no focus was ever put on in building a general framework or trying to reduce the ticket count. This often led to engineers taking the day off after their on-call due to the load and honestly it made people quite grumpy. And upper management was always much more interested in feature delivery since the focus was always on promotions and the more you delivered the better it looked for your manager. So now you have engineers with such a terrible on-call load along with pressure to deliver new features and projects within the atrocious tight deadlines that would be set. It was, to be blunt, a shit show.Code quality was atrocious. We had one enormous Java method (&gt;1000 lines) which would take care of nearly every single request coming into our service... With only about 7-8 unit tests. It was so difficult to get even basic things done to the point where any ticket that needed to be done would take a minimum of 4-5 days regardless of complexity. And of course managers and senior engineers would estimate small tickets to take around 1-2 days and then be shocked when 2 days later it&#39;s not even close to being finished. I will give Amazon credit that they do grill design reviews pretty harshly so those are done well in general. But code reviewers didn&#39;t care about quality or best practice. If it works then ship it.I&#39;m just not 100% sure about the whole PIP scene. Our service was extremely critical and we were extremely understaffed. So I don&#39;t think it applied to anyone in our org but I know of other teams who would have no issues in taking in a fresh college grad, making them do work for 6-12 months and then just randomly putting them on PIP. Sad but I&#39;ve seen it happen a few times in my time there.I&#39;m glad I got the Amazon stamp on my resume and left. When I left, more than half my team and my manager quit around the same time too. It was definitely a wild experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I interviewed with Amazon and Facebook in the Spring/Summer of 2020. The difference was night and day. Amazon felt like I was part of a huge cattle herd. The recruiter contacted me and told me they needed to hire a bunch of people in my area. I was immediately given a course of study, link to common LeetCode questions and told I had a couple of weeks. That fine. I enjoy solving puzzles. Facebook felt VERY different. The recruiter had a conversation about career goals, told me how wonderful it is to work at FB, and then quizzed me on some basic CS concepts. The ensuing rounds for each got even more divergent. The Facebook interviewers constantly made me feel like my success was a &#34;win&#34; for them. It felt like a team! Amazon felt like they were waiting for me to screw up so they could disqualify me. In the end, I dropped out of Amazon because it felt disgusting. And I could tell, if this is how they bring me in, I can&#39;t see any reason why it&#39;ll magically get any better once I was &#34;in&#34;.My feeling on those who use LeetCode as some sort of indicator. Great. You&#39;ve found the people that do the brain-teaser puzzles at Cracker-Barrel. I&#39;m one of those people. Some of the best people I&#39;ve worked with, would fail those tests immediately... yet, they&#39;ve built scalable, performant enterprise software. I now see those tests as nothing more than a way to reduce the number of applicants."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at a company that hired several people out of Amazon. Amazon is a big company, so there is significant variation from team to team.However, several of the ex-Amazon employees were clearly scarred from their time working at Amazon. Whenever something went wrong (delays, outages, missed deadlines) one of them went so far as to spend hours or days preparing documents showing how it was actually someone else&#39;s fault, not his, because he thought it was necessary to avoid being fired. He said his experience at Amazon was basically one large game of &#34;not it&#34; whenever it came time to assign blame for the latest issue, and everyone had to become very good at blaming someone else. The worst was when he was actual at fault for something, because he would panic and scramble to distract from the issue he caused by raising concerns about everyone else around him. Easily the most toxic person I&#39;ve worked with in the past few years.On the other hand, I&#39;ve known other ex-Amazon people who said their work was nothing like this, so YMMV"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To clarify, the &#34;box&#34; is any UNIX computer (very well suited for Raspberry PI devices, since the wifi can act as a hotspot), and the &#34;internet&#34; consists of all the best FOSS apps and open content that get served from localhost, see full list here: http://wiki.laptop.org/go/IIAB/FAQ#What_services_.28IIAB_app...The use case is to make apps/content/tools normally requiring internet accessed work offline (either on localhost or local area network). In practice, using IIAB goes a little something like this:   1. find device (the more storage the better)
   2. install free software on device using IIAB scripts
   3. download free content (various content packs)
   4. deploy device anywhere in the world to enjoy
      all the FOSS and free content on local network

The IIAB scripts make installation and download setup fully automatable (battle-tested Ansible scripts https://github.com/iiab/iiab/tree/master/roles ), which is exciting because you can provision &#34;learning server&#34; devices very easily."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This really deserves more love.Who remembers Ken Thompson&#39;s &#34;Reflections on Trusting Trust&#34;?The norm today is auto-updating, pre-built software.This places a ton of trust in the publisher. Even for open-source, well-vetted software, we all collectively cross our fingers and hope that whoever is building these binaries and running the servers that disseminate them, is honest and good at security.So far this has mostly worked out due to altruism (for open source maintainers) and self interest (companies do not want to attack their own users). But the failure modes are very serious.I predict that everyone&#39;s imagination on this topic will expand once there&#39;s a big enough incident in the news. Say some package manager gets compromised, nobody finds out, and 6mo later every computer on earth running `postgres:latest` from docker hub gets ransomwared.There are only two ways around this:- Build from source. This will always be a deeply niche thing to do. It&#39;s slow, inconvenient, and inaccessible except to nerds.- Reproducible builds.Reproducible builds are way more important than is currently widely appreciated.I&#39;m grateful to the nixos team for being beating a trail thru the jungle here. Retrofitting reproducibility onto a big software project that grew without it, is hard work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a big deal. Congratulations to all involved.In Software, complexity naturally increases over time and dependencies and interactions between components become impossible to reason about. Eventually this complexity causes the Software to collapse under its own weight.Truly reproducible builds (such as NixOS and Nixpkgs) provides us with islands of &#34;determinism&#34; which can be taken as true invariants. This enables us to build more Systems and Software on top of deterministic foundations that can be reproduced by others.This reproducibility also enables powerful things like decentralized / distributed trust. Different third-parties can build the same software and compare the results. If they differ, it could indicate one of the sources has been compromised. See Trustix https://github.com/tweag/trustix"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t see a single comment doubting the value of reproducibility, so I&#39;ll be the resident skeptic :)I think build reproducibility is a cargo cult. The website says reproducibility can reduce the risk of developers being threatened or bribed to backdoor their software, but that is just ridiculous. Developers have a perfect method for making their own software malicious: bugdoors. A bugdoor (bug + backdoor) is a deliberately introduced &#34;vulnerability&#34; that the vendor can &#34;exploit&#34; when they want backdoor access. If the bug is ever discovered you simply issue a patch and say it was a mistake, it&#39;s perfectly deniable. It&#39;s not unusual for major vendors to patch critical vulnerabilities every month, there is zero penalty for doing this.The existence of bugdoors means you have to trust the vendor who provided the source code, there is no way around this.You have to trust the developer, but in theory, reproducible builds could be used to convince yourself their build server hasn&#39;t been hacked. This isn&#39;t really necessary or useful, you can already produce a trustworthy binary by just building the source code yourself. You still have to trust the vendor to keep hackers off everything else though!Okay, but building software is tedious, and for some reason you are particularly concerned about build servers being hacked. Perhaps you will nominate a dozen different organization that will all build the code, and make this a consensus system. If they all agree, then you can be sure enough the binaries were built with a trustworthy toolchain. A modest improvement in theory, but that introduces a whole bunch of new crazy problems.You can&#39;t just pick one or two consensus servers, because then an attacker can stop you getting updates by compromising any one of them. You will have to do something like choose a lot of servers, and only require 51% to agree.Now, imagine a contentious update like a adopting a cryptocurrency fork, or switching to systemd (haha). If the server operators rebel, they can effectively veto a change the vendor wants to make. Perhaps vendors will implement a killswitch that allows them to have the final say, or perhaps they operate all the consensus build servers themselves.The problem is now you&#39;ve either just replaced build servers with killswitches, or just replicated the same potentially-compromised buildserver.I wrote a blog post about this a while ago, although I should update it at some point.https://blog.cmpxchg8b.com/2020/07/you-dont-need-reproducibl..."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27575580">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think a lot of the replies in the thread so far have focused on tech (understandably, this is HN after all) but that&#39;s missing something obvious - the 4 day week would apply to everyone.In tech it&#39;s very likely someone going from 5 days to 4 days could still achieve the same amount of actual work. As other commenters have said, many tech workers don&#39;t do productive work all the time they&#39;re present. Retail workers, factory workers, people who fill in the holes in roads, telephone support people, etc aren&#39;t contending with pointless meetings and busy work though. They can&#39;t do 40 hours of work in 32 hours by removing some of the hours they&#39;re not really working. What they do doesn&#39;t compress like that.Consequently looking at this from the context of tech workers is far less interesting. The Japanese government isn&#39;t saying &#34;Let&#39;s get rid of pointless meetings and busy work!&#34; In tech removing the pointless nonsense isn&#39;t actually reducing the amount of real work people do. Instead, Japan is saying &#34;Our country is wealthy enough and advanced enough that our people can actually do less work.&#34; That&#39;s fascinating.If you see this as &#34;removing the wasteful time spent on things that aren&#39;t useful like meetinga&#34; then you&#39;ve missed the point. It is that, but it&#39;s much, much more than that too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s an open secret at least in the tech world that absolutely no one is putting in a productive 40 hours of work a week. This was true well before the pandemic and is more pronounced than ever now. Everyone needs to be &#34;present&#34; for 8 hours a day 5 days a week, but spends their time in pointless meetings, preparing documents and powerpoints that no one will read,  faux social/teambuilding events, hour long lunches, goofing off on the internet, all to maintain the pretense of office culture.Companies that shuffle things up to prioritize productivity over simply showing up will be set to succeed over the next generation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The social contract in Japan was that you’d give your life to your employer in exchange for a fair wage and stable employment until you retired. Neither of those things are true now. Wages are low and companies either ignore their legal obligations or hire people as contractors, who have less rights  than full time “employees”.Now, many people, especially women* and young people are finding that it’s possible to run a small business for 3-4 days a week and make more money than an entry or even mid-level full time office job.So, I think Japan finally enforcing rules against abusive behavior at the workplace and pushing for a 4-day week, if it really happens, is a reflection of where society is at right now.*Women have a low wage ceiling because they are expected to quit and have children at any time."</p>

They proved their ethics already by reporting it to them, and they know it already because they found it. There is literally no reason to try to keep the white hat hacker in the dark, not update them, etc. The white hat hacker could have exploited the vulnerability already!"</p>

It&#39;s very powerful, but even proving the simplest undergraduate maths statements (say, about group theory) can prove very challenging. I believe that part of this is that Coq uses different mathematical foundations than traditional mathematics, which mostly uses set theory (ZFC, although most people don&#39;t care about the specifics). So it can be hard or unnatural to express something like &#34;subgroup&#34;. I don&#39;t know if Lean fares better in that respect. Coq documentation is also IMHO almost impossible to understand unless you&#39;re already very deeply knowledgeable about the system.We will probably still need some more iterations, to get more user friendly assistants with better documentation and to get adequate teaching resources etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Things I have learned about SSDs:If you want to go fast &amp; save NAND lifetime, use append-only log structures.If you want to go even faster &amp; save even more NAND lifetime, batch your writes in software (i.e. some ring buffer with natural back-pressure mechanism) and then serialize them with a single writer into an append-only log structure. Many newer devices have something like this at the hardware level, but your block size is still a constraint when working in hardware. If you batch in software, you can hypothetically write multiple logical business transactions per block I/O. When you physical block size is 4k and your logical transactions are averaging 512b of data, you would be leaving a lot of throughput on the table.Going down 1 level of abstraction seems important if you want to extract the most performance from an SSD. Unsurprisingly, the above ideas also make ordinary magnetic disk drives more performant &amp; potentially last longer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This page tells me a lot about SSDs, but it doesn&#39;t tell me why I need to know these things.  It doesn&#39;t really give me any indication about how I should change my behavior if I know that I&#39;ll be running on SSD vs spinning disk.I&#39;ve always been told, &#34;just treat SSDs like slow, permanent memory&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My opinion is probably... not technically correct... until you have to deal with drive reliability and write guarantees, but I don&#39;t think programmers actually have to know anything about SSDs in the same way that developers had to know particular things about HDDs.This is out of pure speculation, but there had to be a period of time during the mass transition to SSDs that engineers said, OK, how do we get the hardware to be compatible with software that is, for the most part, expecting that hard disk drives are being used, and just behave like really fast HDDs.So, there&#39;s almost certainly some non-zero amount of code out there in the wild that is or was doing some very specific write optimized routine that one day was just performing 10 to 100 times faster, and maybe just because of the nature of software is still out there today doing that same routine.I don&#39;t know what that would look like, but my guess would be that it would have something to do with average sized write caches, and those caches look entirely different today or something.And today, there&#39;s probably some SSD specific code doing something out there now, too."</p>

There seemed to be an overwhelming amount of evidence over the last year that this repurposed drug is effective at treating Covid during a variety of stages (preventative, first positive test, ICU admittance, and even long haul). But since there hadn&#39;t been a randomized trial the drug had, not only been dismissed, but heavily censored over social media. I still cannot believe how much the discussion has been silenced in the same way people discuss &#34;covid vaxx causes magnetism&#34;. The fact the interview between Bret Weinstein and Pierre Kory was banned from youtube for non-WHO/CDC/NIH approved covid treatments is a tragedy.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a great initiative. The last time I remember setting up a mail server using Postfix or Dovecot was around 2015.It was a traumatizing experience. It rarely worked, all my email went to spam and I absolutely hated the amount of hackery and duct tape required to keep it working. Configuration files, missed emails...It was so unpleasant, to this day I avoid messing with mail on servers at all costs. I&#39;d much rather pay for Mailgun or some provider.Lately I&#39;ve been seeing an uptick of these apps making self-hosted email easier. Mail in a box, Maddy, etc. I will unconditionally support anything that makes doing this easier.I&#39;m not switching from GSuite, but I&#39;m happy to see progress in the space."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using Maddy now for about a month for my email, and it&#39;s incredible. The dev says it&#39;s not caddy for email – but in my experience, it&#39;s certainly been that easy.I&#39;ve got to write a longer article about this, but self-hosting email is incredibly liberating. I now own my entire digital identity. I can work on open source projects with developers around the world completely while relying only on my own capabilities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see no one has mentioned Mailu (https://mailu.io/1.7/). It’s a self hosted mail server made up of a couple docker images.I would recommend it based on my use and experience.I’ve been using it for my personal email and for automated no-reply messages in a few projects with no delivery issues. I’m hosting on a Contabo VPS.It handles spam with rspamd, sets you up with DMARC, DKIM, has an admin interface, web mail interface."</p>
