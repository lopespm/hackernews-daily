								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Andrew here. Connor, thanks for releasing this on the orange site.This story is also more fun from my position. I&#39;ve been applying to internships and interviewing every week. They&#39;re mostly rejections. They&#39;re the same questions over and over with minor variation (sorry to top comment for &#34;impersonating&#34; your comment style). My days are deteriorating from a colorful sphere down to two points. In fact, down to two pointers, left and right, iterating over a list of heights to find how much rain water it can trap.I&#39;m about to repeat the experience for the 10th time and I&#39;m 100% on autopilot. But suddenly, a man reaches out to me on email and offers me up to $80/hr to be his senior engineer. This feels sketchy, my girlfriend tells me, &#34;you&#39;re good but let&#39;s be honest here...&#34;. Anyways, I proceed, it might just be the start of a beautiful thing. I&#39;m asked to interview as one of our developers because English is not their best language. I&#39;m a little bothered, but I was fine with it. But then I see the developer name: Connor Tumbleson. My laughter bursts and so does my suspicion: With a name like that, no way the guy doesn&#39;t speak good English. I look up Connor Tumbleson on linkedin, and my suspicions were proved correct. I detail everything to Connor, and now this is on the top of HN. I lost a opprotunity but gained a story of the lifetime."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This story is much more fun when you come at it from the interviewer&#39;s position. You&#39;ve been doing interviews every week. They&#39;re mostly rejections. They&#39;re the same questions over and over with minor variation. You&#39;re about to repeat the experience for the 18th time and you&#39;re 100% on autopilot. But suddenly you&#39;re in a spy thriller. This is the greatest thing that&#39;s ever happened.Is it a good legal/corporate decision to hide the person who claims to be the original and let him listen to the interview with the other candidate? Holy fuck, no. Is it going to be WAY more thrilling? Oh my god yes; how could you not?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In 1996, my employer got a contract to work with AT&amp;T to build a website that provided regular event updates from the Atlanta Olympics. In 1996, this was a very big deal, such a newish concept that the project was written up in AdAge or some similar industry magazine.A few months later a prospective junior engineer came in for an interview. My manager asked him the typical &#34;tell me about an interesting project you&#39;ve worked on lately.&#34; He then proceeded to describe in detail the very project we had just completed, even referencing the magazine article about it (he must have forgotten he was interviewing at the company mentioned in the article). At the end of his presentation, my manager said &#34;That&#39;s interesting, because here at X, we just completed that project.&#34;Awkward silence. Then the interviewee got up and said &#34;I guess I should go now.&#34; My manager said &#34;Yes, I guess you should.&#34;Impersonation of this sort can be simultaneously disturbing and somehow comical. It isn&#39;t a new phenomenon; I&#39;m not decided on whether I believe the information age makes it easier or more difficult."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I tried using it in Portuguese and it&#39;s cool but it seems very off, just a huge number of things that don&#39;t sound even remotely natural or idiomatic. But when I click the translate button, the English translation is a perfectly reasonable thing to say.SO... I&#39;m highly suspecting that, behind the scenes, the &#34;real&#34; conversation is happening in English, and it&#39;s translating in both directions. Which is always going to be fairly disastrous, particularly with short snippets of conversational text. (In contrast, machine translation does best with long sentences of highly technical writing.)So the concept is very intriguing, but the problem is that it needs to rely on native language models per-language. (Or if it already is, then those models need a vastly better or larger training corpus.)So A+ for proof of concept, but I&#39;d never recommend anybody practice with this in order to learn/practice a language, because with the quality where it is, it will make you a worse speaker -- not better. The things it says are just too weird."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m stunned by how well this works for Japanese, the only language I think I&#39;m good enough at to judge the AI&#39;s responses.The speech recognition is flawless as far as I can tell. The AI occasionally gets itself into a loop of repeating my question or itself, but I think this has been a problem with a lot of chatbots. The only glaring errors I&#39;ve seen so far are these kinds of AI-specific issues, like forgetting context, getting geographical facts wrong, etc.&gt;こんにちは。今日はどちらへお出かけですか？ (Hello. Where are you headed?)京都に行きます. (I&#39;m going to Kyoto)&gt;素晴らしい都市ですね。行ったことはありますか？ (It&#39;s a great city. Have you been?)いや初めてです。お勧めの場所はありますか？. (Nope, it&#39;s my first time. Any places you suggest?)&gt;京都は歴史のある美しい都市です。たくさんのお寺や神社を訪れることができます。(Kyoto is a beautiful city with history. You can visit plenty of temples and shrines.)そうですね。清水寺とか聞いたことがある。行きたいんだ. (True. I&#39;ve heard of like, Kiyomizudera, and I want to go.)&gt;清水寺は必見です！とても人気のあるお寺で、市内を一望できるんですよ(Kiyomizudera is a must-see! It&#39;s a very popular temple, and you can see the whole area at once)Not only does it know about Kyoto, but it knows about a specific temple (picked it up via speech recognition too). Translations are rough and by me, not quazel.This could be a real game changer if the other languages are this good.Additionally, if you register an account then you get access to the &#34;Scene builder&#34; which lets you set up a situation to start the conversation in. I have found that you can redirect any conversation to pretty much anything, but I thought it was a cool idea that many people here averse to account-making might have missed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is great. They mentioned a few months ago their will to open-source it [1] and now it&#39;s finally a reality, so props to Kenton and the Workers team on achieving it!I&#39;ve dug a bit on the OSS repo [2], and here are some of the findings I got:    1. They are using a forked version of V8 with very small/clean set of changes (the diff with the changes is really minimal. Not sure if this makes sense, but it might be interesting to see if changes could be added upstream)
    2. It&#39;s coded mainly in C++, with Bazel for the builds and a mix between CapNProto and Protocol Buffers for schema
    3. They worked deeply the Developer Experience, so as developer you can start using `workerd` with pre-build binaries via NPM/NPX  (`npx workerd`). Still a few rough edges around but things are looking promising [3].
    4. I couldn&#39;t find the implementation anywhere of the KV store. Is it possible to use it? How it will work?

Open sourcing the engine, mixed with their recent announcement on a $1.25B investment fund for startups built on workers [4] I think will propel a lot the Wasm ecosystem... which I&#39;m quite excited about![1] https://twitter.com/KentonVarda/status/1523666343412654081[2] https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd[3] https://www.npmjs.com/package/workerd[4] https://blog.cloudflare.com/workers-launchpad/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Workers are so damn good and easy…I am originally from the PHP/Laravel world, recently had to quickly develop a very simple (5 endpoints) REST API and decided to give CF workers &amp; KV storage a try. In an hour the API was running in production…CF is really, really good at many things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great. The Cloudflare model for Workers really deserves to become a de facto standard that can be pulled off the shelf for open source serverless functions. Really excited they’re opening this up this way. It seems like a great positive sum move."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Swedish national seismic network picked up two explosions within kilometers of the reported gas leak locations yesterday.The time of the first explosion: Yesterday, Monday morning at 02:03 am, second one Monday evening at 7:04pm (local time, CEST).The reports of the gas leaks came at 1:52pm and 8:41pm, respectively - by means of ships reporting bubbling at the surface level.One of the two events registered at magnitude 2.3. They were picked up by stations all over the country.It&#39;s clear from the registered seismic waves that the events are not earthquakes.- You can clearly see how the waves bounce from the bottom to the surface. There is no doubt that it was a blast or explosion. We even had a station in Kalix [quite far up north, some 1300 km away] that picked this up, says Björn Lund, who is a lecturer in seismology and director of the Swedish national seismic network, which measures Swedish earthquakes and explosions.Translated and summarized from: https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/svt-avslojar-tva-explosio... (Sweden&#39;s national public service broadcaster, within the last hour)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I were a betting man, I&#39;d put my money on Poland.The Polish prime minister immediately called &#34;sabotage&#34; and fingered Russia, while everyone else is still saying &#34;it could be sabotage but we need to investigate first&#34;.Russia wants the taps capable of being turned ON at their discretion, not permanently broken. This hurts their bargaining position in a big way because they&#39;ve just lost their biggest source of leverage against Germany.Poland opened a new pipeline to Norway on the same day as the leaks appeared, so there was lots of Polish activity in the waters.Poland doesn&#39;t receive gas via Nordstream, so damaging it doesn&#39;t hurt them in any way.Poland is Ukraine&#39;s most ardent supporter in Europe, often leading the vanguard of actions to support Ukraine. They&#39;d have a strong motive to ensure that the rest of Europe doesn&#39;t waver in its commitment to keep the Russian taps off.It could be argued that since Europe has already decided to never turn on Nordstream again, the fallout from such an act of sabotage is minimal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s so easy to spin a just so story around incentives to think anyone is responsible.US did it because their gas industry want to sell to Europe, and also Biden was clipped saying he can stop NS2.Russia did it because the repair costs are low and hence the distrust propaganda value is worth that cost, and because EU is going to stop buying their gas anyway so may as well capitalize on the sunk cost.Forgetting incentives for a minute and instead looking at recent patterns of behavior and reckless disregard for both others as well as self-preservation, my default assumption is that Russia did it. This is the best lens to use when the incentive picture is murky, because it clearly is murky here."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32996457">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We tried to hire a contract employee and the fraud happened twice in a row.The first time, we interviewed the candidate over the phone. He answered our technical questions extremely well, but the guy who showed up for work didn’t seem to have basic computer skills. He also had a much stronger accent than over the phone. We asked him questions from the interview and he couldn’t answer any. He finally admitted that he wasn’t the person we interviewed, but demanded to be paid for for his time and trouble anyway.So then we switched to Zoom interviews. We got burned again when they sent a guy who looked similar to the person we interviewed, but clearly wasn’t. Shame on us, I guess.After that we started doing in-person interviews."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are significantly worst things happening in the industry by much much bigger consultancy names. We, an enterprise, hire complete teams from the consultancy that would pick some of the work in different projects with their own product owner and so on but under our contract.We seldom see all the people whom we interviewed for the teams, as devs, being present in the meetings that they are all expected to be present (of course it is most often the timezone difference that is the mentioned reason). Or people who join have their camera turned off, so no way to see them.Code quality that comes, is not on par with the skillset we evaluated during the interviews and I suspect the whole consultancy is doing something similar with presenting top engineers in the interview and then moving them between many teams. Leaving the less skilled engineer to do the work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been remote hiring for years. Remote positions are a magnet for fraud of all types.If you have the budget, I highly recommend moving your compensation points up and focusing on top engineers in remote locations. It&#39;s much easier to vet people who have an established online track record and you can tap references from well-known companies. Unfortunately this way you will miss out on some great candidates that haven&#39;t yet established themselves, so you still have to branch out.For remote work we require video interviews and cameras on during meetings. We&#39;d make an exception if someone really needed accommodations to keep their camera off for some reason, but otherwise it&#39;s cameras on. I know some people don&#39;t like this, but it improves communication and team cohesion in a noticeable way. It also immediately highlights fraud like this.Get your security team involved. You should be tracking where remote employees access your VPN and company services. Don&#39;t be afraid to ask about discrepancies and changes. If someone has logged in from one IP or region for the first 4 weeks and then suddenly you&#39;re seeing new logins from a different city or country, investigate. I don&#39;t care if people travel, but we need to firmly understand the security situation.Watch out for people with frequent excuses for missing meetings, having to turn their camera off, excuses like &#34;my camera isn&#39;t working today&#34;, and so on. Send everyone known-good webcams and company laptops.And as always, performance management is key. Managing remote is harder than managing in person, and I say that as someone who manages remote and loves remote teams. You need strong performance management practices in place and clear ways to measure it. People who aren&#39;t getting their work done should show up quickly in your system and warrant additional manager investigation.But if someone shows up in Zoom who isn&#39;t the person you hired, lock it down ASAP. Don&#39;t let being &#34;nice&#34; get in the way of handling an urgent security situation. Someone you didn&#39;t hire who hasn&#39;t agreed to your contracts is in your system, and that&#39;s a red alert emergency."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really like the engineering principles in general that the Go team uses, however, I just don&#39;t like Go. That isn&#39;t meant as a slight or anything other than simply my opinion. That said, I really like the idea of a simple language based on the sort of principles demonstrated here. The runtime seems really nice, I just wish I liked the language better (IMO: not expressive enough, needs better error handling, needs much better enums, needs pattern matching, has error prone C-style &#39;for&#39;, almost everything is statements not expressions, special comments are error prone, has nil pointers, etc.). In the end I think if someone were to write a slightly simpler version of Rust with the Go runtime it might be pretty neat. That said, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d want to drop from Rust so maybe I&#39;m just fantasizing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Love go as a platform.. self contained binaries have been a miracle for ops..but have a few big hangups about using the language full time because of the sucky ergonomics.* No optional/named parameters. Writing a whole function per parameter for function chaining is excessive. This would not be difficult to add to the compiler (i&#39;ve done it and have seriously considered using the fork) but it seems like the team is just stubborn about adding stuff like this.* No default struct values. 0 isn&#39;t good enough in real world scenarios.. have fun writing BlahInit(...) for everything.* Would be nice to get the question mark syntax for error handling. Error handling shorthand for if err != nil would also be very welcome."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m really grateful for everyone who has made Go possible and continues to make it better.

					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32982310">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks like a recipe for cold solder joints and solder bridges and doesn&#39;t seem like it saves time.What you really want to do when you have dozens of jumper wires is to do an array-of-struct to struct-of-array transform on the steps. Instead of cutting, stripping, tinning, and soldering one wire at a time, cut all your wires, then strip them all, then tin them all, then solder them one by one.Here&#39;s a pro tip: when you tin the wires, lay the iron flat on your workbench with tip out into air and tin by laying the end of the wire on top and then adding the solder.Another pro tip: use a pair of needle nose pliers to bend the tinned leads by a little over 90 degrees to make a little hook. When you solder to the board you can apply a little tension and let the solder flow into the hole. Makes very string solder joints."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh boy, nice idea, but this looks complicated and time consuming. I recommend to get some good equipment first:  - solder fume extractor (see below)
  - extra thin high quality tin
  - a desoldering pump AND desoldering wire
  - high quality flux
  - a TS 100 soldering Iron with KU tip from ali express for 50 bucks
  - optional: USB-C Power Adapter for your existing power supply (so you don&#39;t have to buy one)
  - optional: a soldering mat (normaly blue colored)

and you have a near professional equipment for about $120. Now flash IronOS[1] on your soldering Iron, and it works even better.Instructions:  - turn on solder fume extractor
  - heat iron to 370° Celsius (but be careful depending on your workpiece)
  - Tin both ends beforhand
  - better slightly more flux to put on (but not for small works) 
  - if flux has been applied, cleaning up with e.g. toothbrush &amp; isopropyl alcohol after you&#39;re done maybe a good idea

However, the most important peace of hardware is a solder fume extractor... I&#39;m surprised that so many youtube &#34;professionals&#34; don&#39;t put a hint on this - never play with your health. This can even be done DIY (see youtube tutorials).High quality flux is also important because of your health. Chinese sellers often don&#39;t care about ingredients...High quality tin is much easier to work with and costs 5 bucks more than low quality tin. It is worth.[1]: https://github.com/Ralim/IronOS"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bad advice. Just use a good solder iron, thin solder (possibly leaded), and good no clean flux, then lots of practice. It&#39;s all about timing: too quick = cold solder joint; too slow = burned pad/track, or part. Learn also to understand about thermal mass and how to change the temperature and timings according to what you&#39;re soldering and its size.Also, that iron looks like a Hakko &#34;936&#34; cheap clone: they are barely above the garbage level; get a better one. Used Wellers aren&#39;t that expensive, and no, you won&#39;t need a microcontroller for digital temperature control and all those gimmicks they put in modern solder irons. I also have a PineCil from the same folks that made the PinePhone and was amazed by its quality. Yes, it has a mcu for digital temperature control, but I&#39;d lie if I wrote that I used any of its functions beyond setting the temperature."</p>

Pausing always fixes erratic mode.Given that the “erratic mode” only impacts the beginning of the run and disappears suddenly at known locations, this sounds like an issue of delayed GPS lock.And given that the problem didn’t exist in the past, it could be a software issue due to upgrades. Or it could be a hardware issue that developed over time, such as something impacting GPS receive sensitivity. Or it could even be a new source of RF interference in the GPS range near the author’s start point, which impacts GPS lock until they get far enough away from it.Interesting issue, but note that this issue appears to be specific to this one specific person, not a general issue with all Apple Watches as some in this thread are speculating. I certainly have not noticed this behavior on my Watch even with the latest updates."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Semi related iWatch Rant - if you think running data is bad, try tracking your sleep.It just doesn&#39;t work.- Sleep for 3h - wake up for 1, sleep for 5 more: records 3h only.- (being a parent of a small baby) do not sleep at all during the night, sleep 4+3 hours during the day: 0 hours recorded- sleep trough the night but wake up every 90-100 minutes (baby again): 0 hours recordedDamn, this is a $500+ device, and it cant even get basic sleep data correctly.
Also, it takes anywhere from 1min to couple of hours for data to appear in the Health app.OTOH my wife has ~3 year old Huawei Fit watch, which was about $120, and that thing records every 10-15min or longer nap. Without a mistake."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m part of a running group with a mix of Garmin and Apple Watches and the Apple Watches always have pretty different distant readings according to Strava, maybe 2%-5%. The Garmin devices are generally much closer together.I wonder if the dual-band GPS on the Apple Watch Ultra is an attempt to fix these problems? I would guess that it’s software, with the author, if for no other reason than I’d be surprised if Garmin were all that much better at putting GPS in a tiny housing than Apple."</p>
