								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This problem first occurred in the mid-&#39;90s, and people saw it was a problem, and that&#39;s why we specified the image dimensions in HTML (before the GIF or JPEG header was loaded), so the layout wouldn&#39;t shift during load, when people were already reading and navigating.Since almost the beginning, graphic designers were trying to layout Web pages like an advertising brochure, lots of bad ways, rather than as hypertext.  When, in a sense, they finally did take control of the Web, HCI (usability in service of user) had evolved into &#34;UX&#34; (advertising-like graphic design in service of non-users).There&#39;s often disincentive for things like &#34;user can understand what the controls are and what the state is&#34;, &#34;user can focus on the information they want&#34;, etc.  UX won&#39;t care about these things until some time after users are so aware of the problems that it affects engagement metrics and eventually A/B testing figures out why.I&#39;m imagining a eureka moment, during which a UX researcher, trying to find a new, improved dark pattern, to screw over hapless users harder, accidentally lets slip in some old-school good usability, which wasn&#39;t even supposed to be in the test sets, but discovers that this strangely resonates with users."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A particular bane of mine is the self-oscillating UIs, youtube is particularly bad at it these days - if the mouse pointer is in &#39;just the right place&#39; (which is bigger than it sounds) then you get the seek-bar preview frames popup, which moves things just enough that the mouse pointer is no longer over the area that triggers it, so it vanishes, and the whole thing starts again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Way back when I first started learning to build web pages [when HTML4 was just a glint in Tim Berners-Lees eye], it was conidered bad form not to prvide a &#39;width&#39; and &#39;height&#39; attribute for an image you were placing on the page.Because if you provided these, the browser would know how much space to leave for the image to occupy after it had downloaded [this was back in the dial-up modem days. So images usually loaded gradually after the rest of the page] and so the layout of the page would not change. Conversely, if you didn&#39;t provide &#39;width&#39; and &#39;height&#39; attributes, the browser would only leave a default small icon sized space for the image and then you&#39;d have the page content move and shuffle about as each image downloaded and the rest of the page content got elbowed out of the way, to accommodate it.It&#39;s funny how such basic concepts of usability seem to have fallen by the wayside in our new modern Web3 [or whatever version buzzword we&#39;re on now] in favour of moving content, modal overlays and the like. And, since so many sites these days just aggregate content from countless other external sources, even that basic notion of pre-defining your image sizes is often neglected too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Back when the Apache OpenOffice project was still alive, the LibreOffice project used git notes to track, for each commit to Apache OpenOffice, whether it was ignored (usually for being specific to the obsolete openoffice.org build system), redundant with a libreoffice commit (usually because the LibreOffice project had already fixed the same issue in a better way several years before), or cherry-picked into the libreoffice tree (this was the rarest case; in these last two cases, it also pointed to the relevant libreoffice commit); an aoo commit without git notes meant it had not been looked at yet. While the LibreOffice project stopped doing that a couple of years ago (probably because there was no longer anything interesting happening in the aoo repository), you can still see the branch they used to mirror the Apache OpenOffice tree, still with the git notes, at https://git.libreoffice.org/core/+/refs/heads/aoo/trunk (follow the parent links to see more, or clone the repository locally and look at that branch with gitk, which also shows the git notes)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a question totally unrelated to the post, but that I finally decided to ask because of it.In the tweet by Simon Willson at the top of the blog post, he uses the word &#34;against&#34;:  Started experimenting with &#34;git notes&#34; against a new repo [...]

English is not my native tongue, but I always take the use of this preposition as if to state an adversarial relationship between two things, a relationship of opposition between them.
Therefore, sometimes I find it odd the way it is used in programming-related context.
A few examples of what I mean:  - &#34;to program against a standard&#34; instead of &#34;to program based on a standard&#34;
  - &#34;to match against a pattern&#34; instead of &#34;to match the pattern onto the thing&#34;
  - &#34;to compare against a list&#34; instead of &#34;to compare with items from a list&#34;
  - &#34;to file an issue against the repository&#34; instead of &#34;file an issue at the repository&#34;

It is possible (and very likely) that my proposed meanings are grammatically or even semantically wrong,
but I feel that &#34;against&#34; is being correctly used in these examples because I can see a slight opposition between the two things in them,
and I can understand that some people might even find an adversarial relationship there.
However, in the specific case of Simon Willson&#39;s tweet, the use of &#34;against&#34; sounds even more off because I fail to see a repository and Git notes as being adversaries or opposite to each other.
So the question is: is only me, as non-native speaker, that finds this usage (not only Willson&#39;s, but the examples too) a bit weird, or do native speaker also have similar sentiments?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve tried to use git notes over the years but unfortunately notes are tied to a specific commit hash. It&#39;s a blessing and a curse.Works great for some types of review system, or for &#34;tagging&#34; things related to deploy. Notes on commits on the master/main branch, which doesn&#39;t get rebased? Awesome thing, they work.But you can&#39;t as easily use them on branches: the moment a branch whose commits had notes is rebased, and SHAs change, good-bye notes associated with the &#34;previous&#34; SHAs :/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At a place I used to work for, the four day week question was put to the CEO at an all-hands company town hall.Not a fan of the idea, he scoffed and said something like, ‘I pay you to be at your desk from 9am-5.30pm Monday-Friday. Why should I pay you the same for a day less?’I don’t think he realised it at the time, but that answer was devastating to company productivity and morale. He’d just demonstrated to everyone that he didn’t value results and all that was important was bums on seats.People stopped putting in extra effort, waited out their hours as that was all that was required and started brushing up their CVs. I left not long after and so did many others."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the US nuclear navy, the power plants have to be manned 24 hours a day both operating and shutdown. Ships in maintenance periods also generally go through a phase where ship personnel have to support maintenance work around the clock. Additionally, some parts of the training pipeline are run 24 hours a day.I say all that to say that while I am not a subject matter expert, I have a significantly above average amount of experience working various types of rotating shift work as well as duty rotations (a duty rotation is working 24 hours every 2, 3, 4, or 5 days depending on available manpower. Yes, you read that right - for a month, I was at work 28 to 32 out of every 48 hours).Forget 4 8 hour days, I would work 4 10 hour days right now in a heartbeat with no discussion or regrets.1) it is invaluable to have a normal working day where you can do tasks - change your oil, get your haircut, go grocery shopping without a crowd, see a matinee, the list is endless.2) the scope of weekend trip you can plan across 3 days instead of two is exponentially higher. So much room for activities.3) time after the working day just isn&#39;t that useful. Drive home, eat dinner, now it&#39;s 630/7pm. Waste a couple hours, go to sleep. After a 10hour day, the time after work is precious and useful to relax, but then you get a whole other day off.It surely isn&#39;t for everyone, but it surely is for a lot of people. The thing that blows my mind is no one is even willing to try."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I expect to be downvoted for saying this, as some people are really precious about the idea of 4-day work week, but I really struggle to understand how working fewer hours will not result in loss of productivity. If for some reason it is true that working 4 days a week results in the same amount of productivity, then why are 3 days a week not even more productive? Or 2? This is obviously reductio ad absurdum but that would mean that people who work 0 hours are the most productive ones.I know that there is the argument about &#34;if I have fewer hours they will be more focused&#34;, but that to me sounds like it&#39;s entirely wishful thinking and in a few years will be having the same amount of wasted hours in those days too, as people start thinking of Thursday as the new Friday.I assume there is some sort of middle ground between working too much and working too little. Are there any actual evidence that that optimum middle ground is 4 days and not 3, or 5?I would find the whole idea much more palatable if it wasn&#39;t sold by claiming something likely isn&#39;t true (people working fewer hours do more work), and instead someone was honest and admitted that this is a political project.What I find much more interesting is switching from a 7 day week to something else entirely, for example working on: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday is free, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday is free. I can see how that might result in people being more productive, as they still work the same amount of hours, but they don&#39;t get as exhausted as before."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Once again, absolutely amazing. Those are more details of a really interesting internal CPU bug than I could have ever hopes for.Ken, do you think in some future it might be feasible for a hobbyist (even if just a very advanced one like you) to do some sort of precise x-ray imaging that would obviate the need to destructively dismantle the chip? For a chip of that vintage, I mean.Obviously that&#39;s not an issue for 8086 or 6502, since there are more than plenty around. But if there were ever for example an engineering sample appearing, it would be incredibly interesting to know what might have changed. But if it&#39;s the only one, dissecting it could go very wrong and you lose both the chip and the insight it could have given.[1]Also in terms of footnotes, I always meant to ask: I think they make sense as footnotes, but unlike footnotes in a book or paper (or in this short comment), I cannot just let my eyes jump down and back up, which interrupts flow a little. I&#39;ve seen at least one website having footnotes on the side, i.e. in the margin next to the text that they apply to. Maybe with a little JS or CSS to fully unveil then. Would that work?[1] Case in point, from that very errata, I don&#39;t know how rare 8086s with (C)1978 are, but it&#39;s conceivable they could be rare enough that dissolving them to compare the bugfix area isn&#39;t desirable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was at C-Cube Microsystems in the mid 90&#39;s, during the bring-up of a new chip they would test fixes with a FIB (Focused Ion Beam). Basically a direct edit of the silicon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The obvious workaround for this problem is to disable interrupts while you&#39;re changing the Stack Segment register, and then turn interrupts back on when you&#39;re done. This is the standard way to prevent interrupts from happening at a &#34;bad time&#34;. The problem is that the 8086 (like most microprocessors) has a non-maskable interrupt (NMI), an interrupt for very important things that can&#39;t be disabled.Although it&#39;s unclear whether the very first revisions of the 8088 (not 8086) with this bug ended up in IBM PCs, since that would be a few years before its introduction, the original PC and successors have the ability to disable NMI in the external logic via an I/O port."</p>

They have their main store on Shopify, so they didn&#39;t need too much on the backend: only their CRM for keeping customers happy and handling returns and damaged goods and refunds and special sales. Also, on the backend, they had all the integrations with the 3PL, that is, 3rd Party Logistics, which is to say, they worked with external warehouses, because they weren&#39;t ready to have their own warehouses. They did have integrations with the warehouses so they could track inventory levels.So the fun fact is this: they were running entirely on free Heroku dynos.

To illustrate, let&#39;s look at the potential evolution of this vacation shot deliberately chosen for its mediocrity...Then the dynamism is removed by &#39;correcting&#39; the dutch angle to horizon, the surprisingly good color balance is skewed off, and the whole thing gets that circa mid-2000s HDR look from Flickr and Shutterfly and the like where every photo got tone-mapped.Underwhelming of an end result, especially compared to the later color and tone examples (e.g. kitchen superhero)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To me the other algorithms described in the list are more novel and interesting:https://madebyevan.com/algos/crdt-tree-based-indexing/ - for when precise order is critical, like paragraphs in a document. This algorithm is almost like storing adjacency information like a linked list, but is more convergent. Very interesting for [my use-case](https://www.notion.so/blog/data-model-behind-notion).https://madebyevan.com/algos/crdt-mutable-tree-hierarchy/ - for tree-shaped data, like blocks in a Notion page that should have exactly one parent, but allow concurrent re-parenting operationshttps://madebyevan.com/algos/log-spaced-snapshots/ - log space snapshots, for choosing what fidelity of historical information to store. For context, many CRDTs for rich text or sequences store unbounded history so that any edit made at any time can be merged into the sequence. For long-lived documents, this could be impractical to sync to all clients or keep in &#34;hot&#34; memory. Instead, we can decide to compact historical data and move it to cold storage, imposing a time boundary on what writes the system can accept on the hot path. The log-spaced snapshots algorithm here could be used to decide what should be kept &#34;hot&#34;, and how to tune the cold storage."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Slightly off topic...Back before my Phoenix/Elixir days, we used to have to cache almost everything. Now we don&#39;t cache anything -- even with more traffic and less servers. Now, the projects I work on are not getting millions of views every day. But they are still important for many customers.We don&#39;t really design anything that needs to be cached anymore. Just better access patterns and table design as we get wiser.Take Wordpress as an example. There really should not be a need to cache a Wordpress site. But some of the most popular plugins are those that cache. To be fair, I suppose, their legacy non-optimal database design access pattern and code is responsible for this.Just getting something up and aiming for product-market fit is priority #1 and then struggling with caching if it gets popular, at which point, more resources can be thrown at it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Cache coherency ensures that the behavior is correct, but every time a cache is invalidated and the same memory has to be retrieved from main memory again, it pays the performance penalty of reading from main memory.1. First no. If any such rereads occur, they will be from the LLC (last-level cache, or L3 cache for Intel/AMD CPUs).2. Second no. IIRC, modern caches are snooping and/or directory caches. This means that when Core#0 says &#34;I&#39;m changing cacheline X&#34;, Core#0 knows that Core#1 has it in its L2 (or deeper) caches. So Core#0 will publish the results of that change to Core#13. The examples they gave are missing read/write barriers, which are rather important. #2 will only happen during read/write barriers. That is to say: your code is memory-unsafe by default. If order and cache-invalidation matters, you actually need a barrier instruction (!!!) to make sure all these messages are passed to the right place at the right time.---------For better or for worse, modern CPU design is about doing things thread-unsafe by default. If the programmer recognizes a problem may occur, it is the responsibility of the programmer to put the memory barriers in the right place.This is because the CPU is not the only thing that can reorder things... but also the cache system... as well as the compiler. So memory barriers inform the compiler + CPU + cache system when to synchronize.The original Netflix article is more precisely worded.&gt; This consistency is ensured with so-called “cache coherency protocol.”With a link to MESIF (F for Forwarding state, which is one such protocol / way to share L1 cache info without going all the way to LLC or DRAM)I&#39;m pretty sure that GPUs actually invalidate the cache dumbly, without any MESI / MESIF (or whatever). GPUs are actually really bad at these kinds of ping-pong operations and synchronization... preferring thread-fences and other synchronization mechanisms instead.------That being said, I think the blogpost is a good introduction to the subject. But note that its a bit imprecise with some of the low level details. I guess its correct for the GPU-world though, so its not completely inaccurate...-----The original Netflix article has an even more difficult problem revolving around Java&#39;s Superclass cache and how it is affecting &#34;true sharing&#34; of caches. I&#39;m not very familiar with JVM internals, so I lost track of the discussion at that point."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m not laid off but actively looking to change after spending a couple of years at my current employer. Despite being a staff engineer, managing 12 engineers, and having a solid revenue stream tied to my current team - I&#39;ve mostly gotten rejections without interviews, 1-2 low ball offers, or radio silence. I cannot imagine how hard this must be for those laid-off, hopefully this storm passes soon.EDIT: you cannot make this up, it&#39;s a saturday and we got an email 1/3 of our team got laid off (I didn&#39;t yet, but I have a feeling it might happen soon)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I keep getting the same amount of emails from recruiters as before, mostly startups.Found a new job (non-startup) by responding to one of those. Signed the offer and was going to quit FB on a certain date, then got the FB layoff severance package a week before that date as a nice bonus.I also interviewed at Google and got the thumbs up to proceed to team matching, but no team matches after a month. This makes me believe that they have at least a partial hiring freeze, although their recruiters are pretending that this is not the case - they&#39;re just saying that team matching takes a bit longer. Google interviews were useful as practice for the other jobs, but not for actually getting an offer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those of you feeling down about being ignored, keep in mind this is the slowest hiring time of the year, with holidays and vacations, and end of year budgets.Even in down markets, hiring tends to pick up in January as managers get their hiring budgets for the new year and are back in the office.Hang in there!"</p>
