								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hiii everyone, this is my first time posting here! I have read Hacker News sometimes but only thought about sharing my own post after seeing Manara&#39;s post (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25849054) last month. I asked them if I can share this here and they said it was a good idea. :)I’m a 19-year-old Gazan female who participated in Manara last year and got internships at Google and Repl.it. I’m so excited I will spend this summer at Google in Europe! I got lots of questions about my experience when people heard about it on Facebook so I wrote this blog post to let other young engineers in Palestine and the Middle East know how they can get into amazing companies like this too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I interviewed Dalia and a few other people referred to us by Manara at Repl.it. It was such a pleasure meeting kids that are so smart and have an insane drive.We have a really high bar for hiring at Repl.it, Dalia and the other youngsters from Palestine performed better than at least half the experienced engineers I&#39;ve interviewed in the past. We extended an offer to one Dalia&#39;s classmates and he started yesterday as an intern with high potential for full-time, as our internships usually are since we invest a lot in them.It was such a pleasure meeting you Dalia, wish you all the best. Hope to work with you in the future (maybe when we can offer US visas).P.S. We&#39;re still hiring"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"First of all - big props to Dalia. She clearly worked her behind off to earn those offers.Second - this definitely, to me, proves that Manara has a good business model. I actually don&#39;t think the fact that the Manara students are from MENA is all that important though. However, I do think that their extremely hands-on, and intensive &#34;bootcamp for FAANG interviewing&#34; model is clearly an advantage for early career technical candidates.Thinking back to my college days (in the US, mid 2010s) - we were not given any sort of class that focused on professional interviewing. The college career center was also very general, and not knowledgeable about the specifics of passing the coding interviews. The best advice I got was a recommendation from a guest lecturer to read &#34;cracking the coding interview&#34; (which to be fair, was better than nothing).As a result, the people from my school who did the best right out of the gate, were largely people who already knew people already in a FAANG roles and who could rely on that person for a referral, interview advice and practice feedback. Our school was not in SV (or anywhere close), so realistically, that was not an option for most of us. Additionally, I always applied for internships at FAANG companies while I was still a student - but never even got called in to interview - so it wasn&#39;t like I could practice that way either. I ended up doing fine for myself by accumulating a good base of practical experience from local non-FAANG companies before graduating, but I really believe my peers, and aspirational novice engineers of all backgrounds would have benefited greatly from having a hands-on course like Dalia described. I especially would love to see efforts like that extending out to under-served communities here in the US as well (native american reservations, appalachians, rust belt cities)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not much better if you end up being a GCP customer.My company has gone through 4 reps in 3 years. Every time we get a new GCP rep they just want to talk to us about &#34;expanding our use of GCP offerings&#34;. The only thing they want to talk about is starting to use BigQuery - not my business at all.I signed up for a Google Cloud Security summit, and afterwards a sales rep reached out me. It was obvious from the start they had no idea I was a gsuite or GCP customer. They then directed me to a NEW account manager (#4) even though I had been working with a different one. I had worked with the prior account rep going over our architecture to make sure everything was kosher (sustained use discounts etc). I even made them a schematic of our architecture on GCP at their request. Once I provided that to them I was met with radio silence.It&#39;s really insulting, and to me obvious they don&#39;t care about my company at all. We&#39;re looking at other options.I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if somehow this post leads to me getting an email from another rep &#34;Wanting to start over and doing things right&#34;, which will inevitably devolve into the discussion of how can I use BigQuery."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Title should maybe be switched to &#34;Google Cloud vs AWS Onboarding Comparison for YC companies&#34;.Not to say that isn&#39;t a useful article on its own, but it&#39;s hard to draw too many meaningful conclusions for the rest of us when the first line of the AWS bullet points is &#34;reach out to dedicated YC email&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to be a huge fan of GCP and bet on it to power my startup, and have come to greatly regret it.Recently, I needed to increase a CPU-limit quota from a small number (like 16 vCPUs to 64 vCPUs) - nothing crazy. In the past, the quota increase system was more or less automated and would only take a few minutes to process.This time, however, GCP denied my quota increase and forced me to schedule a call with a sales rep in order to process the quota increase. It was the biggest waste of time and kind of goes against the entire point of instant cloud resizing.It also feels like the velocity of new features, instance types, etc has slowed down dramatically in the past year. Also, while I&#39;m ranting, Google Cloud SQL is probably the worst cloud service I&#39;ve ever used  (and it costs an arm and a leg for the pleasure!)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Putting aside the good-plane/bad-plane discussion, this program is the poster child for one of my pet wishes: that the costs of government programs would be expressed in $/tax-payer.  There are about 100M tax payers in the US; this program is expected to cost about $1,500,000M; so the F35 program is expected to cost about $15,000 per tax payer.  True: that&#39;s over 50 years; still, un-discounted, that&#39;s $300/year/tax-payer.The Covid bailout last year was about $60,000 per tax payer (https://www.covidmoneytracker.org/).  How much of your $60,000 did you see?I&#39;m not arguing for or against these programs; I&#39;m arguing for expressing them in comprehensible terms.  $6,000,000,000,000 societal total; or $60,000 for you.  Do you expect to receive $15,000 of value from the F35 program?  I&#39;m not sure I won&#39;t: perhaps it&#39;ll keep oil/energy prices stable and I spent well more than $300/year on energy..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The saddest thing about all of this IMO is they have been working on this for 14 years, and how much money was spent/wasted? Now, read about Skunkworks - they were able to build the SR71 (without supercomputers) in less than half that time and for a fraction of the cost.This isn&#39;t just planes, this seems to be everything nowadays. Fission was discovered in 1938/1939 and we dropped two bombs on Japan in 1945. No chance we could do something like that in this toxic environment of today.I know Peter Thiel is not popular here, but his conversations about technological progress seem to be spot on: we just cant build cool shit anymore. I really did want a flying car, and all I have is 140 characters and promises of AI that never come true.Maybe, you could say there are some exceptions like CRISPR, but that is TBD."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I guess along the way, the activity of designing and building the plane became more important than the outcome / functionality of the plane itself.You see it all the time in projects.  People look busy and seem like they&#39;re building things, so some progress must be happening.  Or is it?Blink an eye, and in a couple years you unwittingly accumulated a platform that served to fulfill every random team&#39;s desire to load on requirements, systems, electronics, sensors (&#34;go find out what people want!&#34;), with very few people making the countervailing decision to trade off / cut things for an overall desired outcome (&#34;what do they actually demonstrate -- not say -- they need?&#34;).Well, they didn&#39;t have to pay for it, so there was no harm in giving their requirements.  And if the actual willing payor (Congress) had little incentive (or technical chops) to be ruthless about costs or actual useful output, well then there&#39;s few checks on that happening.  Until some top level general says, &#34;why aren&#39;t these hugely expensive planes being used like we thought they would be?&#34;  Too late.I guess it kept people employed in the meantime.  How can you cut 10% of the workforce in Huntsville when the representative sits on the Armed Services committee?  (I don&#39;t know that, but just for example...) Which, sometimes, is a national goal in itself for strategic purposes.It might be good though, to have a more deliberate plan about these kinds of things, if that&#39;s the goal."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26246435">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lots of nostalgia about Fry’s here. Well, I have a different take. Fry’s was my first job, and my first introduction to wage slavery. They never at any point cared about employee health or well-being. Breaks were the state minimum. Pay was the state minimum. The entire staff (and there were hundreds back in the day, when the checkout line would back up into the store even with 20 registers open) shared one 7x7 beige break room. It looked like something from Prison Architect, just an old tube TV with bent bunny ears (you weren’t allowed to turn it on though, it was for training) and the stale smell of cigarette smoke. Knowledge was irrelevant, it was all about sales. SPIFs (bounty-style sales commissions) and revenue ruled the day. Aside from that, the owners didn’t care; cliques and in-groups ruled hiring and firing in the absence of leadership. Stores were always falling apart even when they were new. I don’t think anything over 7’ up was ever dusted; even 20 years ago, it was so thick in some places you couldn’t see the paint. The repair bar employees would regularly rifle through customers’ hard drivers and keep the juciest pictures.Just another cynical retail empire, pumped hard and drained dry by its owners while the foundation rotted from below. May they build condos on its grave."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m not surprised, but this makes me feel incredibly sad. I built my first PC using parts from there. I’m going to miss it.But once Fry’s pivoted to be a consignment store that was mostly empty and selling pallets of bottled water and perfume, it was obvious the business was about to die.Curiously, Microcenter has managed to live on and seems fairly robust. I can’t help but think Fry’s tried to sell too many different products and had a massive amount of floorspace to keep up. Whereas my local Microcenter just sticks to electronics and the store is much smaller and feels cramped in comparison."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I graduated college in 1985 and moved cross country to Sunnyvale for work. Fry&#39;s was a supermarket chain, and at the time there was one and only one location that was trying out carrying computer stuff, on the east side of Lawrence Ave I think, before they moved to the west side of Lawrence.They weren&#39;t yet fully committed to it. Half the store was produce and such -- milk, eggs, lettuce, etc, and the other half was rows of TTL parts, memory chips, diodes, capacitors, and resistors. It blew my mind. I bought a 68000 CPU, 128KB of DRAM chips (64Kx1 density back then), a perf board, wirewrap wire and a wrapping tool, EPROMs, sockets, and built my first computer all from parts I bought at that Fry&#39;s.About 60 seconds away from Fry&#39;s was Computer Literacy -- a really great bookstore that, as the name implies, had nothing but computer related books. It wasn&#39;t 20 copies of &#34;Computers for Dummies&#34; books. The vast majority of inventory were single copies of the most arcane stuff -- all sorts of college level CS textbooks, and you could ask the desk to order just about anything if you knew the title of it.I sent a lot of money and time in both locations. Silicon Valley felt like a magical place back then."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve always wanted to write a book. I have helped write 3  different deeply technical books (and one solutions manual), but I wanted something fun, interesting, and valuable.So I wrote &#34;Everyday Data Science&#34; which is a collection of stories, tutorials, jokes, math, and code all written to inspire people to analyze their personal data.In general, I was also inspired by the challenge to &#34;make $100 online&#34; which I have done in the past month since launching. It was daunting, and I felt quite vulnerable, but overall I&#39;m pleased with what I&#39;ve made.I wrote up this quick post to give you an idea of the process I followed to write the book, and some of the content.I&#39;d love to know your thoughts and am open to (nice) feedback :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"@andrewncThe book looks very intriguing! Before buying it, I wish I could read a bit more about what one could expect from the book. Let me explain :)&gt; This book is for people as untechnical as my Mom or as technical as my Applied Scientist friends working in big tech.&gt; ODEs On A DietDo you present an intuitive explanation of ODEs? Would both your mom and an Applied Scientist find it informative? If yes, I would love to read! A few pages from this chapter would really help in making a purchasing decision.&gt; a solution to Multi-Armed Bandit problems which are significantly more efficient and only takes a few lines of extra code.Does the book include code samples? As someone wanting to learn about, e.g., ODEs through code, I would love it code samples were present in the book.I understand that $7.99 is not a lot in the US, but it is not the case in a few other parts of the world. Given that there are no refunds, having more information about the book would be valuable for international customers.BUT... the books looks great, and big congratulations on publishing it!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice! Real-world problems like these  are what spurred my interest in statistics/data science, and I agree with your sentiment that intro stats books are a terrible way to cultivate enthusiasm and curiosity about ways to solve problems using data.In my experience, the most difficult parts of the process are (1) translating from qualitative problems “in the field” to a formalized technical problem, and (2) all the wrangling necessary to implement the formal problem using field-collected data.I find that I spend most of my time as a data scientist working on these parts of the process, and often don’t have the bandwidth or even requirement for more advanced methods. Not that fancy techniques are the goal, per se, but I do notice I rarely have the opportunity to use them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you like stocks and are careful with the way you spend your money, you know how much time goes into buying shares of a stock. It’s tedious and I don’t have 24k for a Bloomberg terminal. Which led me to the idea during xmas break to spend the time creating my own terminal. I introduce you to “Gamestonk Terminal” (probably should’ve sent 1 tweet everyday to Elon Musk for copyrights permission eheh).In summary, the Terminal (https://github.com/DidierRLopes/GamestonkTerminal) has 7 distinct menus:
- Discover Stocks
Top gainers; Sectors performance; upcoming earnings releases; top high shorted interest stocks; top stocks with low float; top orders on fidelity; and some SPAC websites with news/calendars.- Market Sentiment
Scrolling through Reddit main posts, and most tickers mentions; Extracting stocktwit sentiment based on bull/bear flags; Twitter in-depth sentiment prediction using AI; Google mentions over time.- Research Web pages
List of good pages to do research on a stock, e.g. macroaxis, zacks, macrotrends, ..- Fundamental Analysis
Read financials from a company from Market Watch, Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, and Financial Modeling Prep API.- Technical Analysis
The usual technical indicators: sma, rsi, macd, adx, bbands, and more.- Due Diligence
Some features are: Latest news of the company; Analyst prices and ratings; Price target from several analysts plot over time vs stock price; Insider activity, and these timestamps marked on the stock price historical data; Latest SEC fillings; Short interest over time; A check for financial warnings based on Sean Seah book.- Prediction Techniques
The one I had more fun with. It tries to predict the stock price, from simple models like sma and arima to complex neural network models, like LSTM. The additional capability here is that all of these are easy to configure. Either through command line arguments, or even in form of a configuration file to define your NN."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Should probably rewrite it in rust, to solve the markets memory leaks, otherwise everything will keep going up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;...that has been developed for fun, while I saw my GME shares tanking.&#34;&#34;Spare time&#34;...Wasn&#39;t that only several weeks ago? This is an incredible feature set! How many hours did you put into this?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For the non-lawyers: as the article indicates (but doesn’t really explain), this is a ruling on a request for temporary relief (called a “preliminary injunction”). This is not a final judgment. It can (and presumably will) also be subject to appeal. Nothing remotely final about this. The judge has simply said: “CA, you can go ahead and enforce your law for now.”Now, this does also mean the judge would quite likely ULTIMATELY rule in CA’s favor. But it is not a guarantee. And, as I said, then there’s appellate and Supreme Court review.For reference, the 4-element test/standard for a preliminary injunction generally accepted in US courts is set out here:“[G]enerally a plaintiff seeking preliminary injunctive relief must satisfy a four-factor test: (1) that he or she is likely to succeed on the merits of his claims; (2) that he or she is likely to suffer irreparable harm without preliminary relief; (3) the balance of equities between the parties support an injunction; and (4) the injunction is in the public interest.”https://www.americanbar.org/groups/litigation/committees/wom..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m hopeful as the judge seems to understand the ISP strategy:&gt; Mendez reportedly was not swayed by ISPs&#39; claims that a net neutrality law isn&#39;t necessary because they haven&#39;t been blocking or throttling Internet traffic.&gt; &#34;I have heard that argument and I don&#39;t find it persuasive,&#34; Mendez said, according to The Hollywood Reporter. &#34;It&#39;s going to fall on deaf ears. Everyone has been on their best behavior since 2018, waiting for whatever happened in the DC Circuit [court case over the FCC&#39;s repeal of net neutrality]. I don&#39;t place weight on the argument that everything is fine and we don&#39;t need to worry.&#34;"</p>

Anything visible on your screen will display in your Work Diary, but you have the option, in Settings, to choose whether the screen captures your entire desktop or only the active screen.Are people aware UpWork encourages monitoring freelancers like this? I would never work for a platform that promotes this or want to subject someone to being monitored like this.Can you really not ask the client questions before submitting a proposal either?Is all this just taking advantage of freelancers who don&#39;t know how to market themselves, or am I missing something?For all the freelance projects I&#39;ve found myself, some detailed discussion was required beforehand to check what the client really needs, and I aim for terms that don&#39;t lead to being micromanaged (like fixed price projects based on results not time) so I can&#39;t see the appeal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to be a freelancer, finding work mainly on Upwork, and I loathe them now.What started as a 10% commission was upped to 20%, and they tried to do various tricks on both clients and freelancers to a point that I stopped doing freelance work altogether.It was a great platform, and I don&#39;t think a 10% clear cut wasn&#39;t enough for them for an organic growth.Another thing I loathe is LinkedIn. I&#39;m sure many people find their next job through LinkedIn, but it baffles me why LinkedIn would even exist today, being an social network, communication platform, a portfolio, and all of them in a very awkward position, and not being very good at any of them.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been on Upwork as a buyer for years. It’s tremendous for getting great talent on a short term basis. Top rate I’ve paid I think is some close to or just over $100/hour, so it’s definitely not just for low-end stuff.I’ve learned (the hard way) about being very, very clear with deliverables and expectations. Based on the average response I get on Upwork, it would seem the median buyer is much more susceptible to contractors blowing smoke. So one has to be careful.But overall, as several hundred thousand dollars client over the years, it’s been a godsend."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"D3.js is, to me, one of those tools that makes things possible rather than making things easy (although I only use javascript once every year or two so it&#39;s always a slog). This is big: it&#39;s like a zero-to-one step, rather than incremental progress.This fall I made an interactive visualization of the fine-grained plate tectonic model I have built for the Himalaya and Tibet for a research project[0].  The model building process (i.e., finding the relative motions of the plates) is largely solving a system of linear equations, so it&#39;s not immediately apparent what the results really mean and whether they are acceptably realistic.D3.js allows me to explore and understand my own scientific results so much more thoroughly than the static quiver plots that I was making in Matplotlib--being able to pan and zoom a globe (not just a projected map!) and see the tectonic plates move through time is phenomenal. Being able to share the results so trivially as a web page is a huge force multiplier as well.Thanks so much, Mike![0]: http://rocksandwater.net/blog/2020/11/tibet-blocks-js/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love D3 and am always shocked by Mike Bostock’s willingness to help. Ten years of D3, yes, but ten years also of Mike answering questions in great detail across GitHub, SO, Twitter, etc. And that’s on top of maintenance + running a startup. Some people just have unbelievable drive.In other news, I’ve enjoyed using D3 over the years, and always jump on visualization projects as a result. Here’s my favorite thing I’ve made while I was learning D3:  https://www.jwilber.me/permutationtest/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don’t think it’s bad advice but having shipped multiple (really bad) games, I think it misses the two biggest/best pieces of advice I’ve gotten:
1. GDDs are probably a distraction if you’re a solo dev - prototyping and grayboxing a lot and looking for the fun mechanics without any art/music/story to get in the way or distract is essential 
2. If you’re truly just starting (and don’t already have a sense of fun), absolute best way to start is to carbon-copy a game you find fun, then start adding/tweaking elements. 
This both builds the mindset required to make games, and helps you get into the “fun iteration” loop quickly without getting bogged down in writing a lot of interesting technical systems that don’t end up contributing to the game in a meaningful way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve written some learnings after shipped my first game: https://ruoyusun.com/2018/06/15/guide-for-non-game-dev.htmlAs a professional software dev, I&#39;ve noticed that while both game dev and software dev are &#34;writing code&#34;, they are done in a very different way.As a software dev, the value proposition is more or less clear before you start writing code. As a game dev, you can only start to see your value proposition after you have finished your code - that&#39;s why game code, especially as an indie without clear distinction between prototype and production phase, tend to become spaghetti really quick - and that&#39;s fine. If you spend too much time to make the code look nice, then you are not spending enough time to make the game actually fun.Software usually has some logic behind it - it has to make &#34;sense&#34;. A game doesn&#39;t necessarily have to make sense - it needs to &#34;feel right&#34; and &#34;fun&#34;. That means your nicely designed abstractions actually won&#39;t be reusable - copy &amp; paste is much more pragmatic. You can start to look to refactor after your game is actually successful (or fun at least) but even then you will realize that most of the code is not reusable.A big part of your game code is actually &#34;content&#34;, instead of &#34;systems&#34; - meaning they are closer to a &#34;script&#34; than a well architectured software code. So you write more if-else and less inheritance and encapsulation (unless you are writing your own engine, then in that case, your engine code is actually close to software projects).And if you hate writing UI for software, you&#39;ll hate writing UI for games even more."</p>
