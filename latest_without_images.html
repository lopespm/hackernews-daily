								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It’s a really powerful article, and it’s hard to argue with any of it. What a nightmare it must be to have what happened to Amanda Knox happen to you. A totally innocent person, who was not only imprisoned for years for a crime she had nothing to do with, but also had her name dragged in the mud by the global press for years. To such an extent that most casual observers still think she had something to do with the crime.It’s clear that the filmmakers have no legal obligation to Knox (and she acknowledges as much in the article), but I think it is equally clear that they have a moral obligation to not slander her using a thinly veiled fictional character.It’s a shame too, because the real “Amanda Knox saga” would make for a much more interesting movie: what is it like to have your roomate murdered, your life destroyed, and your identity robbed from you by the global tabloid press? That’s the real Amanda Knox story."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fascinating article.  I thought she was exaggerating when she complained about people accusing her of being a media whore, until I scrolled down to the [flagged] [dead] and saw someone doing just that.But I don&#39;t think she has a choice.  In the past, it would&#39;ve been possible for someone in her shoes to choose obscurity.  In the past, the real Amanda Knox and the idea of Amanda Knox that exists in the collective unconscious of the media and media consumers would&#39;ve drifted apart.  Now, it&#39;s hard to imagine how that could happen.  Even if she invented a new identity and moved to a small town in Alaska (which would be a new kind of prison sentence in some ways), it&#39;d be newsworthy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting to me how the truth got lost, and how uninterested people are in the aftermath.  The real killer ended up with a sentence almost half the length of what Amanda Knox got.  And he is already out of prison.  Italy&#39;s justice system is very different from the US&#39;s, for better or worse."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m torn badly with Amazon. After read The Everything Store, and what has been written all over the place, Jeff Bezos is a massive turd. Employees are horribly treated, wages suppressed, and all sorts of terrible and abusive practices.Then it comes time for me to buy something. I needed a new pair of size 14 sneakers. I drove to Adidas, Footlocker, dicks, and a few other stores but I just couldn’t justify $100 sneakers that didn’t look like prison issued.Opened my Amazon app in my car after leaving the crowded mall, and find what appear to be a decent pair of shoes. FakeSpot agreed with the reviews, and I bought then for $35. They will arrive tomorrow.That kind of convenience is terribly addicting. I haven’t figured out the solution, but I remember what it was like when Walmart came to town, put others out of business, mistreated employees, etc. We were unable to stop it then, how the heck are we going to stop it now?So aside from “just stop buying from Amazon” what can we do ?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That makes Amazon #3, after the federal government and Walmart:     Entity        US Employees
  1. US Government         2.7M
  2. Walmart               1.6M
  3. Amazon                1.0M

If Amazon continues to grow at current rates, it will surpass Walmart&#39;s figure within 2 years.Looking at these figures, it&#39;s evident that these three entities are far larger, wealthier, more connected, and likely more powerful than the vast majority of US cities, the vast majority of small countries in the world, and maybe even a few smaller US states."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m not sure why everyone continually romanticizes brick and mortar retail. Its terribly inefficient, and wasteful of time, energy, space etc.Think of all the Walmart, Dicks, Big Lots parking lots and strip malls that could be converted into better space. Think of how much waste there is when you have to pack, unpack, stage and repack merchandise.Amazon’s distribution is a superior business model which is why it is popular. I’d also reckon that the carbon footprint per package is lower if you account for the driving that is required for more traditional shopping.I’d rather see more competition using a similar business model than a return to concrete strip malls full of big box retailers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author of the referenced blog (and library) here. This is great!The full text search engine in SQLite is sadly not really good for this - one reason is that it uses standard B-Trees, another is that it forces storing all token positions if you want BM25 sorting, which is a huge overhead for articles as long as Wikipedia&#39;s.But that doesn&#39;t mean full text search isn&#39;t possible in a very efficient manner with statically hosted data! I wrote a proof of concept of making the Rust-based tantivy library work in the same way, which has a lot of internal things that can make the index much smaller and more efficient than SQLite&#39;s. It&#39;s also &gt;10x faster in creating the search index.Here&#39;s the demo also for Wikipedia: https://demo.phiresky.xyz/tmp-ytccrzsovkcjoylr/dist/index.ht...
I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s more efficient than the SQlite version in this form, but it definitely has more upward potential and is more fun to work with.And the corresponding draft PR: https://github.com/tantivy-search/tantivy/pull/1067I sadly haven&#39;t gotten around to working on it more and writing an article about it.Other people are also working on using this stuff to make Sci-hub and LibGen more available by using this in combination with IPFS for distributed and &#34;uncensorable&#34; hosting which is pretty awesome.Edit: Just realized that the OP demo only searches in article titles, while mine searches in full article contents by default. You can search in only the titles in my demo by querying `title:harry title:potter`"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Shocked to find out that this is very much a static website, it&#39;s &#34;merely&#34; downloading a small portion of the 43GB SQLite file in question with HTTP Range requests, and then it uses a WASM-compiled copy of SQLite to query the requested data. Very impressive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m nervous on your behalf for your S3 bill, have you done napkin maths for how much this will cost to host, especially given the relative inefficiency of the autocomplete queries?A trick that might help: create a separate SQLite table containing just the article titles to autocomplete against. That might give you queries that use smaller ranges of the file."</p>

					<h3><a href="https://phys.org/news/2021-07-exotic-particle-tetraquark.html">New exotic matter particle, a tetraquark, discovered at CERN</a></h3>
				</div>
				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28008771">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The new particle contains two charm quarks and an up and a down antiquark. Several tetraquarks have been discovered in recent years (including one with two charm quarks and two charm antiquarks), but this is the first one that contains two charm quarks, without charm antiquarks to balance them.This is not the first time a tetraquark has been measured, but instead it&#39;s the first time a tetraquark with two charm quarks and no charm antiquarks. That&#39;s still nice work, but I was initially confused by the headline (&#34;didn&#39;t they discover those already?&#34;)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Quarks are the fundamental building blocks from which matter is constructed.&#34;I sometimes wish would include &#34;In our current model&#34;,
&#34;We now think that&#34;, or some other qualifier.Such absolute statements have been made frequently prior to our current understanding.I have no special knowledge to lead me to believe that quarks are not the end all of parties.But I was happy with atom being the fundamental thing, 
and then electrons, neutrons, protons were the thing as well.The other day I read about Fractons &#34;quasiparticles or Partial Particles&#34;, so now I have to figure those out as well.I have lost track if the graviton has been found yet.
I dont think it has.From a purely layman&#39;s sense of esthetics the current model for particle physics is messy and a little spooky.I have an odd hobby.
I collect old paper encyclopedias from pre 1970
For every language that I speak.  
It takes up MASSIVE amounts of space.The oldest I have been able to acquire on a limited budget
Is 1880.It is always fun to track concepts over time.They all state what the world is like, and how it works as bombastic facts.Yet over time, most of it gets replaced or at least highly refined
and things are removed.Particle physics is an active field with much still to learn or figure out.
Let us keep that in mind."</p>

					<h3><a href="https://daisyui.com/">DaisyUI – Tailwind CSS Components</a></h3>
				</div>
				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28004515">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We&#39;ve gone full circle - CSS components to inline CSS-in-HTML back to CSS components.But I actually think I will use this. A big problem with CSS is that you end up making overrides no matter how composable you make the classes. And some simple things (e.g. responsiveness) are unintuitive and / or annoying to do in CSS. Hence Tailwind&#39;s &#34;CSS-in-HTML&#34; mini classes. But that doesn&#39;t fill the core purpose of CSS, bigger general-purpose classes to avoid repetition. Combine the two (general classes + mini classes for slight case-by-case fixes) and you get the best CSS experience I&#39;ve seen so far (at least I think, I haven&#39;t tried it yet)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m not saying this is ugly but the visual execution of some of these components is poor. No good usage of padding in some examples, poor ratios between the typography and the containers, inconsistent use of different line widths and border radius, weird and incosistent design choices in spacing and proportions…I mean. This looks alright and it will certainly make any UI look pretty decent, but the execution is not superb like the actual TailwindUI library which is incredibly well thought from a visual design perspective. Those components are perhaps less shiny than these but they are incredibly functional and way more intentional.This is a good effort though and I hope to see it improving."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ok, I&#39;ll guess I&#39;ll be the lone voice of dissent here. I don&#39;t like it. I think it goes against the concept of utility classes / functional CSS. As soon as you start making component-level classes, things begin to become opinionated and you lose the universality.My understanding of the functional CSS approach was that you&#39;d make a button component, and use the variety of &#34;atomic&#34; classes to style it. If you&#39;re using a &#34;btn&#34; class etc, it muddles the distinction of where the semantics live, and things get harder to reason about / debug."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28006679">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Beautiful. The nostalgia hit me very hard with this.I remember in the original version you had all sorts of options, and could even combine screensavers.For people who may not remember: screensavers used to be a neccessity as old CRT tubes would &#39;burn in&#39; an image if they held it static for too long - leaving a shadow of the static image permanently. Screensavers kicked in after a few minutes and displayed something dynamic so as to save your screen from burn in.In the 90&#39;s, having a cool custom screensaver was cool (around the same time that having a custom ringtone on your 3210 was cool), and you&#39;d pay money for software like After Dark."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"https://uxfactor.ca/1151/I know one of the authors of Flying Toasters and sent him the link. Here&#39;s what he had to say:&#34;It&#39;s a rough approximation, which is super cool, but misses all of the nuance.&#34;You see, back in the day, there were very strong competitors to After Dark that had as much or more animations. The thing that set After Dark was a &#34;je ne sais quoi&#34; that felt like an elevated experience. Both the customers &amp; the competitors thought this was some sort of accident, or that the animations were important, but neither of these things was true.&#34;The secret was that people loved the nuance of interacting with the product (&amp; subtlety in the animations) and it was very carefully designed with cognitive science. I pushed the team very hard before I would let anything be released because I insisted on the nuance.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was a kid in the 90s learning to program, writing screen savers was one of the best ways to demo your &#34;skills&#34;. Also just something creative to do when you didn&#39;t really have a project in mind. I still think they&#39;re an underappreciated art form, and it&#39;s kind of disappointing that OSX only ships with a couple really basic ones. Apple should bundle in all the AfterDark modules (there were several releases).There was also an amazing set of screensavers which I don&#39;t remember the name of, but one of the set was called &#39;kaos&#39;, and a lot of them were based on fractals. If anyone recalls the name of that software...[edit] I found it! DarkSide of the Mac by Tom Dowdy. Brilliant. http://poubelle.com/DarkSideDocs.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been working remote for about 10 years.I&#39;ve had &#34;real&#34; offices.  I&#39;ve worked in open-plan offices.  I&#39;ve had a home office.  I&#39;ve worked from bed.There are tons of good ways to do it.Lately I swap between a kitchen table and a chair on my porch. I no longer use multiple screens, I&#39;ve just gotten really fast at swapping windows on my 15&#34; laptop; I&#39;ve gotten good at figuring out how wide my terminal window breaks should be and where my browser dev tools should sit.Surely there are more optimal ways of doing stuff.  Odds are that there is a Taylorist approach that would pull more productivity out of me.  But much like my typing speed (~50WPM) isn&#39;t really the limiting factor in my programming skill, screen real estate isn&#39;t a big factor in getting stuff done for me.But the big thing for me is that, in the end, it&#39;s fine for me to switch stuff up on a monthly or quarterly or yearly basis.I could never have done that when I was in an office.  I couldn&#39;t take 20 min and play banjo or accordion and come back to my problem with a fresh eye.  I couldn&#39;t put on my laundry and hang it up while I listen to other folks on the daily stand up.  I couldn&#39;t start my lunch cooking in the instapot while waiting for a script to finish running.It would take a hard, hard sell to get me back in an office, not matter how much real and legitimate enjoyment and utility other folks get in an office."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For the past 2 weeks, I&#39;ve been working from a treadmill. It has been incredible. I got a small under-the-desk treadmill for my standing desk and I walk at about 2.5km/hour and get around 20,000 steps in per day. It has improved my mood, my clarity, and also has improved my sleep (because I&#39;m tired of walking). I also find it easier to focus on tasks for some reason.If you can make a setup like this work for you, I highly recommend it. Your body will thank you in the long run.EDIT&gt;&gt; A few of you are asking about the model. I actually bought 2, one for myself and one for my partner, who also loves it.This one is mine https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V7F8QYK. I got it when it had a $100-off coupon, so the price wasn&#39;t as steep. No real complaints so far, except you can&#39;t store it upright. I just roll it out of the way when I want to sit.The one for my partner is https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0895DRWVY. She likes it. It&#39;s a little smaller and can be stored upright and out of the way, which is nice. There have been complaints about the remote (and it only comes with 1), but the manufacturer claims to ship new remotes free of charge if yours breaks.They&#39;re both a little quirky with a very simple LCD screen. Supposedly mine has an app integration for step counting, but I just use my phone in my pocket. They both get the job done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Survey seems pretty flawed and potentially biased. The survey was done by a contractor/home improvement company so maybe they used customer&#39;s as their population?While SWEs might need/want a good desk setup, many office jobs just don&#39;t need it. I&#39;m not sure people are really improvising but rather find sitting with a laptop is how they normally work anyway.And working in the bedroom can be misleading... it&#39;s often a private place you can put a proper desk.I WFH and went from living alone to having 3 roommates who all WFH. I have my bed, desk, and theater setup all in the (master bedroom). It&#39;s actually better than a 1bdr apartment, it&#39;s quieter (no leafblowers!) and I don&#39;t have dirty dishes right behind me.I have a small desk but a 4K 32&#34; monitor and a vertical 1080p one. A microphone on an arm and NO webcam; I use screen sharing 90% of the time but I don&#39;t need to see peoples faces. (I really wish video calling didn&#39;t compress &gt;1080p screens so much). If I need a webcam, I use my laptop.Maybe the pandemic changed things but you could get decent chairs for $20 at goodwill.I guess I&#39;m just skeptical that a majority of people have difficulty working from their home... You know the place you live and pick your own furniture."</p>
