								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another argument against the &#34;going dark&#34; claim is that before smartphones and the internet, the only conversations the FBI could monitor was through phonelines and mail. These were known to be easily monitored and I doubt there was much more criminal activity happening through those then than now.I would argue that the conversations that have gone online are the interactions that were previously happening in-person (at least in term of criminal activity), to which the FBI didn&#39;t have access before.There is something Orwellian with the idea that there shouldn&#39;t be a word that can be pronounced in the country that the government cannot record and listen to after the fact. The limits of what is legal or not have always moved (see homosexuality, drug and alcohol consumption, etc). So a 100% enforcement of the law is counter-intuitively undesirable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I dont understand why the US people still trust these agencies. FBI, CIA, NSA have all shown to act against the democracy in many cases. If they could be trusted, they could be trusted with a backdoor. Since they cannot be trusted, the backdoor only makes them a more dangerous enemy of the people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FWIW, I&#39;ve had a warrant executed against me by the FBI. They seized every electronic device I own, and forcibly took my biometric data(fingerprints, face scan, retinal scan) in the hopes they could unlock my devices with it. They were unable to access any LUKS-encrypted volumes, and were less than happy about that situation. Can&#39;t say much else unless I&#39;m good with 99x anxiety for the next few days.ps: not charged, not convicted, very innocent. not a fan of the justice dept."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very interesting, these kinds of articles are (to me) some of the best content we get on here.I&#39;m no expert in any of the languages used except maybe C, at least I&#39;m quick to form opinions about C code. In C, I&#39;m not so sure that there is a well-established &#34;idiomatic&#34; concept, since C is not so tightly bound to a community as more modern languages. At least that&#39;s my feeling.That said, I was shocked to see that the example code did heap-allocations to store integers. Single integers, one per allocation, per &#34;counting bucket&#34;. I would store the count in the data pointer without a second thought, I just &#34;can&#39;t&#34; make 4/8-byte heap allocations and still sleep at night. Especially after all the concern about processing the input in large blocks for performance! Casting an integer to/from a void pointer should be pretty safe according to my gut feel. If that turns out to be false, I would dump the libc&#39;s hash API altogether, since it makes me do heap allocations to store single integers.I tried making the change locally, and the time taken (as measured with the OP&#39;s benchmarking program) dropped from 0.11 to 0.10 on my system (a Dell laptop running an Intel i5-7300). That&#39;s at least something."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is definitely the most interesting part of the article for me:Incidentally, this problem set the scene for a wizard duel between two computer scientists several decades ago. In 1986, Jon Bentley asked Donald Knuth to show off “literate programming” with a solution to this problem, and he came up with an exquisite, ten-page Knuthian masterpiece. Then Doug McIlroy (the inventor of Unix pipelines) replied with a one-liner Unix shell version using tr, sort, and uniq.http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2011/12/more-shell-less-egg..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Knuth-McIlroy comes up a lot.  Previous discussion [1].  For this example I can make a very similar Nim program [2] run almost exactly the same speed as `wc -w`, yet the optimized C program runs 1.2x faster not 1.15x slower than `wc -w` - a 1.4x discrepancy - bigger than many ratios in the table.  So, people should be very cautious about conclusions from any of this.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24817594[2] https://github.com/c-blake/adix/blob/master/tests/wf.nim"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"All of the people on this list are &#34;software engineers&#34; in the sense that they have some rudimentary education in the field. Almost none of them could get a job as a software engineer at their own company, if they had to, because they would be completely unqualified. And I&#39;m not looking down my nose at anyone: I have an undergraduate degree in CS, but I got it 16 years ago and then went to law school, and there is not a serious place on earth that would let me touch their codebase. But if I started a really valuable company tomorrow (maybe I should), I would code as a software engineer on this list.I mean, come at it from the other direction: Why are there so many software engineers who are not successful CEOs? My God, they have the secrets of for loops, S-expressions, they know about vim---and yet they aren&#39;t running Pfizer? Why not?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, talk about assuming correlation implies causation.I think the obvious lesson here is when society becomes reoriented around a new field (in this case software), people with experience in that field are going to do well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What this seems to show is that CEOs in a particular sector often have expertise in that sector. And that Tech is currently the most highly valued sector as measured by market capitalisation. To find evidence of Software Engineers being the best CEOs overall you&#39;d really need to find examples of them running non-tech firms successfully or examples of non-Software Engineers running tech firms poorly."</p>

Surprised this isn&#39;t enforced in the other countries, it costs next to nothing to implement and is just an additional step in the account migration process.I&#39;d love to see companies allow for opt in additional security measures, like banks or telco&#39;s calling me - having a verbal password to confirm things, that level of security seems to only be available to VIPs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I use this feature. On a large monitor, Firefox wastes quite a lot of space with the default layout. To be honest, I wish there was an option to make it more compact than the &#34;compact&#34; layout. There used to be an XUL extension to do this, before XUL was killed off.Seems like every time I see coverage about Firefox, it&#39;s Mozilla removing or crippling some feature I care about.Why bother using FF at this point? Most sites don&#39;t work as well, and Mozilla seems actively hostile to my use case. If I&#39;m going to use a browser that is hostile to me, I may as well get better website compatibility out of the bargain.Not surprised their market share keeps shrinking. At this point, what&#39;s the sell?Edit 1: worth noting, there is a lower-down comment thread[0] with relevant links - Mozilla does not care if you like this feature.0 - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26464973"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t get it.  The wording of the bugzilla specifically says&gt;  The &#34;Compact&#34; density is a feature of the &#34;Customize toolbar&#34; view which is currently fairly hard to discover, and we assume gets low engagement.So not only do they not have telemetry for that, they aren&#39;t even attempting to make it more discoverable to test if there&#39;s a correlation between &#34;hard to discover&#34; and &#34;low engagement&#34;?I would use this but never knew this could be changed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think Mozilla has a clear vision of what they want to achieve. They&#39;ve been randomly removing features, or even plain butchering their  products (eg the recent Firefox mobile update) for several years, and all they probably achieved is to lose more and more users.Yet with their tiny market share they aren&#39;t exactly in a position to lose users."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those not from South Africa, this app is primarily for people to be able to get notifications or look up when their area will be affected by a &#34;planned power outage&#34;, or as Eskom (our state owned power utility) refers to it, &#34;load shedding&#34;. &#34;Load shedding&#34; is enacted whenever they have a power production capacity issue where different areas take turns without power so as to not let the power grid collapse.This app aggregates information from various data sources and provides push notifications too. It is without a doubt the best source of this information and the app being unavailable significantly affects the day to day lives of a significant portion of the South African population who use it to plan around these power outages.While the app also has a &#34;chat&#34; feature, it&#39;s really tangental to the primary purpose of the app and I expect that most users of the app, like myself, don&#39;t use that feature at all and only care about knowing when they will be without electricity.In case you&#39;re wondering why they hell we have load shedding, it&#39;s because Eskom is grossly incompetent. Their incompetence is hugely exacerbated by nepitism and corruption where government has historically appointed people to Eskom management positions solely as &#34;favours&#34;, rather than on qualification for the job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The company I work for has forbidden the use of Google and their services such as GCP etc. due to how they treat their Play Store developers and other customer, in particular that there never seems to be any human being that you can talk to and find out what you need to do to fix the situation. We do not want the same to occur to our servers or if there is an overflow from Play Store ban to GCP etc. The business risk is too high when you rely on Google&#39;s services.Some examples:Terraria banned - https://twitter.com/Demilogic/status/1358661840402845696New project banned - https://medium.com/@amton15127/why-you-should-not-use-fireba...Google bans company - https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8kvias/tifu_by_gettin...Google bans mail - https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/a-serf-on-googles-farmBan app for communicating changes during covid - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23221447Adwords ban - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23224791Serverpunch bad support - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17431609Delete app - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20826618Google bans game with pandemic - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23229073Google bans dev with no recourse - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15197357"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is the other side of the Play-store problem. The other side is the tax.Play store employee can ban your app = destroy your business at any time. The reason can be &#39;new policy&#39;, &#39;misunderstanding&#39; or something more problematic, such as influence from your competitor to the employee.A &#39;power to destroy business&#39;, should not be a click away from some random employee."</p>
