Unless they fully opensource the code it is unlikely to get any traction. And if it is really based on Linux we&#39;re likely going to see UI and UX issues, An OS is more than just a some fancy icons and modded apps. The transitions that they show in the demo are not easy to achieve as in stability of the software. 
It looks very clean but unlike elementary OS, it doesn&#39;t feel authentic. I don&#39;t know what obsession people have with Apple but they aren&#39;t the only company getting designs and UX right. These avenues are unfortunately killing independent and new design ideas."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Pleiades[1], also known as the Seven Sisters:&gt; It is among the star clusters nearest to Earth... and is the cluster most obvious to the naked eye in the night sky.Only six stars in the cluster are visible to the naked eye yet mythology from several ancient cultures share the idea that one of the seven “sisters&#34; is hidden. The article The world’s oldest story?, originally published in TheConversation [2], states:&gt; The star Pleione... was a bit further away from Atlas in 100,000 BC, making it much easier to see.These two stars now appear as one to the naked eye which the author proposes is the source of the hidden sister. This dates the story to 100 kya.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades[2] https://theconversation.com/the-worlds-oldest-story-astronom..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a nice theory but sometimes simpler, less glamorous solutions might hold the truth.There are more than 6 &#34;sisters&#34; visible with the naked eye, but most people normally can&#39;t see them.It&#39;s more believable to me that the &#34;missing&#34; 7th sister is just the brightest of the less visible ones.Those less visible would certainly have been used as a test of prowess for determining the keenest-eyed, especially among early societies where such skills were important.&#34;Ah, but can you find the hiding sister?&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminded me of a theory came up with as a teenager, that the Vaanaraas of Ramayana (a group to which the famous &#34;monkey god&#34; Hanuman belongs) may actually be an early hominid that had ape-like features, that lived in parallel with humans in different territory. They were intelligent enough to help the human princes in their quest, which got them a place in their story - a story which went on to become an oral tradition, and got embellished with time to become the Ramayana. If, as proposed here, stories can be orally passed down for tens of thousands of years, that makes it slightly more likely that this outlandish theory actually has some merit to it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When you finally learn to master and config Emacs, you run circles around all other editors. Emacs is so much more than just an editor. But even if you only use it for coding: Magit is the best git client I have used in years (coming from PyCharm + Git Tower App, which is nice), then there‘s Ztree-Diff (excellent folder diff tool; previously using Kaleidoscope app), then Eshell for interacting with the server from within Emacs (programmatically if you like), Tramp for remote editing, excellent integration of ripgrep and silversearcher (ag) into Emacs for code navigation, yasnippet as an excellent templates/snippet manager, and many more packages.What makes Emacs exceptional is you can link all these packages together, create your own workflows by scripting Emacs in Lisp. And I write the docu in Emacs in org-mode, with org-babel I can run shell-scripts / python-scripts and other code in my org-file and see the output underneath it (like Jupyter notebooks), link to code fragments in my org files etcI manage several projects with it and switch contexts with one key-combination: Vagrant box is started, project folder is changed, necessary files opened, ready to hack, build, deploy, do server restarts with a single key stroke.I think VS Code is a nice coding environment with good defaults and many things done right (compare installing packages in VS Code to Sublime! What an improvement) but nowhere near the capabilities and the productivity of Emacs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It also shines in areas where Emacs doesn’t: if you’re a programmer working on typical contemporary projects, mostly just wanting to get stuff done, things usually… just work. You install VSCode, open a source code file, get asked to install the extension for that particular language, and that’s it. You get smart completion, static analysis, linting, advanced debugging, refactoring tools, deep integration with git, and on top of that, great performance and a cohesive user experience.These days I mostly use VSCode due to great language server integration (Pylance, gopls, rust-analyzer, etc.), but I still rely on Emacs with Magit for almost all my git interactions. This is not helped by VSCode&#39;s shitty commit message box, which after five years is still this ~250x20px by default input field with some after-the-fact validation tossed in. The great thing about Emacs is that everything is a buffer, you get the full editing power afforded by a buffer, not some second-class input field, especially for something as important as commit messages."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On the discussion of values, I&#39;d also like to submit &#34;(expected) longevity&#34; for consideration, which I think is distinct from &#34;stability&#34;.I made the switch from Vim to Neovim as soon as I felt confident that (1) the project was going to be around for a while, and (2) it was on track to &#34;overtake&#34; Vim (you may choose to disagree with me on this, I found built-in LSP to be a compelling selling point, but the specifics aren&#39;t really related to the point I&#39;m trying to make). That it was almost completely a drop-in replacement, down to the init file, certainly didn&#39;t hurt.Under the author&#39;s framework, Neovim apparently prefers &#34;progressiveness&#34; while Vim prefers &#34;stability&#34;, and those two sound dimetrically at odds based on their descriptions; but both have large, active communities that aren&#39;t going anywhere. I&#39;m not sure I can say the same about Kakoune, for example, which is a certainly a promising project but hasn&#39;t yet convinced me to jump the fence.[edit for Emacs thoughts]: Now that I think about it, &#34;text centrism&#34; in my mind is also closely related to longevity. I don&#39;t care as much about the properties of plain text as I do about the fact that I&#39;ll be able to open/view/edit them _even if the application ecosystem dies_. I find Emacs attractive here with org-mode and, to a lesser extent, org-roam (the comparison here would be between e.g. SaaS productivity offerings like Notion)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The nice thing about my 2015 Macbook Pro is that it&#39;s useful without any accessories. I can just throw it in a bag and walk out the door.It&#39;s got enough battery life that I usually don&#39;t need to bring a charger. It has all the ports that I ever need. I can hook it up to a projector with the built in HDMI port, I can put in the SD card from my camera, or I can quickly copy files from someones thumb drive. I don&#39;t need to think about bringing the right kind of cables for what I&#39;m planning to do.Sure, the new Macs are a lot faster, but every Mac released after 2015 would be a downgrade for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use two MacBooks for programming for several hours each every single day, my personal machine has a touchbar, my work machine does not. I realize this is blasphemous to say and I did think I would hate the touchbar for all the reasons, but I actually ended up liking it.I had imagined myself tapping virtual function buttons and the whole thing seemed silly and useless and worse than having physical keys, but VS Code and other dev tools actually have good integration, and when I open an app like Adobe Illustrator which I don&#39;t use frequently enough to memorize all the hotkeys it&#39;s quite handy to have the commands listed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article&#39;s criticism of the 12-inch MacBook are preposterous. The 2 lb Macbook is the best laptop I&#39;ve ever owned, by far. Maybe I&#39;m too sensitive about weight, but I feel an incredible difference between 3 lb and 2 lb laptops, especially if its sitting on your lap for extended periods of time. The keyboard and charger have never once been a hindrance to my workflow, as the article makes it out be. I really wish Apple would come out with 2 lb laptops again. Latest line of Macbooks (the &#34;Air&#34;) weigh in at 2.8 lb minimum."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"My wife participates in our local Buy Nothing group and it’s fantastic. They have a couple of rules that seem to help make it work:1. Hyperlocal: your local group will he made up people near your house. You’ll get to know them. When the group gets too large, it’s split into two smaller groups.2. Not bartering, not first-come-first-serve.  When something is posted, the person offering is supposed to wait a while, then decide who to give it to. I don’t participate in the group, so I don’t know why this makes a difference, but my wife says it does."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My wife and I love to get rid of stuff. However one challenge using free cycle or  free Craigslist is it seems to attract people with a hoarding problem. People that jump on any free thing without a sense for how they would use it. So I feel better giving things away for free when they say how they’ll use it or show specific gratitude for the item. Or give them to a thrift store where they enable a charity.Does anyone else notice this or have this issue?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The unintuitive thing here (for the general population at least, possibly not the HN crowd) is that almost certainly nobody at Facebook saw, and approved (much less designed) this marketing strategy. It naturally emerged from the goals the system has been given. That doesn&#39;t excuse it: in fact, it indicts automated targeted-advertisement as a category.This software is working exactly as it was designed to. I&#39;m sure somebody could (and probably will, now that it&#39;s made the news) add a rule that makes an exception in this case. But this is going to keep happening, and keep happening, and keep happening, as long as we continue allowing systems to automate our content-feeds, optimized for getting us to spend money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll pile on an anecdote. I still have a facebook account but its not something I use very often except the past week given the situation in the USA.My facebook account is very old, when i was more of an active user I did all the usual posts/photos that a lot of liberal urban types contribute.Anyway, after posting some anti-insurrection posts I start noticing all sort of &#34;tacti-cool&#34; gear ads or targeted T-shirt s with some very macho-man hyper masculinity phrases on them.This is very much _not_ me. Now I keep facebook on a tight leash (FB container, privacy settings turned to max) so my guess is that someone out there is spending a lot of money on a huge ad target or somehow facebook thinks anyone who is posting about a US insurrection would like to participate with some neat military cosplay kit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yes. That&#39;s what Go is for. Go is for doing the things that Google does on servers, which mostly means web apps of one kind of another. It has all the parts for that, and they&#39;re well-exercised because they&#39;re doing billions of operations per second on Google&#39;s own work. It&#39;s hard-compiled, so you don&#39;t have all the extra overhead of the interpreted languages. Also, Go has a better async story than most web-oriented systems. Goroutines, or &#34;green threads&#34;, do both the job
of threads and &#34;async&#34;. In async land, if anything blocks or uses much CPU time, you&#39;re stalled. Not so in Go. A goroutine can block without stalling other goroutines.Right now, I&#39;m writing a client for a virtual world in Rust. There&#39;s a big need for concurrency, but, unlike web stuff, it&#39;s all tightly interrelated. There&#39;s a GPU to keep busy. There&#39;s network traffic of several different kinds. There are compute-bound tasks which need to be kept out of the frame refresh loop.Rust is good for this. The existing C++ client is too much of a mess to make concurrent; people looked at it and gave up. In Rust, it&#39;s coming along nicely.Use the right tool for the job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m the maintainer of Juniper. Juniper is a library, not a framework. As such it is agnostic to how you want to solve N+1. You get a lookahead and can do what you want...dataloader (like Facebook), eager loading all data up front (like Rails), generating efficient SQL on the fly (like prisma).There are projects and examples to do all three but we don&#39;t want to assume one solution is right for all domains.We take this to the extreme...Juniper doesn&#39;t even require a web server and isn&#39;t tied to a particular serialization format! Of course, we provide optional integrations with popular web frameworks using json but the key is they are optional."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; But Rust’s memory rules aren’t more secure than Node.js’s or Python’s. Your web application written in Rust isn’t going to be systematically more or less secure than an application in Python or Ruby.Just want to call out that I&#39;ve heard a horror story of a very bad security bug due to implicit shared mutability in Python.(vague to protect the innocent)&gt; Heck, if you ask some people, Rust is less secure than a GC’ed language for web apps if you use any crates that have unsafe code - which includes Actix, the most popular web framework, because unsafe code allows things like deferencing raw pointers.You can write unsafe code in Python (and some of the web frameworks use this) and nothing helps you with auditing it, unlike unsafe blocks in Rust."</p>
