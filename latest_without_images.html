								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"That&#39;s a very interesting set of findings. What is important to realize when reading this that it is a case of survivorship bias. The startups that were audited were obviously still alive, and any that suffered from such flaws that they were fatal had most likely already left the pool.In 15 years of doing technical due diligence (200+ jobs) I have yet to come across a company where the tech was what eventually killed them. But business case problems, for instance being unaware of the true cost of fielding a product and losing money on every transaction are extremely common. Improper cost allocation, product market mismatch, wishful thinking, founder conflicts, founder-investor conflicts, relying on non-existent technology while faking it for the time being and so on have all killed quite a few companies.Tech can be fixed, and if everything else is working fine there will be budget to do so. These other issues usually can&#39;t be fixed, no matter what the budget."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Simple Outperformed Smart. As a self-admitted elitist, it pains me to say this, but it’s true: the startups we audited that are now doing the best usually had an almost brazenly ‘Keep It Simple’ approach to engineering.I wrote about this before that as an industry, we have made writing software complex for complexity&#39;s sake.&gt; imagine, in a world where there wasn&#39;t a concept of clean code but to write code as simply as possible. not having thousands of classes with indirection.what if your code logic was simple functions and a bunch of if statements. not clever right, but it would work.what if your hiring process was not optimizing for algorithm efficiency but that something simply works reliably.imagine a world where the tooling used by software engineers wasn&#39;t fragile but simple to use and learn. oh the world would be a wonderful place, but the thing is most people don&#39;t know how to craft software. but here we&#39;re building software on a house of cards [0]:[0] - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30166677"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve seen most of the architectural problems in consulting - it&#39;s amazing how a team of clever engineers can take a simple thing and make it sooo convoluted.Microservices, craptons of cloud-only dependencies, no way to easily create environments, ORMs and tooling that wraps databases creating crazy schemas... The list goes on and on; if you&#39;re early, you could do a lot worse than create a sensible monolith in a monorepo that uses just postgres, redis, and nginx and deploys using &#39;git pull&#39; ..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"898 KB even without compression. Pretty good for what it is. Properly compressed, it’d be well under half that on the wire.(The server seems to be serving with only extremely mild compression, and none on the biggest part, the WASM. Feeding it all through `gzip -9` cuts it to 408 KB, of which 374 KB is the WASM. `brotli` cuts it to 352 KB, of which 323 KB is the WASM. The HTML, CSS and JavaScript are also largely unminified, and even a simple conservative pass roughly halves their gzipped size. No idea of the state of the WASM, I’m not going prodding inside it just now. I know that I’m never impressed with the JavaScript side of the bindings produced by Empscripten, Rust’s wasm-bindgen and any other such tools I’ve seen—with a little manual effort, I’ve very easily reduced 50 KB files—minified!—to under 5 KB. Optimising such things and immediately discarding the results is a strange hobby of mine.)For comparison, the similar parts of https://sql.js.org/examples/GUI/index.html are a bit under 1.2 MB uncompressed (most notably excluding CodeMirror), around 450 KB on the wire."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Richard Hipp, of sqlite fame, just announced the project&#39;s new WASM-based &#34;fiddle&#34; app in the sqlite forum (https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/5cfd681451), providing a way for users to run a slightly-hacked build of the sqlite3 shell app in their browsers (with no server-side backend).(Edit: this was my first-ever HN post and i _thought_ that this comment was going to &#34;stick&#34; up top with the link to serve as an introduction/explanation. Didn&#39;t realize that it would be &#34;just another comment.&#34;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you find this useful, you may also benefit from the fact that Python compiled to WASM (by Pyodide) also includes a working build of SQLite in the sqlite3 standard library module.You can try that out in a REPL here: https://pyodide.org/en/stable/console.html    import sqlite3
    db = sqlite3.connect(&#34;:memory:&#34;)
    db.execute(&#34;select 4 * 5&#34;).fetchall()

Or in a full client-side WASM Jupyter notebook interface using https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/try/labI also used Pyodide to get my Datasette SQLite Python web application running entirely in the browser at https://lite.datasette.io - more details on how that works here: https://simonwillison.net/2022/May/4/datasette-lite/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well done for putting it out there!We&#39;ve worked on this about 3 years ago, plus background removal (realtime alpha-matting still not really done well by anyone), portrait re-lighting (G-Meet is now doing this) and even eye-contact (adjusting eye position to create the illusion of looking directly into the camera).Some findings:- Competing with dedicated H264/5 chips is very hard, especially when it comes to energy efficiency, which is something that mobile users ultimately care a lot about.  Super-resolution on H264 is probably the way to go.- It&#39;s hard to turn this into a business (corporates that pay for Zoom don&#39;t seem to care much).PS Also a big fan of super-tiny AI models (binarized NNs, frequency-domain NNs, etc) for edge applications.  Happy to chat!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Awesome!A thought: now that neural compression is becoming widespread, it could be a good idea to put some kind of indicator or watermark stating the compression is neural (learned/function approximation in general). I think this would avoid liabilities and criticism around the fact that some weird things may appear (incorrect detail generation), maybe giving a wrong semantic idea. It may also be a good idea to put a mean squared error term in your objective function to help preserve general meaning."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow Will was such a part of my childhood watching Star Trek. Obviously, he didn&#39;t appear often but he was memorable simply because there were so few people as young as him on the show.Sad to hear this all around. This also brought back memories of me being required to play piano growing up. I hated piano, performing (recitals), playing in general. I was terrrribbleee (still am) and was put up in lessons for 12 years. I fought tooth and nail as I got older and eventually was so bad my parents stopped at 16.Music is a very &#34;asian&#34; or &#34;chinese&#34; thing to put your child through. As well as being good academically. This part of my life was a sore spot, but not even close Will&#39;s situation.As I have young children of my own today, I&#39;m faced with these questions. What is a healthy amount of pushing vs too much? I don&#39;t need my kid to be the best at anything - I just don&#39;t want them to be lost/dead-in-the-water or unable to fend for themselves."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Now think how many children suffered the same fate, but we’ll never hear about it because they did not become famous.Reminds me of “dance moms” or “cheer moms”, “football dads”, etc.If you’re a parent, remember not to live your unfulfilled dreams through your children."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of my friend&#39;s daughters really, really enjoyed dancing, singing, acting, auditioning for commercials.  Her aunt had won Survivor, or American Race, or Big Brother, or whatever (they&#39;re all the same to me, I can&#39;t remember which it was) and she wanted to be just like her!   Until the day at seven years old that she had to go to an audition, she sat herself down in the middle of the driveway and said, &#34;No, no, no, no, I hate this, I hate this, please never, please,&#34; and wouldn&#39;t budge.  My friend was forced to realize finally it had been all her, and not her daughter.  Thankfully, she did get the message, was self-reflective enough to listen.What a strong little girl, I thought.  I remember years of &#34;loving&#34; horseback riding lessons and shows as a kid because I wasn&#39;t strong enough to tell my mother I hated every minute of it.  As a father myself now, I try very hard to listen and support what my kid is interested in, and not manufacture what I want him to be, and wonder if I still screw it up."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi HN, I built this.  It&#39;s been posted several times before, so I can answer some common questions:How does this work?
I adapted GPlates [1], an academic project that creates desktop software for geologists to investigate plate tectonic data.Is the geocoding accurate?
Even though plate tectonic models return precise results, you should consider the plots approximate within ~100km. In my tests I found that model results can vary significantly. I chose this model because it is widely cited and covers the greatest length of time.How should I interpret the maps/colors?
The graphics that wrap the globe are provided by Dr. Christopher Scotese, a geologist who runs the PALEOMAP project.  You can learn more about the project and the creation of the rasters here [2].  You might also notice some old national borders.  I just work with what I can get!Why can&#39;t it look up my location?
Your location probably didn&#39;t exist at the time, geologically speaking.  Try switching to closer to present day (e.g. 66 Mya)Where are all the dinosaurs?
Despite the title of this post, the visualization isn&#39;t really meant to show an exhaustive list of dinosaurs or fossils (the list doesn&#39;t even show on mobile).  If you want to dig into data on fossils near you, check out the Paleobiology Database Navigator [3].[1] https://www.gplates.org[2] https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-q0WIa7ofISFHyBe4UxvN8DIPs8...[3] https://paleobiodb.org/navigator/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the neat bits from this is going to 340 Mya and look at where the Appalachian mountain range runs.You can hike part of the Appalachian trail in Spain https://www.geologiadesegovia.info/the-international-appalac... and Ireland https://iatulsterireland.comhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Appalachian_Trai..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dang, wish this title was updated to be less misleading. I spent way too long looking for functionality that didn&#39;t exist. The author (not same person as poster) posted in the comments:&gt; Where are all the dinosaurs? Despite the title of this post, the visualization isn&#39;t really meant to show an exhaustive list of dinosaurs or fossils (the list doesn&#39;t even show on mobile).That said, this is a really cool visualization of how the water fill and plates evolved over time. Love it!"</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31497827">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My takeaway from the article is that Fuchsia exposes a capability-based interface externally, but uses the old kind of privilege-checking inside the kernel. Once a single sloppy check was found, the game was over: a privilege escalation and planting of arbitrary code into the kernel followed.Did I miss anything?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something that I haven&#39;t seen brought up yet is the &#34;weird C++ vtable layout.&#34; This is actually the &#34;relative vtable layout&#34; that&#39;s first described here: https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26723, and is usable in clang via the -fexperimental-relative-c++-abi-vtables option.The basic idea is that you don&#39;t need to waste a whole 64 bits for vtable entry, especially since you can usually assume that code within the same DSO will be within 32 bits of each other. So, instead, you do a 32-bit offset from a known address (the vtable&#39;s address) to get the function pointer, and in the rare case you need a cross-DSO entry, just emit a thunk for the symbol that&#39;s in the same DSO to get an address within 32 bits."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Disclaimer: I made some contributions to Fuchsia and I am clearly biased.I am not sure why there&#39;s so much negativity around Fuchsia. From a technical point of view it&#39;s finally a serious attempt to do something new in the OS space. It might not be the right and perfect answer, but it might introduce new paradigms and maybe some fork of the project might be able to provide additional benefits for end users down the road. I know that there are lots of hobby/research projects trying out new stuff, but i think Fuchsia stands out because it might be able to land the innovation and make it accessible for a larger user base."</p>
