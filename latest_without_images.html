								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just researched good/quality crafting printers yesterday. Search results were mostly blogs and crappy websites that offered obviously no insights but were just SEO optimized to direct you to their Amazon affiliate links. Especially sad since those affiliate links to Amazon mostly resulted in &#34;This product is currently not available&#34; sites.Repeated my search on Youtube to find reviews or unboxing. Most video search results were basically &#34;Youtube SEO&#34; again - the most viewed/top-ranked videos did never show a single actual print run or even the printer available. It was mostly marketing websites turned into video (slowly scrolling/moving over product description or pictures clearly taken from the web). And of course, affiliate links in the description.The web has become a crappy place to research products as long as money can be made with those through affiliations. I wonder if outlawing affiliate marketing would make the world a better place.P.S: Whats most ridiculous about my Youtube Printer research experience, the best and most helpful video was a sales video from a home shopping TV station [0], where they actually showed some printing action and handling of one of the models I was interested in.[0]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytMXgjCReO0"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not just Google---the World Wide Web itself is rapidly becoming a defunct protocol, the culmination of a decades-long shift in the Internet&#39;s center of mass away from browsers and towards centralized and commercialized apps---from personal web pages to LinkedIn/GitHub/Twitter handles, from the ubiquitous WordPress blogs to YouTube videos and Medium posts, and from forums to Tweets and subreddits.The useful information on the Web is now concentrated in a few places---Reddit, Quora, Stack Exchange, Wikipedia, etc. When I want reasonable search results, I search there instead of the Web as a whole. (And even many of these services are in the late stages of the Silicon Valley life cycle---desperate monetization and engagement-increasing gimmicks---with uncertain futures.)Wikipedia, bless its heart, lurches on as a cathedral to early Web&#39;s dream of information democratization. It stands as a wonder of the ancient world: incomplete, built from technology few now understand, and reflecting values and priorities that no longer quite align with contemporary culture. But it persists thanks to its inertia and the undeniable sense of awe it invokes even today."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google was still useful for things that are non-marketable. But in the last year or so, I have started to realize how awfully bad has gotten even at that.Case in point: Open source mailing list archives. For various reasons, some times I have to search for entire email threads that are available in the web interfaces of some mailing list archives. I have part of a phrase of some email, I put that into google with quotes, and it returns some results, usually with the main archive being in the first results. In the last year or so, Google has started returning no results for some phrases of emails that do exist and are available in one or more public archives.When that started to happen, I tried Bing. And Bing returns results with links to archive. So does duckduckgo most times. But for Google, it&#39;s like if that particular email I&#39;m searching at that moment didn&#39;t exist (for other emails in the same mailing list it works fine). It only happens occasionally, but it&#39;s getting worse. So I have started to rely on DDG and Bing more and more, because they always find what I want.So Google is starting to fail at some of the most basic aspects of a search engine, it&#39;s not just the ordering of the search results - there are some public web pages that it won&#39;t see for whatever reason."</p>

For example:  const sym = Module.getExportByName(&#34;lime.ndll&#34;, &#34;SDL_SemWait&#34;);
  Interceptor.replace(sym, {

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting tidbit about Papers, Please: it&#39;s written with Haxe (a programming language), on top of OpenFL (an open-source Flash alternative), which uses Lime as its foundational cross-platform library. The nice stack traces you see in the article, such as:openfl::display::Application_obj::__constructare because Haxe actually compiles down to C++! (That&#39;s also why it has nice interop with C/C++ libraries like SDL.) Haxe boasts an insane amount of compile targets -- just taking a glance at its Github page, it can compile to Javascript, C#, C++, Java, Lua, PHP, Python, and Flash, plus a couple different Haxe-specific interpreters.Not many game developers use Haxe, so it has a small, tight-knit community. Other well-known games written with Haxe include Dead Cells, Northgard, and Dicey Dungeons."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Some scientists say these worries about attention are a moral panic, comparable to the anxieties in the past about comic books or rap music, and that the evidence is shaky.I agree with them.It&#39;s hard to pay attention to something for long unless it&#39;s entertaining. Reading a book, reading a paper, etc -- these activities take discipline that most people don&#39;t develop or don&#39;t often apply. This isn&#39;t new. The mistake is thinking that the ability to concentrate on something non-entertaining is the baseline. One reason so many people think they have ADHD is because they make that mistake.We had the same anxieties about radio and TV. Those anxieties were right and wrong. Technologies do change how people behave but it&#39;s always the same story. There will be entertainment freely available and you&#39;ll have to choose to concentrate on things that aren&#39;t entertaining that you consider worthwhile."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is a veritable war going on for your attention, and the battlefields are your eyeballs, your ears and ultimately your brain. Psychologists have been enlisted, as they are in every war to try to win it for &#39;their side&#39;, be it one of the big silos or some dying TV or newspaper era behemoth, there is no reasonable way in which you can withstand that kind of frontal onslaught. The only way to really deal with this is to not participate.Beware or you too will be collateral damage on the balance sheets of these media conglomerates. Unmediated reality is still there for you to peruse, but &#39;augmented reality&#39; will be the next big wave for tech and I&#39;m pretty sure that it will end up being used mostly for advertising purposes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This for me is key, these sorts of problems cannot just be solved on an individual level. They are systemic.&#34;Individual abstinence is “not the solution, for the same reason that wearing a gas mask for two days a week outside isn’t the answer to pollution. It might, for a short period of time, keep certain effects at bay, but it’s not sustainable, and it doesn’t address the systemic issues.” He said that our attention is being deeply altered by huge invasive forces in wider society. Saying the solution was to just adjust your own habits – to pledge to break up with your phone, say – was just “pushing it back on to the individual” he said, when “it’s really the environmental changes that will really make the difference”.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many people kept insisting &#34;Not many young people are dying from Covid-19&#34; a statement that over looked the fact that, under normal circumstances, not many young people die at all. But there was an article in the New York Times that offered these facts about people aged 20 to 40.July, 2019: 11,000 deadJuly, 2020: 16,000 deadBoth numbers are small in a country where 3 million people die each year, about 250,000 a month. But it&#39;s still a 45% increase, so that age group was the worst affected, in terms of the increase in death. The increase in the death rate of old people was not as dramatic, as older people make up the vast majority of all deaths, every year."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;The CDC weekly death counts, which reflect the information on death certificates and so have a lag of up to eight weeks or longer, show that for the week ending Nov. 6, there were far fewer deaths from COVID-19 in Indiana compared to a year ago – 195 verses 336 – but more deaths from other causes – 1,350 versus 1,319.&#34;So last year more covid deaths (particularly among the elderly), but while those numbers have declined, the numbers from younger &#34;working age&#34; people have increased more than enough to make up for it.&gt; &#34;Just 8.9% of ICU beds are available at hospitals in the state, a low for the year, and lower than at any time during the pandemic. But the majority of ICU beds are not taken up by COVID-19 patients – just 37% are, while 54% of the ICU beds are being occupied by people with other illnesses or conditions.&#34;Well a lot of people were avoiding medical care (precisely because of Covid concerns), so this makes some sense.  Couple that with the increased death rate for younger people and something has happened to worsen the health and outcomes generally for that population.  Cue wild speculation and theories."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Zotero is, if you&#39;re not in the market for a closed source silo like EndNote, the only game left in town. Mendeley went full on Evil, and Papers for Mac is Mac only, closed source, and missing dozens of functionalities that are absolutely a must have in academic writing and research.An absolute must have is BetterBibTex (https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/), which adds better Citekey management and, my personal highlight, &#34;export on add&#34; functionality. In short, everything I save into a specific folder in my library gets exported as a .bib file right away. That way I can click a button in my browser and have the citation ready in my LaTeX editor, Word, or Obsidian (https://github.com/hans/obsidian-citation-plugin) within seconds.The latest beta also adds full Markdown export for Notes. I tend to keep my notes on papers in Zotero, attached to the paper, but export them for filing in Obsidian (which I then feed into MkDocs for our work group&#39;s large repo).Unless you need Apple Pages support, which Apple keeps to itself and only sells for mighty moolah to a select few, Zotero can do anything EndNote can do, is Open Source, and with that won&#39;t drive your PI up the wall with yet another expense."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I highly recommend going for the beta version which features a (game-changing) built-in pdf reader[1], with annotations (searchable and synced with the beta iPad app) and many more improvements.Zotero is an amazing tool and I could not imagine writing papers without it. For collaborative writing, it syncs the bibliography with overleaf[2] and google docs. The browser add-on allows to build your library with one click while browsing, and it parses wonderfully meta-data from all (most) publishers and pre-print servers. Then my unique bibfile (symlinked in every project) is continuously updated to reflect new items or manual changes.But I use it even for non-publishing side of research: one can save webpages (with snapshots) and write notes with formatting around them. My personal research workflow involves note-taking with the markdown app Zettlr[2], from which I can cite my Zotero library using simply `@[Author:Title:Year]`. I can then build notes from a twitter thread and stats.stackexchange.com answers, then connect it with papers and blog posts that way, and a specific chapter of a book with my annotation on the cloud. It not always straightforward as a workflow but it works wonders.And the team is very responsive on the forum and on twitter. If one of the dev is ready this, thank you so much for making researchers life way easier !EDIT: I just realised I can share my libraries online. A bit ashamed because it is very messy, but in case you are wondering what a Zotero library looks like, here is the link to mine [4] (without the notes and the embedded pdf and data files because I cannot share all of them. Moreover, I don&#39;t use the folder structure anymore so its very messy).[1] https://www.zotero.org/support/pdf_reader_preview[2] I recommend the BetterBibTex extension for anything related to tex, it&#39;ll save you a lot of time[3] https://zettlr.com, another great app.[4] https://www.zotero.org/wosk/library"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a grad student, Zotero is a lifesaver! Thanks to the people developing it!I use Google Drive for my pdf storage using some Zotfile acrobatics (awesome plugin btw) to manage my actual pdfs. I plan on switching to Zotero&#39;s cloud storage to support development as soon as I can.That being said, I wish I had a nice workflow for reading papers on my iPad like I do on PC (Windows specifically, I know there are software for the Mac/iOS ecosystem but I don&#39;t have a Macbook so...): Open Zotero -&gt; double-click on the paper -&gt; Bam, the pdf opens in Acrobat where I can highlight and annotate, and save to pdf directly for future use.The closest I got to this on iPad was to use the Zotfile plugin and use the Send to Tablet feature as described here [0], and opening and annotating the pdf on iPad.Another interesting workflow seems to be using Obsidian to store the relationships between papers using annotations and highlights from them [1]. Another way to do this would be LiquidText but I paid 20+ USD separately for both the iPad and Windows Store versions, and it asks me to pay up again so I don&#39;t know what&#39;s up with them...Still, I hope Zotero keeps being developed as it&#39;s the best, and perhaps the only open source research management software out there.[0]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7novaC_O_Y[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Fjhad-Z61oEDIT: Added clarification of OS I am using."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The main issue with &#34;Web3&#34; is that it moves records of transactions from many private places to one public place. Sure this one place may not be controlled by a single entity, but it facilitates tracking at an unprecedented level.Cryptocurrencies are the ultimate example of this and are an absolute boon to tax collectors, forensic accountants and fraudsters. In our current economy financial transactions are recorded in millions of individual ledgers that are kept private, or in the case of cash transactions are often not recorded at all, or are not linked to an individual. There is no central ledger.With crypto currencies however you can not only see all transactions but also trace them back to individual users as long as you can link a wallet to a person. This is a massive increase in centralisation yet discussion of whether this is a good idea seems to be entirely missing. The notion that centralising transactions in one place is somehow an example of decentralisation just seems mad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with web3 is not that it&#39;s centralized -- that&#39;s irrelevant.The fundamental problem with all crypto&#34;currencies&#34; is as follows: the world uses real currencies and there is only one way this enters into the world of crypto&#34;currencies&#34;: by someone selling a coin to someone else. Thus, regardless of what crypto&#34;currency&#34; we are talking about, it would be a zero sum game if not for transaction fees. However, with transaction fees it becomes a scam because there&#39;s a set of players who are guaranteed to win and there&#39;s another set of players who, en masse, are guaranteed to lose. It utterly doesn&#39;t matter what you do with your crypto&#34;currency&#34;, this is the underpinning scam of it.And once you entered the game, the only way for you to not lose money is to find a greater fool who will take over your crypto&#34;currency&#34;, everyone who owns some becomes a proponent of it. It&#39;s an ingenious scam.And no, nothing in the real world is like this. In the real world, the amount of currency increases when a bank extends a loan which then creates more value by such things as being using as capital, allowing you to enjoy a home now instead of decades later and so forth. Also, stocks are not a zero sum game -- companies actually create value and so forth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the author makes the mistake of assuming that web3 is a meaningful, tangible term being used in good faith.In reality, web3 is a marketing buzzword that cryptocurrency boosters have started promoting in an attempt to legitimize their resource intensive and otherwise useless financial speculation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe AirDrop is a a great example of how Apples vertical integration and full ownership of software and hardware really thrives. It may not offer interoperability with other platforms, but that’s because other platforms don’t have the control needed to implement the same level of integration of hardware and software needed.Without the direct low level control of the radio hardware they would not have been able to integrate both Bluetooth and WiFi in the way that AirDrop does.I hope one day standards for this type of functionality appear so that other platforms can implement it. Ideally apple would contribute their tech to create the standard but that’s probably wishful thinking."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"No book influenced my attitude toward philosophy more than Wittgenstein&#39;s Blue Book. Here are a couple gems:&gt; The questions, &#34;What is length?&#34;, &#34;What is meaning?&#34;, &#34;What is the number one?&#34; etc., produce in us a mental cramp. We feel that we can&#39;t point to anything in reply to them and yet ought to point to something. (We are up against one of the great sources of philosophical bewilderment: we try to find a substance for a substantive.)&gt; The idea that in order to get clear about the meaning of a general term one had to find the common element in all its applications, has shackled philosophical investigation; for it has not only led to no result, but also made the philosopher dismiss as irrelevant the concrete cases, which alone could have helped him to understand the usage of the general term. When Socrates asks the question, “what is knowledge?” he does not even regard it as a preliminary answer to enumerate cases of knowledge. If I wished to find out what sort of thing arithmetic is, I should be very content indeed to have investigated the case of a finite cardinal arithmetic. For:
(a) this would lead me on to all the more complicated cases,
(b) a finite cardinal arithmetic is not incomplete, it has no gaps which are then filled in by the rest of arithmetic.&gt; Now I don&#39;t say that this is not possible. Only, putting it in this way immediately shows you that it need not happen. This, by the way, illustrates the method of philosophy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not quite all public domain. (in English) [0] (maybe? gray area)I&#39;d highly recommend checking out his work on (and coining of the term) &#34;language games&#34; [1] I&#39;m not sure I agree with all of the thinking behind them, but it&#39;s a fascinating concept that has useful nuggets whether or not you agree with everything Wittgenstein says about them. They are explored pretty fully in his work &#34;Philosophical Investigations&#34; [2] This work pretty much set aside a fair amount of his thinking in Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, which is still an interesting work in its own right. I think that even a cursory ELI5 treatment of this material in a standard college course would be very useful in arming students with tools needed to dissect language. I&#39;ve used it (in brief) when teaching a course on Informal Logic in relation to propaganda.[0] It seems copyright on the English translation might still be in effect, or at least a gray area of determination. Since it&#39;s a common text use in college courses I&#39;m guessing the copyright owners may fight public domain release. The issue will be whether or not the translation was a work for hire or if it can be considered sufficiently different to constitute an original work. The English translation by Anscombe, Hacker, and Schulte occured posthumously, and so might not be considered work for hire. Hopefully it will resolve in favor of public domain. For a shorter consideration of &#34;language games&#34; check out Blue Book.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_game_(philosophy)[2] https://www.amazon.com/Philosophical-Investigations-Ludwig-W..."</p>
