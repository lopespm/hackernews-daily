								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Key takeaways:1. One of the best ways to improve your writing is to learn how to cut out words that are not necessary2. Stuffy writing is bad writing! It lowers the power of your brain and mine!3. What words should you never use in writing? Words whose exact meanings you don’t know! Never use a word unless you know EXACTLY what it means4. If your writing is nonsense, maybe your thoughts are nonsense too!5. To keep things clear and readable: Put the main point of each paragraph in its first sentence6. Pretend you’re writing a textbook! That’s how I ended up writing so many books...Organizing knowledge Learning is a lot like writing a book7. I often write the introduction last, after I know what it will introduce!8. Never draw the reader’s eye to anything that is not the main point"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One useful first step in becoming a better writer - in particular if your subject is complex - is to to delete your Twitter account and never look at another Twitter thread.  Character limits kill creativity and complexity.The presentation does leave out one very necessary requirement for becoming a good-to-great writer: you have to do a lot of reading.  If you&#39;re going to write about a complex scientific or technical subject, you should have some examples in mind of great texts that you&#39;ve read.  What did other writers do that you liked or that stuck with you?  Equally true, what are some really bad examples, some things to avoid?For example, here&#39;s what I think is an excellent popular history book, and if I ever wrote something with a historical bent, I&#39;d flip though it first:
&#34;By Steppe, Desert, and Ocean: The Birth of Eurasia&#34; by Barry Cunliffehttps://www.amazon.com/Steppe-Desert-Ocean-Birth-Eurasia/dp/...The point about Twitter is really this: you have to develop the skill of composing a paragraph as a coherent entity in order to become a decent writer, and Twitter doesn&#39;t allow for paragraphs, just sentences (and short ones at that).  Paragraphs should have an internal cohesion to help the reader absorb the concept being presented.  Once you have that, you can start chaining paragraphs together, reordering the sequence of paragraphs, with the goal of constructing a path that the reader can follow through the whole essay or chapter.  Getting the order right is important for complex topics, as point D might rely on a good understanding of points A and B, and so on.  Your goal should be to make the reader feel smart.Of course that&#39;s just advice for non-fiction writing; if you&#39;re doing fiction or poetry basically anything goes.  The public might like it or hate it, but the literary critics can safely be ignored."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Forgive me for bringing up my own material here, but I wrote a piece that is highly relevant in this context only two days ago:Writing for Engineers - https://www.heinrichhartmann.com/posts/writing/This text is particularly geared towards Software Engineers and focuses more on the psychology of getting started with writing. Lot&#39;s of overlap with the content in this post (which has much more depth on the &#34;how to write well&#34; part)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yes, this is true. This is why Netflix runs fast.com: it serves Netflix content from Netflix servers, so if ISPs want to prioritize fast.com content they&#39;ll have to prioritize Netflix content as well. Of course, that doesn&#39;t help non-Netflix sites..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was on the phone with a buddy trying to troubleshoot Local file transfer speeds vs Speedtest results.Speedtest kept reporting 100Mb/s range speeds (the tier he was paying for).  Local file transfers however were stuck in the 1MB/s range.After some questions and troubleshooting he discovered that he had used a 10Mb/s hub instead of a 1Gb/s switch that was sitting right next to it.  A simple mixup.His internet connection was also plugged into that same 10Mb/s hub.There is NO WAY his PC could have reported 100Mb/s to speedtest.Do not trust them for accurate results."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unlikely your suspicions are correct. Provisioning high QoS to the speedtest site is common practice (see fast.com for countermeasures), but changing the entire subscriber QoS because traffic to one particular destination is detected seems like too much work and doesn&#39;t really achieve anything useful.If you are on a wireless network (either your upstream from a WISP, or internally on your own network), then I&#39;d suspect some wireless air access control syndrome is the cause -- e.g. stations are usually randomly fighting for air, but when you pull down your big speed test file that ends up putting the network in a state where your station gets all the air time. Lo and behold all your traffic has better QoS. Basically your speedtest traffic, because it is a constant stream, shoved everyone else off the air and allowed your other traffic to get through at the same time as a result."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I taught comedy improv for many years. One tip I would give new performers is to adopt an alter ego for the stage (a fun fake name and/or personality) and to choose a totem (an object) that they wear to do just that such as shoes, a shirt, watch, etc.This helped so many different people such as accountants, pre-k teachers, stay-at-home moms, and even university professors get out of their shells, prevent their stage fright, and to be more energetic on-stage when their normal persona is calm, cool, and collected.I do believe we also have an alter ego in three different situations such as work, home, and play. Another common thing I would teach is that you can alter your characters in scenes easily by adopting one of those personas of the character you&#39;re portraying.I believe many people adopt an alter ego without knowing it today. These are YouTubers, Streamers, Conference Speakers, and really anything where there&#39;s a concept of a &#34;stage&#34;.The book &#34;The Alter Ego Effect&#34; by Todd Herman goes into this further, but my favorite material on this is &#34;Impro&#34; by Keith Johnstone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can also reinvent yourself whenever you move from a place to another. I used to live in a small and enclosed community to my twenties until I moved out into an environment I knew nobody. It gave me a clean-slate, and after returning a year later, people close to me told I had changed a lot. Moreover, I continued to be the new me. The gap in the shared history cut both ways: I could forever hide behind it and explain e.g. some opinion of mine to come from influences of that time, but on the other hand, it was also the last time someone else than I knew a coherent history of me.Since then, I have moved into new environments four additional times. Each time I see it as a possibility to reflect what I&#39;d like to change and work towards that. And whenever I return to home, I feel like a tourist now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Immediately made me think of VTubing. A lot of vtubers now are among the most popular streaming channels on Youtube and many of them are probably what you could call above average performers in terms of what content they put out, from music to narrative fiction.Also reminded of me of an interview with Buckethead explaining his alter ego:&#34;&#34;Because I was always super scared to play, and I didn&#39;t really link that together, I just thought &#39;This is weird.&#39; Like a horror movie guy. And when he saw it he was like &#39;You should just go for it!&#39; I was like &#39;That would be cool.&#39; Because I could do everything I liked doing as this character that I&#39;m totally scared to death to do otherwise. And it applied to all the stuff I like, like Disneyland and martial arts and dancing, all that stuff I liked. I was like, &#39;I can&#39;t do it just like me.&#39; It was a great way to get all the stuff out.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why does DDG de-list things in the first place; isn&#39;t it in the interest of search engines to be as useful as possible to users, and thus maximise the results provided?Also curious to know the extent to which Google de-lists things?Long term, perhaps a decentralised search engine could get around de-listing and provide a more reliable and rigorous search experience."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author of the interview question here. I came up with the idea after working at the company for a couple months and realizing that the skill of &#34;diving into an unfamiliar area of the code and quickly figuring it out&#34; was very important for us. Database codebases are large and complex -- so much so that almost every new feature you work on for the first year or so feels a lot like doing the question.Over the years of evaluating with it, we learned a lot about its quirks (both false positives and false negatives). At one point, someone got so frustrated that they threw their laptop on the floor. Happy to answer any questions about it!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great interview question I don&#39;t want to be &#39;that guy&#39; by picking at what may be a detail but there is another response to look for from a candidate.We should think very carefully about adding a multiplication command because it introduces a failure mode that may be unanticipated by the client. Code that previously worked could begin to fail after this command goes into use.Specifically, if the client needs to revert a series of operations on integers, and if the operations are transitive, there is no need for a mechanism to ensure they occur in any particular order (the usual caveat about working within the limits of precision applies.) This holds true for addition and for multiplication, in isolation, but is not true if they are combined. Change the order and the end result will change. Adding multiplication puts a burden on the client to understand this risk and be explicit in the ordering.Some people may argue that the client should already understand it and they have a point. We can&#39;t defend against every possible misunderstanding. I think there is a good discussion to be had on this question and if the candidate were to go there, it would be a favorable sign of experience on their part."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think I&#39;ve been reading too many interview questions lately that I originally thought this was a trick question that required implementing mult with only the provided incrI like that this was a more of an engineering question about diving into an unfamiliar codebase than a gotcha math/algorithm question"</p>

If you are on one OS and this non-natve-looking app comes along, you have to mentally map it for your OS so it&#39;s none-nativeness requires mapping to the OS-nativeness.If you, on the other hand, only work &#34;in&#34; this application and just take it with you regardless of the OS, then you would indeed not need to mentally map the application itself.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; One little girl had 6 eggs in her basket by the end. That kid terrified me.I took our six year-old to an indoor climbing venue last year.   She&#39;d never done any kind of climbing before (although always seemed to be &#34;climbing on&#34; anything/everything at playgrounds and in kindergarten, particularly things that aren&#39;t really designed to be climbed.  Had had a few interactions with gravity, including landing on her face at a playground, one of the reasons that prompted me to check out options for some proper climbing instruction for kids)We pitched up, she met the trainer, she&#39;s the youngest in the group and also the last experienced, they get kitted out and head out to warm up then start climbing, I did what any HN parent does: fired up my laptop to catch up with work and stopped paying attention...About 15 mins later another parent came over to me and asked &#34;is that your daughter right at the top?&#34;  (about 16 meters/50 feet up, at the top of the wall)Me: &#34;err ... yeah&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I did a brief write up on some of the biggest new features here: https://gpanders.com/blog/whats-new-in-neovim-0-7/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I will never understand why people choose VSCode/Jetbrains over a terminal based editor. I can edit the kernel with clangd and get hover reference, autocomplete, go to def, ref, dec, smart refactor, and that&#39;s on top of being able to easily jump and fix lint/bugs using Vim&#39;s already great support for parsing compiler errors. With term added (which is a core Vim feature) it also has excellent support for gdb debugging. I am very glad that neovim is also making things EVEN BETTER with tree sitter and baked in LSP support.So I get 98-100% of what an IDE gives me, I can use my editor over ssh and edit anywhere, I don&#39;t need a GUI to even be installed on the system where I have all of my cores and RAM for compiling the kernel, it starts up instantly, and it&#39;s completely free and open source, not driven by a corporation, and there&#39;s decades of documentation on how to use it.Edit:I really don&#39;t understand the comments of &#34;I will literally not spend a single minute configuring my editor&#34;. I guess it&#39;s the systems developer in me that can&#39;t fathom someone that wants to use a tool to make a living without understanding it fully and being able to tweak it to their exact liking over the course of their entire career.I personally consider my investment into Vim one of the best I ever made. If dumb college me can do it in a few weekends, you can do it. I recently setup Emacs and got it to the same level as my Vim usage in about two days of tinkering just for fun. Then again, I suppose some people are just here for the money and want to clock in and clock out as fast as possible. I really wish I could share with you the joy of tinkering, learning, and growing your knowledge about how these wonderful machines work."</p>

Shirky&#39;s early essays were fundamental to way we understood the potential of the Web back in 1999-2008.I actually discovered this while looking for another old Shirky essay which, as far as I can tell, is now entirely gone from the Web."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I suppose we can look at this with nostalgic eyes.I was a big Shirky reader back in the day.But the truth is that all kinds of things disappear all the time in all aspects of life. The web is no different at all.Take my dad for instance - a quite profilic and famous mid level artist. It’s coming to the point where not much people remember him. And when my siblings pass on that will be that.Let’s not get too nostalgic. If someone is interested they should try to preserve the writings and keep them going.That’s why certain groups have taken it upon themselves to preserve old important films. And as we know they are always fighting for more donations to keep things going.Because in the end… no one really cares.50 years from now children will be asking who was Van Gogh."</p>

All those agendas require an OS which takes time to boot. Making it worse, some of those TVs&#39; CPU are crap and thus every operation takes much longer than those dumb ones. Lots of vendors also start to ship new remotes that removed all the essential buttons, especially the video source button, and I have to press 5 or more times than before just to switch to a different source.So we are actually paying more(of course, lots extra hardware cost) for less. But it does not end there. Vendors put lots of Ads in them, some vendors even put boot-up Ads regardless it is connected to internet or not. The worst I guess was mentioned in a couple of day ago some rouge vendor even started to put customized Ads based programs we are watching on air.I guess my replacement for a TV would be a big monitor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"TVs without a tuner are quite popular in Austria. You save around 30€ per month on payments to public TV stations, if your TV is just a monitor and has no tuner.You can get for example one of those (german, but you probably can read the specs anyway):https://nogis.at or https://www.gisbefreit.at/Most devices are not high end though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Quick story. I purchased a Sony tv with android OS. In the store, the OS did everything I wanted.When set the system up at home, it worked just like in the store.Then five days later, an OS update forced ads onto the front page. The entire home page was changed from what I had purchased.Fortunately, I could reset the device back to the previous OS version and not let it anywhere near a wi fi.What I purchased and what I was having in my possession became antithetical to what I wanted with a software update."</p>
