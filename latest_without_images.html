Infineon and AMD used to do a lot of research and production in Dresden. The AMD fab has since become a part of GlobalFoundries. But there&#39;s still a healthy ecosystem of university research and medium-sized software companies. Or at least there was, when I visited GlobalFoundries in 2014.Also, there has been a growing amount of research activity into chip design in Germany lately, driven in no small part by CERN&#39;s needs.For example

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is moves like this which show the tremendous impact of Tesla.  The old automakers were never going to be the ones to push the switch to greener tech themselves.  Even the companies that we may have thought were forward looking a decade ago like Toyota are now showing that they had no plans to embrace cleaner vehicles as an overall company strategy.  The industry needed an outsider to threaten the incumbents into actually changing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s crazy is I absolutly thought Toyota would be the leaders here. The prius HAD a full electric drivetrain ALREADY. Regen etc etc. Neat dash display. They could have dropped the gas engine out and simplified things, increase battery size and they&#39;d have been well on the way.Instead we have this hydrogen craziness. Billions here in CA have been spent on a &#34;hydrogen superhighway&#34;. Meanwhile, for some reason the EV / Tesla charging network is getting built out naturally - I just did an EV plug at home for my relatives with electric cars -&gt; no govt subsidy needed. If we get an EV (we want to) I will leave the house every day with a &#34;full&#34; tank.The conversion losses are a lot less with electric -&gt; Hydrogen you start with electricity, make hydrogen, compress it, transport it, pump it, use to to make electricity again, run engine.Electricity you can also make locally (solar etc) and hopefully one day use as a battery backup to your house (100kW house battery would be great)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Instead of everybody jumping on bandwagon and siding with every legislature to be PC, individuals and companies have right to challenge those laws or on how practical they are. These challenges will naturally yield better laws considering the huge wave already behind the electric vehicles.&#34;Toyota’s Indian subsidiary publicly criticized India’s target for 100 percent electric vehicle sales by 2030, saying it was not practical.&#34;, the keyword being not practical, country which struggles with electricity during summer and rations farmers electricity is legislating 100% electric?"</p>

Now that Apple has released a patch for it widespread reverse engineering will begin immediately and it&#39;ll only be a matter of time until packaged exploits become part of standard mass-use toolkits. Having a patch ready to deploy is great, but simultaneously means it&#39;s all the more important to get it deployed fairly promptly if it&#39;s something that could have serious root/remote execution potential.Though I suppose if this bug can be used for a jailbreak there may be some people who&#39;d actively want to stay on 14.7 as well.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thank you once again for writing such an excellent article &lt;3In contrast to some other comments here, I love the narrative style. After all, these are half tutorials half entertainment - and the entertainment keeps it enticing. I would not have spent nearly two hours reading about the nitty-gritty of futures implementation details today if it weren&#39;t for the way you write about things.To put it the other way - if I wanted to read a super condensed, concise reference of how these things work, I would, you know, read a reference. The narrative style of building things on your own, solving problems as you face them, picking tools and libraries on the way, feels relatable as the everyday lived experience of software development. It feels appropriate for the medium - it&#39;s a blog after all!Besides, blogs are the perfect place to mention the tiny useful tools and libraries people might not have heard of. References and books might err on the side of being &#34;neutral&#34; and not making opinionated recommendations, but this can also lead to unknown unknowns. People don&#39;t know what they are missing out on! Luckily, blogs have more freedom here. Mentioning things like `cargo-edit`, `serde` and others can probably make some readers feel like &#34;one of today&#39;s lucky ten thousand&#34; - enjoying the newly-gained quality of life improvements."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I don&#39;t know! Why do they truncate stuff like that?Because Linux limits thread names to 15 bytes (not including the required terminal nul).Other unices are better though not great, macOS is 63 I think.By comparison Windows allows 32… kilobytes.Though “runtime” is probably what should be shortened here, “rt” is literally the name of the tokio features for configuring the runtime, so that would likely be more understandable than the trailing “-w”."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So, most people reading this aren&#39;t looking for the marketing section. But I wanted to point something out I see all the time. Take a look at the roles under CMO at a 125 person company:--CMO (15)Director, Product Marketing, plus 3 PMMs (4)Director, Demand Gen, plus 3 marketers (4)Director, Sales Enablement, plus 2 marketers (3)Director, Brand Marketing (3)PR &amp; Analyst Relations (1-2)Events/Community (1)--What I posit is that Product Marketing is useless as a position and should be eliminated most of the time.The role ends up being:
- Jane Doe is the Product Marketer for product X. She&#39;s responsible for growing it as much as possible.
- She works with Anne X. in demand gen to make ads to promote the product to new customers.
- She works with Hillary Y. in email marketing to cross promote to existing customers
- She works with tech to do landing page/funnel testing.However what I find is that the role just adds friction and useless tests to show value. Let the subject matter experts (in demand gen, email, website testing) create the plan for each product holistically. Product Marketers are dead weight 80% of the time.I would only say this anonymously but its true. Source: I&#39;m a marketing consultant that has worked with dozens of fast growing SaaS companies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a good rough outline. As the author says, it&#39;s not meant to be a perfect target that fits every company. Adjust accordingly.I like how he limits the number of C-level titles in the early stages to just a CEO and CTO. It&#39;s a common mistake for startup founders to hand out too many C-level titles to their cofounders and early hires. This causes problems when the company outgrows some (or most) of those people. If you need to bring in a more experienced CMO, CRO, CSO, or other C-level, your only options are to demote the existing C-level and replace them with a new boss or to arrange their exit from the company. Neither are good looks, and neither make people happy.Much better to start with Director and VP level titles in the early days. You can either bring in a C-level above them when the time is right, or promote them to C-level if they grow into the role.That said, most SaaS I&#39;ve worked with would want more people on backend/devops at the earl stages. Having 3 people total handle combined devops and backend development is a big risk, especially if any of them want to go on vacation or leave for other jobs. Downtime and server outages are not a good look for a growing SaaS, so don&#39;t skimp on people who can keep it up and running."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why do the number of front end devs exceed the back end? Does anyone else see a problem here? Front end effort has always been a fraction of back end effort on the systems I&#39;ve developed. If that&#39;s not the case, I can only hypothesize it&#39;s because front end toolchains have gotten overly complex for what they accomplish. Not only that, but I would posit that for most SaaS ventures, the back end is where the differentiation and value is delivered, so that is where the bulk of dev resources should be deployed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Neat. I’ve been looking for something like this for gamedev — being able to model pseudo-realistic simulation of planetary evolution (for my interest, just starting at plate tectonics and going up until wind patterns) to provide a “basis” for further simulation.It’s surprisingly hard to google though; almost all content is simple perlin noise generation that looks kind of correct but ultimately produces total nonsense (so any further derived rules have to also be total nonsense) — generally constrained with further nonsense rules to produce higher level concepts like “animals” and “biomes” that can’t be touched meaningfully.Other material I can find is far too involved, and far too slow — targeting actual simulation of the earth. The few that do it with the goal of “just realistic enough” still end up being 10+ minutes generation time for small worlds. Modeling erosion processes being the main culprit, afaict.Definitely stealing this one, for all my nefarious deeds."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would like to see more work being done to simulate abiogenesis. Essentially, it&#39;s a search problem -- take some elements and probabilistically form increasingly complex molecular machines to the point where they become self-replicating and exhibit the basic properties of life. Once this bootstrapping has begun, it&#39;s a matter of subjecting the proto-lifeforms to evolutionary pressures, and over time, they will &#34;evolve&#34; to become increasingly complex organisms."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great work. Interesting that he didn&#39;t simulate the impact that formed the moon, though. I&#39;m interested in how that impacted (ha) plate tectonics. I&#39;m not aware of a scientific theory that posits a causality between the impact and plate tectonics, but we are the only rocky planet that has both plate tectonics and a natural satellite created by impact, so I have to wonder if they&#39;re related."</p>

I have my own opinion, but he&#39;s been right about stuff I&#39;d disagreed with him in the past before so I&#39;m gun shy about confronting his ideas again.On the topic of unsafe language though, he&#39;s absolutely right. We don&#39;t have to put up with this. We could pass a law and ban new code in unsafe languages from national security threatening devices like phones or cyberphysical devices like self-driving cars and we would be the better for it in under a decade. We could even have taxes to give breathing room during a transitionary period to encourage it before outright banning it, but we don&#39;t. We don&#39;t because so often it is less of a hassle for the government to trust the private sector that it is to take some real position on the regulatory issues that matter. This will probably always be the case until the government is able to evaluate talent and pay salaries in accordance with that talent as the private sector is."</p>

It makes some sense even here - that bad code is as common as bad law - and often for the same reasons, politics, money, and hard questions&#34;Engineering&#34; is a wide subject - the big stuff is carefully built and highly regulated -  bridges and buildings.  But as we go down the scale we see engineering give way to the problems of politics and money - tower blocks collapse for example, and then we see human level engineering - factory tools that try to meet  inflicting goals, dangerous toys and so much more.The software world should not beat itself up for not being like all those engineers - when lives are not on the line engineers get tied up just the same as the rest.   And when lives are on the line, software and hardware engineering have learnt a few things - reduce the scope to the barest possible essentials - have a lot of redundancy and stick to well known designs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I did a Ph.D. in number theory, published a few dozen research papers, and have programmed a lot and this post sounds about right to me.  I did CS as an undergrad, before doing a math Ph.D., and remember being very surprised that math papers weren&#39;t a lot more wrong than they actually are (since computer software is so often full of bugs, and all it takes is one single bug to completely invalidate an entire paper).  When I was a grad student at Berkeley, I once asked Serge Lang (who I think wrote the most advanced math textbooks of anybody who ever lived) why mathematics research papers don&#39;t have a lot more incorrect results in them.  He responded that it was because people secretly &#34;proved&#34; everything to themselves in multiple ways, but only wrote up one proof, and it was unlikely that multiple very different reasons for something being true would all be wrong.  Of course, there are serious mistakes and gaps in the literature, though what one person considers a gap, somebody else who knows more might not consider a gap.  For example, I remember once that Ernst Kani was complaining to me about a big gap in a paper by Ribet; I didn&#39;t believe it, so I read the relevant section and was able to fill in the gap in a few hours sufficiently to satisfy him.   In any case, I&#39;ve spent decades both programming and doing number theory, and despite some similarities, they are very different things.    Another related way these threads come together is with Kevin Buzzard&#39;s big project to formalize mathematics using LEAN; he&#39;s another number theorist, and he told me that a few years ago he started really worrying about the correctness of a lot of number theory papers, and that strongly motivated his interest in LEAN."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If anyone is interested in number theory and would like to help some incarcerated people that are working on a number theory paper:I&#39;m a director of the Prison Math Project: http://prisonmathproject.org/We have a few advanced mathematicians in jail who don&#39;t have access to computers. They need help with formatting their work in LaTeX and stuff like that to make it ready for publication (credit offered).They have previously co-authored some papers from within jail eg&#34;Linear Fractional Transformations And Nonlinear Leaping Convergents Of Some Continued Fractions&#34;&#34;Math And Art In Prison: A Collaborative Effort Across The Ocean&#34;please reach out if any interest in helping them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Anyway, despite the fact that error-correction is really hard, publishing actually false results was quite rare because &#34;people&#39;s intuition about what&#39;s true is mysteriously really good.&#34;I don&#39;t find that mysterious.  One aspect of number theory is that results have arbitrarily deep implications and relations.  If you are wrong about something you can often substitute it in somewhere else and produce a wrong answer or a contradiction.Doing something wrong which still looks right after being tested from a few different perspectives is extremely tricky.Like finding a pseudoprime for some probabilistic primaility test-- it&#39;s not likely to also be a pseudoprime for an unrelated test.  So pretty much the only way to pass a collection of independent probabilistic tests is to actually be prime.  (Note the &#39;pretty much&#39;-- a bunch of approximate proofs isn&#39;t a necessarily proof, but it at least explains why false things are seldom believed even when their headline proofs aren&#39;t solid)I don&#39;t just mean through different reviewers -- when you publish a proof of something you&#39;ve probably satisfied yourself that it was true through multiple avenues.  The proof you published was just the one you thought was the most convincing. Unfortunately, making an error in it can be something that makes a proof more convincing (until the error is found), but fortunately having an incorrect proof of something doesn&#39;t make the underlying fact untrue."</p>
