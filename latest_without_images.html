Throw out the Blue Check status symbol. Offer &#34;real person&#34; twitter filter.- Transparent and consistent moderation policies.

Musk has admitted he doesn&#39;t understand people, is a self-confessed troll &amp; edgelord and and Tesla&#39;s culture seems less than ideal. So lacks any of the qualifications I see as being needed to run something like Twitter. Maybe there&#39;s some other Musk magic that will do what so many others have failed to do."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here&#39;s an all-time great post about why you might consider SQLite in production with data about performance: https://blog.wesleyac.com/posts/consider-sqliteI use SQLite in production for my SaaS[1]. It&#39;s really great — saves me money, required basically no setup/configuration/management, and has had no scaling issues whatsoever with a few million hits a month. SQLite is really blazing fast for typical SaaS workloads. And will be easy to scale by vertically scaling the vm it&#39;s hosted on.Litestream was the final piece of the missing puzzle that helped me use it in production — continuous backups for SQLite like other database servers have: https://litestream.io/ With Litestream, I pay literally $0 to back up customer data and have confidence nothing will be lost. And it took like 5 minutes to set up.I&#39;m so on-board the SQLite train you guys.[1] https://extensionpay.com — Lets developers take payments in their browser extensions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of my previous employers was using SQLite as a large distributed database - they had their own custom sharding strategy, but essentially the idea was to shard A accounts * B tables * C num_of_days with a .db file for every shard.When I first came and saw it, it...did not sound right. But I didn&#39;t want to be the guy who comes in and says &#34;you are doing it wrong&#34; month 1. So I went along with it.Of course, eventually problems started to pop up. I distinctly remember that the ingestion (happening via a lot of Kafka consumers) throughput was high enough that SQLite started to crumble and even saw WAL overruns, data loss etc. Fortunately, it wasn&#39;t &#34;real&#34; production yet.I suggested we move to Postgres and was eventually able to convince everyone from engineers to leadership. We moved to a custom sharded Postgres (9.6 at the time). This was in 2016. I spoke to people at the place last month, and it&#39;s still humming along nicely.This isn&#39;t to illustrate anything bad about SQLite, to be clear! I like it for what it does. Just to show at least 1 use case where it was a bad fit.SQLite was a tempting first answer, but what solved it was Postgres, and we eventually offloaded a lot of aggregation tables to Clickhouse and turned the whole thing into a warehouse where the events got logged."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The sqlite docs page has a nice article [1] on when to use an embedded database such as sqlite and when to go with a client/server model (postgres, mysql or others)When not to use sqlite:- Is the data separated from the application by a network?- Many concurrent writers?- Data size &gt; 280 TBFor device-local storage with low writer concurrency and less than a terabyte of content, SQLite is almost always better.[1] https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I consumed a lot of blog posts like this before becoming a manager. It feels satisfying to read vague principles like this:&gt; Facilitate wellbeing&gt; Personal safety, dignity, and wellbeing of every team member are paramount. Team success is only success if team members feel good about it.But then you become an actual manager and realize that these are largely just feel-good aphorisms that don&#39;t really help navigate the hard work of being a manager.Don&#39;t get me wrong: I think &#34;facilitate wellbeing&#34; and similar tidbits are valid advice. Likewise, a manager who chooses to not facilitate wellbeing would clearly be in the wrong. But when you get into management you realize that the hard work isn&#39;t waking up and deciding to facilitate wellbeing. The hard work often involves making unpopular decisions, or telling someone &#34;no&#34; when their pet request wouldn&#39;t be in the best interests of the team, or defusing interpersonal conflict among two team members who have been feuding for months.These feel-good blog posts seem rather vacuous after being in the trenches of management for several years. Again, not because the advice is bad or wrong, but because it&#39;s just a lot of text around the basics of being a decent human being. Learning how to do the hard things about management or how to make unpopular but necessary decisions is something that you won&#39;t learn from the average blog post or LinkedIn post, largely because these function more as personal branding pieces than actual advice.In my experience, the best management advice comes from talking to the best managers you know personally. Online, the most practical management advice comes on smaller forums where people are either anonymous (and therefore less interested in personal brand building) or older and accomplished (and therefore not worried about blowback impacting their career). The type of feel-good blog posts or LinkedIn blurbs that people associate with their personal brand don&#39;t really add much value after you&#39;ve read 5-10 articles saying the exact same aphorisms."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lot of misconceptions here that cause teams to underperform.1. Managing comes first. (Nope, as a manager your are primarily responsible for ensuring a good outcome. As your title goes from manager, senior, higher to VP etc this becomes more important. Lower job titles you get paid to &#34;do the work&#34;, higher titles are about &#34;achieve outcome&#34;.) In the current market you&#39;ll often run into team members that don&#39;t perform. I see this so often where leads think that they have to &#34;manage&#34; and not do the work and the result is them and their team failing
2. Facilitate wellbeing. That&#39;s nice. But your primary responsibility is to A. Achieve the goal. B. hold people accountable to an acceptable level of performanceGive credit, take blame: That&#39;s a good one.This post is just full of vague language that doesn&#39;t hold anyone accountable. Sucks to be an IC on that team, thinking everything is going well and eventually end up having whole teams being fired since your manager didn&#39;t set the right pace."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This sounds pretty good, all these are qualities anyone would want in their manager if they had a job doing &#39;the critical path of execution&#39;.  There&#39;s few things more frustrating than continually having to halt in the middle of one task to jump over to another task because someone&#39;s pants are on fire.  Sure it happens, but it should be the exception not the norm.However, there&#39;s another side to the manager&#39;s job that doesn&#39;t seem to be addressed - interfacing upwards with whatever layers link to owners, founders, the board, shareholders, etc.  How does that exactly work out in practice?  Let&#39;s say leadership makes what you think are really stupid decisions with disastrous longterm consequences (ex: Boeing 737 MAX design process, Google signing up with China to build Dragonfly, etc.).  What do you do? Pour gasoline on yourself and set yourself on fire in protest, or roll your eyes in despair and proceed to assign your team to the task?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Dart, despite being a from-scratch, relatively modern language, ended up with three implementations (host AOT compiler, host IDE compiler (dart-analyzer), on-device JIT compiler).We also had an earlier analyzer written in Java that was mostly discarded and rewritten as well as two compilers to JavaScript that share less code than you would expect.Some of the redundancy is because, as the author correctly states, the needs of an IDE are quite different from the needs of a batch compiler. Likewise, an ahead-of-time whole program compiler has different constraints from a JIT compiler running a program from source.But a lot of the redundancy in Dart&#39;s case is incidental. We have a fairly large, distributed team with a lot of autonomy and sometimes that led to people doing their own thing instead of putting in the effort into coordinating and sharing more code.Also, the language changed radically from Dart 1.0 to 2.0. 1.0 was a dynamically typed scripting language designed to be run from source in a native VM directly embedded in a browser with a separate optional type system mostly used at dev time. Dart 2.0 is a fully statically-typed language with a more typical compilation process.That monumental change led to some duplication and technical debt that we are slowly paying down by sharing more and more of the front end over time.The path I see most new languages take is:1. Start with a command-line batch mode compiler.2. Eventually get popular enough that users clamor for real IDE support.3. Cobble together an IDE plug-in based on the batch-mode compiler&#39;s front end.4. Discover that the latency is horrific and slowly and painfully realize you need to write a new front end architected for IDE use.5. Now you have two front ends.I believe the throughput loss of a front-end designed for interactive IDE use is less than people realize. So I suspect that a more efficient path for any new language is to design your front end for interactive IDE use from day one."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Recycling partially used soap is a good idea. Making sure everyone around the world has access to soap is certainly super important.There&#39;s really no reason US recycled soap needs to be the soap that is sent to (eg) Africa, shipped over oceans. Doesn&#39;t (eg) Africa have it&#39;s own soap production facilities? But I guess American consumers would be unwilling to use recycled soap?  Or just the neat connection between the soap collected in one place and delivered to those poor unfortunates overseas is what&#39;s necessary to get funding and other support? Nobody wants to fund just paying for soap in (say) Africa or just recycling soap in the US, I guess.Causing &#34;60%+ reduction in the number of children who die from diarrheal diseases each year&#34; -- is a pretty stunning claim.  Looking closer... I guess they&#39;re simply saying that children ding of such diseases had dropped by 60% from 1990 to 2020, not that they alone are responsible for that? Just that they&#39;ve &#34;helped&#34; to some unknown extent?  I bet most readers didn&#39;t catch that. That seems a bit dishonest actually. Still, even the 60% reduction in such deaths over 20 years alone is pretty great and I hadn&#39;t known about it! (I believe this is one of the leading causes of death in man parts of the world -- or used to be?).  I suspect this particular effort had a pretty minimal contribution to those numbers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Those tiny hotel soaps are just the peak of the iceberg.My SO used to work seasonally in a hostel in Venice. People leave a lot of half-used shower gel bottles, soaps, makeup products etc.It got to a point where the staff just put all the products which were safe to use(laundry detergent, shower gels, spray deodorant, shaving foam) in an unoccupied room referred to as &#34;the Rossmann&#34; (popular drugstore chain in some European countries) from which everyone in the know was at liberty to take as much as they wished.A fraction of the goods were originally found unopened."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a poor use of resources. Sending anything but money to places in need is just wasteful. This soap effort is not efficient. The expense of collecting the soap, refining it in a garage (including cost of the equipment), and delivering it to the recipients is almost certainly vastly more than if they&#39;d just sent cash and bought brand new soap local to the recipients. And that&#39;s not even factoring in the labor of the people doing it. This is another feel-good measure that is economically stupid, and whose primary purpose is to make the volunteers feel good about themselves. That&#39;s fine, if that&#39;s what they want to do with their time and money. But no one should help them by donating. It&#39;s far better to donate your cash to people that make efficient use of it."</p>

But in Rwanda, that number flips: 83 percent of Rwandans live in rural areas.DON’T BE FOOLED by Rwanda’s rural demographics; the country has a reputation for leaning into health tech innovations. Rwanda’s universal health care system reaches over 90 percent of the population. In 2009, the government piloted a phone-based program, called RapidSMS, to track and reduce maternal and child mortality.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Disclaimer: IANAL, IANATA, this isn&#39;t tax advice, etcForeigners residing in Japan are eligible to participate in furusato nouzei, but Americans might want to note the following clause in the section &#34;Tax Must Be the Legal and Actual Foreign Tax Liability&#34; in Publication 514 Foreign Tax Credit for Individuals[1], which states:&gt;Subsidy received. Tax payments a foreign country returns to you in the form of a subsidy do not qualify for the foreign tax credit.&gt;The term “subsidy” includes any type of benefit. Some ways of providing a subsidy are refunds, credits, deductions, payments, or discharges of obligations.Whether or not furusato nouzei falls under this clause seems to be up for some debate, and AFAIK the IRS hasn&#39;t made a public determination on it either way. I don&#39;t risk it, but I am under the impression there are some that do.Alternatively, the furusato nouzei portion could be not included in the tax credit? But would it be worthwhile...? Sounds like it depends on the situation and frankly seems like a lot of work to get a few gift baskets.[1]: https://www.irs.gov/publications/p514#idm139978451112272"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This counsels that a young person born and educated in e.g. Gifu move to Tokyo after graduation to earn a living.
&gt; Many, many do. While Japan’s overall population is declining, Tokyo’s increases by about 100,000 people per year.Notably this differs from America in that rent acts as a natural counterbalance here. It’s not common knowledge that a university graduate should move to New York or San Francisco, in fact if you aren’t in a top paying field it’s probably common knowledge that one should not move to these cities.I wonder how much different the population landscape of the United States would look like if NYC, the Bay Area, LA etc had ever figured out how to plan for urban growth in the same way Tokyo did (context: you can afford a small single family home on a middle class income in Tokyo, I think prices there are around 30% over other Japanese cities)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Omoshiroi! This is a really nice write up. Education is indeed very expensive and the towns outside of Tokyo have difficulties surviving, with only older people remaining there. Those towns have to be very creative to attract money and people. You can get a house for free, if you will live there, similar to some Italian towns.In the Netherlands we have similar issue of towns fighting for survival in more rural parts (Limburg). They try to combine schools of several towns to reduce the cost of teachers, and similar combining police stations.Lowering the friction for such &#39;gift tax&#39; is interesting, Japanese are big into all kind of little gifts: if you go on holiday you bring something small, an Omiage. If you attend a birthday party, not only you bring a present (which is usual everywhere) but the guest also get a little gift in return, an Okaeshi."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are a couple of techniques that I have used in the past that have worked well.First, don&#39;t edit the proposed contract itself. Instead, add a rider that specifically overrides the provisions you don&#39;t like. Something like &#34;Intellectual Property. Work produced by employee shall be considered work-for-hire. &#39;Work&#34; is defined as...&#34; Then add a line to the bottom of the rider that says &#34;If any portion of this rider is in conflict with the main contract, the terms of the rider will override the terms of the contract.&#34; The benefit of this approach is that you avoid the back-and-forth niggling over particular words in the main contract, and you often overcome the other party&#39;s resistance to changing the language their lawyers said had to be there. It&#39;s stupid, but it works.The second technique is simply to say, &#34;this contract isn&#39;t large enough to justify these provisions. If you would like to bump the contract, we can talk. Otherwise, no.&#34; This has worked for me in negotiating software licenses. I haven&#39;t tried it in an employment situation. It works because it forces the other side to acknowledge that their demands have costs, and they can have what they want only if they pay for it. They never do.I am not a lawyer. Heed this advice at your own risk."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m not certain my experience is relevant in this context, but I’ve been fighting contract language for over 30 years. I’m a pro photographer and producer in the biz for many years. I produce unique content that is quite challenging to recreate.So many contracts contain what I call “rights grabs”. They are attempting to transfer my IP to them for maximum profit. I’ve fought this trend with success for decades.I simply cross out the offending language in the contract and make the license contingent on the agreement proceeding as I describe. I’m happy to abandon a contract if it does not go my way (a luxury not everyone has).My largest checks in the past two years have been from lawsuits brought against copyright infringement. In every case my contract revisions have withstood legal challenge and the defenders/offenders have folded when they proceeded as if the original contract language (before I altered, after they signed) stood.There are lawyers who have pursued this niche to great success and I have lawyer team ready to pursue infringement on a contingency basis. It is quite amazing.More than once now, my lawyers have fought for years when the infringers had deep pockets and a terror of precedent. They paid so many thousands to their legal team but lost. I have prevailed in every case.I recognize this is bragging. But so many of my colleagues have just signed for a short term check while losing in the long run. I might be an obstinate  fool, but so far it’s paid off.We in the photo biz have had to survive a huge paradigm shift in the biz model in the last 18 years. But so many people fold for Pennie’s. “I need this $250 right now to make rent”. But my settlement checks are in the $25,000 range typically (25% after my lawyers and agent get their cut).Last I looked, the average income for a photographer in the U.S, was around $7500 a year. Yes, $7500 (no missing zeros). I make six figures consistently and I’m damn proud of this fact.Most of the conversations on this forum are above my skill set, but you folks are generally paid for deep knowledge and rare skills. Don’t let anyone steal this from you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let&#39;s talk about &#34;unlimited PTO&#34; -- I&#39;m seeing more of this in my half-hearted job search and I&#39;m really wary about it. I&#39;d like to get my prospective employer to agree in writing to a certain number of days that would be considered normal/acceptable PTO, so I don&#39;t a) feel guilty for taking that amount and b) get shafted in performance assessments for taking a normal amount.Has anybody had any luck getting a prospective employer who advertises &#34;unlimited PTO&#34; to do this in contract negotiation phase? Basically I don&#39;t want to just rely on the goodwill of said new employer to treat me respectfully for taking a good chunk of said PTO, and I want to define what is reasonable expectations up-front."</p>
