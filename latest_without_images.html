Steam Deck is a PC, and players will be able to install whatever they like, including other OSes.[0]: https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/steamdeck/faq"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Gotta admit, I never saw that coming. I thought SteamOS was dead after the failure of Steam Machines and Valve was only continuing with their Linux efforts because it&#39;s still a useful hedge against Microsoft locking everyone in the App Store. I totally did not expect them to copy the Switch use-case with it.I&#39;m anxious to see how this turns out. Valve&#39;s history with hardware is not so great, so it could go nowhere like Steam Machines, Steam Link, and the Steam Controller did. On the other hand, it could end up all but killing off PC gaming if it is super successful. If it lands somewhere in the middle it will at least be yet another boon for Linux gaming brought to you by Valve as more developers will port or ensure compatibility with Proton."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wonder if corruption in the Chinese military is the same, worse or better. If they are not paying $600 to replace 20 cent bolts, we are heading towards a massive shift in military power, because their military spending has surged since 2016 and they are now spending almost as much on defense as the US."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was a deliberate decision back in the 1980s and 1990s related to how to structure personnel. You&#39;ll likely recognize it as how software teams are siloed and the concept of &#34;full stack&#34; is kind of a misnomer.The theory was basically that complex systems needed specialization for building and maintenance and that the US military could not afford or recruit the kind of people that could simultaneously run operations, do management AND troubleshoot.In other words, military personnel are not seen as technical experts that focus on one thing for a decade, moreso that they are like project managers who have depth in one area from their first 5-6 years and then &#34;broaden&#34; out to fill in the management layer of the force beyond that.There are exceptions to this of course, warrant officers and the like. However it&#39;s a tiny slice and given how massive the system is and how many sub-systems are involved - the management layer grows in the form of uniformed ranks while the technician layer grows in the contractor ranks because of how the force is structured.The incentive for that contract force however is to keep the contract (and follow on) and the knowledge related to it, so they end up building in these kind of &#34;nobody can touch this but us&#34; requirements. Functionally you can see how this is a self fulfilling prophecy - we aren&#39;t recruting or structuting our force to have the capability to maintain systems because we have a contract force that does it.To fix this a deliberate decision has to be made to change the force structure to build more technicians and unfortunately people like that don&#39;t want to take the pay and lifestyle cut so we just can&#39;t fill out the ranks.I could go on all day, including how the defense industrial base as well as citizens balking at growing the size of the uniformed forces reinforce this system, but it&#39;s a pervasive problem across multiple vectors."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s a bit surprising (if not ironic) but I think it may make sense in a way. It&#39;s been pretty clear that Mudabala (an Abu Dhabi fund that bought AMD fabs in 2008 which then became GlobalFoundries) wanted to unload that investment after they stopped shoving money into failed process developments (GloFo licensed their 14nm from Samsung as a reminder after their own 14 failed, and their 7nm failed too), so no surprise on their end.From Intel&#39;s perspective, there are also some US assets from IBM, which GloFo &#34;acquired&#34; in 2014 (for -1.5 billion at the time), which includes some oldish US fabs, but also a patent portfolio. It certainly goes into the current US political narrative that Gelsinger has been pushing.But perhaps more importantly, I think that what Intel is buying is what was sorely lacking them : people and a methodology of working with external customers.
From all I&#39;ve heard over the years, Intel&#39;s process and design teams are so insular and out of touch with the rest of the industry&#39;s practices that they had a terrible time just working with customers. It wasn&#39;t pretty when they tried the two previous time to open up their process. Loads of announcements, few products if any coming out, and when it worked, they ended up buying their customers anyway, see Altera.If Intel truly wants to go in the foundry direction, they&#39;ll get some interesting outside experience, and while it may not make sense from a pure process point of view, considering how much of a sore point their inability to make it work has been on their previous attempts, the idea may have a lot of merit.Perhaps a very smart move from Gelsinger, time will tell, in the meantime I&#39;ll have a laugh at Intel buying AMD&#39;s old fabs :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Intel wants to get into the foundry business.  99% of what Intel does is for their own chips.  They don&#39;t have the support infrastructure of being able to deal with external customers.  Global Foundries has that.You don&#39;t just decide to make a chip.  There are hundreds of foundry specific libraries, design rules, and more.  There are always problems with the EDA CAD tools for new processes and you need lots of support people to answer questions and help debug problems that your customers are having.Intel has tried being a foundry before multiple times over the last 20 years.  They always fail and give up after a couple of years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great article. Since it looks like a lot of folks are interested in this article, some extra background.First, what is forcing? The article actually has a great description of ultrapowers (a key part of the construction) but it goes by a little fast, so you might like Tim Chow&#39;s &#34;A beginner&#39;s guide to forcing&#34; [1] which does a good job not only laying out the mathematical details at a high level, but also really clearly explaining the philosophy of how you prove something independent of the axioms. I found it very illuminating.Second, the article has some interesting notes on how mathematicians go about what axioms to select and which not to. Penelope Maddy&#39;s &#34;Believing the Axioms&#34; [2] is the classic on this topic (it has two parts). It is focused on set theory, so it has a nice description of Martin&#39;s axiom and the arguments for and against. It was nice to read because it is a deeply technical argument (set theory is hard!) but at the same time there is no &#34;right answer&#34;—all of these axioms, after all, are independent of ZFC, and it&#39;s &#34;ok&#34; to add any of them. The arguments are sometimes aesthetic (&#34;rules&#34; versus &#34;surprises&#34;), sometimes pragmatic (what they can and cannot prove), and sometimes involve deep values of what the universe should be like (should higher cardinalities be like lower ones? weirder? simpler?).It might all seem abstract, but if your day job is programming, imagine an argument over how to architect a large and complex system. Perhaps both architectures are possible, but which one is &#34;right&#34;? What arguments would you deploy? Set theorists are also building a large and complex system (the universe of sets) and are having arguments over how it should be built, which things it should make easy and which hard, which technologies should be supported natively (forcing?) and which should not.[1] http://timothychow.net/forcing.pdf

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Man there&#39;s a lot of juicy stuff in this article (Woodin&#39;s Ultimate L program gets briefly alluded to at the end of the article).I just want to point out, because the HN crowd seems to generally not be mathematical Platonists, that this entire article is implicitly assuming a Platonist philosophical foundation. This may cause confusion for lay readers who are not mathematical Platonists.In other words the article assumes that mathematical objects have an objective existence: they either exist or they do not. Hence every single logical axiom has a truth value. You do not get to arbitrarily choose what logical axioms you want. If you do, you can end up choosing the &#34;wrong one.&#34; Therefore it is an important question to understand whether the Continuum Hypothesis is true or not, even if it&#39;s independent of ZFC (and hence requires ultimately philosophical rather than mathematical arguments).If you aren&#39;t a Platonist and instead view logical axioms as having no inherent truth value, but rather foundations that you can pick and choose from as necessary (where in one case you may choose to use an axiom and in another you may choose its negation), then all that might sound very strange to you. In that case, you should mentally substitute every instance of &#34;true&#34; or &#34;false&#34; in the article with &#34;agrees or disagrees with the meta model used to examine the semantics of a logical theory.&#34; In particular, whenever we talk about a formal treatment of the semantics (i.e. model) of a theory, whether that be something like ZFC or a programming language, we must always make those statements relative to a meta-model.For example if we talk about the formal semantics of a language like C, we must first posit a meta-model which already contains notions of things like &#34;integer&#34; and &#34;natural number&#34; which can be used to give meaning to statements such as &#34;performed an operation n times.&#34; If you&#39;re not a Platonist then you probably believe that there are multiple possible meta-models you could use."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For 50 years, mathematicians have believed that the total number of real numbers is unknowable.It&#39;s an established result that the Continuum Hypothesis is independent of Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms of set theory. No proof is going change that.So whatever has been proved here doesn&#39;t change that. It will take a second to get the reference but Raymond Smullyan says essentially that &#34;we&#39;re not looking for a proof or disproof of CH, we&#39;re looking for an assumption that can be shown to be natural enough that we can take it as an axiom&#34;.Just sayin&#39; since the (subheading) writer seems to be playing fast and loose with the concepts involved.Edit: article goes on to give rigorous explanation but still starting &#34;no one knew&#34; confuses what&#39;s going on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember a long time ago in the UK, around 2003 or so, there was a similar problem with Fruit Machines (Slot machines found in UK bars and pubs).Through dumping the ROMs and emulating the machines, it was found that the machines were effectively forcing losses at certain points in gameplay; from the same memory state, you bet high and the machine goes low, or you bet low and the machine goes high, giving you zero chance of winning.There was a campaign called Fairplay that I believe resulted in a fairly small print label being placed on the machines stating that they would at times give no chance of winning; not a great win, but at least it was being said somewhere - http://worldofstuart.excellentcontent.com/fairplay/fruit/bre...The FairPlay site by Stuart Campbell is actually still up, although I remember first reading about it back in PC Zone personally.

I pretty much could guess that something like the article discusses was at work, and was simply more a game of luck.Obviously I stopped after that, as a pure luck game is not as fun. If I had known that the default was 700 losses before payout as a default, I would have had a nice drink or 3 and counted the many people that tried it throughout the dayAs a side note, saw one winner at the machine get a wrapped stack of 500, 1 dollar bills"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; It&#39;s been frustrating me for a long time that most companies when hiring are looking for people who do lots of side projects and open source work,This is a myth.The number of candidates I interview who have side projects worth looking at or open source contributions is maybe 1-in-10 at most. Any company that requires candidates to have significant open source contributions is going to have a hard time hiring, because it’s not very common.Really, the only time side projects are valuable is when someone needs to fill gaps in their resume. For example, if all of your prior experience was writing PHP backend code but you wanted to apply to a React front-end role, it could be helpful to have something like a React TODO app in your GitHub profile to show that you have some minimal experience with React and front-end work. You don’t need a massive open-source contribution that takes months and months of free time, just something small to show that you have some amount of experience that isn’t reflected in your resume.The side project myth is getting out of control. Most recruiters and hiring managers will never even open your GitHub profile."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Recruiters want people who do side projects [...] having side projects and doing open source is valued in hiringI think your premise is wrong and you&#39;re vastly overestimating the value of work done outside of your job.- Having side projects: I was never asked past internship interviews. Even interviewing for my first job after graduation, I talked about what I did during my internship, not about side or school projects.- Meaningful yet small contributions to open source: I don&#39;t remember anyone noticing nor asking.- Major contributions to a big open source project: I assume these people get hired easily.Recruiters are not dumb. They know that most good candidates are either not allowed or not willing to work on meaningful projects on the side, outside of a few very specific cases. Don&#39;t waste your time with companies that have delusional hiring standards."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Admittedly it&#39;s been a long time since this has been something I&#39;ve had to worry about - but back when I just asked for it to be cut out the contract. Generally everyone was fine with it, especially when you explain &#34;it&#39;s how I learn to do stuff that benefits me in the office&#34;. I think the general worry was twofold - that a) working on my own stuff would mean I didn&#39;t get my actual job done, and b) that working on my own stuff would mean I leave sooner and it&#39;s costly to pay for recruiters and refill roles.It probably helps explaining what sort of side projects you do, how much time they take, your &#39;real&#39; job pays for you to live and this is the nerdy equivalent to playing 5-a-side football or watching movies.Anecdotally a (very skilled) dev friend recently got a job with a (UK) challenger bank and was required to sign a similar thing, they were happy to carve add exceptions for a couple of things he was working on."</p>
