They also release a language model to benefit everyone even if it says politically incorrect stuff.  They also name their projects &#34;cocaine&#34; probably to perhaps to prevent western competitors from using them.You look at OpenAI and how they don&#39;t release their models mainly because they fear &#34;bad people&#34; will use them for &#34;bad stuff.&#34;  This is the trend in the west.  Technology is too powerful, we must control it!  Russia is like... Hey, we are the bad guys you&#39;re talking about so who are we keeping this technology from?  The west has bigger language models than we do, so who cares.  Also their attitude to copyright and patents, etc.  They don&#39;t care because that&#39;s not how their economy makes money.  Cory Doctorow&#39;s end of general purpose computing[1] and locked down everything is very fast approaching.  I&#39;m glad the Russians are around and aren&#39;t very interested in that project.[1]https://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/resources/tech-talks/cory-doctor..."</p>

People are yelling at eachother about the CIA and the legitimacy of Israel and Assange and the definition of fascism and… anything that pisses anybody off about international politics in general. In a thread about a piece of software that’s (to me and likely many others) prohibitively expensive to play around with.Anyway I hope somebody creates a playground with this so I can make a computer write a fan fiction about Kirby and Solid Snake trying to raise a human baby on a yacht in the Caspian Sea or whatever other thing people will actually use this for."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This might be overreacting but is there a way to opt-out of Copilot using your code in open source repos?It feels morally wrong to me that I can spend thousands of hours working on projects on my own free will but then a company can sell the code I wrote to others in the form of snippet completion as a service. In fact they end up selling your code back to yourself if you plan to use the service.If the answer is no, that moves the needle pretty far in the direction where I&#39;d at least consider the idea of moving all of my repos to Gitlab. I don&#39;t care much about stars or popularity. I open source things that are interesting and useful to me and if other folks want to use it they can but I don&#39;t gain motivation from others using the projects I release. I like Github and its UI and it&#39;s no doubt &#34;the spot&#34; for open source but selling code written by others rubs me the wrong way a lot. It stinks because it also means no longer contributing to other code bases too. It&#39;s moving us in the opposite direction of what open source is about."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find this whole topic very annoying, this is like the 3rd variation to reach the front page today. But it has made me realize why I instinctively dislike Free Software as a movement.Copyright and licensing are bad, actually. Stop getting worked up about the idea of using courts to punish theft. Stop getting into a frenzy of arousal about the police kicking down doors to drag Billy Gates to jail because 80 characters of fast square root is theft but 79 isn&#39;t.Where on earth is the ambition and vision!? Knowledge is public domain. A commons of knowledge is a public good. The cost of code copying is zero.Sure in our day job we have to pretend to care about this stuff. But when did the ideological scope of what can be achieved become rules lawyering over license text.Copy my MIT licensed code without attribution? I don&#39;t give a shit, go ahead, I hope it helps, in fact I want a truly public domain license but copyright law is so hostage to corporate interests no such thing exists in many countries.Free the code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is now proven that copilot returns code from codebases with non-permissive licenses [1].I&#39;m curious - what are the legal implications of this going forward? I&#39;ve so many questions.1. Will Microsoft ever face lawsuits for these license violations?2. If so, who/how? Class-action?3. Will copilot be forced to open-source in the future? Under which license? Some open source licenses are incompatible with others, but copilot uses code from probably every OSS license conceived.4. If Microsoft faces no justice, will we start seeing more OSS license violations? Will Google start using AGPL-licensed code?[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27710287 | Copilot regurgitating Quake code"</p>

Then in my list of aliases I alias foobarnator to foobarnatorToBeAliased.sh.The alias itself looks a bit weird in that to pass arguments to an aliased command you need to use a function (in Bash at least AFACIT) but it all works fine.As aliases aren&#39;t sourced when other scripts are running, I&#39;m sure my scripts/commands ain&#39;t ever going to clash with anything.I&#39;ve been doing that since years.It also works fine to add &#34;wrappers&#34; to existing commands: for example to add additional input sanitization catching common mistakes I&#39;m making when calling some commands."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ya know, it’s funny. I like Python. We like it enough to actually use it in embedded products. It has its limits, and we use other tools where it doesn’t fit. Python in a browser seems like a keen idea.But JavaScript vs Python isn’t really the key thing for me on the web. It’s the uncanny pile of other software one uses to build a man-machine connection that flummoxes me. It’s the CSS, the DOM, the events, the browser API, the ever churning massive pile of complexity that interactive software has become with the voluminous W3C specs, expressed in near BNF form and full of edge cases and backwards compatibility, all so every thing my user does can be observed by myself a few megacorps. I honestly wouldn’t care if I could write it in Fortran. It’s such a minor wart of the whole mess.Caring about which actual language you can use in all the script tags of a jacked up text format feels like caring which font is being used in your favorite hot piece of government legislation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article describes what is possible with Python in a browser, but misses an important detail: how much memory it consumes and how much CPU it uses.Python is not a fast language. For example, consider a simple loop:    for i in range(10):
        pass

In Python, this will be compiled into: a call to range(), heap allocation of an Iterable, calling getIterator() on an Iterable (which might also do allocation), calling next() on an Iterator while catching for StopIteration exception (and calls are often slow in interpreted languages). While in C we could just have a loop without any calls.I remember how I had to use a Dart-based web application (compiled to JS) in one of Google&#39;s advertising products. The script weighed around several megabytes and everything was so slow. Furthermore, there also was a small and useless &#34;what&#39;s new&#34; applet, and it probably was shipped with a separate copy of Dart runtime because it weighed several megabytes too. Obviously this was a product intended to be used only on latest MacBooks, not on a Windows XP laptop.It is totally fine to write such application for youself, or maybe for internal use, but if you are a corporation with millions of users, I think you should pay a little attention to performance and choose a better technology. Or, if you are of a Google scale, find a way to optimize the code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"  &gt; But there is another aspect of the language that makes it so desirable from his standpoint: it can be extended with binary extensions that use an API that is written in C, but can be accessed from other languages. He likens Python to &#34;a Honda Civic with mounting bolts for a warp drive&#34;. So the language can be picked up by kids who can then pop open the trunk &#34;and bolt on warp nacelles&#34; that allows the code to run faster than C or C++ in some cases, Wang said.
  &gt; 
  &gt; That aspect is sometimes overlooked, but it means that Python can be used in ways that other, similar languages cannot. &#34;It&#39;s not just like Node, it&#39;s not just an alternative to Ruby&#34;.

Both node and Ruby have a comprehensive C API, this is a very common language feature since binding to native libraries is unavoidable. Is there actually anything different about python here?https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like Rust and I&#39;d love to see it in the Linux kernel, but not before the GCC+Rust issues are all fixed. You shouldn&#39;t need non-GCC compilers to compile Linux and from what I can tell there isn&#39;t any GCC Rust compiler that&#39;s fully equivalent to the standard Rust compiler just yet.They say that Rust support is optional, but when the first big driver gets written in Rust it&#39;ll become mandatory. So either the Rust integration will fail and nothing important will get written in it, or it won&#39;t be optional. I&#39;m not sure what comfort that&#39;s supposed to bring."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"EDIT: It is very bit unfortunate that my general/off-topic comment is currently the most upvoted. I was not commenting on the Linux integration specifically. I&#39;m a _novice and hobbyist_ when it comes to Rust.For example this comment https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31849071 is much more interesting and on topic.---I want to provoke a little bit, but I&#39;m genuinely curious about the following:I feel like the Rust ecosystem is still quite immature in a lot of areas. Just a few indicators to illustrate what I mean:- Both async/await and the question mark operator feel like rushed implementations, neither seem like the best long term solutions for Rust and are not in line with the otherwise solid foundation of the language.- Open source code examples sometimes use an array of external dependencies that are unrelated to a given project and feel arbitrary. This reminds me of the JS ecosystem.- Some projects pride themselves to not use &#34;unsafe&#34; code, including linking with battle tested C code, which seems like an arbitrary restriction that sounds better than it actually is. There is even an open source maintainer that got mobbed out from his own project because he used &#34;unsafe&#34; in places that others didn&#39;t agree with.- Rust is fashionable. Putting &#34;Rust&#34; next to a HN title immediately gets clicks and upvotes. SO surveys and similar report high interest in the language. This is not an inherently bad thing, quite the opposite. But as a secondary effect it might detract from objective, technical decision making.I really like the language, I have _way_ more good things to say about it than bad things. But am I alone in feeling like this? Other modern language communities come with a philosophy that promotes stability and simplicity. Is the Rust community riding on the merits of Rust&#39;s unique value proposition, while forgetting some important fundamentals?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is my humble opinion, but kernel shouldn&#39;t be a place for language diversity. Even code comments should be standardized for such critical and complex project with so many participants."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have started doing something completely different than using bookmarks. I set up yacy[1] on a personal, internal server at my home, which I can access from all my devices, since they are always on my wireguard vpn.Yacy is actually a distributed search engine, but I run in &#39;Robinson mode&#39; as a private peer, to keep it isolated, as I just want a personal search of only sites I have indexed.Anytime I come across something of interest, I index it with yacy, using a a depth of 0 (since I only want to index that one page, not the whole site). This way, I can just go to my search site, and search for something, and anything related that I&#39;ve indexed before pops up. I found this works way better than trying to manage bookmarks with descriptions and tags.Also, yacy will keep a cache of the content which is great if the site ever goes offline or changes.If I need to browse, I can go use yacy&#39;s admin tools to see all the urls I have indexed.I have been using this for several months and I am using this way more than I ever used my bookmarks.[1] https://yacy.net/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I (still) use Pinboard: https://pinboard.in/u:pratyush  Reasons:
  1. Archives - those tutorials and guides stay when the original pages go 404
  2. API - I use the api to automatically post my bookmarks to my blog
  3. Full-text search: this is very very useful when needed
  4. Social Discovery: Search that niche website / app on Pinboard. It shows lots of other people who found that same thing as interesting. We can then follow them and subscribe to their favourites as RSS feed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have tried many different solutions the last two decades, but none of of them really stuck or became useful over time. I kinda gave up and as a last ditch effort started to do the simplest thing I could think of: ctrl+D to add bookmarks in Firefox, jotting down a few keywords on each entry. No folders, no structure, just a flat list and some keywords.A few months in I noticed how powerful this simple system was. When talking with someone else about a tool, github-repo or article I had seen but did no remember the name or title of, finding it back was suddenly a breeze. Since I keep my desktop and mobile bookmarks in sync, it it just a matter of typing in a keword in the address bar in firefox and it shows up instantly!On desktop, you can limit the search to bookmarks only by starting with a *, which is helpful to avoid browser history etc.I have really low bar for adding a bookmark now as the mental overhead is so low and it is done notime. It has become the second brain I always wanted :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ve been following Zeihan since his first book. I’m yet to find a credible counter argument to his theses. And he’s being proven right at an alarming pace this year.So far this year we’ve had:- A land war in Europe- Food insecurity in the developing world- Breakdown of supply chains and shipping routes- Nation states resorting to seizing each other’s ships (see Greece-Iran issue recently).Everything that he had talked about in the past and in his latest book.The thing about Zeihan’s arguments is that you can’t really argue against demographics. You can procure any resource from any part of the world, but if you want an 18 year old to consume or work or fight, you HAVE to wait 18 years. Or import them from elsewhere - which causes all sorts of cultural and societal conflicts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting to combine this line of thinking with the transition from nation-states to market-states:https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1744057060106386...The power vacuum that&#39;s arisen from populism &amp; isolationism is about to create a gigantic untapped market for firms that provide the services of a state - defense, dispute resolution, and currency - for a fee, to gigantic multinational corporations.  At the same time, there are nascent technologies (drones and robotics for defense, blockchain and the Internet for dispute resolution &amp; currency) that dramatically lower the cost of many of these services, to the point where we may see private companies that are more effective than nation-states at it.  Might we see the nation-state get replaced by a web of competing mercenaries, each of which effectively serves as a protection racket for their customers?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Haven&#39;t read the book, but for those who don&#39;t know who Zeihan is, his work follows two threads of post-WWII history:1. Deglobalization; and2. DepopulationThe article focuses mostly on deglobalization, but depopulation is in the horse pulling the cart.Many are familiar with the deglobalization idea from the last US presidential administration. The current administration kept those tariffs, and abided by the previous commitment to exit Afghanistan. Zeihan argues that this trend toward increasing isolationism goes back decades.What may seem less familiar is the demographic implosion the entire world is undergoing - a baby bust. The vast majority of major countries with the exception of the US and Mexico have passed a point of no return demographically. Their populations will shrink with mathematical certainty. As their populations ebb, so will their economic growth prospects and place on the world stage. The problem is especially pronounced in Asia and Europe, but can be found everywhere.The reason for the bust: people moved to cities. On a farm, kids are free labor. In a city, kids are expensive conversational pieces."</p>
