								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s worth mentioning that many smartphone users upload content to Youtube seemingly mistakenly and unaware that they are doing so (also known as fat-fingering[0]). A quick search for:    DSC001.mp4

And then filtering that by recently uploaded always yields interesting results. For those that don&#39;t know, `DSC-XXX` is a standard naming scheme for digital cameras. More on the default naming scheme in the following link[1][0] https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fat-fingerin...[1] https://datagenetics.com/blog/december22012/index.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This hack is great because the dev didn&#39;t have to read assembly code or parse WireShark logs or deploy any kind of cracking software. They simply observed the ecosystem carefully and deduced a failure mode through some serious mental BFS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Classic &#34;confused deputy&#34; problem. What is the current recommendation in the modern microservices world to solve it?When user agent (UA) makes authenticated call to service A, which in turn makes call to service B:UA -[user auth]-&gt; A -[????]-&gt; Bhow to pass authentication information from A,  when making a call to B? Options I can think of:- pass UA token as is. This has a problem that token becomes too powerful and can be made to call any service.- pass own token and pass user auth info as an additional field. This doesn&#39;t solve confused deputy problem, since own token can be used with any user auth and service B can be tricked to make request for data in B not belonging to user- Mint new unique token derived from tuple (A own token, UA token, B service name). B then extracts user information from the token presented by A and authorizes request. This seems to solve confused deputy problem, because A has no access to other UA tokens, so it can&#39;t mint a new token for a wrong user. Downside is that token minting should probably be done in another service and it requires making a call to it for almost every request between two microservices, making it a bottleneck pretty quickly.I&#39;ve never seen last one in real life, maybe it has some critical flaws  I am failing to see?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I kind of wonder if we&#39;re looking at solving this the wrong way. Instead of mandating that manufacturers take specific steps to fix the waste problem, maybe it would be better to tag items at manufacture and charge device makers a percentage based on how long before it enters the waste stream.Manufacturers could solve this by either:- Making their things easy to repair- Creating in house recycling programs- Making equipment more durable and longer lastingAny combination of the above. By picking one specific way of reducing waste, we are ignoring other factors. Few people care to repair Android phones because you can&#39;t upgrade the OS after 2 years regardless. It doesn&#39;t matter if the hardware is repairable, the device is greatly devalued at that point. Like wise, if it&#39;s super expensive to repair an iPhone, people aren&#39;t going to bother and will just replace it.By focusing on the end result -&gt; Devices entering the waste stream &lt;- the manufacturers are responsible for ensuring hardware gets responsibly recycled, repaired, or just doesn&#39;t break. Obviously, to make this work the cost per device entering the stream would have to be significant compared to the cost of the device.Also, the cost should be the responsibility of the maker. Currently in some place in the US, consumers pay the cost to dispose of/ recycle televisions. The result is we end up with TVs on the side of the road. Often on the way away from the dump where people refuse to pay the disposal fee then toss the TV out the door on the way home."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t describe how much I hope something comes out of it. Not because I have some illusion of this tackling corporate greed, or helping the environment - devices will likely become more expensive and bulkier as a result, supply chain of replacement parts is generating heaps of waste too.I simply am surrounded by tens and hundreds of sort-of-broken devices that don&#39;t force me to replace yet, but are not fixable either. The laptop overheats, phone compass never works properly, one port in the TV is dead, there is no light in the fridge (but it still works). The list goes on. I just want a world where stuff lasting a lifetime exists."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just yesterday my SO told me the subwoofer was broken. It&#39;s a wireless unit, which pairs with the soundbar, which I got with my TV about 5 years ago.I quickly come to the conclusion the power supply is broken. And of course the power supply is internal.I tried to open up the thing, being fairly competent with electronics. But try as I might, I just couldn&#39;t figure out how this thing comes apart. I don&#39;t want to brute force it, thing is stylish and my SO likes that about it, but also a lot of plastic so easy to break.Ok, I searched the web for a service manual. Nothing. Not even close.In contrast, the DVD player my mom uses (mostly as a glorified CD player) died before xmas. It&#39;s an old Sony unit, bought in 2000 or 2001, and been on ever since (standby or active). I searched and I found a beautiful service manual, with detailed schematics and instructions for disassembly and reassembly. Even the PCB itself has lovely markings making it very clear what is going on where.Quickly discovered the issue in the power supply and ordered some replacement parts (still waiting).Sure I could probably have found a second-hand DVD player for cheap. But yeah it just seemed so senseless to toss away a perfectly good unit when by all accounts it just needs $3 worth of parts."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I see a number of people here describing Parler as &#34;unmoderated&#34;, but it turns out they do have extensive moderation [1] that they use to ensure ideological conformity in their posts. Then the most active users were paid for their content too [2]. This really makes it more of a propaganda weapon than a free speech platform.[1] https://twitter.com/donk_enby/status/1347939939120533506
[2] https://twitter.com/donk_enby/status/1346565749977051136"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This story truly terrifies me: my team owns my company&#39;s sign up page. (I speak for myself and not them, of course).Sounds like Parler, fearing that their OTP provider might go down, decided to fail-open, ie: if the dependency throws an exception, presume there&#39;s something wrong with the dependency and that the code provided is acceptable. It never occurred to them that the dependency could be down permanently, or that malicious actors[0] would be able to realize it and exploit to quickly.Lesson learned: do not fail open where security matters, where authentication matters. Failing closed prevents new users/customers from signing up, but it protects your existing users/customers.[0]From a security standpoint, these are malicious actors. I would also probably buy said malicious actors a beer if I met them, accompanied by a high five.Edit: this is a hypothesis of course. Maybe the bug was somewhere else in the system- it could be in Twilio&#39;s provided integration library where the fail-open occurred."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;In a press release announcing the decision, Twilio revealed which services Parler was using. This information allowed hackers to deduct that it was possible to create users and verified accounts without actual verification.&gt;With this type of access, newly minted users were able to get behind the login box API used for content delivery. That allowed them to see which users had moderator rights and this in turn allowed them to reset passwords of existing users with simple “forgot password” function. Since Twilio no longer authenticated emails, hackers were able to access admin accounts with ease.So these &#39;security researchers&#39; are random hackers that illegally gained access to accounts and servers are actively doxxing people and this behaviour&#39;s now being praised?Apart from being illegal, I seem to recall severe backlash against several instances of doxxing in the past, which is exactly what these people have done.I wonder if people would still be cheering this on if 70TB worth of twitter information had been leaked instead."</p>

He said what he has a big wishlist on Amazon, so I&#39;ve chosen a couple of books and bought them to him.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m struggling to try to understand what this means for the risks of running a business in the cloud going forward. It was not just AWS dropping them, but many of their other vendors dropped them too, essentially killing their business overnight.Granted, for this first case the bar was extremely high. You needed literal storming of the Capitol and a platform seemingly specifically targeted at those people for this to happen. However, now that the precedent is set, I would expect the bar to be lowered going forward. That creates risks that need to somehow be mitigated (and reflected in valuations).Even for businesses that are not in such politically charged areas, I can easily imagine getting inadvertently tangled up in some popular issue and having vendors become targets of online activist (whether it&#39;s your own vendors, or whether you are a vendor to a target).What are the best mitigations here, both technical and social? Vocally side with the popular issues, or try to stay completely out of them, to try to avoid becoming a target (e.g., social media presence)? Try to reduce dependence on cloud providers and vendors by building more in-house? How far would you have to go, since a colo or an ISP can drop you just as AWS can?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"All I’m going to say is that I’m all for free speech and setting fair rules for everyone to play by (ie regulation), but looking at the examples provided in the buzzfeed articles this is beyond simple free speech. I hear a lot of people saying this is just another example of the left trying to shut down free speech but there are clear threats being made on the platform. If Parler doesn’t want to do any content regulation then fine (though this should be any easy place to draw the line), but I can’t blame Amazon for saying “we don’t want that here”."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a former Ubiquiti employee, I&#39;m sad to watch the slow decline of the company. There was a steady exodus of engineering talent through 2020. The CEO was focused on moving to countries where engineering was cheaper and employees complained less about constant crunch mode. If you search around, you can find interviews where he brags about closing the San Jose office because he thought everyone there was too entitled.The saddest part is that we had many good engineers who could have continued to do amazing things with the UniFi momentum. So much time was wasted on dead end products like FrontRow. Most everyone I know left for jobs where we were treated better and paid more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"PSA: with Mailchimp URLs, it&#39;s best to remove the `?e=xxx` URL parameter. That way, A) you can&#39;t be identified by the sender as the person who shared the email, and B) other people can&#39;t flood your inbox by clicking the &#34;unsubscribe&#34; link at the bottom of the email.In this case, the cleaned URL that should have been posted is https://mailchi.mp/ubnt/account-notification"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regarding authenticity, from the TechCrunch article about this:&gt; The networking company quickly followed its email with a post on its community pages confirming that the email was authentic, after several complained that the email sent to customers included typos.Indeed: How am I supposed to know whether this email is really from Ubiquiti?* There was apparently no official press release.* All links in the email, including the &#34;Change password&#34; button, are to e.g. `https://ui.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=somehexnumber&amp;i...`.* The delivering server is `mail42.atl11.rsgsv.net`, which the TLD of which doesn&#39;t seem to resolve in my browser to provide hints.* Various news sites that reported this either just referred to &#34;emails people got&#34;, screenshots random people got via Twitter, or link to the Mailchimp site, for which I&#39;m not sure how to verify whether the &#34;ubnt&#34; account actually belongs to Ubiquiti.Given this, how shall the normal affected user figure out that this isn&#39;t well-executed phishing?It seems companies could do a much better job making it obvious that their emails are legit. Especially if they were just breached, and &#34;Change password&#34; buttons are involved."</p>

The blame for Myanmar violence should be placed squarely on the people that are spreading misinformation that incites violence.  Even if Facebook does a better job policing content, don&#39;t you think these perpetrators will find an equally effective technology to spread their propaganda?  If not now, then in the future surely they will?Don&#39;t get me wrong, I do think Facebook should police clear misinformation that can lead to human suffering, but it seems like the media want to convince me to hate Facebook.  I hate the people behind this misinformation.  And, I would love Facebook to get involved, but I don&#39;t hate them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I mentioned this on Twitter[1], the reason to encrypt before sending over SSL is not about double encryption, it’s about how a large backend system is designed.Often, you have load balancers that are SSL endpoints, so the data is decrypted at that point.You can start to see the problem already. What if there is a different bug, and so a dev starts logging requests somewhere down the line? You accidentally start logging cleartext passwords. Oops. Facebook was fined for this not that long ago.But if the password is encrypted, then it’s not really an issue, and the black box blob can be forwarded to a login microservice. There, the team decrypting will be on higher alert.So depending on the structure of various teams, you now have fewer teams that need that kind of security oversight and can move faster.Smaller blast radius of something goes wrong.[1] https://twitter.com/sroussey/status/1347688753221931010?s=21"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve heard about the security of a mobile banking app about eight or so years ago, when mobile banking was still very much a new thing and trust was a big issue. They too opted to write a second encryption layer on top of TLS / SSL, fearing MITM attacks. That was also when iOS didn&#39;t support SSL pinning yet.It seemed to work for them, security researchers went to town on it and while they quickly discovered there was a second encryption layer below SSL, they were unable to determine what it was and how to crack it.IIRC their encryption was never broken, and thanks to that track record, they slowly increased daily spend limits over the mobile app.Long term, because they were very forward-thinking and they had competent native app developers (as opposed to the competition who struggled for years with mobile web / crossplatform tech), they increased their market share by a lot, now being the largest bank in NL; can&#39;t find historical data, but they went from 37% in 2016 to 40% in 2018."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I keep being somewhat baffled by Steam&#39;s login process every time I&#39;m forced to go through it. Apparently Steam is such a cesspool of (pre)pubescent teenagers, with rampant account hacking and theft of funds, swag or whatever, that they feel the need to fortify the process if only to make it more inconvenient for the hackers.- “Remember the password” barely ever works, even on desktop. Since I don&#39;t quite log in every day due to being too old for that, I have to redo the process every time—on a machine that I bought with my own money just for myself and intend to protect with both technical means and physical force.- Somehow copy-pasting passwords from KeepassX/XC doesn&#39;t work on Mac, with the shortcut. Not sure if this is a misfeature of Steam, but I have to paste the password to an editor first and then copy out of there into Steam. (Seems though that ‘paste’ in the context menu does work—this might&#39;ve changed since I first noticed the issue.)- And of course, the weird variation on 2fa, via email, instead of the good regular TOTP. As is tradition by now, I&#39;m also given the choice of installing yet another app on the phone, which somehow doesn&#39;t quite seem to serve my interest."</p>
