								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very neat. They write:&gt; In this course, we’ll be looking for the following trifecta: (i) ideas that are non-obvious, even to the well-trained computer scientist, so that we’re not wasting your time; (ii) conceptually simple — realistically, these are the only ideas that you might remember a year or more from now, when you’re a start-up founder, senior software engineer, PhD student, etc. (iii) fundamental, meaning that there is some chance that the idea will prove useful to you in the future.In the first lesson, they discuss consistent hashing, and they seem to have achieved their goals.ETA: Must include this anecdote on the history of the algorithm:1. 1997: The implementation of consistent hashing given in this lecture first appeared in a research paper in STOC (“Symposium on the Theory of Computing”) [...] Ironically, the paper had previously been rejected from a theoretical computer science conference because at least one reviewer felt that “it had no hope of being practical.”2. 1998: Akamai is founded.3. March 31, 1999: A trailer for “Star Wars: The Phantom Menace” is released online, with Apple the exclusive official distributor. apple.com goes down almost immediately due to the overwhelming number of download requests. For a good part of the day, the only place to watch (an unauthorized copy?) of the trailer is via Akamai’s Web caches. This put Akamai on the map.4. April 1, 1999: Steve Jobs, having noticed Akamai’s performance the day before, calls Akamai’s President Paul Sagan to talk. Sagan hangs up on Jobs, thinking it’s an April Fool’s prank by one of the co-founders, Danny Lewin or Tom Leighton."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"VMLS by Stephen Boyd (also of Stanford) would be great background reading for the vector/matrix stuff (i.e. most of this course): https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18678314I love this book. As opposed to the way that linear algebra is typically introduced, this book focuses on concrete applications (like text analysis, image/signal processing, finance, ML, etc.) and eschews more arcane concepts (like eigen). To me, building practical intuition is the best way to learn* the subject.A more advanced but still accessible manuscript by Boyd et al: Generalized Low Rank Models (establishes connections between PCA/SVD and many other matrix factorization methods, and shows you how to roll your own): https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/glrm.pdf"</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32787657">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a really elegant point.&gt; Doing upfront authorization of powers is relatively efficient, and is also pleasingly self regulating. If an agency overloads or confuses its ex ante regulator, they simply won’t get permission to do things. This provides a strong incentive for clear and concise requests to the regulator.It is very easy for regulators, even well-meaning, to focus on what they require of an individual transaction.  But we live in a world where automation and dynamic workforces make it possible to break every expectation about how a system will be used."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That last line made me laugh, but it&#39;s funny because it&#39;s true. It&#39;s down to the &#34;sit where you&#39;re sitting&#34; effect.Noam Chomsky famously told Andrew Marr during an interview that he was sure Marr was sincere and believed everything he was saying, but if he&#39;d believed anything else, he wouldn&#39;t sit where he was sitting.It follows from that true observation that the only time such appointed watchdogs (whether oversight board members or news personalities) are actually doing something, is when they quit, or at least threaten to quit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find it interesting that the Dutch push to change the intelligence law coincides with a similar one currently taking place in my home country of Romania.I wonder if these are actually part of a more coordinated attempt to tacitly make the (broadly speaking) West more authoritarian and tightly controlled."</p>

					<h3><a href="https://twitter.com/zhuowei/status/1568659229887664129">YouTube-dl has an interpreter for a subset of JavaScript in 870 lines of Python</a></h3>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32793061">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To be clear, this is an extremely tiny subset of JS. It looks like they only implemented the features needed to run a very specific function. For example, the only symbol allowed after &#34;new&#34; is &#34;Date&#34;, everything else throws an exception.It&#39;s still fun that it&#39;s there, but it&#39;s not as big a deal as it sounds from the tweet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anyone who has ever pulled a website from a script knows the pain that is Javascript. Normally you want to just get some text and work out the API actions but a lot of sites use horribly obfuscated Javascript -- either because that&#39;s what modern web development is (lolz) -- or because its part of their &#39;security.&#39; That means if you want to write browser-based bots properly -- you ought to use a browser. There are special browsers that run &#39;headlessly&#39; or are designed mostly for bot use. Like https://www.selenium.dev/ which plugs into a few different &#39;browser engines.&#39;But now you have another problem. Your simple script goes from being small, simple, self-contained, and elegant gem, to requiring a full browser, specialized drivers, and/or daemons running just to work. If you&#39;re using something like Python you just frankly don&#39;t have very good packaging. So it&#39;s hard to string together all that into a solution and have it magically work for everyone. What YouTube-dl have done is good engineering. Even though it&#39;s not a full JS interpreter: they&#39;ve kept their software lean, self-contained, and easier to use."</p>

I never had any desire to block reddit ads until the last ~6-12 months or so when it would autoplay ads when I scroll.  I have &#34;no thumbnails&#34; so it doesn&#39;t show me the ad other than a line of text or so.  I have &#34;old&#34; reddit enabled on my account -- this works for desktop.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"How to measure anything. I think it&#39;s targeted for actuaries/insurance, though I&#39;m not in that field. But it did change my idea of what can be analyzed and measured. The beginning is repetitive. Some of it is very unorthodox. But it was very useful in detailing how to evaluate risk.How to talk to little kids so little kids will listen. I don&#39;t have kids and read it on a whim. I&#39;ve found it&#39;s excellent for communicating with people in general during conflict (especially patients). The author is a counsellor and describes real counselling sessions with parents who want better relationships with their children. I enjoyed how the author uses the same techniques on the adults and obtains the same manner of response as when used on the kids.Understanding Complexity is not a book but a part of the Great Courses. It&#39;s hard to say what it directly changed but it did affect how I view everyday life, from traffic to physiology.Hui&#39;s Approach to Internal Medicine was very helpful for transitioning from knowing about medical facts to practical medical knowledge useful to everyday care. It&#39;s focus is on &#39;approach&#39; rather than facts. It has a practical approach to medical issues. First distinguishing by ones in the same category of pathophysiology then practical approach to distinguishing issues within the category. It&#39;s a dense book but an excellent read and a good reference."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The key reason web frameworks dominate these days is that it&#39;s very hard to keep the UI in sync with state.That&#39;s it - that&#39;s the problem they solve. People started writing vanilla HTML/CSS/JS and struggling to make &#34;reactivity&#34; (hence React) work well when web applications got complex with a lot of state to manage. So we started building frameworks on frameworks and abstractions on abstractions and ended up where we are today.It&#39;s gone a bit far but the overall purpose is a valid one.(From someone who has used React professionally but uses vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for his personal website)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly, I&#39;m turned off by these frameworks. Javascript is an easy language, and these frameworks raise the bar to entry. Many will say they make things &#39;easier&#39; but that&#39;s not my personal experience. Some context: I wrote a lot of JS in the early/late 2000s (Anyone remember WebFX by Erik Arvidsson?). His follow-up gig became WebOS[0]Back then it was called DHTML or Dynamic HTML and then evolved into the HTML5 standard later on. The syntax of React &amp; Vue is just too weird for me. Frankly I&#39;ve reached a framework fatigue after learning jQuery inside out which was a hard-won battle, and then having to learn React/Vue/Svelte just to stay &#39;in the game&#39; is too much for me. Excuse me if I&#39;m biased here.[0] https://newmedia.fandom.com/wiki/Web_Operating_System"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The web was originally created to share documents, so interactivity and extra functionality was an afterthought. As the web became more popular, websites started to add more functionality similar to traditional software programs.Eventually, the original guideline of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity started to not really make sense anymore for many websites, because as pages became more interactive, the lines became blurred. If you look at a site like GMail, where does the page structure end and interactivity begin?With large parts of a page being interactive, it becomes difficult to manage all the state involved, especially if it’s a “live” page that updates in real time and may have several people viewing it.Frameworks were introduced as a way to manage state and allow websites to re-render efficiently without hard page refreshes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember when I was a young assembly programmer and I looked down on those obtuse C programmers who needed such a slow high-level language. After high-school, having read all those fantastic W. Richard Stevens books I simply could not understand why anybody on earth wanted to use C++ when C was easily capable of modeling complex object structures. When they forced us to use Java, I was deeply in shock: was this really a programming language or more a toy for little kids and why would they want to slow down computers to a crawl?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The &#34;letters to the editor&#34; are really fun to read -- it&#39;s like reading the HN comments of the time, with the same combination of insight and cynicism.&gt; In response to Gregg Williams&#39; editorial (&#34;The New Generation of Human- Engineered Software,&#34; April, p. 6), the mouse of Lisa, Visi On, and their predecessor, the Xerox Star, is a truly fascinating hardware device, and on those few occasions that I have seen these devices in use, I have been impressed. But the mouse is not revolutionary, and, as its name suggests, it is really nothing more than a rodent. Its functional predecessor was the light pen. Some years ago, light pens were fashionable devices for selecting a particular function, and they are still in use. But displays attaching light pens had to have an appropriate phosphor, and they were not as easy to program as function keys. About the same time, touch- sensitive screens were introduced, and they are still used in applications such as online catalogs in libraries; here, too, however, programming appears to be the chief stumbling block.&gt; If the name of the game is &#34;ease of use,&#34; the industry would be far wiser to develop touch-sensitive displays than mice. Because a display has no moving parts, it is likely to prove more durable than a mouse. And a finger placed on a display screen does not require additional desk space, as a mouse does. If an executive were having an office conference, don&#39;t you think he might rather touch his screen a couple of times than roll a mouse around his desk pressing buttons on it?&gt; There are, obviously, many considerations at work in the development of new products. My bet, simply stated, is that the mouse is not a viable product. At best, it will limp along like bubble memory. - John P. Rash, President, Acorn Data Ltd.There&#39;s also:- Several refutations to a previous letter which claimed CRT monitors are a radiation hazard- An engineer from Intel responding to criticisms of their FORTRAN compiler with &#34;those issues have been fixed in the latest version&#34;- Debate over structured programming and strong typing- Debate on what &#34;computer literacy&#34; means and whether the general population needs it (including a claim that WYSYWIG editors and desktop file managers do not make computers easier to use because &#34;a desktop manager is only a sophisticated analog for being able to copy one file into another&#34;)- Conversations on software prices and piracy- And, of course, someone pointing out a typo in an article."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember learning C on my dad&#39;s computer running CP/M. My dad spent $4,000 on his computer ($16,800 today; ThinkerToys/CompuPro S-100 bus system) and it was his pride and joy. We spent hours working on it together. Unlike most computers at the time, it had two 8&#34; disk drives, which was awesome, because the C compiler and all the libraries took up most of an 800k disk which meant you needed another disk for your editor and storing your source. At the time, most of the coding that we did together was in assembly, and C seemed awfully bloated and slow. I never really got into it. It&#39;s funny thinking about it now because many people seem to look at C as a low level language, but at the time it sure didn&#39;t feel that way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The profit motive is being blamed here for optimizing for engagement.But how do you assess progress when you remove all desire to monetize?I run r/WallStreetBets and &#34;quality&#34; is an extremely nebulous term.I look for things like &#34;novelty&#34;, &#34;thought-provoking / well reasoned commentary&#34;, &#34;original content&#34;, &#34;authenticity&#34;, &#34;self-awareness&#34; or &#34;primary research&#34;. But these are human assessed metrics.Some more easily measurable metrics might include, &#34;length of submissions&#34;, or &#34;number of outbound links excluding blacklisted domains&#34;. Or even &#34;number of tickers or quality-correlated keywords mentioned&#34;.All these metrics have very clear downsides, and if generally well-known, become useless. Interestingly, a score too high can also result in something being unlikely to be authentic.Another challenge is your relationship with users. Surprisingly, moderators are not innately adversarial to users, they can also promote content through other channels (discord, twitter) or sticky threads for a viewership boost.So, even without a profit motive, what do you do?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good article, though I think it missed explicitly making the point that the reason &#34;engagement&#34; is the metric is because that&#39;s what platforms monetize. Engagement is a euphemism for attention, and social platforms exist to sell your to advertisers.Since the article is written for &#34;community builders,&#34; understanding that engagement is a metric to quantify the advertising potential of a platform should make it obvious that people who aren&#39;t in the business of selling attention to advertisers don&#39;t need to copy social media and optimize for engagement; instead they should target better measurements of value creation for their community. Of course Goodhart&#39;s law[1] still applies.1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law(edited for readability)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I enjoyed the Monsters Inc reference and the turning of it on its head central to this piece.  But we&#39;ve said/argued this for years and at the end of the day engagement = ad reach = profits and until the economics there change any for-profit social media will gravitate towards engagement.  Hell ANY media gravitates toward engagement and outrage bait.  An actual community built around Mastodon seems possible, and there&#39;s community discussions around private group chats but they will always remain niche and not profitable.I don&#39;t get what https://savannahhq.com is and what the value add is there but that seems to be what he&#39;s interested in, niche + small communities."</p>
