								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yet, in order to watch Netflix on FreeBSD, you have to jump through such hoops as &#34;downloading either google chrome, vivaldi, or brave, and [using] a small shell script which basically creates a small jail for some ubuntu binaries that actually install widevine which is essential for viewing some DRM content such as Netflix&#34; [1][1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBYor4wL62Q"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just some napkin maths. ( Correct me if I am wrong )Looking at the 800Gbps Config, Dell R7525 with Dual 64C / 128T and 4x Connect-DX 800Gbps in 2U.With Zen 4C, 128C and PCI-E 5.0, Connect-7, two node could fit into 2U. i.e doubling to 1.6Tbps per 2U.That is going from 16Tbps to 32Tbps per Rack. ( Using 40U only )To things in perspective, if every user were to use 20Mbps Stream at the same time, ( not going to happen due to time zone difference ), the 250M Netflix subscribers worldwide would need 5000M Mbps or 5000 Tbps. That is less than 200 Racks to serve every single of their customer on planet earth. ( Ignoring Storage. ) You could ship a Rack to every Region, State, Nation, Jurisdiction or Local ISP and Exchange and be done with it.I hope Lisa Su sent drewg123 and his team at Netflix with Zen 4C ASAP to play, cough, I mean help them test it.Note: We have PCI-E 6.0 ( and 7.0 ), DDR6 on Roadmap. The 200 Racks could be down to 50 Racks by the end of this decade. Assuming Netflix is still streaming at the same bitrate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Beautifully written article -- I couldn&#39;t agree more. From my personal point of view the biggest impact are:1) e-commerce textures such as cloths are more faitfully represented -- more trust in e-commerce, more revenue2) more equity for selfies, people-of-color skin is better represented in JPEG XL, selfies in general look more people like with less smoothing of skin performed at compression stage -- I&#39;m a great friend of the idea that filtering should not be built into the compression so that all kinds of images can be transmitted3) more compression, faster and cheaper to load4) better progression -- unlike I believe AVIF does, JPEG XL progression does not impose more decoding cost for sequential, progression does not make compression density worse5) thermal camera support -- I believe thermal cameras have huge ecological and cost optimization opportunities and more phones should have thermal cameras in them to facilitate the shift away from fossil fuels6) small images -- thumbnails and sprites etc. do not necessarily need spriting with JPEG XL. That is a nice increase in system level simplicity. JPEG XL overhead is about 10-20 bytes whereas AVIF overhead seems to be 600 bytes or so.7) &#39;it just works, no surprises&#39; -- the worst case image quality degradation in any quality setting are much less severe and much less common than in other formats"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; A unique feature of JPEG XL is that it is possible to recompress existing JPEG images (of which there are a lot out there!) to a JPEG XL file that is on average about 20% smaller, without introducing any loss. In fact, the bit-exact same JPEG file can be reconstructed from the JPEG XL file.I wasn&#39;t aware of this and this is actually crazy, and freaking brilliant from a migration point of view. I wonder how that was achieved. I didn&#39;t care so much about JPEG XL, now thanks to Google derping I want it everywhere."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had regarded the lossless re-compression as an interesting parlor trick, but I get it now.Coincidentally today I was testing how much we can shrink our archived videos. We have lots of videos recorded with the Intel hardware encoder in H264, so not even the state of the art of H264. I figured: pop it into handbrake, change the codec to H265 (X.265), and boom 30%+ reduction. No, the H265 file got 3X larger. Well the default handbrake quality might be higher than the original video, and now it&#39;s going to some spend bits trying to encode the artifacts in the source video, while adding artifacts of its own. Sure you can find a happy medium where the quality won&#39;t be too much worse and you reduce the file size in most cases. But it sure would be nice to be able to losslessly recompress those videos!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As I&#39;ve said for a long time, I don&#39;t mind moderation, I just want to be in charge of what I see. Give me the tools that the moderators have, let me be able to filter out bots at some confidence level; let me see &#34;removed&#34; posts, banned accounts; don&#39;t mess with my searches unless I&#39;ve asked for that explicitly.Power to the people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been a reader and participant of the Bogleheads forum (on investing and personal finance) for well over a decade, and I think it&#39;s a shining example of good moderation in practice. My observation is that the key is preventing discussion from getting heated; really moderating the temperature (or noise intensity, excitement, etc.) of the place. Threads on topics that are known to get heated (including topics that can be relevant to investing and personal finance, such as politics and macroeconomics and cryptocurrencies in recent times) immediately get locked. Threads on topics that start out OK but end up getting heated also get locked, or the heated content gets surgically removed if main discussion can be salvaged. So the focus is entirely on high-quality information and thoughtful, low-emotion points and counter-points to think about. The merits of the discussions continue to attract and retain new fantastic participants who make them even better. Edited to add: The practice of moderation here at HN is similar, and has similar effects, which is why I&#39;m here.If they started removing low-emotion information and discussions that just didn&#39;t fit the Bogleheads philosophy, I think that would cross the line into censorship.Anyway, it&#39;s clear that the Bogleheads forum model is the polar opposite of where Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit have gone to suck in the masses and increase their engagement by highlighting the most heated stuff and throwing gasoline onto the fire with likes, votes, and retweets. I think the mainstream social media companies have put themselves into a bind with this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; And it would make the avoid-harassment side happier, since they could set their filters to stronger than the default setting, and see even less harassment than they do now.I highly doubt it.I’m pretty sure typical harassment comes in the form of many similar messages by many different users joining a bandwagon.  Moderation wouldn’t really be fast enough to stop that; indeed, Twitter’s current moderation scheme isn’t fast enough to stop it.  But the current scheme is capable of penalizing people after the fact, particularly the organizer(s) of the bandwagon, and that creates some level of deterrence.  An opt-out moderation scheme would be less effective as a deterrent, since the type of political influencers that tend to be involved in these things could likely easily convince their followers to opt out.That may be a cost worth paying for the sake of free speech.  But don’t expect it to make the anti-harassment side happy.That said, it’s not like that side can only tolerate (what this post terms as) censorship.  On the contrary, they seem to like Mastodon and its federated model.  I do suspect that approach would not work as well at higher scale - not in a technical sense, but in terms of the ability to set and enforce norms across servers.  But that’s total speculation, and I haven’t even used Mastodon myself…"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I put around 15 minutes a day into Birdwatch for a couple of months before the purchase was finalized. This is purely anecdotal, so take it with a grain of salt.The requirement for agreement seemed to work well at preventing weird factchecks from anywhere on the political spectrum. I saw a fair number of people trying to use Birdwatch to argue with each other, bad faith factchecks, and so on. None of them made it to general visibility.I wrote 45 notes. I tried very hard to keep them unbiased, but I&#39;m human and I have strong political opinions. 5 of them wound up approved. I suspect the requirement for agreement tended to keep anything that&#39;s more than a little divisive from getting approved; no evidence for this, though. I&#39;d be curious to know what the average percentage was for active users.There are way more Birdwatch notes getting written right now. A lot of them are terrible quality. However, they mostly aren&#39;t getting approved, so I think the system is working as designed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"After this change, the TypeScript compiler will now be compiled with esbuild. I feel like thats probably the best endorsement esbuild could get, hah.Surprising they call out the 2 space indent level that esbuild is hardcoded[1] to use as a benefit. Why not save even more bytes and re-format the output to single tab indentation? I wrote a simple script to replace the indentation with tabs. 2 indent size: 29.2MB, tabbed size: 27.3MB. 2MB more of indentation saved! Not significant after compression, but parsing time over billions of starts? Definitely worth it.[1] https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1126"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Finally, as a result of both of the previous performance improvements (faster code and less of it), tsc.js is 30% faster to start and typescript.js (our public API) is 10% faster to import. As we improve performance and code size, these numbers are likely to improve. We now include these metrics in our benchmarks to track over time and in relevant PRs.&gt; [...]&gt; The TypeScript package now targets ES2018. Prior to 5.0, our package targeted ES5 syntax and the ES2015 library, however, esbuild has a hard minimum syntax target of ES2015 (aka ES6). ES2018 was chosen as a balance between compatibility with older environments and access to more modern syntax and library featuresI&#39;d be curious as to what percentage of the improvement comes from modules vs comes from a different target."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A little while ago I asked (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33051021):I’m curious, how many people are using TSC only for type-checking, and a different system (eg esbuild or ts-node) to actually compile/bundle/execute their code?Looks like my suspicion was correct; not even tsc uses tsc!"</p>
