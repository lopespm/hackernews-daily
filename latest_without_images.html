								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve often thought the same thing about becoming an adult, especially a parent, in general. There are so many choices that I harshly judged older people for making (how to allocate their time and money, where to live, what to allow or not allow the kids to do, how to behave at work, etc.) that I now find myself making as a married guy in my mid-30s with four kids. It makes me sad, but on each point I&#39;m like, &#34;Oh, now I get it.&#34; I fear that this pattern could continue until I become my father in my 50s and 60s. I try not to judge people so much anymore.Anyway, I appreciate the article as someone who will soon try my hand at teaching. I will have a lot to learn."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This perfectly describes my experience as a TA in graduate school. At first I didn&#39;t understand why my advisor insisted on being so precise in assignment instructions. Then when TAing with him I saw how students could creatively misinterpret instructions, even when I could not imagine how to make them more precise. An exception for the new case would be added to the next iteration of the assignments. I only understood why we went to such lengths to prevent cheating because in my first year I watched my advisor spend two weeks of his time sitting down individually with each student and present evidence that they had cheated. Only about 10% of the students had cheated, but in a class of 1400, that&#39;s 140 students! I can&#39;t even imagine how much work that must of been on the head TA."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; every word of the assignment creatively misinterpretedOTOH when I took operating systems I got an assignment that said “implement a job scheduler, using FIFO, LIFO or round-robin job scheduling”. So I picked FIFO, got it working and I had time left over so I thought, “what the hell?  I’ll do LIFO too”. So I did, and I still had time so I took a crack at round-robin, but I didn’t have time so I turned it what I had, proud of myself for going above and beyond.I got back a 66 on the assignment. I asked why and he said, “you didn’t even attempt round robin”. I pulled up the assignment where it VERY CLEARLY said “or” and he said, “well, it should have been obvious I meant ‘and’”."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What I find incredible is: Once this fully ramps up, this one power plant is expected to satisfy 14% of the entire country&#39;s electricity needs.  7 of these could power an entire country, 24/7."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s surprising is the length of time of this project. It was started in 2000, and just completed. That&#39;s 23 years of development. These nuclear projects appear to take a significant amount of time.By comparison, this wind turbine project near my parents was approved in 2016 and completed in 2018, providing 78 megawatts of power. Yes that&#39;s significantly less than the 1.6 gigawatts of this Finnish power plant. But, consider that in the same time period, 10 of this wind projects could be completed.On top of that, solar projects are also much faster. Look at the Solar Star solar installation which provides .5 gigawatts of power, started in 2013 and completed in 2015. So 10 of these could have been completed in the same time as the Finnish system. No, I&#39;m not suggesting that Solar is a good option in Finland. And yes, it would be important to work on massive battery storage systems, to make these work.This just points out just how uneconomical nuclear power is. On top of that, with nuclear facilities coming under fire in Ukraine and Russia making (probably bluffing) threats against Finland, it really makes nuclear an unappealing option. Can someone point out why these projects are so attractive to so many people when it would appear that a combination of renewables appear to both be faster to bring on line and overall safer?Edit: forgot the links,Arkwright Summit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkwright_Summit_Wind_FarmSolar Star https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Star"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good job Finland. I respect the opinions of the environmentalists and agree with most of what they say, but until we have something more reliable that can put out power 24/7 year round, we need more new, modern nuclear plants."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The headline isn&#39;t technically wrong but it&#39;s a tiny bit misleading because the use of web views is limited to a small number of iCloud account screens. These aren&#39;t really &#34;system&#34; preferences so much as Apple cloud service settings which have been wedged into System Preferences.(And where it is used, it&#39;s doing the barest minimum. The preference window itself, the top bar, and the iCloud sidebar are all still native UI.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wasn&#39;t surprised to see the Family Sharing pane in the first screenshot. It&#39;s easily the most janky part of System Preferences that I&#39;ve had to struggle with:- Loading indicators for several seconds when switching between categories in the left sidebar, on a very decent internet connection.- Janky animations and transitions when opening modals, like clicking the &#34;Details...&#34; button on a family member.- Within the &#34;Invite people to your family&#34; modal, clicking &#34;Not Now&#34; causes the &#34;Invite People&#34; button (the default, highlighted action) to blink before the modal closes.Yes while these are absolutely nitpicks, I feel that Apple has lost some of the attention to detail that set them apart."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The error messages could be better yet.The example uses a different code per issue, for instance: &#34;user/email_required&#34;. Most integrators will build their UI to highlight the input fields that contain an error. Making them parse the `code` field (or special-case each possible code) is pretty toilsome.    // from blog post
    {
        &#34;code&#34;: &#34;user/email_required&#34;,
        &#34;message&#34;: &#34;The parameter [email] is required.&#34;
    }

Make it parseable:    // improved
    {
        &#34;message&#34;: &#34;An email is required.&#34;,
        &#34;error&#34;: &#34;missing_parameter&#34;,
        &#34;parameter&#34;: &#34;user.email&#34;
    }

In addition, I:* rewrote `message` to be an acceptable error message displayed to (non-technical) end-users* moved message to be the first field: some developer tools will truncate the JSON response body when presenting it in the stack trace.---As an added bonus, structured data allows you to analyze  `error` frequencies and improve frontend validation or write better error messages: https://twitter.com/VicVijayakumar/status/149509216182142976..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sometimes, I feel that we ought to have a simple protocol, on top of HTTP, to simply do remote procedure calls and throw out all this HTTP verbs crap. Every request is a http POST, with or without any body and the data transfer is in binary. So that objects can be passed back and forth between client and server.Sure, there is gRPC, but it requires another API specification (the proto files).There I said it. HTTP Verbs constrained REST APIS are the worst thing ever. I hate them.They introduce un-necessary complexity, un-necessary granularity and they almost always stray away from the &#34;REST principles&#34;. To hell with &#34;Hypermedia&#34; stuff.I find it such a joy to program in server rendered pages. No cognitive overhead of thinking in &#34;REST&#34;.But, of course, all this is only where the client and server are developed by the same person / company.For publishing data and creating API for third party use, we have no serious, better alternative to REST."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some nice tips in here. However, tip 15, I strongly disagree with:&gt; 15. Allow expanding resourcesI would suggest the opposite. A REST API should not return nested resources at all. Instead, and to stay with the example provided on the website, to obtain the &#34;orders&#34;, the /users/:id/orders endpoint should be called.It might be tempting to return nested resources, because clients would only have to make a single call.Technically this is true but once the domain of your API starts to grow, you will find that the interface will become increasingly muddled.The suggestion provided (use query parameters) is basically a work-around. If you want to offer this to your clients, front your REST API with a GraphQL API instead. It is literally the problem that GraphQL solves. Keep your REST API clean and dumb and focused around CRUD."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not directly related to the title, but further in the article:&gt; newly minted MBA ex-consultant who’s just started working at Dropbox as a product manager: and here is my presentation about why it is imperative for us to expand from file synchronization and, for some reason, password management, into financial service integration through our automated financial information archival tool, and then ultimately into financial services, which will strengthen our moat against competition from other file synchronization servicesI think this is largely part of why modern web services are getting more annoying and aggressive about monetization strategy -- a massive proportion of people in product these days seem to not be the sort of nerds-solving-real-world-problems who founded Dropbox, but someone coming from big consulting companies where the main output seems to be 300-slide presentations. It does not seem like they have much of an exposure to the more human-centric style of building a good product, but rely mostly on buzzwords and spreadsheets, because that ties in closely to what they did before.I&#39;d like to hear a counterargument from any ex-consulting product managers, or people who hire them though :)That being said, the password management seems...okay to me? Services like 1Password already used Dropbox as a backend, so if you&#39;re paying Dropbox, it seems like a fair feature expansion for them to give you further reasons to keep using them since the space overhead is presumably trivial. You probably have a decent amount of sensitive data in there as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I got into the fifth batch (s07) and remember my other startup friends staging an intervention to dissuade me from accepting  because &#34;the valuation is really bad.&#34;Interesting to see how long even the industry insiders failed to take YC seriously. And then once it was working, they flipped immediately to complaining that YC was too powerful and too influential (unbeatable network effect, seed/A valuation inflation, and so on).I also remember the constant naysaying about scalability and batch size. Our batch was ~19 companies. People kept naysaying, &#34;Well this model is fine for now, but it will never work past 20 teams.&#34;PG would always reply with something like, &#34;Yeah, they said that when we had fewer than 10 teams also. We aren&#39;t thinking too far ahead; each batch, we just find the next bottleneck and solve it, and we&#39;ll see how far that gets us.&#34; Which evidently got them pretty far. A lovely example of doing things that don&#39;t scale."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love YC.Even though I&#39;d never apply and thus never get in because of my preconceived notions about YC&#39;s preconceived notions (too &#34;old&#34;?, proud Dad of a bunch of homeschooled kids, mostly solo founder (well, I&#39;ve got kids who code!), building a social/chat app way outside of the Bay area echo chamber, and not toeing any particular political lines (hey, I&#39;m a coder so I&#39;m allowed to recursively nest parens -- don&#39;t tread on me), and even if I&#39;m doxing myself a bit with this comment!), YC and PG (through his essays, Hackers and Painters, and his genuinely kind and sincere approach to everything, even with people who are on the opposite side of the political aisle, like me) have taught me so much about how to be a force for good in this strange and weird world.PG seems to truly live out Jesus&#39; wisdom and the Golden Rule. He wisely avoids getting dragged into political discussions, and the HN moderators wisely steer even very wild discussions away from flame wars. For my next act, I&#39;d like to build a social app that scales up the same sort of non-partisan (or multi-partisan!) active, intelligent discourse that occurs here, even if there are, sadly, very few dang&#39;s in the world.I would like to say a very, very warm and very sincere thank you to pg, dang, and the rest of the YC team who make it possible to still have a civil, mostly uncensored, and wide-ranging conversation, and has helped so many great startups get off the ground, both inside and outside of YC with things like the SAFE and the startup-school opened to all, proving to VC&#39;s how things can and should be done, and just pursuing the most interesting startups, period. If I truly thought I had a chance given my coloring so far outside the SF political lines, I&#39;d apply in a heartbeat!Much love from someone deep in the heart of Texas. Keep up the incredibly awesome work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"YC has been an invaluable resource for me.An acquaintance was in the 3rd batch of founders and turned me on to the ecosystem and community here. Around that time, I was a few years out of high school and working for minimum wage at a pizza shop.I was experimenting with web design, making a few extra dollars running google ads on phpBB forums, and learning to code in the process. I never realized my geeky side could translate into something entrepreneurial until I started spending time here. Tracking the progress of my friend and this community planted a seed that turned into a dream of someday being a founder.Today, my two business partners and I have been running a successful software business for almost a decade. We were distributed before it was mainstream. We&#39;re in the WordPress space and have a team of 20+ people all over the globe. I&#39;ve had the opportunity to travel, meet investors, smoke cigars with business heroes, sleep in if I want to, and enjoy an exciting and fulfilling life.I still find myself regularly googling about issues that arise in my company with &#34;hacker news&#34; appended to the end of the query. The stories here helped us navigate a very stressful M&amp;A process and countless other &#34;business stuff&#34; hurdles that we encountered over the years (ie business insurance &#34;hacker news&#34;).YC provided me with direction and inspiration when I was floundering around in my early years. The simple ideas that you don&#39;t need an MBA to start a business and being an odd duck is a valuable entrepreneurial trait were life-changing. The community and discussions here are where I come to learn and be inspired. I sincerely hope it continues to be that for myself and others for many more years to come.Thanks YC!"</p>

Moreover unless you explicitly deployed a root certificate on your clients (or if an app on the client did it), the router can&#39;t decode TLS traffic (deep inspection) without you getting certificate warnings on the client.
In that case, the only thing the router can see is the dns request, the IP and the TLS SNI.
In short your title is misleading.permalinkembedsavereportreply
[–]ArmoredCavalry[S] 11 points 14 hours ago*I agree they couldn&#39;t be inspecting the contents of your traffic over TLS, but they could easily view destinations. I also agree, there&#39;s nothing in my analysis that proves that all the requests are related to network traffic.
However, if you look at the wording of the reply (directly from TP-Link) to XDA in their review, I don&#39;t see how it could be interpreted any other way? Regardless, I probably should have made my title &#34;appears that it may send traffic related data&#34;.
I&#39;ll be happy if that isn&#39;t the case, but the lack of clear explanation from TP-Link when I&#39;ve contacted support leads me to assume the worstpermalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember reading in the UK government&#39;s security assessment of Huawei that one of the issues is not necessarily data being sent to bad places or backdoors in the software, it&#39;s that the engineering processes behind these devices/software are completely unable to protect against any sort of supply chain attacks.The sorts of things they highlighted were: no version control, no code review, production builds happening on arbitrary machines, no automated testing, poor access control on code, no audit trail on code changes, the list goes on, and that&#39;s just for the software side. The conclusion was that Huawei were about a decade away from being able to even claim they had no backdoors. And that&#39;s a major telecoms hardware provider, trying to sell into governments and major infrastructure projects.I&#39;m not in the least bit surprised that TP-Link are doing this, and also not at all surprised that when questioned on it they are (so far) unable to actually describe why it&#39;s happening or really seem to know anything about it.I think this sort of product is built in a very different environment to what most HN users would expect."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi all! Some background on the project: I want to build a house someday, and the first step is deciding where to build. I knew an interactive map like this would be useful, but after fiddling with leaflet.js for a while and googling for climate data, I felt a bit lost. So I decided to try something new: I hired a contractor on Upwork who had experience with map visualizations. They built an MVP within a few weeks, and from there I was able to tweak and optimize the code to my liking. I think this is a great strategy for side projects that you&#39;re too busy for. :)It&#39;s still mostly a toy at this point, but I&#39;d like to add more knobs and data so that I can narrow down the best place to live (and hopefully help other people do the same). If you want to contribute, the code is open source: https://github.com/lukechampine/goldilocksThe site weighs about 1.6 MB (gzipped -- the full climate data is ~35 MB uncompressed!) and is hosted on a Linode, which seems to be holding up pretty well.Also, a big thank you to those in the comments who shared links to similar projects! The &#34;pleasant places&#34; map is super close to what I want. Ideally this project would look something like that, but with the ability to select your own preferences for what constitutes a &#34;perfect&#34; day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like data like this - it reminds me of the pleasant places maps[1].That said - you have to be wary of both types of maps because it doesn&#39;t take into account other potentially annoying factors.  The biggest being humidity - there&#39;s a huge difference between 90 degree phoenix and 90 degree miami.  Then there&#39;s rainfall, and one a lot of people don&#39;t think about - wind.To add - if you&#39;re thinking about seriously comparing two climates, check out this comparison tool [2].  Has any metric you can dream of charted together.1 - https://kellegous.com/j/2014/02/03/pleasant-places/2 - https://outflux.net/weather/noaa/index.php"</p>
