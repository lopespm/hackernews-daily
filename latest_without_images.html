								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Keep in mind that Apple&#39;s claimed false positive rate (one in a trillion chance of an account being flagged innocently), and the collision rate determined by Dwyer in the article, are both derived without any adversarial assumptions. Given that NeuralHash collider and similar tools already exist, the false positive rate is expected to be much much higher.Imagine that you play a game of craps against an online casino. The casino throws a virtual six-sided die, secretly generated using Microsoft Excel&#39;s random number generator. Your job is to predict the result. If you manage to predict the result 100 times in a row, you win and the casino will pay you $1000000000000 (one trillion dollars). If you ever fail to predict the result of a throw, the game is over, you lose and you pay the casino $1 (one dollar).In an ordinary, non-adversarial context, the probability that you win the game is much less than one in one trillion, so this game is very safe for the casino. But this number is very misleading: it&#39;s based on naive assumptions that are completely meaningless in an adversarial context. If your adversary has a decent knowledge of mathematics at the high school level, the serial correlation in Excel&#39;s generator comes into play, and the relevant probability is no longer one in one trillion. The relevant number is 1/216 instead! When faced with a class of adversarial math majors, a casino that offers this game will promptly go bankrupt. With Apple&#39;s CSAM detection, you get to be that casino."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; In order to test things, I decided to search the publicly available ImageNet dataset for collisions between semantically different images. I generated NeuralHashes for all 1.43 million images and searched for organic collisions. By taking advantage of the birthday paradox, and a collision search algorithm that let me search in n(log n) time instead of the naive n^2, I was able to compare the NeuralHashes of over 2 trillion image pairs in just a few hours. &gt; This is a false-positive rate of 2 in 2 trillion image pairs (1,431,168^2). Assuming the NCMEC database has more than 20,000 images, this represents a slightly higher rate than Apple had previously reported. But, assuming there are less than a million images in the dataset, it&#39;s probably in the right ballpark. It&#39;s great to see the ingenuity and attention this whole debacle is receiving from the community. Maybe it will lead to advances in perceptual hashing (and also advances in consumer awareness of tech related privacy issues)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s been a lot of focus on the likelihood of collisions and whether someone could upload eg; an image with a matching hash to your device to &#34;set you up&#34;, etc. But what&#39;s still extremely concerning is that there is still no guarantee that the hash list used can&#39;t be coopted for another purpose (eg; politically insensitive content)."</p>

This should be a blog post, but I guess that&#39;s too 1999 for the author.So why do foxes lead you to treasure? Answer: They pathfind away from player not by euclidian &#34;distance&#34;, but simply by number of navmesh polygons. The game world has uneven navmesh density, with points of interest (locations often housing treasure) having a higher number of polygons, so the foxes tend to pathfind their escape path into them."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28232469">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Toyota was one of the few (only?) companies to keep a large stockpile of chips on hand to continue production in case of a supply interruption. They kept something like two years worth on hand.I guess 18 months of doing the extremely heavy lifting for the whole industry has taken its toll and now they&#39;re in the same boat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you have a taste for irony, my company makes critical components for semiconductor equipment. If we can&#39;t ship, equipment companies can&#39;t ship new equipment. If they can&#39;t ship, semiconductor fabs can&#39;t increase capacity to meet the demand and solve the shortage.We went line down last week due to shortage of a chip for our component.In reality, the shortage is somewhat self-inflicted, like toilet paper a year ago, but for whatever combination of real demand + hoarding, we can&#39;t get chips."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article (and others about this topic) indicate that the chip shortage isn&#39;t just a static. They all claim that chip and other supply chains (all based on South East Asian) are all under new pressure from delta strain spread.In fact, I wonder how much of this really is chip supply vs general supply. Most articles on this open with headlines about chip supply, but then contains quotes from Toyota about &#34;supply&#34; and &#34;parts&#34; in general."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"7 years ago I had just aborted an internship, my foray into being an employed adult, because I found myself unable to deal with disagreements. Contrary to my naive hope that the confidence boost from being a Professional Software Developer(tm) would solve all my emotional problems I now knew that my limitations would follow me around anywhere I would go. But I had no idea how to change and was too stuck in my own anxiety and arrogance to ask for help.Around that time I Somehow stumbled upon this[1] article on how to make a Buddhist bone trumpet. It took me completely by surprise, the topic, the author, the tone, the context of Buddhism, nothing fit together like I expected. It was the most absurd thing I ever read and I kept laughing, at the same time it felt utterly genuine. My curiosity piqued I read the other less bizarre articles from the author about Buddhism and life in general. It dawned on me that my attempt at completely controlling my life had, in fact, caused me to lose control over it. The process of learning to accept unpredictability and open myself to the world, that started the evening I read that article, was by no means always this fun, but looking back boy was it worth it.[1] https://buddhism-for-vampires.com/kangling-chod"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"https://blog.tjcx.me/p/consume-less-create-moreThis article inspired me on two things :1) Lots of the things I do in everyday life is just to consume: buying, watching, following, etc. These things either consume my money, or my time. These things make me feel good, but it does not generate real value. In order to get rich, I need to create things. I also start to realize that great people are great because they started to create things at a very early stage of their life (but not consuming things as they advocate, think about celebrities, entrepreneurs etc), so they are able to practice and perfect the value creating skills to the extreme.2) I start to realize that the world is binary in nature : I create to sell, I buy to consume. I either at the buyer side, or at the seller side. And in this current society, there is a huge buyer side trap, the whole idea of consumerism and social media is to trap you inside the buyer side, so you keep buying, you keep consuming. I really need to break free from this trap.This blog post was written before COVID-19, but the idea feels even fresher during this pandemic era"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2014/07/instant-pot-el...If you see cooking primarily as a means of getting nutrients rather than a hobby, I very strongly recommend getting an electric pressure cooker. It greatly simplifies cooking because it&#39;s automated. Just add the ingredients, close the lid, press a button, and wait. You will get a perfectly cooked one-pot meal with minimum effort. You can even mix fresh and frozen ingredients and the timer won&#39;t start until the frozen ingredients are thawed. If you don&#39;t overfill it the only thing the food touches is the inner stainless steel pot, so it&#39;s very easy to clean. I get the majority of my nutrition from food cooked this way. I can&#39;t imagine going back to slow traditional methods.It also makes dried legumes far more practical, because you can skip the pre-soak phase. If you eat a lot of legumes, and you switch from canned to dried, the savings will most likely pay for the cost of the machine within a few years. In addition, energy costs are reduced because cooking at increased pressure is faster, and good electric pressure cookers are insulated. I am happy with an Instant Pot brand one, although I don&#39;t guarantee they are the best. If somebody has strong opinions on which is best then please post them.The one major downside is the texture of the food can become boring, because everything is mixed together and you can&#39;t make crispy foods with it, but you can always add things like pickles after you&#39;ve cooked it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This would be a serious breach of privacy if true. But reading the tweets I&#39;m not sure what the policy really is:&gt; During a discovery thing 3yr ago, legal forced me to hand-over all my texts. They refused to let me delete anything, even &#34;fully personal,&#34; even when I said &#34;by fully personal I mean nudes.&#34; They said they&#39;re in their &#34;permanent evidence lockerThis doesn&#39;t sound like company policy, and more like they were subpoenaed or otherwise compelled to hand over communications.&gt; Another interesting Apple tidbit: the company tells employees to link their personal iCloud accounts if they need to collab with colleagues when they start. When they leave, they&#39;re asked to hand over their laptops w/o wiping them and give managers access to work systems.I&#39;m not sure how to parse this. Do you need to link your personal accounts with family photos and whatnot? Or can you just create a separate iCloud account just for work, to collaborate with coworkers?I&#39;m a firm believer in separating work and personal accounts. I usually try not to even log into email from my work computer if I don&#39;t need to, and I always use a spare phone for work if a company requires admin access or remote management tools of any kind. That said, reading these tweets I&#39;m not really sure if Apple is asking employees to breach this separation. I&#39;d just create a separate Apple ID for work and use that for the &#34;personal&#34; account that I&#39;m supposed to merge. That&#39;s a separation I&#39;m still comfortable with."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some time ago when I hired on at Apple (I&#39;ve since moved on to greener pastures) I had a tough time provisioning my corporate MacBook. Every time I tried entering my work email address I got kicked into an unfamiliar auth flow that ended up not working. After I mentioned how much trouble I was having, someone sitting near me in the office told me I needed to use a personal Apple ID to provision the device.I created a completely new consumer iCloud account and used that. I never did anything remotely &#34;personal&#34; on that machine, and after I left Apple I never used that iCloud account again. In fact I don&#39;t even remember my password for it.I went so far as to carry two iPhones, one personal and the other &#34;corporate,&#34; and I only ever used my &#34;corporate&#34; iPhone with Apple employee apps. I never even connected my personal phone to the campus WiFi; I used wireless data for that phone the entire time I was there.That said, I don&#39;t recall ever being asked to merge my personal and work accounts. It&#39;s just that if you want to do any personal stuff with corp hardware, it&#39;s much more convenient to just use your personal Apple ID when you provision the hardware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here’s my take as someone who worked there in the last two years.1. You absolutely have the choice to make a separate iCloud account for work, you just can’t make it with an @apple.com email.
2. It’s true that you should not wipe your device when you quit.
3. We were instructed to avoid using iCloud for anything work related. They recommended turning everything iCloud related off on your work computer except for FindMy.
4. None of the claims in the tweet sound familiar to me, but Apple is a big org.My impression is that they need you to have an iCloud account for tracking the location of the device with FindMy, but technical/legal limitations prevent that from happening through your work email."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The cantilevering arm looks as though it wouldn&#39;t have any real overall rigidity for carving or for rapid, accurate motion with any kind of resistance... But I really love that this made it to hacker news because I feel like &#34;hacking&#34; doesn&#39;t exclude non-software hacks and it&#39;s always awesome to see hardware for design and making alongside all the other software news.The idea of open source robotic assemblies or mechanical assemblies is another cool, separate thing. Another cool project I came across was the AR-1, AR-2, AR-3 series of desktop 6-axis robots. The inventor/designer made all the assembly docs open-sourced and sells kits or specs to make your own."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Neat kinematics with a horribly flexible frame that denies any serious usage. That said - it&#39;s designed to a low budget that increases the potential audience, and that is something that can only be welcomed. I&#39;m particularly interested in the software as that will be an enabler for future variations that have mechanical rigidity.Nice website!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This could be greatly simplified (at higher cost) by using linear motors for the cross-slides.It may even be more rigid than what is there now (though nowhere near rigid enough to do anything real)The design is actually not unique at all - you can buy much better versions of it (at higher cost, obviously).Most positioning actuators you can buy are literally built to be attached to each other in a cross-slide configuration, and to have a rotary table attached to it.  They also directly sell pre-built cross-slide actuators.If you just google &#34;cross-slide stepper&#34; or &#34;cross-slide servo&#34;, you can see this
(servo/stepper just gets rid of the manual ones, which also exist).The normal reason the configuration is not used is because it has no meaningful rigidity."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Richard Bartle is a luminary in the field of game design. He invented a system for classifying gamers&#39; preferred game actions called the &#34;Bartle taxonomy&#34;, which helps game designers understand player motivations better. Think of it like user personas in software development - Killers love competition, Explorers love discovery, Achievers love mastery, and Socializers play games for social reasons. When designing a game for mass appeal it&#39;s often important to make sure players of all stripes find reasons to enjoy it, and Bartle&#39;s taxonomy is a great framework for analyzing how different types of players will interact with a game.You can take an online version of the Bartle taxonomy questionnaire to get your own results here:http://matthewbarr.co.uk/bartle/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those interested, Bartle is the co-creator of the first MUD (multi-user dungeon, online text style adventure).He made a brilliant explanation why is text the best medium to activate the imagination:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zctp972y_Eg"</p>

That being said, I trust everyone here not to reprint the whole thing and sell copies at a profit!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can&#39;t believe how weak these cases have been - are these more of a posturing thing?* These were all approved at the time. This is going to make for a crazy world if folks act on an approval and then they are reversed.* The focus of a lot of these seems to be on harm to other (sometimes very scammy) businesses. The Apple case has this issue as well. Match group can&#39;t do non-cancelable auto-renewing billing in their own app store. Rando app can&#39;t get your email and other details but you can route via apple. Etc. Why not focus on consumer harm more - that was traditional focus. The complaint is Facebook doesn&#39;t make an easy api for others to scrape their platform - uh, hello cambridge analytic?* These social network things seem somewhat fragile. Myspace came and went, Friendster was hot. Now I see a lot more folks on tiktok. Are kids still even active on facebook?* Instagram wasn&#39;t that big when purchased, and many folks (including same people writing the articles now about monopolies) said that facebook wildly overpaid.https://twitter.com/rockspindeln/status/189416024058245121What&#39;s crazy is there is so much straight pure scam crap on the internet the FTC does nothing about. I mean, stuff that is obvious consumer harm. In my case I tried to cancel a subscription 30 days in advance recently (nearly 1K per year). It turns out you have to cancel 90 days in advance but not more than 120 days in advance?? So now I&#39;m on the hook for another 1K. That is just total trash behavior online. And instead of the click to sign up, I had to go through endless hoops. Talked to someone, then they wanted me to submit a case, I did that, then back and forth to &#34;verify&#34; me etc etc.The FTC is crickets on just endless false advertising, misleading internet offers etc (stuff that&#39;s not even close to OK)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; After suffering significant failures during this critical transition period, Facebook found that it lacked the business talent and engineering acumen to quickly and successfully integrate its outdated desktop-based technology to the new era of mobile-first communication. Unable to maintain its monopoly or its advertising profits by fairly competing, Facebook’s executives addressed this existential threat by buying up the new mobile innovators, including its rival Instagram in 2012 and mobile messaging app WhatsApp in 2014.Man, I hate FB as much as the next guy, but this argument is weak as hell.FB was still the #1 mobile app in the world when they bought up both of these companies. Hell, neither were even direct competitors any more than Oculus was.FB&#39;s play is clearly a horizontal integration - they want as many different types of products to fall under their single advertising pane of glass as possible. The FTC is going after them for doing the exact opposite thing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; After failing to compete with new innovators, Facebook illegally bought or buried them when their popularity became an existential threat.Illegally bought or buried them?1) FTC approved all the mergers. So, it is surprising that they&#39;d say that these were illegally bought.2) Facebook seems to be operating all key acquisitions (Instagram and WhatsApp) as separate products and hasn&#39;t made their usage conditional to having a Facebook account.This is re-writing history and it is just as dangerous when the FTC does it as it is when a political party does it."</p>
