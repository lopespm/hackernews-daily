								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"1) This is unambiguously Good News2) This is not upstreamable in its current form (nvidia admit this in their press release)3) In an ideal world, nouveau (the open source driver for nvidia hardware) would be able to target this kernel code. Right now though there&#39;s no commitment for any sort of stable userland ABI, and that makes that difficult (moving to a new driver version may break interfaces that nouveau uses)The press release does say that they have plans to figure out a more upstream friendly approach in the long term, which is great - and what has been released will undoubtedly help development of the existing nouveau codebase."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Had to do a few doubletakes on this, but even with the recent hacks and progress on NVIDIA releasing Tegra source code, I didn&#39;t expect this for another few years.Holy shit.It&#39;s even licensed as MIT.Even OpenBSD could conceivably port this with enough manpower. Adding enough just emulation for the userspace driver would be a lot easier than maintaining a complete linux emulator.This is one of the biggest things to happen to hardware support for open source OSes in well over a decade."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note that this is just the kernel modules, not the actual graphics driver.IIRC these sources were already released under a permissive license along with their driver distribution. This just seems to be them putting those sources on GitHub and being more open to contributions."</p>

I was about to make a joke about it but I&#39;m actually serious.Once I, a former Houstonian with no experience driving on ice, was driving through the snowy mountains and lost control of my car. Instead of panicking, my video-game-induced laser focus kicked in and I calmly piloted the car until the wheels gained traction and I could park the car on the side of the road.But learning how to focus in the midst of chaos, instead of panicking, is a technique I specifically had to learn in childhood to beat challenging levels of Super Mario Brothers.Thanks, video games."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Since coinbase isn’t FDIC insured, it makes sense that if coinbase goes bankrupt, the customer currencies will go away as well. And they aren’t SPIC insured in the situations where crypto is a security.It’s funny to see people shocked (SHOCKED!) when crypto doesn’t have the protections of regular banking and investments. That’s why you don’t invest with stuff that isn’t insured. Those aren’t real rates, they are risk adjusted rates for not having insurance.It’s fine to invest in these products, but scary because people aren’t doing due diligence and have unrealistic expectations.The CEO’s statement that they won’t go bankrupt it just comical. Of course he thinks they won’t. Few bank CEOs think that. But real banks and brokerages have insurance for their customers in the rare situation that they go bankrupt."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For a Cloudflare article, this one is surprisingly light on technical details. And for the product where it most matters.I&#39;m guessing this is a single master database with multiple read replicas. That means it&#39;s not consistent anymore (the C in ACID). Obviously reads after a write will see stale data until the write propogates.I&#39;m a bit curious how that replication works. Ship the whole db? Binary diffs of the master? Ship the SQL statements that did the write and reapply them? Lots of performance and other tradeoffs here.What&#39;s the latency like? This likely doesn&#39;t run in every edge location. Does the database ship out on the first request. Get cached with an expiry? Does the request itself move to the database instead of running at the edge - like maybe this runs on a select subset of locations?So many questions, but no details yet."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, this looks potentially very interesting. Since this is sort of fresh in my mind from the recent Fly post about it:* How exactly is the read replication implemented? Is it using litestream behind the scenes to stream the WAL somewhere? How do the readers keep up? Last I saw you just had to poll it, but that could be computationally expensive depending on the size of the data (since I thought you had to download the whole DB), and could potentially introduce a bit of latency in propagation. Any idea what the metrics are for latency in propagation?* How are writes handled? Does it do the Fly thing about sending all requests to one worker?I don&#39;t quite know what a &#34;worker&#34; is but I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s kind of like a Lambda? If you have it replicated around the world, is that one worker all running the same code, and Cloudflare somehow manages the SQL replicating and write forwarding? Or would those all be separate workers?"</p>

					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31336396">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I once sent out a proposal on the FreeBSD lists to merge /sbin with /bin, and /usr/sbin with /usr/bin. People were concerned that this would slow down the system, due to PATH lookups taking longer. Even when I demonstrated the opposite was true (it being faster due to fewer directories needing to be scanned), I wasn&#39;t able to get consensus. What a shame."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve read this explanation a couple of times, and if you go all the way back to PDP-11 the split does indeed sound ridiculous. I had my first contact with Linux from some magazine CDs in the late 90s, I think it was Red Hat or SUSE based. The documentation there had a much clearer explaination:/sbin, /usr/sbin is for binaries that need root. You put them in separate directories so their permissions all match up, and so they don&#39;t show up when completing in bash.The paths without /usr - /bin and /sbin - are available from the get go. It is the very first partition that is mounted, and what is guaranteed to be available if you do &#34;init 1&#34; or boot in single user mode. You can also do fsck from there (assuming the boot partition is not damaged). I don&#39;t know how this integrated with initrd (initramfs wasn&#39;t a thing yet). I think there was only one &#34;base system&#34; - either initrd was very basic, or the whole base was in initrd, or something similar.The paths with /usr were managed by the package manager. Word of mouth was: don&#39;t install anything manually there. If you do (via make install), keep around the source so you can do make uninstall. But better install to /usr/local or /opt."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bad/illogical/outdated directory structure is one of the most annoying things I&#39;ve encountered while using Linux, because it makes the admin job feel unnecessarily messy (things are all over the place), and it feels as if there&#39;s a fundamental imbalance in the system that you can&#39;t get rid of."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recently left a stressful job after developing shingles and then celiac disease. My life is much worse now, I went into that job healthy and strong and now I&#39;m sick all the time. Perhaps celaic disease was always in the genetic cards for me, or maybe the stress triggered it? The worst part is the job wasn&#39;t especially bad, it was a reasonable job, and I can expect my next job to have similar stress I think. What am I going to do?I&#39;m always amazed at the change in perspective after being in a job for a while. While unemployed, I feel competent, I make progress on hard problems nobody else in the world is working on, and I feel good. While employed, stupid crap stresses me constantly, I can&#39;t leave the stress at work, I bring it home, I obsess about social hierarchies that can vanish in an instant. Everytime I&#39;ve left a job I&#39;m amazed that after just a couple days I can barely remember what I was working on before and what stressed me, like my brain knows all of that no longer matters and let&#39;s it go in an instant.How can I keep a healthy outside perspective while remaining employed? How do I avoid becoming mentally trapped in the workplace mindset? I&#39;ve been giving this a lot of thought, but no answers so far."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Recent Xoogler here. I&#39;ve never met anyone who was actually happy at Google when you sat them down for an honest talk. Everyone was either coasting and depressed/disengaged, or overworked and stressed (I would say 80% were the former). People were frustrated about the bureaucracy, the promo process, the slow pace, the meaninglessness of the work an individual IC does, the stress for managers. Even on a super sexy project dealing with cutting edge AI that got tons of press coverage, everyone was frustrated. This company has a serious cultural issue."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; In 2020, the pandemic destroyed bucket #3 for most people. We were no different. Friends from back home in Canada couldn’t visit us. Even meeting up with local friends became hard. In January 2021 I tore my achilles tendon playing pick-up basketball. There goes bucket #2.&gt; Only then did I realize bucket #1 had been running low for a while.I&#39;m somewhat puzzled. If the author is struggling to socialize with friends (bucket #3) and struggling to pay attention to physical health (bucket #2) then why does he think that this is going to help improve work-life balance:&gt; I work more hours. I’m more likely to be working in the evening or on the weekend now.I can empathize with the desire to get caught up in a high-energy startup (it&#39;s fun!) but this whole blog post reads like someone trying to replace an increasingly disappointing personal life with excessive workaholism. Filling your days with extra work can fill the &#34;bucket #1&#34; (career) but it seems like a nail in the coffin for the author&#39;s problems with bucket #2 (physical health) and bucket #3 (social life).Posts like this are a dream come true for investors and startup founders. &#34;Lacking satisfaction in your life? Come work harder for less money at someone else&#39;s startup!&#34; I suspect this blog post is going to become a staple on VC Twitter and in startup recruiting pitches for the next few years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bias up front: I work at Google.Something I try to do whenever I read articles like this: Whenever you see the name of the giant corporation that the author worked at, replace it with &#34;my team&#34;. Google has over 100,000 employees, so there&#39;s no real &#34;here&#39;s what it&#39;s like to work at Google&#34;. At that scale, there is too much variance for any simple neat summary (though there are certainly trends and commonalities).I&#39;ve met people who worked at Amazon who described it as a hellscape of misery and others who felt it was incredibly rewarding. There&#39;s been times when I worked at EA when I loved my job and times when I hated it.A single data point is useful, but it&#39;s only a single data point. I&#39;m glad the author found a better job that fits what they&#39;re looking for. That&#39;s all any of us really want in our careers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What will the author blog in 5 years?I am noticing a (darkish?) pattern in these recurring “I transitioned jobs” reports. Worryingly, they represent many of the words I imagine myself writing if I were again a blogger.It’s basically the honeymoon/wanderlust cycle. Person gets job. It is a dream job. It is described as a dream job because of reasons a1, b1, and c1. Delta t passes. Things have changed. Because of reasons x1, y1, and z1, job is no longer a good dream job. It’s now a bad dream/nightmare job. Person has awakened now, and for reasons, a2, b2, and c2 is living a new dream. Blink, flinch, repeat.The nagging suspicion is that while things change, they don’t so much actually. They shift around. What does change is how we come to see things. At one point, we convince ourselves things are awesome. Later we believe it’s not. Which is the real truth we ought to accept? It’s like trying to measure the one way speed of light. You can’t, just the sum of the round trip.So do we make the assumption that somewhere in the middle of this good-to-bad cycle is the reality? Or suspect it was always that bad, we were just able to initially gaslight ourselves? Or perhaps that it was and still is good, we’ve just let the negatives creep in and take over?Some would philosophize that all happiness is an illusion. Or a choice. Or whatever.But what frustrates me about this (having been through this cycle 3-4 times now), is that it is not a universal life experience. I have relationships with family, friends, and various institutions that grow stronger and stronger over time. They do NOT loop like work relationships do. Is there something inherit in work relationships that makes this loop inevitable? Do all experience it, or only a certain mindset of persons? Are there cases where this loop is broken, but they just rare enough, you don’t hear about them? Should I despair or hope?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Despite many maturity issues in practice Flutter is the only realistic option for true cross platform UIs that run everywhere. Apart from Qt , but the licensing issue is a hindrance. And yes, the web backend isn&#39;t ideal, but it will improve over time.I just wish Google had built Flutter on a low level core that isn&#39;t tied to Dart, so it would be usable from other languages.Dart isn&#39;t horrible and is getting better, but it is still a somewhat awkward mish mash of Java and JavaScript,  and  I  don&#39;t really enjoy using it.The only reason to use Dart is Flutter, which really hurts ecosystem health / library availability and prevents code sharing with the backend."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was recently tasked to build a mobile app at my work, that would have maybe 5% of the feature-set of our gargantuan web product. However, this 5% was mission critical. Coming from React-TS, building with Flutter was a bit weird at first (where&#39;s my CSS???) but the productivity gains came quickly. The Pub ecosystem is fairly mature, in that all the third party packages are pretty high quality and address most common use cases. Unlike npm where there are 10+ solutions for the same problem, there will only be one - maybe 2 in Flutter land.I was very pleased to find out, that Flutter supported web as well. Now, it&#39;s not as good as mobile yet - some of the animations are render blocked by the JS main thread - but it is a very nice &#39;middle&#39; solution to somebody who needs to use the app who doesn&#39;t have iOS or Android (for example, Surface tablet). Also great for internal testing - push up the latest changes to a dev web environment, and everyone can test without installing APKs or using TestFlight.In my use case, I was actively discouraged against making something that looked beautiful or pretty - the software is designed to be spartan, minimalist and essential. Flutter is perfect for that.All in all, Flutter is awesome. Is it the right answer for everything? No. But when you only have one developer to spare whose job it is to build a mobile app, it&#39;s perfect for that. The web support is a nice bonus - haven&#39;t tried any of the desktop stuff yet.Dart, as a language, is nice. Not spectacular, but certainly tidier than Java or JavaScript. I&#39;ve gotten used to functionality programming, so writing everything in classes was jarring at first."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Flutter 3 comes with an upgrade to Dart 2.17 [1], which has quite a few improvements as well... including state on enums.While that&#39;s great, I was hoping it would be like in Rust, where each enum variant can declare its own state components, but unfortunately it seems to be more like Java: same state for all variants.Well, at least there&#39;s quite a few other small but useful improvements... and they showed how they really listen to the community by implementing the new syntax for passing on constructor parameters to a super-class... and by improving the docs of the 200 most popular packages with lots of examples, as requested by the people.I like how they&#39;re listening to the community as well to implement meta-programming (like macros) [2] to solve the main pain point, currently, in Dart, which is how verbose it is to generate code for things like serialization and data types.Once they get that, Dart will be a really good language to work on (it&#39;s already quite ok IMO, despite most people, usually those who don&#39;t actually use it much, hating on it).[1] https://medium.com/dartlang/dart-2-17-b216bfc80c5d[2] https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/1482"</p>
