								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thibault Duplessis is actually an ex co-worker of mine, and this guy is truly impressive.Not only he is a very talented developer, he really sticks to his beliefs and made what Lichess is today.He used to take up a job for a year or so, save money, and travel the world for a year or so until money runs out. Then he would come back to France and take up a new job. All working on Lichess during his free time.For a few years now he has enough donation to pay himself enough money for his expenses, while he could have been a startup millionaire if he had decided to take a different path.But he proved that you can have a successful non-profit, free of charge, free from ads service. Not just source code, but an actual service hosted with millions of users.We need more people like Thibault."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I made a site heavily inspired by lichess (specifically AGPL, no ads ever, free forever), but for crossword board games (think Scrabble, Words with Friends, etc). You can see it here at https://woogles.ioIt has been growing steadily and we&#39;re about to hit 400K games played; it&#39;s the site of choice for the streaming community and we just finished hosting the World Blitz Championship this past week :)Thibault is sort of my hero. We&#39;ve talked about doing some sort of cross-promotion but I&#39;d like to polish our app a bit more before I follow up again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lichess is truly on a class of its own. It delivers a better service than any of it’s alternatives (in my opinion), and it’s actually 100% free with no BS.Funny enough, I’ve donated around $30 in total which is $30 more than I would’ve ever thought of spending on a chess site. Hats off to thibault and the open source community for creating such a wonderful gem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seams the core of Apple&#39;s defence:  Apple contends that &#39;[n]o reasonable consumer would believe&#39; that purchased content would remain on the iTunes platform indefinitely

which is a flagrant difference between ownership of physical items and non-cloud items vs cloud items.This strikes at the root of our society&#39;s definition of ownership.  Clarification should not depend on Apple, or even a court.  This should be enshrined by an explicit law.  Using the word  &#39;license&#39; or &#39;rent&#39; instead of &#39;buy&#39; for something you can&#39;t own seems the minimum a consumer should demand."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve seen the phrase &#34;Own it in {HD/BluRay/4K}&#34; so many times and always cringe. You&#39;re just owning a limited license (extremely limited, in the case of digital goods) to watch.The average HN user can spot the difference and say &#34;of course you don&#39;t own it, and in case of streaming, you only have access for as long as the service is around&#34;, but that&#39;s not what the average consumer sees. &#34;Buy&#34; and &#34;own&#34; have very strong meanings and repurposing those for marketing purposes to mean &#34;limited lease&#34; is bending the truth to the point of breaking.But of course, &#34;lease it for a limited time, to watch on a limited set of devices, in a geographically limited region&#34; doesn&#39;t sound so valuable as &#34;buy and own it&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What blows me away is in a study group of 734 infants, which benefited from maternal antibodies against malaria, 717 were infected by malaria in the first year of their life. That&#39;s nearly 100%, in the first year since birth. That&#39;s devastating.The vaccine is showing 77% efficacy in trials in Burkina Faso.That&#39;s an ongoing pandemic that makes covid-19 look like a case of the sniffles. Malaria deaths peaked around 930,000 a year in 2004, and is around 600,000 a year now. I believe covid-19 death toll stands around 3 million deaths, most above the age of 70. Malaria is over 100 million, most under the age of 5.Source: https://ourworldindata.org/malaria"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The long and arduous task of dealing with malaria does give one pause when considering that there have been two new globally significant infectious diseases in the last 50 years. We aren’t getting rid of HIV or SARS-CoV-2 any time soon. To me there is little doubt we should deploy massive resources to detect new infectious agents early and prevent their spread. We have the technology. There is no better gift we can leave to  our future civilisation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d like to urge everyone to consider contributing to cost-effective charities that work on alleviating the scourge of malaria.GiveWell, a charity evaluator recommends Malaria Consortium and Against Malaria Foundation as cost-effective ways to directly reduce instances of malaria.https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; 1. Use quotes to force an exact-match searchAlmost never works these days. Google now usually just quantizes your search terms into an ad or ultra popular news article written 3 minutes ago. It also ignores all your operators most of the time.Bonus: If you use something like inurl: You get blocked for a &#34;hacking attempt&#34;. Google also has blocked Tor and VPNs since 2006 or so. In fact, they are the one big search engine who has done this the longest. Google search right now is like one of those dinky websites from the early 2000s that follows all kinds of insane practices like blacklists and filters.What Google Search is trying to be is a thing you can ask questions and get an answer back. For example converting feet to inches, or where is Starbucks. I don&#39;t even understand why the niche (really, this is how academic research is done, but i guess you can just discount the entire web as an invalid soruce) of &#34;searching for strings over a set of websites&#34; is not even attempted to be filled. People are crazy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article is missing several operators that are useful. Like  inurl:, intitle:, allintitle:, etc.The &#34;AROUND&#34; proximity search is neat as well, especially for words with dual meaning. like:bootstrap AROUND(6) cpuFinds &#34;bootstrap&#34; within 6 words of &#34;cpu&#34;, which culls out most (not all) of the unwanted results about the bootstrap js library.This article seems to cover most of the ones I&#39;m aware of: https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/Edit: Changed around(6) to AROUND(6).  Apparently the lowercase version doesn&#39;t work, as it&#39;s highlighting the word &#34;around&#34; in the results."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great list, but what is the most important in search is not operators. It is context.Every time I work with students and they are stuck, I ask them to Google the issue. 9 out of 10 they will write something like: how to upload an image?Instead, they should first specify the context. Is it an issue on the front end? Are they looking for the correct input type for file upload? Or is it the php method to receive the file on the back end. Or is it in nodejs?Search engines cannot infer the correct context because there are hundreds of correct answers. So we have to specify:- nodejs file upload async (no need to talk to it like a human)- html file upload input type- php file upload tutorialMost likely, the answer will be in the first few links."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing which I don&#39;t think has been commented on is the marketing effort behind the M1.It&#39;s getting a lot of prominence and its use across lots of computers means that there can be a consistent message that &#34;M1 is great - get a new Mac and get an M1&#34;.It also provides an opportunity to distinguish between M1 and the next generation M2 (presumably).I&#39;ve always thought Intel&#39;s marketing was a bit confused - i7 stays the same over 10+ years with only the obscure (to the general public) suffix changing from generation to generation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"You get an M1 with the new iPad Pro as well! I hadn&#39;t thought of the situation as the article presents. When shown in that light, it made me pause to reflect. The M1 doesn&#39;t make sense when its in every darn product. The only differentiator is screen size, RAM, and OS?I will admit that I switched to Thinkpad and Win10 about two years ago when I had to return my butterfly for the 5th time. I am not looking back either. If anything, I am more focused on AMD Ryzen and Nvidia 30 series chips in MSI, Lenovo Legion and Asus offerings. There is nothing I can&#39;t do with one of those machines. Going Apple is a backward move for me as I like to program, design in CAD, play steam VR, and run blender sims. Can&#39;t do any of those well with Apple hardware."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO, pointers are less difficult to comprehend than other abstractions, like lambdas are.If you know how to walk down a street and stop at the right street number, then you have used pointers.  And if you&#39;ve ever observed that one tall building may &#34;cover&#34; a range of street numbers, such as 200-220, then you should understand how to move from one 4-byte &#34;value&#34; to the next in an array in memory.Anyway, many more analogies... probably better than this one.Maybe unions could make using pointers a bit more challenging, but again, tall buildings next to short buildings and so on.  We do this kind of pointer calculation in real life."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Resources like this (and as others have mentioned, Dark Site Finder) are very useful for astrophotography, especially for a hobbyist like myself. Many don&#39;t realize how relatively close they live to areas with great nighttime viewing conditions.For example, upstate New York has some great viewing locations, so even if you live in NYC it&#39;s an easy weekend trip. Here&#39;s a shot I took of the Milky Way taken from such a site (one of the darker spots in the map): https://www.lumathon.com/photo/_qTYviEhy/Colors-of-the-Milky...Edit: a few more of my other shots of the night sky for anyone interested, various locations, all of which were scouted using a light pollution map like the one posted -- https://www.lumathon.com/dan/photos/tag/stars"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not like nothing can be done about light pollution. For example Germany has a law about light pollution, and it shows on this map. It less polluted than its neighbours, although it has higher population density and urbanization level."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It would be really great if this and other kinds of geospatial data were more open and easily mashed-up. Let&#39;s say I wanted to find a nice tract of land to buy (Zillow), which has good hiking trails (AllTrails), low light pollution for stargazing (lightpollutonmap.info), and maybe a dirt airstrip (vfrmaps) to fly into. Currently, I have to have four browser windows open with each site. There&#39;s no way to mash this data up easily without reaching for the dev tools and hoping each site provides raw data. Wouldn&#39;t it be better if everyone made data accessibility a priority rather than just packaging it up for each site&#39;s very narrow use case?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think there&#39;s a lot of truth to this, but I&#39;m going to make an additional suggestion that I&#39;ll readily admit is biased by my own feelings:I think Go is in a honeymoon phase and people will hate it in 10 years; I think Rust will continue to be liked even when it&#39;s a legacy language (perhaps no language can continue being loved once it becomes &#34;brown&#34;, but I think Rust will be a lot less dreaded than others).Go, like Ruby (mentioned at the end of the article), is optimized for building. You can do things quickly and easily with minimal ceremony. Some people love that. But that&#39;s exactly the trait that&#39;s starting to weigh on Ruby, and it&#39;s exactly the trait that has put PHP and Perl in the &#34;dread&#34; category over time (remember when people were in love with those?).Rust on the other hand is optimized for maintaining (it&#39;s right there in the name: software should be allowed to become old and &#34;collect rust&#34;). Rust APIs are very hard to misuse, everything is constrained and specified very explicitly. Documentation and testing live inline with your code. You know exactly what a piece of code can and can&#39;t do - you even know whether it&#39;s allowed to mutate an object you&#39;re passing it. And of course certain mistakes are impossible to make at all without (again, explicitly) dipping into unsafe { }.This kind of forethought is what makes a language that survives the honeymoon phase."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A big problem and reason why &#34;brown&#34; languages come to be dreaded is because very few software houses take code UX seriously.I&#39;ve worked on codebases built with UX in mind and codebases without, and it&#39;s a world of difference.Code with UX has descriptive names, functions whose names intuitively describe what they do, using parameters that can&#39;t be accidentally misused. APIs are clearly delineated, domain edges clearly defined. Reading such code feels almost like reading a high level recipe, with the nitty gritty details available on demand using CMD-click. Weird edge case code is documented with a block comment explaining why it was done in this unexpected way. Nesting is minimal. Aptly named temp variables that only exist to aid readability are common.And the irony of it all is that by eschewing code UX, you&#39;re mortgaging your future: making it progressively harder to maintain your codebase, and harder to bring new people up to speed. Changes take longer, and testing is more difficult as fewer and fewer people understand what it&#39;s doing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author seems to completely ignore the possibility that language designers get better at designing languages over time, and people simply prefer to develop new projects in well-designed over poorly designed languages.This to me seems to be the null-hypothesis, and I see no evidence on the page that use in &#34;greenfield projects&#34; vs &#34;brownfield projects&#34; provides any more indication than a simple underlying &#34;well designed&#34; vs &#34;poorly designed&#34; metric.For instance: why do people dislike Objective-C but like Swift? Could it be simply that Swift was expressly designed to ease pain points of Objective-C? Or is it, as this author claims, that Objective-C is in more legacy projects and if Swift were to have been invented first then replaced with Objective-C, people would suddenly love Objective-C and hate Swift? Same reasoning holds for C/Rust, VBA/Python&amp;TS, Assembly/LiterallyAnythingElse [1], Java/C# [2], and R/Julia.[1] I imagine if this author were to have been around to write this in 1980, they&#39;d make a claim something like &#34;People say the enjoy C projects more then Assembly ones, but in this essay I describe how this is actually just because Assembly is more likely to be used in existing codebases, and if Assembly had come around after C people would certainly prefer Assembly and detest C&#34;[2] Note C# is incredibly enterprise/legacy, yet well-designed. This supports the null hypothesis perhaps the most."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an excellent tool to have as a security consultant, and it just keeps getting better and better. When approaching a large codebase, it enables you to write custom rules that match on certain antipatterns you&#39;ve spotted that may be unique to the codebase. That&#39;s the real value of the tool, but the repository of per-language rules is also convenient for quickly finding low-hanging fruit (like every use of a potentially injectable function such as exec,system,etc. in PHP).For example, a webapp may have been designed such that authorisation needs to be explicitly added with a line or two to each controller. A semgrep rule can be written to match all the controllers which are missing this line. Then these controllers can be manually reviewed to assess whether unauthorised access should be allowed. Depending on what you are trying to match, this is something that may be very complex or even impossible to implement accurately in plain grep. Some languages like Ruby have powerful static analysis tools (Brakeman) that can also do this, but the benefit of Semgrep is the flexibility across multiple languages and how readable the rulesets are. [1][1] https://blog.includesecurity.com/2021/01/custom-static-analy..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The name &#34;Semantic Grep&#34; does not give a good idea for what this tool is and what it does.The web page states:  &#34;Static analysis at ludicrous speed.  Find bugs and enforce code standards&#34;&#34;grep&#34; is short for &#34;global regular expression print&#34;.  It finds matches for the given regular expression and prints them.&#34;Semantic Grep&#34; is a static analyzer with configurable rules, style checks, etc.  It does much more than search and print.Perhaps a better name is needed?Edit:  How about &#34;omnilint&#34; or &#34;omnicritic&#34; since semgrep is more of a &#34;lint&#34; (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)) or &#34;critic&#34; (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl::Critic)  type of tool that handles multiple languages?Edit2:  &#34;Static analysis at ludicrous speed&#34; ==&gt; &#34;turbolint&#34;?
