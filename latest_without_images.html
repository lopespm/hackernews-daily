								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is really cool. Seeing these beautiful colors I realize how much how I imagine the ancient world is shaped by museum artifacts and photos in textbooks, which show raw and brown/grey/white stones, rusty tools and weapons. I&#39;ve grown thinking about pre-medieval times as a landscape of ruins. It would be like if future humans were picturing our current world as nothing but bombed cities.It&#39;s a really cool project. Now I want a VR game where I could simply walk around ancient cities and watch people go about their day."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m very curious to see what the long term effects of unionizing will be in Academia. I&#39;m hopeful and optimistic it will improve things in the long run. Yes there will be some unintended consequences but academic life is already very rough if you&#39;re not tenured.Academia likes to cast itself as a true meritocracy. If you work hard and publish good papers you&#39;ll do well. In practice it&#39;s more of a gerontocracy where senior members  can single handedly destroy a young investigators career. (It happened to me and I saw it happen to several people). There is little to no recourse against this.Arguments against unionization from already tenured faculty usually sound like: &#34;If you want to be the best in your field you have to work harder than everyone else. Forming a union won&#39;t change that fact and may even discourage students from working so hard. This might interfere with their career goals.&#34;However, the power structures in academia are heavily skewed and toxic. Individually graduate students have little recourse when they are wronged. Life in academia is hard. You have to work long days, the chance of success is very low. At every stage the probability of getting that next job is very low.A lot of the field agrees that something needs to change, but no one can agree exactly what needs to change or how to get there.  The people with the power are the tenured professors who &#34;won the lottery&#34; and are out of touch with the problems they are causing. They aren&#39;t going to be the mechanism of change even though they hold all the power."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was a graduate student with a research assistantship position at the University of Washington in the mid 2000s, a few years after they unionized and got a contract with the UAW.By the time I was there, even though it was only a few years after the union struggle, I didn&#39;t hear much about the union, at least in my department.But what I knew it meant was: we had good health insurance, we had a guaranteed minimum stipend, we had the right to actually take vacation during university vacations, and a certain number of sick days. I knew from talking to oother students, that before the union contract, grad students with assistantships didn&#39;t necessarily have these things (it depended on department), and sometimes literally got no vacation or allowed sick leave at all.I was aware of no ways that the presence of a graduate student union harmed the grad students involved -- to the contrary of some suppositions in this thread. Grad student unions exist in dozens of universities, some for years now, so it&#39;s possible to look at actual experiences, not just forecasting supposition. I was also aware of no ways the union harmed research or academics at the university (beyond of course costing them more money to treat the grad students right).I wonder if a few years after I left, most grad students even realized what the union had won for them. The union was not very visible, once the fight for a contract was over."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the UK, most students are members of their universitys&#39; branch of the National Union of Students.[1]The unions have a big presence on campus and a bar with heavily discounted drinks and organise a lot of the social clubs and events that happen outside of the study.They also negotiate with the university and faculty, fighting for students, and you can get individual advise and help too.Enrolling to the student union usual happens almost automatically when you turn up and register for your dorm, classes and doctors etc.The staff of the university (academics, lecturers, trainers, instructors, researchers, etc) tend to belong to The University and College Union.[2]I didn&#39;t know this was abnormal in other countries?[1] https://www.nus.org.uk/

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For anyone interested in learning more about partial reprogramming, I recently wrote a review article on the current state of the art: https://www.adanguyenx.com/blog/partial-reprogrammingIn short, we&#39;re still far away from using it in humans (10+ years). Currently, all companies working on this are in pre-clinical stage, with turn.bio as the closest, expecting to go into clinical trials late this year.This tech is exciting but there are still a lot of limitations:- Risk of cancer: this technology is based on the work of Yamanaka in 2006, who discovered 4 factors that can turn any cells into pluripotent stem cells. The work in the OP article basically used the same 4 factors, but only partially, so that the cells became &#34;younger&#34; without losing their identities (i.e. turning into stem cells). This requires understanding the right dosage for every cell type so we don&#39;t go overboard and turn them into dedifferentiated cells which could lead to cancer- Cell specificity, microenvironment, etc.: reprogramming is finicky and the right dosage is dependent on the cell type or the environment around the cells. This is important because you have to figure out the right dosage for each cell type so as to avoid cancer- Delivery: it&#39;s easy to deliver gene therapy to skin cells on a dish, not so much to other cell types or organs in the bodies -- that&#39;s why we have not seen very impressive results when this is used on live normal mice"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a Chinese, I can say that the situation is worse than it in the article. My brother is a student who lives in a flat and has not eaten for two days and no one has brought basic substances. He can&#39;t leave the flat, he turns to his tutor but his tutor is also forced to stay at home (eating instant noodles every day). We are worried about him but there is nothing we can do, if we criticise the government on chinese Twitter we will be arrested by the police. ಥ_ಥ"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; People are finding out that state media exists not for accurate news, but only to spin reality into a narrative that fits the powers higher up.Are people really finding that out only now? I thought that this was generally accepted knowledge even in China, despite the constant fear and propaganda they live with.What&#39;s happening now with the strict lockdowns and zero-Covid policy is inhumane. People are literally prisoners in their own homes and anyone in a position of power will abuse it to avoid hurting their social score. What a fucked up situation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Based in Shanghai since 2014, I can share some details on why it feels so unbearable to be here right now.Firstly, the totalitarian government have never been good at communicating anything except propaganda. So on one hand we&#39;re inundated with &#34;Go Shanghai!&#34; and how brave volunteers distribute food, on the other hand, we&#39;re completely in the dark about what&#39;s going on. Goalposts are being moved daily, rumors proliferate, and things change every day, adding a lot of stress to an already suboptimal situation.Second, I can confirm that the food situation is extremely bad. We are a family of two, and always been kind of preppers, so we had many bags of rice, pasta, dehydrated veg, frozen meats in our large fridge. Chinese society, en masse, is much more used to just ordering food daily. Many people never cook. It&#39;s cheaper this way (though of course the quality varies). Bigger families with aunties who can cook just used to pop by the local wet market daily and get a bag of fresh produce. Many households might not even have a fridge at all, or have a small one.The government was saying that &#34;there will be no lockdown&#34;, and when the lockdown became imminent, people barely had two days to stock up. Queues, fights, empty shelves everywhere. More stress.A lot of people in our community do not have any food left, and we&#39;ve received two government issued &#34;rations&#34; so far (in 12 days of lockdown): one with 5 tomatoes, and one with 3 pounds of chicken drumsticks, 3 potatoes, 1 head of cauliflower, and a bunch of rotten lettuce. If we did not stock up, we would be starving right now. We donated quite a bit of food to our neighbors already, and many people are actually very close to having no food at all. Getting a delivery is almost impossible, group orders organized by compounds are often ridiculously overpriced, and not always work out. Scams are emerging.Thirdly, I understand the author&#39;s frustration with the guards (&#34;baoan&#34;). Those people never had any formal power, but now they &#34;run things&#34; and, for many, the newly obtained power went to their heads. Violence and abuse is abound. We have PCR tests every 1-2 days, sometimes at 6am, some compounds at 3am. People dragged from their beds and forced to stand in queues.How would you respond to all that?Yes, it has some potential to save lives, but if it was communicated better, if we had more time to prepare, and they could still run food deliveries, nobody would complain that much. It&#39;s terribly mismanaged, and even after we &#34;open up&#34;, I will strongly reconsider staying here. Omicron will return, and I do not want to be here for the next (and next, and next) lockdown."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Really happy to see this on the front page!One thing to keep in mind if you&#39;re interested in joining: the Digital Corps is for early career technologists, so if you have much experience in tech, you might want to apply to USDS (https://www.usds.gov) or 18F (https://18f.gsa.gov) instead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Public sector IT was an extremely frustrating experience for me.- incompetent administration (org flow chart, constantly changing paradigms, misnomers (&#34;open source&#34; == we tape together stuff from public git-repositories, push nothing upstream, and outsource lots of core development))- administration&#39;s priorities change with every election (project funding as a flag in the wind depending on current political climate)- red tape everywhere- bureaucrats everywhere- the whole job-stack attracted incompetent people, the kind that values stability over deep understanding and progress. the kind where I thought &#34;man, good that they are working here in [$current_politically_opportune_project] so they can&#39;t do actual damage somewhere else&#34;. this applied for the business administrators, the project managers, the &#34;developers&#34;, the admins, even a large part of the contractors.- &#34;you&#39;re working too fast! haven&#39;t been here for long, eh?&#34;- compliance &gt; securityNever, ever ever ever again. Granted, this was in Europe, maybe the US sucks less in the public sector. I would bet a good amount of money that there is a large intersection of problem spaces among the regions though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like that the Digital Corps exists in theory. I applied many moons ago, I believe during the Obama administration. Service to our country is something I feel is important so I applied to at least see if there was a fit.When I got to the phone screen, I made a point to ask if recreational cannabis would disqualify you from joining and they confirmed that yes, even if it was recreationally used, a positive cannabis result on a drug test would disqualify you.Major bummer, but unsurprising. The entire reason I asked was due to how many posts on HN I’ve seen about government agencies having a hard time hiring tech folks for this reason. I have what I believe to be a decently desirable skillset and a lot of tangible experience working in startups AND enterprise companies, and if I had to guess, would have brought some good value to the team.I hope (but doubt) these policies have relaxed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I believe they have overestimated the cost of using 3.5&#34; floppies, probably to make themselves look better by comparison.They give the cost as $211,172, but that&#39;s the cost to buy a 1 TiB pack of floppies. Their own storage cost is per-month, so to get the equivalent cost for floppies you need to also divide by the expected useful lifetime of a floppy disk. I did a web search for &#34;floppy disk lifetime&#34; and the internet [1] told me &#34;I’ve seen numbers saying the lifespan of floppy disks is three to five years. But I’ve also seen numbers that claim they can last ten to twenty years or even indefinitely.&#34;If you assume floppy disks have an expected lifetime of 5 years, you can amortise the cost across that time, bringing the cost per TiB-month down to a nice reasonable $3,520.[1] https://blog.storagecraft.com/data-storage-lifespan/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You can remember that there was a vibrant community of Flash game developers before the demise of Flash (EOL December 2020, the date of its “demise” is debatable). There’s not really a replacement for Flash and the community kind of fragmented.That said, my impression is that a big chunk of talent from the Flash community went to work on HaXe. These are people who make games and want tools to make game development easier—as opposed to people who get excited about engines, architectural patterns, and programming languages. Just as a general impression, based on people I’ve recognized working with HaXe."</p>

Haxe is a pretty cool language, it&#39;s similar to TypeScript but compiles to native binaries for almost all major game consoles.Heaps was apparently the framework behind Dead Cells if that says anything about the level of polish you can accomplish with this set of tools."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you are new to the Haxe or game development world I would advise against Heaps as the documentation is pretty bare bones. Haxeflixel [0] is one that is prominently recommended for good reason. Heaps is still great regardless and I have used it for a few private projects.

They may or may not allow whatever arbitrary JS you have on the page. They may even intentionally give you bad data (e.g. hijack the payload to give you intentionally malformed data).edit: even more broadly speaking, there&#39;s additional reasons why you can&#39;t expect to receive these kinds of callbacks: consider what happens if a user loses connectivity between loading the page and them navigating away (e.g. their phone loses service because they went into an elevator before navigating away)"</p>
