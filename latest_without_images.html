								<p class="story__comment_others">"Granular control over requests is completely lost in Manifest V3.For example, with Manifest V2 we can initiate a request from a content script after we begin listening for it from the background script, pass a single-use token in the Accept header, identify the request from the background script based on the token, remove the token from the Accept header and edit other headers before the request is sent to the server, then manipulate the response for that single request and stop listening from the background script.I use this workflow in Search by Image to grab an image from the page context when no CSP headers are present for the asset, and the image is only served if a certain cookie and referrer is sent. This will no longer be possible to achieve with the current API of Manifest V3. Extensions used for page archival will also be impacted.Manifest V3 removes a robust toolset that content blockers can use the react to all evasion techniques ad companies implement, and the rest of the extension ecosystem will be part of the fallout."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the interesing things about this story is that there appears to be no consideration of not &#34;updating&#34; to a new Chrome version.  The idea of user choice in &#34;updating&#34; is completely absent.  Why cannot a user say, &#34;V3 sounds wonderful but I will stick with V2, thank you.&#34;  A user has a version of a program that works for that user (e.g., with uBlock Origin), and Google can apparently forcibly stop that user from using that working version, through a process of &#34;automatic updates&#34;.  Users must &#34;accept&#34; updates which makes one wonder Google can pull this off.  Does it not rely on user behaviour.  By accepting every &#34;update&#34; without question, the user is effectively consenting to being controlled.Perhaps users will someday &#34;wake up&#34; to realise that so-called updates are not necessarily being remotely installed for their benefit, but for the benefit of someone else.  No doubt Google has some parallel construction type explanation why users need V3, but how many folks cannot see that they are letting the fox guard the henhouse.Perhaps if ads can be blocked, so too can updates.  (IME, it&#39;s possible.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Now is the perfect time for Open Source maintainers to become legible to the big companies that depend on them—and that want to get more out of them—and send them five-to-six figure invoices.Well, this is exactly what I&#39;ve been doing around VideoLAN (VLC, x264) and FFmpeg for the last few years. In order to do that, I&#39;ve created 2 official companies Videolabs and FFlabs (besides the non-profit orgs) and I&#39;ve gone through all the hoops to get paid (PO, billing, invoices, registering to large companies is a lot of paperwork, tbh, but well..) and we try and bill small to large companies that depends on those projects.And FFmpeg and x264 are the core of the online video.So I did exactly what Filippo is saying we should do.But the result is really not impressive. Seriously, asking for money for support from those companies feels like we&#39;re pulling the nails, even if their full business depends on it. Getting 30-50k$ from those companies for support for one year can be very challenging, long or leading to nowhere at all.So, large SV companies and startup should also start agreeing to pay for open source, when it&#39;s the core of the tech."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m an open source author and maintainer of a somewhat-popular python package[0] (~1M downloads/month) that I&#39;ve maintained for over 10 years. I don&#39;t recall ever receiving a donation. I am still maintaining it, but I just don&#39;t have time to add the improvements that it needs to keep up with the ecosystem (asyncio, for example). If organizations who use it got together and chipped in some non-negligible amount, I would be much more serious about keeping up with it, but $0, or $5-20/month, is just not realistic incentive to compete with other priorities in my life. I don&#39;t know the answer, but that&#39;s my thought process.0. https://github.com/amoffat/sh"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Once upon a time, the best way to get a software job was to demonstrate your ability to build useful open source projects.  10 years ago the Principal Engineers I would work with had super sized open source portfolio&#39;s which leant them both credibility and experience building products people liked.  Junior devs would search (sometimes in vain) for issues where they could contribute a few PRsNow the best way to get a job is leet code, leet code, and more leet code.  Rather than spending  &lt;5 hours a week working with real code and producing real value on open source projects - most career minded engineers will simply focus on leetcode.Not many people patch esoteric software that&#39;s been around for 10+ years because it&#39;s particularly fun or because there is specific business value in it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a project I&#39;ve been working on to create decentralized, peer to peer, &#34;serverless&#34; websites using several technologies including webtorrent, dmt (mutable torrent BEP-46), and handshake decentralized domains.You can create either an immutable (uneditable) torrent site, or you can create a ed25519 keypair and create a mutable (updatable) torrent site.This is great for blogging, whistle blowing, and other things.  It also scales well since torrent technology is great although it had previous been pigeonholed to other use cases.Please give it a try and let me know your thoughts!  I don&#39;t take any credit for this since I just weaved the great technologies others already made together!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a fantastic work!The best part of Federalist is reading and displaying the websites from BitTorrent using BEP-46. The Handshake part is less impressive for me personally, since it basically reads Handshake values from a service (query.hdns.io/dns-query).If Federalist adds a Handshake daemon, it will be much more decentralized, but at the same time much heavier on resources.For historical perspective, decentralized websites (or p2p websites) are here since like 20 years. Here&#39;s a super concise list of what I recall off the top of my head.- Freenet is the first project I&#39;m aware of doing that- ENS+IPFS websites is a strong movement now (see esteroids.eth.limo, I&#39;m a co-creator of this)- ZeroNet was going strong like 5 years ago, and even though it&#39;s less popular now it&#39;s still functional and a nice project.- Agregor browser brings decentralized website the Hypercore (a successor of DAT protocol)- BitTorrent was supposed to have a project especially for decentralized websites (Maelstrom web browser), but it didn&#39;t took off eventually- Magnetico is a search engine built on top of BitTorrent, very similar to Federalists, but without the Handshake part.- Skynet is a project meant almost only for decentralized websites, based on Sia. They have integration with ENS, and afaik, also with Handshake (check it out!)- Swarm, Namecoin etc. could also be used for decentralized websites. I saw some people doing demos with it, but can&#39;t recall any links/names atm."</p>

There&#39;s room enough for all players to take their credit for their part in this existing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ironically, on a previous team I had switched our log4j2 log formats over to %m{nolookups} like 8 months ago... I didn&#39;t realize the whole jndi issue, what we ran into was the O(n^2) behavior of its string substitution.While deploying an ancillary change, our jvms started locking up for minutes on end. What was happening was that we were logging customer input, and the change caused it to run certain things in parallel, which ended up logging the data multiple times. Normally the extra logging didn&#39;t matter but one customer had data like &#34;${foo} ${bar} ${baz} ...&#34;. Even when the ${foo} portion is replaced wothout modification, this triggers quadratic behavior. So we were already potentially vulnerable to the DOS but it was rare enough that we never got locked up until logging the string multiple times, which then overflowed log4js internal buffer and blocked worker threads.You can try this yourself by just logging a string like &#34;${}${}${}...&#34; And in fairly short order it starts taking forever. I&#39;m very glad the fix in 2.15 is to disable lookups by default.I hope that in the time after I left, the security org at the big tech company I worked at and reported this to (as I thought it was - a dos vector, not the complete pwnage it actually was) forced teams to switch to nolookups. Otherwise a lot of people had a bad week forcing updates through..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There seems to be a misunderstanding here. We have on the one side a garbage feature that should never have been implemented - but if you want to keep it for backwards compatibility, sure. But then we have log4j scanning all values instead of only format strings - I think it can be argued that this behavior is a critical bug and was never intended to begin with. It seems to have only come about because whoever implemented the JNDI stuff lost their bearing in the absurd class hierarchies and abstractions in log4j.Of course the last part holds the solution for our backwards compatibility issue. Remove the JNDI nonsense from the default package and move it into an extension package. Whoever wants to keep it can just add that to their dependencies and continue to enjoy logging functions that sometimes also make network connections and block your program."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I get that this is a big deal (any remote code execution that is prevalent is a big deal).But one thing that I haven&#39;t seen mentioned enough is that this only affects pretty old versions of java.From https://www.veracode.com/blog/security-news/urgent-analysis-...    JVM version - if lower than:
        Java 6 – 6u212 (java6 first released in 2006, this version appears unreleased?)
        Java 7 – 7u202 (java7 first released in 2011 this version appears unreleased?)
        Java 8 – 8u192 (from 2018)
        Java 11 - 11.0.2 (from 2019)

The current version of java is java17. Anything running on 17 or 14 (the last major release) isn&#39;t vulnerable.Now, I get that major version upgrades are a hassle, but I haven&#39;t seen anyone address the &#34;hey, you should have upgraded&#34; elephant in the room.(All java release dates from https://www.java.com/releases/ )"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You need to speak with a qualified domain name attorney, not just any attorney or solicitor.As Director of a domain name protection company (and not an attorney) I can offer this:If you registered the domain name before the other party files for a trademark, then there is no way you would have known that they would file for the mark. So, in most cases you probably don’t have to give up the domain name. It comes down to whether or. Or you registered the domain “in bad faith” or not. And again, how would you know they would start their business and get a trademark? You wouldn’t.Are you in the same industry and compete with each other? If so, there might be an issue, but I’d your site offers different products and there would be no confusion between companies or websites, then there may not be an issue.The best way to handle this is to get a domain name attorney to respond to their letter to you, essentially telling them to go away, and that you plan on keeping the domain name.If you cannot afford an attorney, look for a company that offers domain name insurance or a domain name warranty, if you have an issue like this with your domain name, your legal fees to defend the domain are covered.As you have described the situation here, you bought the domain before they filed for their trademark, and you’re not pretending to be them. So you should be able to keep the domain. They are just trying to “ strong arm” the domain away from you with a threatening letter. If they do sue you or file a udrp, defend yourself with the help of a good domain name attorney."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a 4 letter domain name. A stock photo company trademarked the name and then threatened to sue to force transfer. However, I registered the domain before they registered the trademark. I looked up the ICANN rules and saw I had priority. Pointed out the ICANN rule and told to go away. They did.IANAL; this is not legal advice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While this is definitely a bunch a hot air, unfortunately they could frivolous sue you to simply win on financial grounds alone (in particular they could sue you in a location where the cost of travel would be expensive and if you ignored it they get a default judgement, or sue you in both state &amp; federal courts for slightly different things and drown you in legal costs).I&#39;d evaluate what your endgame is. If your endgame is to keep the domain then I&#39;d get a lawyer in order to make it clear that you will respond to legal challenges (and, yes, the bill is going to run up). If you were willing to sell, for a price, then you should try to figure out how much a legal challenge would cost them and set a price a bit higher than that.Is it fair? Absolutely not, but the US legal system is set up so that those with the deepest pockets often win. It isn&#39;t a fair fight for normal citizens, and even having the law on your side is often not enough because it is a financial battle more than a legal one.Either way may be wise to lawyer up today, either for a better selling price, cause them to back off entirely, or move it into the &#34;bury you with costs&#34; phase of bullying."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Craig Murray, friend of Julian Assange, was just released from a Scottish prison for the crime of jigsaw identification of some of the accusers in the trial of former First Minister, Alex Salmond despite the fact that many journalists from mainstream media had published information that allowed their readers to identify some of the accusers explicitly.So it&#39;s not just a problem of dictatorships in second or third world countries. But then again, maybe it is.https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article&#39;s framing of the problem (increased authoritarianism, decreased tolerance for reporting) leaves a lot to be desired without more evidence. The evidence is:- A small increase in total jailed journalists (roughly matching world population growth, and the delta is a small discrete count which would yield large error bounds)- Specific examples of horrific events (matching atrocities that governments have been more than willing to commit in 2020, 2019, 2018, ...)Without looking at longer time scales (e.g., over the last 10-20 years journalist jailings significantly outpace population growth) or providing some justification for why circumstances have changed and we would expect journalist jailings to not pace population growth (e.g., if there are significantly fewer journalists per capita (not sure if that&#39;s true, just hypothetically)), a story that matches the evidence better is that lots of countries were horrible to journalists in years past and they&#39;re repeating that bad behavior now.To be clear, that&#39;s not saying that the overall problem shouldn&#39;t be fixed or even that their framing isn&#39;t correct, but...it&#39;s not exactly hard to provide evidence that _actually_ backs up their claim; why wouldn&#39;t they?"</p>

It&#39;s a free event, held in either Gothenburg or Stockholm. On the 9th of December every year.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In case you have not seen it, there is a very interesting video series by Clickspring about building an Antikythera Mechanism with tools that were abailable at that time. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZioPDnFPNsHnyxfygxA0...The tl;dw is that it was possible to build it with tools that were probably available, but some tools are specialized enough to guess that they had already build other similar devices. The final IRL reconstructed device is very nice. It&#39;s a long serie (10 episodes of 15 minutes each + some additional videos with even more details in other playlist) but it&#39;s worth watching."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think we tend to underestimate what ancient technology could produce because we forget that in ancient times they often operated on longer timescales than we do.With our technology for example we could make all the parts for the Antikythera mechanism in a short time. The ancient Greeks definitely had no technology that would have allowed them to do that, so we see the existence of the Antikythera mechanism as a great mystery.But I don&#39;t see any reason to believe that the Greeks built it in a short time. It could easily be the lifework of the builder, or even the lifework of successive generations of a family of builders.If you need to make a very precise gear in a day you need our technology. If you need to make a very precise gear in 50 years you just need someone with an abrasive that is harder than the material you are making the gear from."</p>

If the seller is not using Amazon for their logistics then they simply can&#39;t guarantee the time window so they don&#39;t add a prime badge?From a customer point of view it would make for a worse shopping experience if Prime items weren&#39;t  fulfilled by Amazon"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Doesn&#39;t seem this will hold any ground if Amazon decides to fight it...FBA products have a clear competitive advantage: free shipping for Prime customers, fast and reliable shippings, easy returns, a networks of lockers so you don&#39;t have to wait for the package at home (in Italy packages have to be handed to a person, they can&#39;t be left in the front yard unattended).Marketplace products have longer and unreliable shippings, you need to pay extra even if you are Prime customer, customer services is usually subpar, customer protection is inferior and so on...There&#39;s not an abuse, they offer a better service, they get better business."</p>

I feel like it steals your attention and mindshare day after day. The ads I see on TV now (rarely, as I don&#39;t watch live TV much) are just so horrible. Dripping with emotions and trying to tug on your heartstrings to sell some toilet bowl cleaner or some other garbage.Social media. I feel like if it weren&#39;t for these algorithms that prioritize &#34;engagement&#34; over facts and polite content, my country would be a bit less polarized. I think that social media will turn out to be like cigarettes and someday we will discover that it has an extremely bad outcome; at least how it&#39;s implemented today. I have come to enjoy HN a bit more lately, as I just don&#39;t engage with the trolls or the horrible people that have opinions I disagree with vehemently. The people I think are horrible, at least, because it&#39;s a personal opinion, and other&#39;s might view me as a horrible person. I have also learned that it&#39;s best not to judge someone by one or two views overall, here, and that helps. I wish more social media could be like HN and allow a diverse set of opinions, but ban the name-calling and such that really take things into a bad place.Most products today are less durable and are generally worse than &#34;yesterday&#34;, in my opinion. Perhaps it&#39;s the old man in me coming out, with a rosy view of yesteryear, but I think that the quality of things are just lower, in general. I do think that things &#34;look nicer&#34; and are more consistent, but at a lower level of quality. 20 years ago, I had only 5 or so choices for any given product, maybe a curtain rod for example (because I just bought some). Today I can go down to several stores and pick from hundreds of curtain rod designs that look really nice, but half of them break after a few years or less. I still have some shitty looking but sturdy curtain rods from 20 years ago, no joke. Electronics are worse in some ways, but faster and more complex, so maybe that complexity is the source of the decrease in perceived quality. I can say that computers are way faster now, and it&#39;s easier to do many things, but I have less freedom than I had with older computers for sure.This is just about the end of my old man rant. Thanks for listening.&#34;The important thing was that I had an onion on my belt...&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think there is an &#39;optimum&#39; level for technology of all kinds, below that you really want more and it is clear that there is room for improvement. But once the optimum has been reached any further additions will degrade the experience.Examples:Car controls:  pre: direct taps and gauges plumbed into engine parts and such, real switches and levers. 
  optimum: does what it should, not more, not less, more reliable than the old stuff, easy to fix and relatively cheap to fabricate
  too much: touchscreens. For everything.

(ICE) Car electronics:  pre: carburettors, bad winter starts, bad fuel consumption, pollution
  optimum: EFI, highly reliable, aftermarket parts interchangeable between brands
  too much: DRM on everything, parts won&#39;t even fit same model a year older, are ridiculously expensive and unreliable to boot

TV:  pre: two channels, black and white, bad image quality, crappy small screens
  optimum: 20 channels or so, in a way already more than you can consume, good quality color image, fairly easy to see screens (say, up to 3&#39; across).
  too much: wall-to-wall screens that intrude on your privacy every chance they can, inability to build up your own collection of content (DRM), pay *for ever* for the same stuff
  way too much: youtube.

CPUs:  pre: 8 bits, too slow for many applications, nice and better than an abacus though
  optimum: 1990s OS, very little eye candy, just enough to take the edge off, fast, and enough horsepower to do meaningful work
  too much: 2020 OS, nothing but eye candy, reduced functionality, telemetry, spyware, forced updates that are just as likely to improve things as they are to leave you stranded

and so on, you get the idea.Technology has and always will have a place in my life. But my car is a 1997 model that doesn&#39;t phone home to the factory, has buttons instead of menus, my phone is a Nokia, and so on. Technology is my slave, not my master."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Algo-paranoia.Every time I interact with a remotely &#34;clever&#34; system, I keep thinking how my input will feed some machine. How fast do I scroll, what is in my viewport. What do I listen to and when. Is this an A/B test? Will something I do on a whim affect that machine to predict something incredibly stupid tomorrow?It only became obvious recently, as I was readying an actual, physical book. The relief to realise that the publisher won&#39;t optimise the font based on how fast I turn the pages. And the disgust at that aspect of tech.And to what end?"</p>
