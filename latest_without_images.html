The road closure[0] on hwy 1 near Abbotsford/Chilliwack is a good one hour drive away from Vancouver core[1]. So while it sounds noteworthy for an entire city be technically flooded in, unless you were driving to the boonies, you&#39;re probably not actually impacted in any meaningful way.He also mentioned the weather cleared since yesterday, so floods should start to subside. You can follow the updates here[2][0] https://www.drivebc.ca/mobile/pub/events/id/DBC-35180.html[1] https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Vancouver,+BC,+Canada/Abbots...[2] https://www.drivebc.ca/#listView"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few years back, not too long ago, I started working on a new contract assignment at a medium size aerospace manufacturer.I show up and check in with IT department. The system administrator shows me to my desk, and hands me a post it note with my password.  Well pass phrase is more like it.  It was something like “sliding down the tall building”.I was quite impressed that they encouraged the use of long pass phrases instead of short cryptic passwords that are hard to remember (think “correct horse battery staple”).  This place really is serious about security, I thought.I thanked the system admin and causally said “I’ll be sure to change this to an equally secure pass phrase”.“Oh no,” he said, “we don’t allow people to change their passwords here. You see, we need to be able to log into anyone’s computer if they go on vacation or are out of the office, so we keep an Excel worksheet with everyone’s username and password. So please don’t change your password.”He turns and walks away, and I just sit there stunned, wondering if this was some kind of practical joke.Sadly he was completely serious.  I kept the password they gave me for the 3 months I was there, as I was asked to do, knowing that at any time someone could log in as me and do something illegal or unethical. It really did give me a bit of anxiety."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A great example of how much thought has gone into this can be seen with this paragraph: &#34;Avoid giving directions like ‘none of the above’, as this implies a visual reference that may not be relevant for users of screen-reading software. Instead, use ‘none of these’ or similar.&#34;That&#39;s not something I would have thought of straight away, and it&#39;s a great reminder of how important accessibility is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Whenever I see a blog post like this about the gov.uk design system I think about the millions of person-minutes small changes like this must save. My wife is Spanish and whenever I have to interact with Spanish bureaucracy it&#39;s like night and day. (This is partially to do with the inherited culture in each bureaucracy - we needed a certified translation of our marriage certificate, and the translator told us that the consulate had put the wrong email address on their website for her. She spent so long trying to get them to update it on their website that eventually she gave in and created the incorrect email address so she could pick up the emails that people were sending)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Last year while working on some public opinion polling software I ran into an issue where I found that analysts often wanted to know the difference between someone selecting &#34;None&#34;, someone skipping the question, or someone not being asked the question due to branch logic. It&#39;s a pretty easy problem to solve -- if you represent the response as a string, you use &#34;None&#34;, &#34;&#34;, and &#34;Not Asked&#34;; if you represent as numeric, you just set numeric codes for each. But the interesting thing is just that it&#39;s sort of an invisible distinction until you think about it, just like this one is. I don&#39;t really do a lot of UX stuff myself and it was kind of a cool moment to have to think about it a little."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love this story, but for somewhat different reasons than most.It highlights that the true business driver is that personal interconnectedness: author&#39;s friend had good relationships with both restaurant managers and drivers. This is what has allowed an MVP to be successful, not the kludgy &#34;product&#34;.Sure, this product still needed to be built for people to be willing to continue to work together, but businesses of the sort have survived for years on spreadsheets and similar &#34;implementations&#34;.Some of these constraints do not hold on the internet, but you still need to catch the attention of the right folk to get that word-of-mouth moving (which is why we see so many &#34;Show HN&#34; posts here: there&#39;re plenty of people here who can do that for others)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Okay folks! Jumping in to thank everyone for reading my story. I really didn&#39;t expect it to resonate with so many and I am so happy (and slightly terrified) that it did. Wow!Main reason I wrote it was to keep reminding myself that resources, and especially time, are limited. As a developer, it&#39;s easy to spend all your time on your pet project and think it&#39;s free and there&#39;s no harm. I fall for that all the time. But it&#39;s never free and yes, there is actual harm. Think of all the other projects you never launched. All the moments with loved ones you never had.Using creativity instead of all your time is just like using an elegant algorithm* instead of brute-forcing it.Notes:* I am a (primarily) front-end developer, don&#39;t know a single algorithm** Thanks @jeremylevy for sharing my story here, I would never dare to"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like this story but I must say it leaves me with more questions than answers. How did he get restaurants to sign on and trust him enough to prepare food for 1 month without payout? Assuming &#34;based on existing relationships&#34; I have to wonder his former employer didn&#39;t care about taking his rolodex and directly poaching customers? What about couriers? How did they handle &#34;no couriers available&#34; or a spike in demand? If someone places a delivery order and it turns out there&#39;s no one to deliver it in the next hour, that&#39;s a problem. What about disputes, refunds, missing items, &#34;this isn&#39;t what I ordered&#34; etc.? The all-cash nature of the business makes clear this was not a US based business where that would likely have been a non-starter.Very cool story but it&#39;s hard for me to really understand it without knowing how the business actually worked and made money. I assume it was a very different market from USA and so economics are very different (cheaper labor, less regulation etc.). Would love to know the name of the business to see the outcome."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Did anyone else read this article and feel like it is a lot of words to say very little? I feel like the core of the article can be summarized into this:Air transport is still more expensive than shipping. But the magnitude is less than it used to be. This is because shipping is seeing bottlenecks and surcharges to handle the bottlenecks. Therefore it makes the more expensive air transport ok to use especially with time sensitive holiday purchases coming up.If that sounds right, almost all that comes from the last few sentences in the article."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Air cargo is suddenly affordable relative to ocean shippingI would say ocean shipping is now as exorbitant as air cargo, or more so."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I ordered an M1 Max the day after it was announced. It&#39;s supposed to arrive today. The route it took to get to Portland, Oregon, was Shanghai to Zhenzhou (where it spent a week), on to South Korea, then Anchorage, then a weekend in Louisville, Kentucky. How this makes any sense in terms of efficiency is totally beyond me.As a side note, I&#39;m mildly paranoid about new Apple devices spending a week held up in Chinese customs. Is the CCP throttling exports, or installing backdoors?"</p>

Fair enough, legally speaking, if you are the copyright holder.However, in the DMCA itself HackerRank asks for the removal of entire repositories, claiming &#34;the whole repository is infringing copyright as it contains the solution&#34;. This is a blatant lie, HackerRank is not an automatic copyright holder of any solutions to a problem they published."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My GitHub repo is on this list https://github.com/egfx/React-LeaderboardI was dumbfounded to receive this message yesterday. I made this project over 3 years ago and I didn’t even know about hacker rank at that time. This project was made because I was seeking a contract job and they asked me to create a leaderboard in react which i did with no code copying whatsoever. I implemented it in react hooks which wasn’t natively built into react so I used preact which had the newest feature set. If anything did hackerrank use my work to seed their tests? I see that as the likelihood. Also it could be because I used the text copy from the contracting job that asked me to create a leaderboard in the readme. In truth it could be either but this has become yet another pitch fork into a very difficult time where I have no job or money to do anything."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Goals masquerading as strategy is an incredibly common problem. Good Strategy Bad Strategy is my favorite treatment of the problem. Unfortunately a lot of executives don’t like to be told they are suppose to take responsibility for strategy. Here is an article length version from the author: https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-cor..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of my issues with OKRs is the oft-repeated line that the goals should be so audacious that you should only expect to achieve about 70% of them.If you&#39;re following this advice, you are either purposefully choosing goals that you do not know how to achieve, which is a problem, or purposefully choosing goals whose achievement relies on way too many externalities over which you have little control, which is a problem.I&#39;m not saying external factors shouldn&#39;t be considered, or that we should only set goals that are within comfortable reach.Rather, I&#39;m saying the uncertainty should be accounted for differently. It should be baked into our goals, not treated as if it only matters at the OKR level.Imagine if you were to plan a sprint, and your story points did not factor in uncertainty at all. Then, you committed to a sprint size that also did not take into account uncertainty. But your stakeholders agreed that a 30% sprint failure rate was acceptable.Now imagine baking in uncertainty into your estimates and then committing to a sprint size you can realistically hit. Add stretch goals if you want. Doesn&#39;t that seem more sensible?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think of Steven Covey&#39;s &#34;Begin with the End in Mind&#34;.There really are some metrics that are strategic.  But when your manager is asked to have 20 OKRs just because your manager has to have 20 OKRs and then you get asked to have 20 OKRs that is a distraction.(In terms of strategy there might be one thing or three things you REALLY need to do.)At one place I worked I was expected to create OKRs for my own personal and professional development and I felt offended by it because it was out of phase with my own needs.Today I do a lot for personal and professional development and it is highly strategic,  it&#39;s motivated by being better at what I do for work but also about getting the social opportunities I want and where I think technology is going over the next ten years.Because it is strategic I am continuously finding that a project I started a year ago has given me exactly the resource I need right now for a situation I had no idea I&#39;d be in.Like hell I need to fill out a form in some artificial format for my boss about it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"NVIDIA, Intel and AMD sit on the ISO C++ and ISO Fortran standard committees. They voted GPU support into the C++ 2017 and Fortran 2018 ISO standards. While NVIDIA implemented this YEARS ago, almost 5 years after these ISO standards were voted in, Intel and AMD have not even announced a plan for implementing GPU support for ISO standard languages on their GPUs.Instead, Intel and AMD strategy is pushing applications to &#34;rewrite CUDA with HIP/OneAPI&#34;, which are not real standards and are no more portable than CUDA. The people claiming that they are &#34;open&#34;, probably also think that OpenACC is an open standard, even though it mostly only runs on NVIDIA GPUs.If you care about portable GPU code, unfortunately, NVIDIA is the only vendor that actually delivers.You can take your standard conforming C++ code _today_, not a single line of CUDA, OpenMP, OpenACC, etc. and the nvidia compiler compiles it and runs it on GPUs and multi-core CPUs. You can also take your normal Python NumPy code and run it on NVIDIA GPUs &#34;as is&#34; without changes.It doesn&#39;t get any more portable than that.I don&#39;t understand how there are so many people in these threads that apparently care about portability happy about AMD and Intel rewriting open source applications in their proprietary vendor-specific technologies, instead of angry about them pushing their proprietary technologies, instead of implementing GPU support for ISO standard languages, just like NVIDIA does."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s good that AMD is providing support for some of their customers since OpenCL is being removed in 3.0. I hope that this is just the start of far greater investment into their software ecosystem. It was understandable that AMD invested less in drivers and support software when they were almost bankrupt but that excuse is drying up. There are rumors that future AMD GPU architectures will be quite good and it would be a shame for that advantage to be wasted by a lack of software support."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Glad to hear it. We&#39;re going on 10 years since Blender notionally got OpenCL support, I bought an AMD GPU on that basis, found out that the &#34;OpenCL support&#34; was so thoroughly dismal that it was slower than my CPU, sold my AMD card, ate the ebay fees, bought an NVidia card, ate the green tax, and got on with my work.I had to repeat that lesson a few years later with deep learning code before it stuck.Hopefully this time is different. I&#39;m cautiously optimistic... but I&#39;ll let someone else be the guinea pig."</p>
