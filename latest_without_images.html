								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I mean, at this point I think everyone should just accept that at the very least their name, age, address(es), email(s), phone number(s) and screen name(s) have been fully leaked if you have ever had any kind of online presence. Not saying that&#39;s right or good, but at this point it&#39;s just a fact.So if that&#39;s the case, I think we should move beyond really even trying to think of this info as private or a marker of identity, and we need to move everyone to more secure forms of identity verification.As has been pointed out on HN before, &#34;identity theft&#34; is a made-up concept to make it seem as if you had something stolen from you, when the real problem is banks and other service providers do an absolute shit job of identity verification. They&#39;re the ones at fault, and they try to shift the onus onto you to fix things when they screw up.Indeed, a social security number is pretty much the only additional piece of data to the stuff above that one would need to open up a bank account in someone else&#39;s name, and those have been leaked plenty of times too.The government needs to make harsher penalties for banks and others that can ruin your credit, etc. because they accept all this leaked info as &#34;proof&#34; of identity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The root of the problem is not the privacy policy or the system security.  The root of the problem is the collection itself.  All large businesses, health care providers, and governments maintain databases.  Every one of them will eventually be leaked.  All it takes is a corruptible trusted insider."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks like this is the &#34;To match users to their friends by phone number, you need an API which can take as input a phone number, and return information about if that number has an associated account&#34; problem.There is no way to let a user find their friends on a service without such an API.   Yet if you have such an API, someone can simply brute force all phone numbers worldwide (there are only 10^10), and now they have a database of all users...Rate limits can help defend, but considering many users might have 1000 phone numbers in their address book, you can&#39;t set the rate limit very low without impacting user experience.  Attackers can reduce the search space dramatically by only checking phone numbers that resolve to an active line (using VoIP stuff to test a number).The only real solution is for your app not to have a &#34;Here is a list of your friends already in the app&#34; screen...   But as you can imagine that means you won&#39;t get any user growth or VC funding..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The world desperately needs a replacement for YAML.TOML is fine for configuration, but not an adequate solution for representing arbitrary data.JSON is a fine data exchange format, but is not particularly human-friendly, and is especially poor for editable content: Lacks comments, multi-line strings, is far too strict about unimportant syntax, etc.Jsonnet (a derivative of Google&#39;s internal configuration language) is very good, but has failed to reach widespread adoption.Cue is a newer Jsonnet-inspired language that ticks a lot of boxes for me (strict, schema support, human-readable, compact), but has not seen wide adoption.Protobuf has a JSON-like text format that&#39;s friendlier, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s widely adopted, and as I recall, it inherits a lot of Protobufisms.Dhall is interesting, but a bit too complex to replace YAML.Starlark is a neat language, but has the same problem as Dhall. It&#39;s essentially a stripped-down Python.Amazon Ion [1] is neat, but I&#39;ve not seen any adoption outside of AWS.NestedText [2] looks promising, but it&#39;s just a Python library.StrictYAML [3] is a nice attempt at cleaning up YAML. But we need a new language with wide adoption across many popular languages, and this is Python only.Any others?[1] https://amzn.github.io/ion-docs/[2] https://nestedtext.org/[3] https://github.com/crdoconnor/strictyaml/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"YAML had a worse example, once.For the ease of entering time units YAML 1.1 parsed any set of two digits, separated by colons, as a number in sexagesimal (base 60). So 1:11:00 would parse to the integer 4260, as in 1 hour and 11 minutes equals 4260 seconds.Now try plugging MAC addresses into that parser.The most annoying part is that the MAC addresses would only be mis-parsed if there were no hex digits in the string. Like the bug in this post, it could only be reproduced with specific values.Generally, if you&#39;re doing implicit typing, you need to keep the number of cases as low as possible, and preferably error out in case of ambiguity."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is important to keep in mind when you read articles and/or studies about how electric cars or wind or solar power is impractical. A lot of the data these studies use is just obsolete.Say you have an opinion piece in a news paper that says that electric cars will always be expensive toys for the rich. It relies on a scientific paper published in a technical journal 2 years ago. The scientific paper does not perform original research but relies on a study published 2 years ago, which study relies on official data reported by companies six months before publication.Perhaps nobody in this propagation chain meant to mislead. But in the end they are using old data that assumes that battery costs are five times what they are in reality and twenty times what they will be in the near future (for example) and draws all the wrong conclusions.Similar things are happening with articles and public comments about renewable energy. There are numerous arguments about how we will always need coal power or nuclear power, or natural gas and they all base it on old studies with obsolete high costs of batteries. These articles commit a further error by also neglecting the every decreasing costs of solar and wind power. These articles are even more egregious because while a car lasts only 10-15 years a power plant is supposed to last at least 30 (for coal or gas) and up to 60 (for nuclear). Furthermore, nuclear plants take 5 to 10 years to even build. In those years the costs of batteries and renewables will only go down further.In the financial press there were many articles about how Tesla will never be profitable, how it is an extravagant way for shareholders to subsidize luxury car buyers, how it will always rely on government subsidies and will need more of them, etc. Well, guess what the federal tax credit expired and lo and behold tesla is profitable.They weren&#39;t necessarily lying. But they were using automotive industry assumptions, and the auto industry with their internal combustion engines is a mature industry with few opportunities for cost reductions. But as far as batteries and electric motors and power semiconductors go ... well we are just getting started on them and hopefully we will have many opportunities for cost reductions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s remarkable what energy dense batteries have enabled. Drones and the entire quadcopter scene wouldn’t be possible without them.Some maneuvers made on a 5” quad can pull more than 100 amps on a 6S, 22V battery. That is around 2,200 watts—more than most consumer microwave ovens! The fact that a battery weighing no more than half a kilogram can supply this much power almost instantly is truly remarkable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FYI, the cost of individual cells has long, long gone below $100 per kWh in wholesale volumes.And believe the cost of a pack itself is very quickly approaching $100/kWh as well if not crossed it already.Making batteries is still a rather profitable business with double digit margins, it&#39;s just latest equipment, and cathode materials became way more expensive, and hard to get than what small battery makers can afford.Despite China dominating the metallic cobalt supply chain, the cathode materials market are dominated by Japanese chemical companies, and I suspect some form of collusion is there.With cathode being the most expensive part of the lithium battery cell, it&#39;s hard to fathom how a free market price for it can be many times the cost of input materials for years on end."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Preview is one of the most underrated pieces of software in the world today.I make the assumption that Quicklook uses Preview (because surely it must).Being able to hit spacebar on just about any kind of selected document/image type file and see a near instant look, multiple pages and all, is so important.  Once you don&#39;t have that (move to the Windows world), you realize how much you miss it.  And you can, with a small bit of effort, add capabilities for additional files such as Markdown.Being able to open a PDF or image in a fast, reliable native viewer, and even do some level of editing (such as quickly adding a signature!) is super useful.In terms of reliability, every time over the last 20 years (some distant, some recent) where I tried to live with a Linux desktop, things would stop working after a short while.  Meanwhile, I have lived on my 2014 MBP since 2014, going through multiple OS upgrades in place  - no wipes/reinstalls - and find it just as performant as ever.  It is in most use cases more performant than my 2017 _much_ higher spec Dell XPS 15 (in Windows or Linux boot mode).There are still some things I hate, #1 being that when I cmd-tab to a window which is minimized, it doesn&#39;t raise that window.  What is the f*cking point of cmd-tabbing to an application if you don&#39;t make its window visible!?  This I have never understood.  But generally speaking, macOS on Apple hardware is unmatched by any alternative."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;apt-get was a revolution when it was released in 1998 and it is still the best way to manage software today. brew is a mediocre replacement.While apt still isn&#39;t the best package manager (my heart belongs to pacman, no matter what the haters say), I completely agree that brew is a failed imitation. I wanted to use MacOS for the longest time, because I&#39;ve been told that it&#39;s a real &#34;Unix system&#34;. Brew has distilled my fears into a sobering reality. The &#34;advantages&#34; MacOS offers really comes down to eye-candy or slightly more consistent shortcut mapping, but none of this really matters to me when I can&#39;t use the software I want, and the OS is always second-guessing my authority. Maybe I&#39;ve been spoiled by Linux, but I don&#39;t understand the hype. Not even on my M1 Macbook Air."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From someone who tends to try this switch about once a year (because the lack of TLC the Mac was getting in the last 5 or so years was getting very very worrying - M1 feels like Apple actually care about the Mac again), I agree with a lot of these pain points. My biggest personal issues end up being (and these are super subjective!):- Preview on macOS is great and no other OS has anything remotely equivalent. First class PDF support, ability to easily annotate anything, makes basic PDF editing easy.- I&#39;m far too used to the macOS touchpad gestures, and emulating these on linux doesn&#39;t end up working well. There is an ongoing project for this but it&#39;s very Ubuntu-centric for now. I am hopeful this will help the whole ecosystem improve though! This is still a pain for me on a desktop because my work setup uses a touchpad as the pointer device.- it&#39;s nigh impossible to eliminate tearing on multimonitor setups with X11, and X11 doesn&#39;t support a mix of DPIs for displays without scaling tricks that make text look awful on the low-DPI displays. Wayland was promising here last time I tried, but Wayland itself still has a lot of rough edges for a desktop. Plus since last time I tried I have replaced my last low DPI monitor on my dev setup, so this ought to be a point I can ignore going forward :)- Finding a mail client I don&#39;t hate on linux is tricky. I&#39;ve never been able to get on with the console clients, and I actually quite like Mac Mail. Thunderbird is kinda okay.- My chosen password manager (1password) still has a fairly awful linux experience. This is getting better - they&#39;re producing a native app now. Said native app needs to support the local browser extensions though!- I like the various iCloud/multi device integration features for Apple OSes far too much. This is mostly relatively simple things, that produce disproportionate pain - eg cross-device copy+paste, browser tab syncing, bookmark syncing, etc. Yes, Firefox has Firefox Sync, and Chrome has it&#39;s own sync stuff too, but there&#39;s nothing as all-encompassing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Windows 95 is probably the oldest OS easily usable by young people. It&#39;s fascinating because:- It has established strong foundations about Windows UI. The Menu/Toolbar couple, scrollbars with a relative size, 3D buttons, start menu, toolbar...- The gap between Windows 3.1 (1992) and Windows 95 is insane.- It was beautifully coherent. Today, Windows 10 seems like a mess with different UI pieces from different universes: Modern UI, Windows Vista/7 era utilities, Windows XP/2003 config things and some older gems. Fun thing: open a Word document from a pendrive and unplug the pendrive, MS Word will show an error box from Win95 era, asking to insert the floppy in the drive.- When booting a VM or an old computer with classic Windows I feel &#34;at home&#34;. Our first family computer when I was a child was a Pentium II / Windows 98. I have strong reflexes with this kind of UI and I&#39;m faster with classic window and menus compared to my phone or a tablet with modern touch interface."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Recently I went through the attic and found an old laptop (120Mhz CPU, 32Mb RAM, low-RPM 810Mb HDD) with Win98 installed on in. To my amazement it could boot and start Excel and Word within 10sec. Compared to my workstation (20 cores + HT @ 2.5Ghz, 110Gb RAM, PCIe SSD) which takes upward of 40 sec to get to the desktop.Really makes one question the current state of software. Sure, Win7 has some more features, but imagine someone in 98 saying: &#34;we have a great idea for a new OS, it&#39;ll have more features than Win98 and it&#39;ll only take 4 times longer to boot if you are running it on a cluster of supercomputers, but those new features are gonna be worth it&#34; =PSidenote on the hardware side: The laptop had a hinge for the keyboard so you could raise it to a 20 degree angle, the CD/Floppy drive had the same connector as the battery so you could swap the drive for another battery if going on a trip. There were two sliding switches for backlight and speaker-volume. Access to the internals via a simple latch. It may have been a brick but it had interesting ideas.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_ThinkPad_760"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The contrast and distinction between the different UI elements is immediately obvious. No mistaking a button for static text, and vice-versa. Also, no hidden scrollbars or other auto-hiding UI elements that are difficult to discover and irritating to use even once you know about them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Unfortunately, disabling uPnP these days is too much of a hit to convenience, so I looked for other solutions.Don&#39;t do this, there is no good reason to run UPNP if you care about security, turn it off and learn to manage a firewall.If the author really cares, go one step further and replace the ISP owned router with something with more control.Finally, if one cares about the software one&#39;s NAS runs, build or buy from someone like TrueNAS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article focuses on the security issues surrounding his new NAS, and that&#39;s fine. But the problem isn&#39;t security. It&#39;s Trust.Consumers generally trust that manufacturers will follow Best Practices and that security is part of the deal: I pay you money, you give me a quality product that Just Works and is Secure.False.Products are made to be sold at a profit. You can imagine that some engineer at that company knows about this problem, put in a Jira bug for it and since it didn&#39;t affect overall functionality, and because the product needed to be released as soon as possible, they rejected the bug and sent it off.By default, we should NOT trust that things are Good and Secure. If we are security conscious, then it&#39;s on us as consumers to figure out how to mitigate these problems. Or is it?If I was this guy, I&#39;d box that thing up and send it back and give the company feedback as to why, and then I&#39;d show them this very blog post.The manufacturer probably won&#39;t care. They know that until the average consumer cares about security and knows how to mitigate problems it won&#39;t matter. And we all know that the average consumer, even of technical products, has security habits.Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I need to go take care of some security stuff on my boxes, this really got me thinking about it!  sudo passwd root

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Upon SSHing into the NAS and having a dig around the file system, I discovered a file that could be modified. /etc/upnp.json seems to contain a list of port forwarding rules. Thank you to Terramaster for providing root access to these at least. Simply change bEnable to 0 for whatever ports you don’t want exposed, reboot the NAS, and check the port forwarding rules.And don&#39;t forget to do all this each time the NAS updates. And pray to whatever entity you wish that auto-updates don&#39;t get enabled.Seriously, after a blunder like this, why not return the device and find a manufacturer you can trust?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am using an unofficial build of LineageOS 14.1 on my 6 year old tablet (Mi PAD 1 &#39;mocha&#39;). After using it for over a month, the ROM is amazingly stable.The earlier MiUi which the tablet shipped with (7.5.2 Android KitKat) had problems with memory management. For some reason, the 2GB RAM was partitioned into two parts, one for the OS and the other for the running apps. But LineageOS does not have this problem, and it is much quicker than when I bought it!I use FDroid to install apps and am very satisfied with it. NewPipe is excellent and videos can easily play at 1080p 60fps when earlier, the tablet used to lag on 480p videos.I have changed the governor to powersave and turned on doze mode. Amazingly, this 6 year old tablet can hold charge for over a week! Even when watching videos at 1080p, the device does not heat up.More power to the LineageOS team and XDADevelopers!EDIT: ROM version"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unfortunately, even if LOS supports my device (it does), it&#39;s not a viable solution anymore for me as a primary smartphone OS (even though I really appreciate some of its features -- used it for years on previous phones) due to SafetyNet.- Google Pay will stop working.
 - My banks&#39; (multiple) primary apps and pushTAN solutions will stop working.and that&#39;s two of the most important things I use my phone for nowadays. (Forced)  bank  MFA and payments. Also for voluntary MFA with andOTP of course, because I&#39;m not against MFA, just idiotic pushTANs.Ironically, devices which haven&#39;t had security fixes in 1 year (thanks for nothing, Sony) will also pass safetynet, and the mentioned apps&#39; vendors will still deem them &#34;secure&#34;.Android security past device release remains a joke. Solutions like LOS exist to keep devices running well past the pitiful life span OEMs allow for, but they have become unviable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;d argue differently. Congrats for having the courage to recognize your problem.The analogy that comes to mind is I&#39;ve been playing basketball in my local town, and now I&#39;ve gotten promoted to play in the big city. I now feel like a small fish in a big pond.If you enjoy software engineering, I&#39;d say, double down. Now that you&#39;re at the medium software company, seek mentorship and coaching from others.In addition, there might be more homework (hitting the gym sort of), things you also have to do on your own.It isn&#39;t going to feel good being humbled and I&#39;ve been there myself. But if you think about the goal as &#34;learning to get better&#34; than &#34;prove to others I am better&#34;, you&#39;ll have a better time walking through this challenge. This all comes from a person who is a PM.So some tactical thoughts of possible advice: 
1. Face the issues head on -&gt; take all the negative feedback on the code and rework the medium complexity task
2. Learn to unlearn bad habits. Yes, it&#39;s harder, but it comes with practice. 
3. Commit to maybe taking a course work online (maybe seek advice from others on what are good ones to address weaknesses you have)Hope this helps.BTW, you don&#39;t need to be able to code things the right way to be a PM. Coding is only one specific skill and not always necessary for a PM."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You could be suffering from impostor syndrome. This is the feeling that someone gets when they are in a role but feel like they aren&#39;t living up to it and don&#39;t belong there, even though they may not be doing anything wrong.I also have 10+ years in software development and have switched companies several times. Every place is very different in terms of how their architecture is set up and what&#39;s expected in a software solution. I&#39;ve been at my current job for only about six months, but there are a lot of nuances and things that have thrown me off in implementing various features and fixes.In some cases, I&#39;d start questioning whether or not I&#39;m taking the right approach or if I&#39;m even the right one for the role. Though, some of these things I would bring up with my manager who would either give me advice on ways I could understand their setup better or would give me reassurance that there&#39;s nothing fundamentally wrong with what I&#39;ve been doing. I&#39;d suggest you talk to your manager, too, because I get the feeling that we&#39;re in the same boat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A long time ago, I described what I did as a programmer, and my friend said &#34;Oh, so you get paid to learn?&#34; I thought about it, and agreed. Part of programming is learning.Sounds like you&#39;ve got a great opportunity to learn what you don&#39;t yet know: you already have a list of things you know you need to work on, a codebase, and a job. Do you think one or more of your co-workers would be willing to give you feedback?  Would you be willing to take time (maybe extra time, &#39;off the clock&#39;) to practice?If, e.g., hard-coding is where you&#39;re at, maybe something like working your way through &#39;Code Complete&#39; would be of help, but I would pair the reading with doing, as close to the company&#39;s codebase and personnel as makes sense.I&#39;ve heard tell of people who asked to be shifted to a lower-level position so they could work at the level they were comfortable with."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love tax law, honest to goodness, and the US&#39;s tax code is so fascinating. Regardless of the political/economic reasons why a tax law exists, so many of the rules are so oddly specific that upon reading them I find myself smiling trying to think of the situation that caused a specific law to be made.When I read these rules, I thought of a potentially amusing tax loophole with regards to the stolen property section:&gt;Stolen property. If you steal property, you must report its fair market value in your income in the year you steal it unless in the same year, you return it to its rightful owner.There&#39;s another rule[0] on the books that says interest-free loans to friends and family can have tax implications, but if your friend/family _steals_ the money from you and repays it later that year, they could potentially get a short-term, interest-free loan without incurring the tax implications. I&#39;d have to dig into the details to see if this would actually work out, but it&#39;s an entertaining thought exercise nonetheless.[0] https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7872"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A semi-related thing - in Poland there is a law stating that income from prostitution is not taxable.When some people tried to take advantage of that (to cover illegal income of other kind), they were audited to prove that the money actually comes from prostitution:- the family was asked whether the person was in fact a prostitute- the tax payer was asked to specify where the services were performed- if they said that these were performed at the client&#39;s flats, they were asked to specify the addresses (and names of clients) who might also be interviewed- if they said they did it from clubs and so on, the club owners were asked about it (and likely denied, as even if the people were in fact prostitutes, it is a criminal offense to profit from other people&#39;s prostitution)- if they said they did this at home, the neighbors were interviewed whether the prostitution did in fact take place at homeIn some cases they also rejected these income statements because based on the age and looks, the amount of money was much higher than the woman could have been paid.And if you appeal this decision, you&#39;ll likely get a court decision supporting the tax authority, saying that you are in fact an ugly prostitute and that you have to pay 75% taxes since the source of income was not determined."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yep, if you&#39;re a drug dealer and you don&#39;t want them to get you on tax evasion, make sure you report it.Or really any cash income.  You don&#39;t have to tell them where it came from.  You just tell them you got cash.  Like when you do a garage sale and want to be legit, you report it in the same place."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I read this article in full, and I have to say: Amen. This subject has a deeply personal meaning for me.I watched my wife go through similar things. Her stomach stopped working, and even with groundbreaking surgery and one of the top 10 gastroenterologists in the world at her side, nothing could be done. She tried to get treatments that she thought might help, until one day her GP just down the road finally told her what no doctor had the guts to say out loud: &#34;you&#39;re dying.&#34;That was a punch in the guts. That was late November 2019. She&#39;d just turned 45. She went on hospice care just 4 months later. Hospice care was the best medical care she&#39;d ever received. Finally she was in less pain (but still a lot of pain- starving to death is the opposite of pleasant). Finally able to have one on one care with a nurse who genuinely cared about her.She passed away at home in February 2021 at 46 year old. Nobody tried to violently resuscitate her. Nobody stuck tubes in bad places. Nobody caused her more suffering in order to prolong her suffering. The green paper on the wall said so. One of my own biggest fears was having our home invaded by EMT&#39;s and police, with EMT&#39;s shattering her frail body to try to save it. But that never happened.So, doctors have it right. Die in peace the old fashioned way, if possible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My Mom just passed two weeks ago from terminal cancer.The Monday ~2 weeks before she passed she was at the hospital, I asked her if this was all really what she wanted. She really wanted to change over to hospice and focus on palliative care.We began advocating for her to switch. She didn&#39;t have a ton of energy at the hospital to express/follow up on her wishes without someone there. The hospital seems like they would have erred on continuing treatment until all hope was exhausted. But once we began advocating for this want of her, the gears really shifted. She got all the morphine she wanted, and various other comfort measures. The palliative care team was driving the show. She was eventually able to go home for home hospice, and she had a final weekend of energy before passing Sunday before last.All to say, having an advocate that help you with your wishes when you&#39;re in a weakened state feels like it is pretty huge. I can&#39;t imagine what would have happened if me and my siblings weren&#39;t able to help her. She _might_ have been able to get what she wanted ultimately, but all the follow up, checking in, caretaking etc you really want to have someone there advocating for you."</p>
