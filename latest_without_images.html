								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;But because of a subtlety of Unix systems (of which macOS is one), when an existing file is moved from another location to the root directory, it retains the same read-write permissions it previously had.&#34;And ownership. (The sentence before that suggests &#34;root directory&#34; here means &#34;directory owned by root&#34;.) The permissions on the directory apply only to the file&#39;s directory entry, not the file itself.This isn&#39;t a &#34;subtlety&#34;, it&#39;s how it works, and no-one who doesn&#39;t understand this should be writing macOS installers.The correct approach is to open the file for read and copy its bytes into your private area. Only then check the cryptographic signature. Just renaming into your private directory isn&#39;t enough, even if that directory has no read or execute access to other users, because the attacker could have opened the file for write access before you did the rename."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For years, I have refused to install zoom, webex etc clients for exactly this reason. Their installer wants admin user access for no apparent reason. They could have given a simple drag and drop installation app. Instead they want to run an installer with root user permissions to do whatever. Also, I hate apps that installs a helper background program, and doesn&#39;t let me disable it via preferences. I refuse to use those too.Besides, for what zoom does, why do they need an app? Browser has all the capabilities they need."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note that if SIP is enabled (the default), &#34;root access&#34; does not mean full compromise. On macOS, root is far from being as privileged as it was in the old days of UNIX yore. (Even on Linux it does not have to be, but my impression is that on most distributions it probably still is.)Just because you&#39;re root does not mean you get any entitlement you want, or arbitrary access to the whole filesystem, arbitrary memory access (a la /dev/(k)mem), or can replace the kernel just like that.(That&#39;s also probably why you don&#39;t hear of iPhones being &#34;rooted&#34;, but rather &#34;jailbroken&#34;. Just being root on an iPhone wouldn&#39;t do that much.)Make no mistake, this is still a privilege escalation attack and needs to be fixed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the things I remember being discussed on m.d.s.policy not so long ago was making a registry (maybe handled by IANA) for example private keys. Turns out Peter Gutmann did the heavy lifting (thank you Peter) to turn that from idle discussion into a draft document:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-gutmann-testkeys/From the point of view of m.d.s.policy the main idea is to require CAs to reject these keys in certificates for the Web PKI and encourage software to use these keys (rather than their own examples) in sample code. Basically when you build my-cool-website.example and copy paste the private key from an example into your certificate fetching code, the CA should say &#34;Er, no, you need to actually choose your own private key, that&#39;s what the word private means&#34; and this should happen when you copy-paste a high-rated Stack Overflow example, the provided sample code from the library you used etc. Ideally these would all be the same keys is the idea.It would also make sense for tools to care about these example keys e.g. GitHub could flag code that&#39;s checked in and has keys which are not these examples since maybe you used real keys by mistake in your GitHub repo, meanwhile your build-for-production CI tools could reject keys which are on the list because that means you forgot to pick actual keys for the real build."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Mac address part stood out to me, has something changed over the year that made changing Mac addresses more complex?Back in college our school had some limitations on the internal networks in our dorms. After doing my normal stuff (you know mega downloading,ftp, limewire etc) my net stopped working. Come to find out they had a bandwidth monitor and would just block you for some time if you used too much and had to contact tech support, even for simple things like window updates.Anyways, somehow I found out I could tweak some net configs in the registry. So here I randomly change some dword value to change my Mac address. I finally got back online and just forgot about it.A few days later I came back to my room after classes, my roommate told me the school officers raided the room trying to get on my PC. I went to the student dean&#39;s office and come to find out I took net access from I think the president and they tracked it to my PC ... Some luck I say lol .. Tech support said that there was no possible way I could change my Mac address after a bit back and forth I decided to just agree with him.O yeah and they had like a 200-300 page printout of irc chatlogs ,there was more stuff but I&#39;ll end it there.Needless to say my net access was blocked for a year even tho I had a work study job with the webdev department.
It didn&#39;t stop me though, I ended up running a long cat5 cable from the dorm next door. Fun times."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, this series of posts is awesome! I have a Kia EV6 and just finding the OBD-II PIDs is a massive pain in the arse. Kia is actually required by EU law to disclose them (Art. 61 EU regulation 2018/858 [0]) but refused to do so even when I wrote to them. Need to follow that up with a complaint to the Spanish type approval authority (which approved the EV6)...Writing custom software looks like a really promising alternative though, especially if the vehicle&#39;s cellular connection can be used. Hell, if the IVI uses the CAN bus, perhaps there&#39;s a reverse-engineerable list of PIDs.[0]: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A..."</p>

Also, these are based on a lifetime exposure, and short term exposure to these amounts is probably not particularly harmful.Additionally, even in the US, the guidelines by the individual states vary between 13 to 1000 ppt.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Like another comment here mentioned, housing is complicated. People don&#39;t want to live in a random house in the middle of nowhere (&#39;roof over your head&#39;). Some people prefer to be homeless on the street versus getting to a roof over their head that they don&#39;t like.People want to live where they want to live (near family, jobs, culture etc)Take NYC for instance. Politicians try to address the NYC housing crisis from a demand/cost perspective. Rent is too high? Let&#39;s just screw the property owner and cap the rent. Or let&#39;s just raise minimum wage to make it easier for people to live in those properties.The result in both cases: you didn&#39;t have enough housing before, you don&#39;t have enough housing now. You give more money to people, rents will just go up. You cap the rent, there&#39;s still a huge number of people that can&#39;t live where they want and you make it impossible for existing tenants to move (or for new/more development to be built, for that matter)So, what instead? You want to build more housing in NYC? Great, that should work. But you have to make it cheap. Deregulate construction, get rid of unions, prioritize developer rights over tenant or homeowner rights. What? You don&#39;t think these are good things? Okay, but then you&#39;ll have to sit back and watch new construction trickle in and result in &#39;luxury&#39; housing because that&#39;s the only way a developer can recoup their enormous land acquisition, regulation and construction costs.
So the challenge with housing is that it requires fundamentally difficult decisions. To pretend that you can just spend 100 billion (or even a trillion) and the problem will be solved and people will be happy, is an illusion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I definitely do. It&#39;s something that turns a basic necessity into a speculative asset, with a price distorted by the money poured into it. Airbnb is also a deeply harmful influence on housing prices.Imagine if we did the same thing with, say, water: privatized it and then &#34;democratized&#34; ownership of it.It&#39;s easy to get retail investors to buy things at inflated, speculative prices, so the price of water would go up. People would say, &#34;Why are so many people dying due to lack of access to water?&#34; And we would blame these startups, laws would be passed, and we would fix it.Unfortunately the necessity of housing is not as direct and clear, and we have a long history of denying housing to people who are unlucky, sick, or the children of such people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a natural first impulse, but it&#39;s wrong. What is the correct impulse is to be concerned about how lopsided most cities zoning is towards single family, as that is what is driving the market power that makes real estate profitable as a financial asset. If most of a city was zoned to allow up to multi residential highrises rather than most of a city being zoned for single family it would cut the appreciation ability of the scarce and valuable land zoned for higher density already and would allow more people to live closer to where they want to live (i.e. close to work/wherever they daily commute).The market isn&#39;t failing to function because someone realized they could buy up current stock and make a large profit over time, people noticed they could make a large profit over time because city governments zoned everything wrong for the actual demand."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was fortunate enough to spend about 18 months as staff assistant to my CEO, including access to their email and basically all meetings. This was a PE-backed roll-up that was in the midst of acquiring several smaller companies, and then pursuing an exit.The experience really opened my eyes about the requirements for the job. The amount of code-switching required to communicate well with ownership, the other C-levels, employees, customers, and potential acquirers could make my head swim. The breadth and depth of technical, financial, and human expertise necessary to verify all the parts of the business and smell out where issues might be hiding. All of that before even getting to (in this case) integrating several businesses into a whole, identifying up-and-coming leaders, and keeping the employees happy; let alone actually having a strategy, getting buy-in, and implementing it. And then spending most evenings networking with the elite class that you need to know to have access to capital. You can never have a bad day. Ever.This was for an org that was comfortably under 1000 employees, all located in the US, where none of the VPs were the kind of political operators you get in meatier companies.I walked away thinking that there can&#39;t be even 100k people in the country with the ability to do even a non-laughable job as the CEO of a 500ish employee company. Not even do a good job, just do a job that doesn&#39;t look like one of those 80s child-parent-bodyswap movies where the kid tries to work in an office.I still think CEO pay is out of control, but I understand better why boards end up paying what they do. Any weakness in any of these skills is an existential threat, and you don&#39;t know for sure what will hit you this year."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The &#34;What it&#39;s like&#34; posts are really cool. Especially enjoyed this account[1] from a content writer who shadowed the CEO during a half-day meeting with a major investor and got to see the impact of their work in a context they never expected:&gt; Next we met with Vinod, Bruce, and investment partners Brian Byun and Sven Strohband for a company brief and brainstorm session. Sid began with an update on the financials, and detailed our massive growth and expansion both in terms of people and product. There were no slides presented. Instead, Sid used our website as a visual aid. Nearly every question or discussion point was first addressed with a Google search to pull up the appropriate GitLab web page to reference.[...]&gt; I’ve been working at GitLab for two and a half years as a content writer on our marketing team and at times have been extremely frustrated with our marketing website—the content on it, how it’s organized, what we’re presenting, etc. It doesn’t look or operate in a way I’m familiar with so my instinct was to not trust it. But nothing we do at GitLab is “normal,” and witnessing our CEO use the website as a single source of public truth to inform our investors is just one example of what it means to be a transparent company.[1] https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/04/08/khosla-ventures-git..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m constantly in awe of Gitlab&#39;s radical transparency approach. I have no idea if this is actually a good idea (surely every competitor of Gitlab has a huge amount of assymetrical information about Gitlab that Gitlab does not have in return) - but I am fascinated by it and truly grateful for them for daring to go out on a limb and do this experiment. My fingers are crossed that this brings them amazing success as I wish all companies worked this way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For consumers in some jurisdictions they may be able to get refunds on the product if it can be argued that this feature was a core reason the application was purchased.However once you are a business many of those protections aren’t present. There is an assumption that businesses should be able to sort things out amongst themselves and the court system. However an SME barely has any more power then a consumer going against a giant like Autodesk.I wonder if the solution wouldn’t be to extend those protections to smaller businesses, and additionally allow reclaiming the cost of any investments in the platform (Training, etc) and other expenses. Your not telling autodesk what they can do with their product, but if they are selling it based on features they are removing, they will be liable to make right anyone who purchased on that basis."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a fairly core feature they&#39;re removing from a product they already sold.I also liked that they don&#39;t make any attempt at claiming this is for any reason other than more money. No &#34;oh our new models are too powerful to run locally&#34; or &#34;oh for security reasons&#34; or whatever. Which would be pretty transparent bullshit but I think a lot of companies would try anyways. This literally admits that the cloud functionality is identical, just paid per use.Imo if you bought the product in this state, fine, but if you bought it before they probably ought to have to grandfather you in forever."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you have to debug at that level, and you&#39;re not designing hardware, things are really bad.Some years back, Wes Irish at Xerox PARC tracked down one of the great mysteries of early coax Ethernet - why was throughput so much lower than theory predicted? For this, he got both ends of a building-length coax with many machines on it connected to one office, so he could plug both ends into a storage scope. If the waveforms disagreed, somebody was transmitting when they shouldn&#39;t. Storage scopes with large storage were rare then. It was an expensive LeCroy unit.After the end of each Ethernet packet on coax, there is a brief &#34;quiet time&#34;, and then the next packet can be sent, beginning with a sync pattern. The hardware detects if what it is sending does not match what it is receiving, which indicates a collision. Both senders stop, wait a random time so they don&#39;t collide again, and retry. This is how &#34;carrier sense multiple access - collision detection&#34;, or CSMA-CD, works at the hardware level.This setup revealed that something on the cable was transmitting a single spike after the end of each packet, during the &#34;quiet time&#34;. That reset the &#34;quiet time&#34; timer in the network interface, which inhibited the transition to &#34;look for sync&#34; mode. So the next packet would be ignored. 
The quiet time timer was at a very low level - software did not see this event.What came out of looking at the waveforms was the surprising result that the                                                                                      spike during the quiet time was not coming from either the data source or the destination, but from something elsewhere on the cable. The spike was not synchronized to the packet just sent.
With the waveforms for both ends of the cable visible, speed of light lag revealed both that this was happening and where it was coming from, as distance along the cable.It turned out that several brands of network interface used a part which contained the quiet time timer, the sync recognizer, and the transmitter power controller. When the timer ran out, the device did a state machine transition, and during that transition, for a nanosecond or so, the transmitter turned on. It wasn&#39;t supposed to do that. This generated a spike on the cable, resetting every quiet time timer and causing the next packet to be silently ignored by all stations.The network interface didn&#39;t need to be active to do this. Being powered on was sufficient. One device with that part could halve the data rate on a coax Ethernet. Thousands of network interfaces had to be scrapped to fix this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know a little bit about Ethernet, having used it since the early 10Base-2 days as well as having done a bit of &#34;hacking&#34; in an effort to decode 1000Base-T.This article is focused on the QSGMII PHY chip, without which it would be practically impossible to use an oscilloscope for any meaningful troubleshooting.1000Base-T is the most commonly used Ethernet variant in use today.  It uses four balanced differential pairs for signalling.  Each pair transmits and receives simultaneously.  This works because 1000Base-T is a point-to-point connection and the PHY contains a hybrid that subtracts the voltage being transmitted from what is received.  This makes the problem of &#34;tapping&#34; the interface harder because the third party observer sees a jumble of data and cannot easily determine what data is coming from either of the two connected devices.  Each pair can send/receive five possible symbols, represented by voltages of +3.5, +2, 0, -2, -3.5 volts.  In addition, the PHY &#34;scrambles&#34; the data being sent with a LFSR (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register) seeded with either a &#34;master&#34; or &#34;slave&#34; value.  (The master/slave identity is negotiated between the two peers when they detect each other.)  It gets even more complex with hamming codes and an abstraction layer to separate the control/data planes.  There&#39;s also a complicated DSP for line equalization.BTW, I do own one of these: https://www.amazon.com/midBit-Technologies-LLC-SharkTapUSB-1... which can make the job very easy, but it was not an available option for my &#34;hacking&#34; application."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The scope&#39;s sample rate really jumped out to me:&gt;  I configured the oscilloscope to collect 100M samples at 1 TSPS (tera-sample per second, 10^12) ...Wow! Sampling at 1000 GHz? I wouldn&#39;t have thought that was possible! Does anyone know how the scope can even do that?"</p>

I wish I knew how to ask properly.The weirdest is that some ISP are blocking it and some are not. So why is that the case?

J. Friedl and comp. sci. purists about whether NFAs and regular expressions should really be called what they are in the face of backreferences and other notation. Friedl suggests another name should be used, because de facto &#34;NFAs&#34;
are no longer equivalent to DFAs.Since Xerox Research Europe&#39;s invention of xfst, the term &#34;extended regular
expression&#34; is already taken for a specific superclass of expressions that
describe regular relations.So I propose two alternatives, semi-regular expressions and super-regular expressions, for strings that look like regular expressions but that use non-regular extensions like backreferences that push the complexity beyond what can be done with NDAs/DFAs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So fun story (to me in retrospect).I had an interview at google years ago where I basically I was asked to come up with this on my own.  In my opinion, a terrible interview Q (per Kernighan&#39;s blog, linked in original post, it took pike an hour or two alone in his office), and I bombed it.  It was either my just before or just after lunch interview and it stuck with me for the rest of the day and I couldn&#39;t give my entire focus to the rest of the sessions.anyways, after it was done, I found kernighan&#39;s blog post and decided I should try to implement this in java as it will allow me to even get some practice with things like junit and more experience with object oriented programming as I had been living in the C world at that time).  so I did, but I then found this regular expression page ( https://www.regular-expressions.info/) and learned many more things about &#34;regular expressions&#34; that i hadn&#39;t learned in school (because they aren&#39;t regular) and wondered if I could extend pike&#39;s simplicity to them in a relatively simple manner.  So I did.which I created this https://github.com/sjpotter/regex.Not meant to be &#34;performant&#34; but meant to be educational to me and perhaps others.Then when I was learning go, I rewrote it in Go.  I did things that are not &#34;normal&#34; go patterns (i.e. using panic and recover to make error handling cleaner (in my opinion, if an error path is simply if (err) { return err } all the way up, I personally think panics/recover at the top can be cleaner, but it seems most disagree), but it was educational on how to rewrite my java code to an object oriented style in Go and to explore the limitations of interfaces and how one might get around them (also perhaps in ways that go against what might be considered proper go programming)https://github.com/sjpotter/regex-gothough now that I look at that repo, wondering if all the work was done elsewhere and then I just pushed a single commit there, might need to go back and look at it"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The crazy part is that this journey is only the tip of the iceberg for this pedometer. It is made of many components, all of which follow similar journeys to the pedometer factory from their respective factories. And the components are made of raw materials, which are also shipped around in a similar manner after being mined. And the mining itself displaces those who live in that space."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why did they do this backwards? It sounds like they took the trip in reverse. I thought they recorded it forward (tracking an actual object the whole time) and presented it in reverse, but it looks like they didn&#39;t actually follow a real object. They just chose a path and took the path in reverse, using the types of transportation that such an object might in theory have taken:&gt; They write that, “Four years later we found ourselves on the largest container ship in the world on our way from Sweden to China.” As per the trip: “We had started the journey by truck to Middle Sweden, then by freight train to the port of Gothenburg, and after four weeks at sea, we filmed from a truck again, this time from the port of Shenzhen to a factory in Bao’an.”The idea of following a single, real object from point of manufacture to destination--documenting all the transfers and hiccups along the way--is interesting to me. Presenting it in reverse chronological order is an artistic decision I&#39;m ambivalent about. But it doesn&#39;t sound like that&#39;s what they did. They didn&#39;t track a pedometer; they just took freight vehicles along a path that maybe the thing went on, without following the actual transfer of the item from box to container, from truck to ship, etc.I&#39;m disappointed. I was ready to actually watch the whole thing. But it&#39;s contrived."</p>
