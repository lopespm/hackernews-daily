								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Most businesses, consumers, and developers universally continue to ignore the primary reason that iMessage is a closed platform, rather than an app on every platform as iTunes is:Apple is using device serial numbers for anti-spam, supported by a fully-authenticated hardware and software stack that does not allow user modification. This permits Apple to simply “console ban” any Apple device that spams on iMessage. This makes it prohibitively expensive to send spam over iMessage. They have been doing so since iMessage was launched.Android offers no such attestation that I’m aware of. Windows, on Pluton, could offer this attestation securely — and that is a key deliverable of Pluton.It’s easy, then, to predict what Apple’s first non-Apple platform will be: Microsoft Windows 12, only if secure-booted, with Pluton-signed attestation that the kernel is unmodified. And it’s easy to predict how Apple will implement anti-spam: by applying “console” bans to specific Pluton chips by their serial number.If Android wants to join the party, then Android phone builders need to implement secure boot with hardware-signed attestation of non-rooted-ness, in the style of Apple T2 + macOS or Microsoft Pluton + Secure Boot. Until then, Apple iMessage will remain single platform.(I recognize that this is extremely unpalatable to device hackers, but the same freedom to modify an OS kernel that hackers desire is also the freedom to spam all users, as we have seen repeatedly with all messaging software platforms operated without hardware-backed attestation for the past thirty years — including email, Jabber, and HN itself.)(No, I do not work at Apple.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"RCS is dead. The Cross Carrier Messaging Initiative (CCMI) has given up. Google is the one still pushing for it. iMessage is simply a big Apple moat. Why would Apple give it up to enhance Google&#39;s business position?Google wants us to pick theirs over Apple&#39;s. Also note that to my knowledge, RCS is not available in all countries.The other funny thing is that Google complains about SMS being insecure -- all while RCS does not support end to end encryption. Google Messages added that feature recently relatively (last year? please correct me below) and I still can&#39;t understand if it&#39;s on by default or not.Here is a random article about RCS state. Feel free to google for more: https://linustechtips.com/topic/1327240-in-the-us-rcs-text-m...I would love a common solution, but rationally I can not blame Apple for keeping a (to me from experiencing both) superior experience that brings in customers. And Google has just managed to catch up. Google will need to make their messaging an order or two better, to the point that Apple will have to join.P.S. Also, I am skeptical any time the phrases privacy, end-to-end encryption, and Google cohabitate the same statement.(Edit)P.S.2. Just use https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/bluebubbles/9P3XF8KJ... in the meantime."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can understand Google&#39;s frustration but they have no one to blame but themselves.Everyone is familiar with their graveyard of failed messaging applications (along with their graveyard of products generally).When I had an android phone, I tried RCS with someone else on Android. It never worked. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s improved, but as the common theme of this story goes, Google blew their chance.I also don&#39;t trust google to abide by the &#34;standard&#34; they&#39;ve created. Their track record is abysmal. I don&#39;t want to use yet another messaging service that they&#39;ve built. I don&#39;t trust it to exist in the future, receive support and updates, and for it to be maintained. If google abandons it that means the telecoms are stuck holding the bag and when we demand even more from the next iteration of messaging apps, RCS will go the way SMS has today.This is nothing more than Google reaping the results of their own failures. It&#39;s a shame they squandered the opportunity over the last 15 years to develop a cohesive messaging app strategy across their products, but its their shame and now they have to pay the price.In a last ditch effort they&#39;re trying to throw all the blame on Apple who was able to innovate and launch a successful messaging service years ago. Apple recognized that SMS could be improved, and they improved it. They didn&#39;t wait for anyone and they recognize the importance of continued support - a quality Google does not seem to foster.Google had their chance over and over again but they blew it over and over again. I don&#39;t care about the little things RCS adds, message bubbles, delivery confirmation etc. These may be nice additions but they truly don&#39;t make a large difference. If an Android phone wants to send a high quality image, video etc they can share a link. That&#39;s good enough for me.Google failed, miserably and publicly. This latest campaign is just embarrassing for them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"CGP Grey has a video discussing jury nullification, for those interested in a further explanation of the subject: https://youtu.be/uqH_Y1TupoQ"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Jury nullification is just one manifestation of good-ol&#39;-boy-ism.Good-ol&#39;-boy-ism is a good thing when it let&#39;s the sheriff of Mayberry teach a kid a lesson without making him a felon and ruining his future.Good-ol&#39;-boyism is a horrible thing when it let&#39;s the sheriff of Mayberry teach a kid a lesson, making him a felon and ruining his future.I have personally benefited from the former. I don&#39;t know how to reconcile the latter when the only difference was the kid&#39;s last name, or skin color, or religion. Every good thing can be abused. Sometimes the scale of abuse calls for the abolition of the &#34;good thing&#34;. Sometimes it is better to tolerate some abuse because of the scale of good that comes from the good thing.For me, this train of thought always breaks down to reasoning that good-ol&#39;-boy-ism is good when the ol&#39;-boys are good and bad when the ol&#39;-boys are bad. But that&#39;s obviously broken when &#39;good&#39; or &#39;bad&#39; is left to the decision of the ol&#39;-boys. Historically, we just have constant war to decide who gets to be the ol&#39;-boys this week."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, so much negativity.I think this is great advice. The key is being genuine and appreciative. Take care of your neediness in other ways. If you don&#39;t know how to listen, writing lots of notes can be just another way of monopolizing the conversation. Use the note as a way to  maintain the intimacy you already have.Ps my marriage lasted happily for 37 years until the untimely death of my beloved wife."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have had an opposite experience. Daily notes makes no difference. I was in a relationship for 2 years and have written a poem every day for 400 days straight to her. But it failed nevertheless. In fact, I was told by her that these notes put her in guilt. Weird.Gestures like these amplify whatever the relationship there is to start with.If there&#39;s a lot of love, they amplify it.If there&#39;s a lot of lack of commitment, they amplify it.They do not change lack of commitment into love magically.Sorry for being the party pooper. I understand where the OP is coming from and I truly respect that. Just wanted to add a bit of more context."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Personal vehicles will be getting both bigger and smaller.  What&#39;s different from the past is that electric motors scale much better than IC engines. Both the world&#39;s smallest vehicles (kid&#39;s toys) and the largest vehicles (huge mining trucks) are both electric.First the small.  Cities will soon start to ban all but electric vehicles in their downtown cores  (already happening in some Chinese cities).  The primary reason being electric vehicles don&#39;t emit the poisonous gases that IC vehicles do.  The next phase will be only EV&#39;s that are half the width of a normal car lane will be allowed in the downtown core.  Most vehicles in the downtown core now are single occupancy, a city can double its downtown vehicle infrastructure for free by restricting most EV vehicles to taking up just half a lane.  These vehicles will be much cheaper too, probably less than $10k.Now the big.  IC RV&#39;s are a bit of a pain but an all electric RV will be much better all around.  That&#39;s because all of the required functions will be electric and run off the huge battery.  Hot water, TVs, heat, refrigeration, very little maintenance just like a normal house, but smaller.  Tesla vehicles already have &#34;camp mode&#34; and people love it.  Image when Tesla builds an EV RV.  This will become young people&#39;s &#39;First home&#39;.  Buy it for $70k and live in it for much less than rent.  When you finish Uni, you own an asset rather than peeing your money away on rent.  Oh and for weekend trips to the lake or the ski mountain and all that, couldn&#39;t be more convenient.Remember, you read it here first.EDIT ... a few typos"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Energy? I feel like it&#39;s been talked about a lot but maybe not?Solar panels are dropping in cost at an exponential rate [0]. As of this writing, consumer &#34;new&#34; panels are $0.75/W and used are at around $0.30/W right now (I won&#39;t give a link as a Google search will do).Battery technology is also dropping at an exponential rate. I believe, with a little effort, one can purchase batteries at about $0.08/Wh.Taken together, one can purchase a 30KWh (daily) solar panel and battery storage system for about $4,200 (not including labor and extra hardware/electronics), which puts the return on investment (ROI) at about 3.5 years if we consider the average house spends around $1200 (in the USA).Dropping costs will quickly put that in the 2 year ROI range which, in my opinion, is the inflection point where it effectively becomes too good to pass up for the average consumer.The dropping price of energy comes with all sorts of side effects, like a potentially decentralized energy grid, use cases for excess energy (eg bitcoin mining, carbon capture, hydrogen production, etc.), novel power storage systems etc., which is maybe the &#34;novel&#34; part that I haven&#39;t heard too much talk about.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swanson%27s_law"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not nearly educated enough about this subject to try to summarise it, but the research being carried out by Michael Levin&#39;s group into how organisms control anatomy growth is completely fascinating and has the feel of a breakthrough. Almost all the talks I&#39;ve seen are good, for example:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-9rLlFgcm0Creating new species without genetic changes seems wild!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So, the RPC-4000 version of blackjack seems lost, but the LGP-30 version exists (and can be run on simh). I&#39;ve disassembled and partly annotated it, and found that it too has a sort of cheat switch.The LGP-30 has no source of randomness to use as a seed. From loading the program, if the player plays optimally, the games will all be the same. Over the first few dozen games, the player ends up in the hole (IIRC, noticeably more than the long-run house edge).The LGP-30 has one conditional branch instruction, that tests the sign bit of the accumulator. But if the sign bit on the instruction is set, and the TRANSFER CONTROL switch on the front panel is set, then the branch is always taken. This appears once in the program. On startup, if the switch is set, it marks two of the aces as already dealt. This perturbs the sequence enough so that, over the first few dozen games, the player has the advantage."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The commenters saying be reasonable, they were sanctioned, GitHub had to do this, should look into the last time code was made illegal or similar turmoil and what the developer community did in response…It was not accepting sanctions or govt failures to understand code as “well that’s that.”- Phil Zimmerman (PGP) was under  criminal investigation for arms exports by releasing the code for consumer encryption. The case escalated and was eventually dropped, included POTUS attention.- Aaron Swartz passed away via suicide in 2013 under threat of 35 years in prison and a lot else  for downloading from JSTOR programmatically- Clifford Stole spent several years being ignored by every govt agency under the Sun, except for CIA, for finding, attributing and then exposing a widespread KGB hack of govt systems in the 80s- L0pht testified in front of congress to expose significant  internet security risks that were otherwise ignored.I’m not saying Tornado Cash and related devs were doing a purely moral action. But the automatic siding with the heavy hand of govt sanctions on code the govt doesn’t really understand is pretty shameful for a nuanced technical audience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People on Twitter are either wilfully dumb or simply ignorant.GitHub had to do this. It was required of them by law. Tornado was sanctioned.&gt; These prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any blocked person and the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.This is, unambiguously, directed toward entities such as GitHub providing them service.I&#39;m not a fan of GH these days but they did the only thing they could do in this situation. You can be upset about it, but you can&#39;t be upset at GitHub about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honest question: was GitHub legally obligated to delete the accounts of anyone who had contributed to the repos?I get that contributing to the repos would be a violation of the sanctions, but it&#39;s not clear to me when the project was sanctioned and whether all the contributors were aware that they were contributing to a sanctioned project. Would it have been enough for GitHub just to remove the projects?I ask as someone who has a lot of developer friends from Cuba who run into problems with accounts on platforms being deleted all the time. IIRC there was an episode awhile ago when accounts were being deleted simply for logging in from Cuba.It seems like the legal obligation would be to block logins from Cuba (and/or Cuban people), but deletion of accounts seems more like a CYA move than a strict obligation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, i almost forgot about Firebug.From my point of view it was really a game changer. The first time debugging and understanding web-applications became accessible. Probably all browser dev tools were inspired by this tool"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An interesting convention that ~started with Firebug was the use of angle brackets in the DOM/Elements view. (eg a DIV element is shown as `&lt;div&gt;`). HTML, as a text format, uses angle brackets to denote tags. But DOM is an in-memory object model; it doesn&#39;t have tags, but elements, and those have nothing do with angle brackets (other than getting el.innerHTML will serialize back).From a usability POV, it&#39;s entirely defendable: make the DOM visually look like the HTML you authored. But Firebug and our current browser devtools only add them for aesthetics and familiarity.It rarely causes problems, but it&#39;ll explain why you&#39;ll see `&lt;tbody&gt;` in DevTools even if your HTML doesn&#39;t have it.  Still, I think dropping the HTML-y representation of DOM elements could be a win — removing end tags in particular would improve the information density.Bonus: A Firebug Cheatsheet I made in 2007, 4 years before I was working on Chrome DevTools: https://imgur.com/I2KbZWm"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Firebug was some truly excellent work - but I think it&#39;s worth also mentionining its precursor Venkman - which in turn built upon the js/jsd low-level debugging APIs inside the mozilla suite.https://www-archive.mozilla.org/projects/venkman/edit: there&#39;s a nice write-up of how firebug got started here https://flailingmonkey.com/the-history-of-firebug"</p>
