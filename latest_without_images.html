@yegghttps://twitter.com/DuckDuckGo/status/1114524914227253249Also, they probably do not realize that they will have to start with Twitter if to be consistent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like DDG, but honestly, this is a really bad move. It is already harder for me to find certain sites in the rankings. I mean look at this, even searching for &#34;drudge&#34; doesn&#39;t even bring up a link to Drudge Report: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=drudge&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=webI liked DDG because it respected the user. Limiting what I can see in order to make sure I don&#39;t see &#34;Russian disinformation&#34; seems to me like the exact opposite of respecting the user.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Suppose I go off and make a search engine, with my own algorithm for ranking search results.  At first it works great.  And then five years later, I find that, by a quirk in my algorithm, I find that a new site has risen to the top of all my results.  This new site was created as a prank, and it contains authoritative-sounding but incorrect answers to common questions.  The results returned are still relevant to my users, but they are now factually incorrect.Should I simply accept that this site is the correct top result for my users&#39; queries, since it has been ranked by my unbiased algorithm?  Or should I decide to put my finger on the scale, and redesign my algorithm (possibly by simply reweighting results from this particular site) to change the rankings?Does the answer change if the site is not a prank site, but is propoganda?  Or an earnest-but-incorrect flat earther?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thank you to this community for all the support through the years! We&#39;re spending a lot of our time on basic research and sensing, and we have a few small updates planned for f.lux, too. The main challenge as we learn more about the biology is to keep things simple enough--it&#39;s easy to make things complicated, and it&#39;s pretty hard (for me) to distill them to something that makes sense to most people.Also, if you care about how your eyes and circadian system work, don&#39;t forget about all the light from outside your screen too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While it’s not strictly necessary anymore, because most OS’s have at least a basic feature that mimics flux built in now, I feel like we owe the devs a huge debt for forcing the conversation about the toll our ultra high brightness screens have on our sleep patterns and quality and our eyes.Plus, it’s a great example of a really high quality piece of software developed with a lot of care and a huge long term commitment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you&#39;re using an external monitor, it&#39;s better to do it on the monitor itself rather than in software. When you do it on the monitor it applies everywhere, even when rebooting or using another OS. When I did it in software (redshift) I noticed it was causing my laptop to overheat.Here&#39;s how I do it on Linux with a Dell U2720Q monitor.  sudo apt-get -yy install ddcutil # Install ddcutil on Ubuntu
  sudo modprobe i2c_dev  # Load required kernel module

  # Night - Set brightness to 20% and color temperature to 3000K

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is important to recognize that Stripe is largely selling well-made shovels for the gold rush here. They have a history of diving more deeply into this market [1] and withdrawing from it before [2], so this is just Take 2. This time around, they are not themselves buying Cube Thingies or similar and don&#39;t have any exposure to the volatile world of ETH or other coins.I think there will be decent transfer of money from venture-funded NFT startups to Stripe for the next few years, followed by a dip in the market when the startups discover that selling digital art is less of a viable market than they realize.I am personally skeptical about the end market, but Stripe seem well-insulated from the risks. I&#39;m curious what people who are bullish on this think though – what might I be missing about the digital art market? I think paying 12 million pounds for a Renoir is bananas too, but people certainly do it [3]. I just expect digital stuff to be more volatile because it&#39;s hard to communicate that combination of artisanship and rarity.On the topic of well-made shovels, I highly recommend the Voile Telepro in HN Orange [4] as a portable snow shovel to keep in your car if you live in a snowy climate. They will probably be on sale in spring and summer.----------------------------------------[1] https://web.archive.org/web/20150516061807/https://stripe.co...[2] https://stripe.com/blog/ending-bitcoin-support[3] https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-pierre-auguste-renoir-1...[4] https://snowmetrics.com/shop/voile-shovel/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel like they missed the primary point which is that E2E encryption is the primary thing protecting everyone from hackers/criminals/other-governments. Without it the criminals WILL have access to your systems and data and then you can basically say goodbye to anything being valuable at all.Locking your door at night is a poor metaphor. A criminal can literally infiltrate and search through every unsecured computer connected to the internet in a matter of minutes and using almost no resources and with little risk. This drastically diverges from physical assets.Making encryption illegal will ensure that only criminals use it, thus making only criminals safe online."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have said this before: this is a losing battle for individuals striving to protect the freedom, if we just try to do it individually. People bringing this get paid to do this during office time (and maybe after office time too by lobbyists) so they will keep at this; my protests require me to do it by taking time out of the limited time I have left after office.Fight fire with fire, fund EFF so that we have our own well stocked army. To be clear, I&#39;m not trivialising or belittling the impact of individual effort, just that it takes too much to be sustainable. And yes, individual and organized efforts are not mutually exclusive."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Yet as today’s letter points out, subsequent investigations by The Wall Street Journal, Reuters, and The Markup revealed that not only did Amazon employees working on private-label items have access to third-party data, but they routinely used it, even discussing it openly in meetings. “Amazon employees regularly violated the policy—and senior officials knew it.”That&#39;s pretty incredible.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Somewhat related: any time a business/person has access to data about a customer or their business, they&#39;re in a position of power and are able to use that data against the customer.When you apply to rent a house, you&#39;re required to provide pay stubs and salary information.  The landlord can (does?) use this to know how much they can jack up your rent next lease term (my landlord raised our rent $800/month in January).Same with insurance salespeople, car salespeople, etc.  Everyone who gets access to your financial data can use it against you.There should be a 3rd party involved -- they take your documentation and then report to the landlord/salesperson/etc. a simple &#34;is the person qualified?&#34; Yes or No.  And then permanently destroy said documentation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"“For scientific discovery give me Scott; for speed and efficiency of travel give me Amundsen; but when disaster strikes and all hope is gone, get down on your knees and pray for Shackleton.” - Sir Raymond Priestly, Antarctic Explorer and Geologist.For those who don&#39;t know about this expedition, NatGeo has a good video about it on youtube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgh_77TtX5I"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For anyone who hasn&#39;t read it, Endurance: Shackleton&#39;s Incredible Voyage, by Alfred Lansing is a well-written account of the expedition story."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember watching a TV documentary about the Endurance expedition 10 years ago and being flabbergasted.First, the Endurance is trapped by ice for half a year. Then she is crushed by the ice, and the crew camps on the ice. Then they start a 500 km march, over the ice, carrying the lifeboats, to reach an island. After over half a year (!), they finally decide to start a 160 km journey across the open sea in the three lifeboats. The crew of 27 manages to reach Elephant Island after 5 days on the open sea in wet clothes at temperatures below -20 degrees. The island is completely uninhabited and there is little hope to ever be rescued from there, so they build a new boat out of the three lifeboats, and Shackleton and five other men set out for a 1,300 km journey to South Georgia, which they know has a small whaling station. Here is an image of the boat [0]. This journey itself has is its own Wikipedia article [1] and is considered one of the greatest boat journeys ever accomplished. The rest of the crew is left behind on Elephant Island. Against all odds, they actually reach South Georgia after 17 days in extremely bad conditions. However, they are on the wrong side of the island. So Shackleton decides to cross the island by foot, with 2 others. It&#39;s a 40 km journey across a mountain range nearly 3,000 meters high [2]. They have no map and improvise their route. In what was actually the first confirmed crossing of South Georgia, they reach the whaling station after walking, without stop, day and night, for nearly 2 days. Just imagine being placed at that whaling station, at the end of the world, and suddenly seeing these 3 half-dead men come out of the mountains. They pick up the remaining crew on the other end of the island by boat. Then, Shackleton immediately tries to rescue the rest of his crew which is still 1,300 km back on Elephant Island (he has no idea whether they are still alive). This takes another 3 months and multiple ships. Only the fourth attempt is successful. But in September 1916, over 1.5 years after the Endurance was trapped in ice, Shackleton has saved his entire crew. Everybody survived.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyage_of_the_James_Caird#/med...[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyage_of_the_James_Caird[2] https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Panorama..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This stuff has been a nightmare for us for a long time. We have to scan pdf417 barcodes from physical identification as part of our offering.Recently, we stumbled upon some cheap USB keyboard emulator 2d scanners that can pick these up very reliably. For our product/customers, this is a viable path. We have tested probably 30 different webcams by this point.  The only 2 that are as reliable as the handheld CCD scanner are the iPad and my Canon DSLR tethered to my PC in automatic mode with a macro lens.Resolution is a factor, but so is frame rate and environment. You have to consider the full UX stack. Someone is required to physically position the barcode in a particular way with certain lighting constraints, etc. With a handheld CCD scanner, you get a laser guide for precisely what distance to go for, and an ergonomic experience that is much more conducive to successful scans. Most offer on board illumination, so even in a pitch black room you will get a successful scan."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like this announcement, because it means that there&#39;s a manufacturing line for proper HiDPI [1] displays running in some LG factory somewhere that third party manufactures like LG/Dell/Iiyama can hopefully use to give us some fresh good-looking 27&#34; 5K desktop monitors. It boggles my mind how little attention very high pixel density displays have been getting from PC display manufacturers. I would also be first in line for a PC monitor that uses the M1 iMac display, but I suppose nobody sees a market for higher end 24&#34; monitors anymore.[1]: HiDPI displays that work correctly with macOS&#39; and Linux desktop&#39;s naive HiDPI implementation, that requires 2x scaling for good results.Nobody in 2022 will sell you a monitor that does that, except for Apple&#39;s expensive stuff that is hard to use with regular PCs and one over the top Dell display. I wish everyone did what ChromeOS or modern Windows apps do. I need that extremely crisp font rendering in my life."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Awesome to see them finally putting out almost consumer friendly pricing displays. Few things I&#39;m disappointed about though:- 60hz. For this price point I&#39;d expect higher.- Thunderbolt 3. Interesting that they didn&#39;t bump to 4, given the Mac Studio is Thunderbolt 4. This means you wont be able to daisy chain the displays.- Lack of size options. Would love to see more variety here. After moving to an ultrawide format, I can&#39;t see myself moving back to standard format monitors from a productivity standpoint.Overall though excited for this and keen to see how it&#39;ll evolve. It&#39;ll be a miss for me this cycle but keen to see their future releases of their monitor line."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s kind of ridiculous how slow the progress in screen resolutions has been. It&#39;s disappointing that Apple is only going for 5k, not 8k; they&#39;re well positioned to fix the ecosystem and bring high-resolution large displays to everyone, if only they tried.I&#39;m finally sitting in front of an 8k 65&#34; screen. This gives me a nice combination of decent picel density in the center and lots of peripheral vision in which to put secondary windows, plus I can sit across the room and watch a movie on it. But every component of the ecosystem introduced problems and friction.I have an M1 Macbook Pro on the same desk. The Macbook can&#39;t drive the 8k TV. I have a separate desktop running Windows with an nVidia GPU for that. Every component of the video ecosystem has given me friction in getting to 8k. I had to swap my $1k nVidia GPU for a different $1k nVidia GPU that wasn&#39;t any faster, to get HDMI 2.1 support. Had to use special HDMI cables, because cables that aren&#39;t specially marked as HDMI2.1 compatible don&#39;t have enough bandwidth. And then the display itself has a ridiculous postprocessing bug (I wrote about it at https://www.rtings.com/tv/discussions/IyO2wLLsNnJCMT-_/firmw...) which makes me think the firmware engineers didn&#39;t have a working 8k source to test with."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, I have so many questions. First, I really respect people acting on conviction. Anyway, I have lots of questions (all completely uninformed) so feel free to ignore any of them, haha.1) Where are you in the development process? Have your scaffolds been used to successfully grow a piece of edible meat?2) When do you think the value of cultivated meat will grow to a point to make the industry self-sustaining? Or even just for it to become a viable option for restaurants/consumers?3) How is flavour added in the process? Since diet has so much impact on flavour, how can you experiment with flavour while growing it in lab? I understand this is specific to another step in the process, so if you can&#39;t answer, no worries.4) When you say scaffolding, my mind immediately goes to a very visual/physically defined place. I&#39;m picturing like a Ribeye Exoskeleton. What level of control over the sculpting of the end product do you have, or does the scaffolding function on a very general growth support level that results in the development of an end product that is then sculpted by the meat-maker?5) Anne-Sophie, have you tried any lab grown meat?6) How far away are we from seeing &#34;at-home&#34; kits for meat growing? I&#39;m picturing a world where a restaurant has their meat-printer going all the time, experimenting with different flavours and textures for the next menu!7) Does this have any non-edible use cases? Can this process be applied to growing functional muscle/tissue, not just edible muscle/tissue?Thanks! Again, feel free to pick and choose."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just wanted to say this is probably the best launch HN description I’ve ever seen, and I’ve been here for the better part of the decade. Thank you for going into the real meat (ahem) of it and not being scared of writing at length.Your cause, if successful, will hopefully indirectly result in orders of magnitude reduction in total animal suffering, so best of luck and godspeed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From an environmental and cost perspective, how do you see this compete with plant-based meat in the short-term and long-term?"</p>
