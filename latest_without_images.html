								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Amazingly enough it’s not even possible to be sure you’re buying a legitimate Kindle book anymore.I often buy classic books but want a particular edition which might include specific notes or a translation by a specific writer, but following the Amazon search - actually clicking on a link where I’ve constructed the search with meticulous attention to the terms that are essential to me - will often lead to a totally random result from an unknown ‘publisher’ which meets none of my criteria and wasn’t the link that was presented to me.Obviously all the reviews are bunched haphazardly together - including the ones that praise the translation which the presented book doesn’t include, and the ones warning about poor formatting from the pirated edition.If Amazon can’t even sell Kindle titles without commingling, then it blows my mind people buying electronics from them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me, this is a leading indicator that Amazon&#39;s ecommerce side will falter. When I look at the reviews for an item, some reviews are high and people are happy, and other people have terrible experiences that doesn&#39;t even seem to be for the same item. I think it&#39;s because of this issue, where Amazon lets 3rd seller to claim that they have inventory for something.I really don&#39;t trust Amazon for a lot of things now, and would rather go directly to the seller on their site. Especially now that I&#39;ve gotten older, I just want less stuff but with higher quality."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Silk Road was not directly selling drugs, it was only a marketplace where other sellers did it, and for this reason it was taken down. AFAIK selling a counterfeit item is a crime too, so shouldn’t Amazon be treated the same ? One could argue that the Silk Road was created with the purpose of enabling the crime, unlike Amazon, but with the problem becoming bigger every day I think that Amazon knows about it very well but doesn’t act because it is against their economic interest, making it complicit of the crime"</p>

It was fascinating and fun - from how to make a row of equilateral triangles with nothing more than a ruler, pen and paper. Many, many hours were spent on the various flexagon derivatives.Years later, I made a JS page to combine images and print hexaflexagons for my son&#39;s classmates. Had some fun with that as well; it was much more confounding than I expected.Nowadays, microfiche is gone, the public library is unfortunately not in most kids vernacular, and the attention span that would be required to enjoy doing the math I did has been hijacked.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few years back I was going through some old floppy disks I found in a box and, on one of them, I found a screenshot I took of my desktop circa winter of 2000. In it was a window open with a MUD I was logged into at the time. Another window had Winamp open with a playlist of songs and another window had ICQ open. The only reason I took it was because there was an unofficial competition between our pub and another pub elsewhere on the MUD about which was more popular, and we had finally surpassed them.It&#39;s amazing how many emotions seeing that one image gave me. But the biggest was just this overwhelming sense of nostalgia. As I looked at that, I could remember what I was thinking, what I was feeling, everything that was happening in my super confusing teenage life at that time. Occasionally I will look at that image now, even 22 years later, I can still feel all those feeling again.Of course, my ex&#39;s character is in the screenshot too. So, a bit bittersweet as well. :/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve gotten mixed reactions whenever I share this, but when I program I like to record my screen with OBS.* It&#39;s a mental hack to keep me accountable, especially now working from home. If I&#39;m in an office anyone can look over and see whether or not I&#39;m working. It started as an attempt to mimic this feeling at home, even though I&#39;ll be the only one to ever see the recordings.* It allows me to go back and see how I worked in the past. I have a few videos of myself working from 2015 which I think is pretty neat just because of how different my workflow was back then compared to now. I&#39;m not using the same tools or even on the same operating system.* I&#39;m working on video games which is what makes this very useful for me. If something visually interesting happens, or if there&#39;s graphical bug of some kind, I can go back and breakdown exactly what happened. I&#39;ve stepped through videos frame by frame in the past to debug, it&#39;s been surprisingly helpful.* It allows me to go back and see my progress. I can know what I was working on a given day, see how far I&#39;ve progressed, it&#39;s just generally a good motivator. You can of course do this with git, but if you&#39;re working on something visual it can be nice to see it in motion rather than a textual diff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For my creative coding projects (which are usually looping animations) I&#39;ve set up scripts that export a short video at every git commit. Going back and seeing things develop is quite satisfying, and also useful if I stumbled upon a configuration that I like and want to branch from"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Pushy pop-ups, &#34;do it now&#34;, flashy colors, and all that stuff.
Things that work like a charm in e-commerce or fashion will most likely not work on devs.Not just &#39;not work&#39;, but &#39;actively repel&#39;. A popup chat bot or a survey form request (during or after using a website or software product) or anything not germane to the task that has a shadow or notification highlight has slowly but surely become a form of wart that elicits a deep, instinctual disgust from me. I&#39;d even say an unhealthy and unreasonable level of disgust.It&#39;s enough to get me to instantly despise a product almost nomatter how well it does its original job.But 100 folks who actually click ads or interact with these distraction baubles (mistakenly or otherwise) are worth thousands of people like me, so I understand why it won&#39;t ever change for the better out of a company&#39;s own volition.---When it comes to advertising, say, developer tooling, I think a large part of the problem is that there&#39;s just not going to be a lot of relevant tools out there, for my job or hobbies, that I either don&#39;t already know about (and aren&#39;t using because I have already evaluated its prospects) or... I am already using it. Conversely, seeing ads for something I am already using has potential for negative effects (see above). Tasteful advertising is thus useful for the rare case of something I don&#39;t know about, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth it when 999/1000 of these ads are detrimental and irrelevant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my experience, high-quality educational content works much better than paid ads when targeting developers.One of the best examples I&#39;ve seen is digital ocean. When ever I google a sys admin type question, there is a digital ocean article as the top result."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work on EthicalAds, one of the ad networks mentioned in the post. We focus on targeting relevant developer-focused ads to content rather than to individuals.The post is great. My only nitpick is that the author mentions that they think retargeting will go away. The scope of retargeting might be reduced especially as third-party cookies stop working but I don&#39;t think retargeting will completely go away. Big ad companies with whom visitors have a direct relationship with (Google, FB) will always be able to do it. They know the pages on their sites and those linked from their site that visitors visit and they will use it to target ads. They don&#39;t need third-party cookies since they have first-party cookies.Networks that just do ads and don&#39;t have relationships with visitors except for advertising will find it harder and harder. At EthicalAds, we don&#39;t do retargeting at all because of our privacy focus, but many ad networks will find retargeting more challenging (less precise, they can always fingerprint users) to do. Doing away with it is a good thing from a privacy perspective but it probably will further entrench the big players."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not included in this list but definitely worth mentioning;- Lowering your hiring bar. When you hire people the burden to get them up to speed and productive is on the existing team. If these people are smart and motivated, great! But no-one benefits from having 200k+ engineers now have to spent their days explaining how GIT (yes, really...) works to a small army of juniors.- Not involving your current team in decisions that affect them. Re-shuffle the teams around, re-architect the product, change the existing workflow, etc. If you hire professionals with 10-20+ years of experience just to ignore their advice, they&#39;re going to be looking for an employer that does appreciate their input very quickly. Nothing is more frustrating than telling a manager not to put his hand in a pan of boiling water, just to see him do it and then blame the cooks for having a pot of boiling water around :)My current manager decided to add 50 outsourced engineers to a team of 5 to deliver the product in a year (instead of the 1.5 - 2 originally guesstimated).In addition to this he decided to give the responsibility for the architecture of the application to outsourced &#34;solution architects&#34; with no domain knowledge and reorganized the teams to split them by job title (e.g testers, developers, operations, &#34;management&#34;, etc).Current productivity is lower with 55 than it was with 5, 3 out of 5 have already handed in their resignation. We&#39;re burning through an additional 3 million this year with 2 crappy React pages to show for it.Next year the damage will probably be worse given the rapid outflow of talent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most of these, I think, relate to a single kinda-meta-problem.Managing software orgs is hard, and most orgs can&#39;t do it well. Using additional management methods, more managers, and more engineers can make the software org less efficient. Software production is weird. Efficiency of software orgs is extremely plastic. An effective 15 person team can outperform a 150 person team and this is normal. Very extreme compared to most fields employing such numbers. Software can be really important &amp; high value. Value can be utterly disconnected from the cost of producing it.I say &#34;less efficient&#34; purposely rather than &#34;worse.&#34; It might actually make sense to go from an efficient 25 person team to an inefficient 500 person team. The additional cost of might be dwarfed by the benefits of marginally more higher output. That might be better economically (even socially), but less efficient.If you&#39;re in one of these orgs, you will not be more happy though. Efficiency feels good. Inefficiency feels bad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Like many engineers, the author of this article assumes all engineers are ethical, and perfectly suited to the assigned task. The author also assumes unlimited budgets, perfect control over a company&#39;s hiring and resource management, and a perfect understanding of the software&#39;s requirements.These are the same complaints I hear from inexperienced engineers over and over and over again – and not just engineers, but anyone primarily responsible for &#39;labor&#39; vs. &#39;management&#39;.The &#39;best engineers&#39; empathize with the perspective of &#39;management,&#39; that running a company is probabilistic, and that managers, co-workers, and other departments – like finance, recruiting, product, and marketing – are also duty bound by challenging constraints often beyond their control."</p>

					<h3><a href="https://mort.coffee/home/tar/">The tar archive format, and why GNU tar extracts in quadratic time</a></h3>

				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32206579">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Tar is pretty unusual for an archive file format. There&#39;s no archive header, no index of files to fascilitate seeking, no magic bytes to help file and its ilk detect whether a file is a tar archive, no footer, no archive-wide metadata. The only kind of thing in a tar file is a file object.tar = tape archive.  It was designed around streaming files to a tape drive in a serial fashion.  Tape bandwidth has almost always been slow compared to source data devices.  You need to start writing to the target device as fast as possible.  Taking time to construct a full index just delays starting the slowest stage of things, while providing only relatively minimal benefit.Generating an index is fairly straightforward, the file headers give you the information you need, including what you need to know to get to the next file header.  Your only bottleneck is just how fast random reads are.  If the file is on disk, it should be relatively trivial.It&#39;s even possible to do this relatively cheaply with Range headers if you&#39;re looking at a tar file stored on an HTTP endpoint, though you&#39;ll likely want to think about some smart pre-fetching behaviour."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Punchline:&gt; My tarball happened to contain over 800 000 links with &#34;..&#34; as a path component. It also happened to contain over 5.4 million hard links.The behavior is more precisely described not as quadratic, but O(n*m), where n is the number of symlinks pointing outside of the extraction directory, and m is the number of hardlinks. It happens because of the security precautions gnu tar performs to make sure a malicious archive can&#39;t set up a symlink pointing to an arbitrary place in your filesystem, and then extract files to it. The strategy they use has an unoptimized corner case when the archive also has a lot of hardlinks.The mechanism could probably be improved by remembering the list of deferred symlinks in a hash map rather than a linked list, but also, both symlinks pointing outside the extraction directory, and hardlinks, are uncommon.(Edited to correct: The problem exists even if the hardlinks do not actually point at the symlinks.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I always used to think there was something magic about these formats (like, only really smart people would design a new format, and my custom csv was somehow ‘less’ than other formats), but now I’m older and I find that it’s just a bunch of files concatenated together to make a new one.The magic is lost, but I feel a lot better about myself :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What a great example of how a series of reasonable decisions can add up to something unreasonable when you scale up the inputs. This line is my favorite: “there was an open task for a few years to address it (T73412), and so I did it.”This situation reminds me a little bit of trying to work with very large images in ImageMagick, like 60k x 60k resolution. A simple resize was taking 6 hours on my mac 10 years ago, due to IM trying to allocate the whole image at once and then swapping non-stop. And then I discovered that the Graphics Magick fork did streamed resizing, and did the task in a couple of minutes. It’s a small and relatively easy change, but someone had to prioritize handling large inputs first. This is one reason software is hard for me; every time I need to process large inputs I wish I had written a streaming mechanism, but every time I start a project I decide to do the easy thing first and wait until I critically need streaming. Maybe it’s the right thing to do to avoid over-engineering, but this comes up often enough that I’m usually in a mild state of frustration about something being under-developed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very happy that Aras is fighting the good fight, doing some great OSS work after his departure from Unity.  The speed up numbers are quite impressive!I remember when I was first getting into shader programming 10+ years ago, I asked a question on the Unity forums and Aras was one of the first to respond.  Even then he was a titanic figure behind Unity’s graphics stack.  I never forgot how kind he was to help a kid like me out, I’m sure he was quite busy!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The speedup factor is order-dependent.This is why it is very difficult to justify optimization work to management. If there are 20 things to optimize that take 10 seconds each, the change isn&#39;t really noticeable until you&#39;re getting past half-way. And once your processing already takes a few minutes, what&#39;s the harm in adding another 10 seconds?"</p>
