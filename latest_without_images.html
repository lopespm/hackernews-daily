								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very nice.Regarding the comments about complexity of existing formats - I agree, with the exception of PNG. In terms of complexity, QOI is very similar to PNG filtering phases, i.e. when you strip primary compression phase (Huffman coding) from PNG.Also, I admire how the author combined a lot of common and cool tricks into QOI:- Block tags form a sort of a prefix code, making it easy to differentiate block types with differing sizes- Look-back array is used (common trick from LZW family)- Delta-coding is used when storing pixel diffs- In the end, if nothing else works, full pixel value is writtenAlso, the fact that everything is byte aligned is very appreciated.This is a breath of fresh air and really impressive how good performance (both processing and size reduction) this gets with so little (very readable!) C."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know you don&#39;t like &#34;design by committee&#34; and overly complex formats. Also, the compression algorithm itself is somewhat independent of the &#34;container format&#34; that it&#39;s used with.However, if I may make a suggestion: If you do end up rolling your own container format for any reason, always include a way to store the colour space of the image!Treating RGB images as arrays of bytes without further tags is like treating char* as &#34;text&#34; without specifying the code page. It could be UTF8. Or Latin-1. Or something else. You don&#39;t know. Other people don&#39;t know. There&#39;s often no way to tell.Similarly with colour spaces: sRGB, Display P3, and Adobe RGB are just close enough to be easily confused, but end up looking subtly wrong if mixed up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; To keep things O(n) when encoding, there&#39;s only one lookup into this array. The lookup position is determined by a “hash” of the rgba value (really just r^g^b^a).Is a bit imprecise.
The algorithm would still be O(n) even with a linear search through the &#34;seen pixel array&#34;, as it is bounded by 64 length and therefore a constant factor that gets eaten by the Big-O notation.Because of this hash the algorythm seems to do something else than first described though.
Instead of &#34;a running array of the 64 pixels it previously encountered&#34;, it&#39;s actually the previous 64 pixel _values_ previously encountered, which allows for much bigger jumpback.By deterministically computing this array during execution it itself seems to act as a kind of compressed jumpback table, allowing for approximated arbitrary jumpback with just 6 bit.Quite impressive!Edit:
I think there might be an interesting tweak that could increase the effectiveness of the hashing technique used.If one were to walk and store the pixels in a Z-Curve order, the runtime would stay the same but the locality of the color value pool, might be increased."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; [10] Make your project robust to re-orgs. A company management hierarchy is inherently fragile (a tree is a 1-connected graph, after all); socialize the project continuously with managers who might take over in the future. Do whatever it takes to make sure that manager churn does not result in unfair career outcomes for ICs.&gt; [17] For storage systems, bias heavily in the beginning towards consistency and durability rather than availability; these are harder to measure and harder to fix if broken. Because availability is easier to measure, there will be external pressure to prioritize it first; push back.It&#39;s kind of crazy how well the author is able to move from the very top to the very bottom of the technical project management stack."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really think this is a great list however I think one of the major factors why this project succeeded isn&#39;t listed but is mentioned in the intro.&gt; We hit production with a 3-person team in less than a year; and subsequently scaled the team to 30+ engineers spanning multiple sub-teamsStarting with a small skilled team to build the core and actively plan for a larger team at some point is absolutely critical for project success in my experience, especially with complex projects like this. That small team can have a much tighter communication loop and all keep a single unified picture of what the end goal is. When the team grows this single unified picture is no longer feasible so it has to be broken down into sections, which is a good thing, but if the core isn&#39;t setup so that the sections are sufficiently decoupled things fall apart quickly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lot of good, actionable learnings there. I liked this one in particular.&gt; [26] In a transparent codebase with quick review cycles, APIs will leak implementation details unless you gate-keep.It&#39;s tempting to make quick fixes to APIs but please take it slow. Think through existing customers as well as how could new ones will use it.Also, something I learned while building/maintaining public APIs was to always clearly document (along with examples) the context in which an API should (ideally) be used and how it combines with other APIs to enable common use cases."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If anything, I think stablecoins are way more dangerous than the author indicates.People talk about things like Bitcoin as a threat to sovereign currencies, and they are, as competitors, of sorts. But stablecoins are another matter entirely. One huge aspect of the value of sovereign currencies is that they are instruments of law -- courts will settle in them as a lowest common denominator, and it is safe to use them in all sorts of settings as a result.When dollar-denominated assets appear, they always run the risk of being considered a dollar-equivalent. For example, bank deposits are dollar-denominated, and are considered dollar-equivalent (even dollar-superior, in the sense that there are transactions that you can&#39;t legally do with specie, only with bank deposits, like buy stocks). That means that if banks (which are businesses) are not good at doing business, the government is essentially forced to treat them as dollar-equivalents by making them whole. See Savings &amp; Loan Crisis, the GFC, LTCG, etc., etc.Stablecoins piggyback on the legal aspects of dollars, and as long as you treat them as dollar-denominated assets, you&#39;re fine. The second you treat them as dollar-equivalents, you run the risk of a change in the value of that asset being something that the government is forced into supporting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder how much of the Crypto hype is because the US banking system still lives in the 1980s or thereabouts.If everybody in the US had access to bank accounts with easy electronic transfers within 5 seconds for no charge, no chargebacks and so on, as people are used to in the EU, would people still be excited about Bitcoin?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most people on HN are rational people who look at the world in a rational way. Bitcoin and friends are not operating in a rational market, therefore we don&#39;t understand them, and most of us would probably be pretty lousy investors since we would try to make decisions rationally instead of memeing and YOLOing.But, and this is a key point, that doesn&#39;t make us right and them wrong. It&#39;s just a different kind of market, one that I am not very good at, but it is for sure possible to make money in it. You just need to be a different kind of person. We can say our way is &#34;better&#34;, but who are we to decide that?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The assumption that the content of the video had something do do with why it was broadcast may not be reasonable. Someone wanting to play the technical prank might well find some of the most random shit available to broadcast, hoping (perhaps mistakenly) that the point would be clear anyway.I think its also possible that the the technically equipped people who did this were perhaps not thinking as clearly as usual that evening. Intoxicants may have been involved. There were some gifted organic chemists working out in the suburbs then."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Before life got in the way, I wanted a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Resource Management as a foundation for a Master&#39;s in Urban Planning. I currently run r/UrbanForestry for the same reason:I don&#39;t think it makes sense to see human settlements as separate from nature. I think of nature as the fabric within which such configurations occur.It isn&#39;t inevitable that human development must be a concrete jungle. You can include plants, permeable surfaces, etc in your plans so people can live more lightly and less intrusively on the land.I also think America has a lot of room for adding back walkable mixed-use neighborhoods where at least some people can live, work and shop in the same neighborhood. Or at least live and shop if they are retirees, teens, or similar groups who aren&#39;t seeking a job or who already work at home or from home in some capacity.Studies suggest this leads to greater wealth in such neighborhoods (such as more sales) and we know vehicle traffic is a significant burden wrt human-caused climate change. Making it possible to skip the long commute makes for a better quality of life and less pollution adding to this issue.We currently frame this issue as a painful choice between short-term gratification and current high quality of life with a long-term cost of global disaster versus short-term sacrifice for slim hope of assuaging our guilt with no guarantee of real improvement in the future. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s necessary.I&#39;ve lived without a car in the US for more than a decade. I think you can live that way and live well. I think we can design and build a world that provides a high quality of life for people and doesn&#39;t destroy the environment in the process."</p>

The decline is certainly sad to see and already rather visible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m Danish and not at all interested in the politics of it, but there can be a case for teaching algebra late. We do it in Denmark, because it’s the subject children have the hardest time learning, and having too many of them fail too early kills their interest in math. We still teach algebra in grade 7-9, but we’ve gone through the social experiments of teaching it at different ages, and have lost entire generations because it was taught too soon.I don’t think social justice or equality should play a part of the argument, but it’s always hard to tell where the legislation ends and the propaganda begins these days, and I’m honestly no interested enough to read the 800 page document this article is about.I will say, however, that I think we’re going to have problems teaching math until we reform the school system to be suited for the modern world instead of the early 1900’s “assembly line” society. It makes no sense to place children in classes based on their age, and certainly not for all subjects.The result is always going to be that both slow and brilliant students get fucked over, in a myriad of ways, especially if they are a mix of good and bad at different subjects.Why exactly is it that you aren’t taught courses like math, or history or language according to your ability instead of your age?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These superficial debates are in my eyes futile since they presuppose: &#34;We ought to have a strict curriculum for a certain narrow age group.&#34;After what we have learned the last 30-50 years from cognitive sciences one has to wonder what schools are actually for, nowadays. There are most certainly not optimized for &#34;learning&#34; by any means. 
Imho to put it blatantly schools are reduced to be a effective stronghold for indoctrination. They justify their power by using &#34;science, technology, art, literature, history, social community, cultural exchange ...&#34;. Of course sheer by its power and scope we certainly &#34;learn&#34; something there. And you also happen to find great teachers in that system but its certainly not its main purpose.Going back historically, schools still remain inherently (and shockingly so) medieval institutions. Interestingly &#34;school&#34; originally stems from the greek word of σχολή (/skʰo.lɛ̌ː/) which simply means &#34;free time, leisure&#34; which got hijacked by the church with &#34;monastic schools&#34; and today &#34;school&#34; means quite the opposite.Throughout its (western) history with changing society they were succesful adaptions made (Prussian system, Humboldt&#39;s Ideal, Montessori pedagogy) skyrocketing literacy, expolding number of scientists etc.But today the educational system is massively outpaced by the societal changes and by failing simply regresses to its medieval core of indoctrination (&#34;preparation for the labor market&#34;).No scientific literacy (aka critical thinking, controversial debates), no &#34;learning&#34; grounded on cognitive sciences, no hearing and tending to the needs of our young which they can perfectly articulate."</p>

Boring, and too prone to failure if the project runs into trouble at any point in time.What I&#39;d prefer to see is a space construction that is continuous. Imagine a ring station, but one that is cellular in nature- lots of smaller modules that together form the huge station. This allows one to construct and add further modules over time, growing as needed.The beauty of this design principle is that we could start today. Design the first iteration of these modules, with the intent to fit them into SpaceX&#39;s Starship (or whatever heavy rockets come next). Launch 10 or 20 of them, connect them, and spin them up to 1/5th gravity, something not too hard to do. Add modules in the centre of the ring that are zero-G, where zero-G things can be done- but allowing those who live on station to live in mild gravity at least.All the while, you can dream big. You can plan for how this station goes from 10 or 20 small modules to thousands."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was thinking about these drawings yesterday when I saw the mockup of a ring made from 32 Starship fuselages.  Welded end to end, 32 pieces would net a 1/4 mile diameter ring with a volume ~85x the ISS.Elon estimates that the refueling procedure necessary for interplanetary starship missions would require 8 fuel tanker starship launches, but this could be cut in half if the tankers were stripped of the elements needed for reentry and landing.I could see the economics working out to where it would make more sense to launch stripped down single use fuel tanker starships, and then sell the empty orbiting shells to someone interested in building in space.https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2021/11/17/science-upside...."</p>
