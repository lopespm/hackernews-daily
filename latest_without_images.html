								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some really good thoughts here. I&#39;ll summarize the ones that hit me:- &#34;Why are people searching Reddit specifically? The short answer is that Google search results are clearly dying. The long answer is that most of the web has become too inauthentic to trust.&#34;This is it for me exactly. I search for the following kinds of things on Reddit exactly because results on other sites aren&#39;t trustworthy: Reviews are secretly paid ads. The &#34;best&#34; recipe for pancakes is only what&#39;s trending on instagram right now. The latest conditions on mountain bike and hiking trails are being shared inside communities like Reddit but not on the web. The same for trending programmer tools.- &#34;It is obvious that serving ads creates misaligned incentives for search engines...&#34;What I&#39;m shocked by is that Google somehow maintained a balance on this for so long. Well, at least a good enough balance that people still use it primarily.- &#34;Google increasingly does not give you the results for what you typed in. It tries to be “smart” and figure out what you “really meant&#34; ...&#34;This is the most annoying behavior because I really mean what I write.- &#34;There’s a fun conspiracy theory that popped up recently called the Dead Internet Theory...&#34;I hadn&#39;t heard of this. Now that&#39;s some sci-fi level of conspiracy but in today&#39;s world it seems totally plausible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An important thing to realize, too, is that this is a problem that keeps getting worse. The article talks about product reviews and recipes, but it&#39;s been spreading a lot further than that. Recently I was trying to look up a technical error, and found a lot of web pages that seemed to be auto-generated with &#34;How to solve [error_scraped_from_the_web]&#34;, complete with a list of generic things unrelated to the error (IE, &#34;Step one: try turning your computer off and turning it back on again. This is usually a good first step, and you&#39;ll be surprised at how often...&#34;).Likewise, I wonder how long appending &#34;Reddit&#34; will work. As others have pointed out, Reddit shills are already relatively common, and it&#39;s becoming increasingly common for bot accounts to create lots of random comments to appear to be human (such as finding a thread with thousands of comments, then copying and pasting the comment to another place in the thread or to another thread, or auto-generating a simple sentence based on other comments in the thread).Sometimes the advertising hordes move so fast they kill something before it even takes off, like what happened with Clubhouse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google used to be really, really good at finding exactly what I told it to find. Nowadays, it&#39;s turned into the yellow pages; sponsored content from businesses trying to sell me goods and services.Can people suggest good alternatives or search patterns for certain categories of information or search types?Some of the search patterns I currently I use:* Youtube for product reviews and demos, entertainment, music and educational material.* Google with site:reddit.com at the start for questions best answered by other humans; crowd-sourced answers, authentic replies from mostly real people.* Google with site:news.ycombinator.com if I want to find &#34;forum-like&#34; discussion on topics I&#39;m interested in.* Google Image search with site:amazon.co.uk when looking for niche products I need to buy, because Amazon&#39;s search is so incredibly broken and game-ified.What I&#39;m having a heck of a time finding is technical content; long-form programming tutorials, deep dives into academic concepts (I do a lot of signal/audio processing and search for blog posts related to these topics), circuit schematics, electronic engineering content. These used to exist on enthusiast forums 10-15 years ago, but Google often no longer surfaces hits from these forums, both because the content is old and the forum model is dying. Reddit is the &#34;replacement&#34; but it plagued with low-effort &#34;look at my thing&#34; posts that help nobody."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Marketing.The one thing I pushed off for as long as possible. Because it was always easier to build more, than it was to go into marketing / sales.No clever tricks, or growth hacks. Me and my cofounders just connected with everyone we could on LinkedIn, twitter, discord, etc. and talked to people about the product: https://rysolv.com/.In fact, part of the reason we delayed marketing was looking for some clever way to 10x, or make it go viral. A big motivator was Paul Graham&#39;s &#34;do things that don&#39;t scale&#34; post [1]. So we just sat down and talked to people.[1] http://paulgraham.com/ds.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It might sound dumb, but monetizing my site was the stepping stone to make it take off. I run a solitaire website called https://online-solitaire.com/ that ran for a few years without me earning any money from it. I kind of thought that no-one earned money from banner ads anymore, so I didn&#39;t even bother with them.One day I decided to try it out and earned around $1000 the first month. That gave me the boost to spent time improving the site, optimizing speed and improving SEO. A couple of years later, the site is now earning $10k+ a month ."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Commoditize your complement&#34;I had hosting issues in many of my companies and consulting projects, running from &#34;WTF is this AWS bill $10k???&#34; to &#34;WTF did our 10gbit/s download just kick Heroku offline?&#34;But people can only appreciate the things I build for them if they are hosted well. So I took the obvious next step and purchased a small struggling hosting company. We then introduced nicer tooling that imitates the AWS and Heroku APIs if possible, to make using their servers as easy as possible for me. And now I can offer managed hosting to all of my consulting clients. For them, it&#39;s slightly cheaper prices and (in contrast with AWS and Heroku) they can just call me when things don&#39;t work. And for me, it&#39;s reliable high-margin revenue."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was really close to becoming a Linode customer last week for several large boxes, but ended up buying hardware and self-hosting.The cost to cut in an enterprise fiber link (1000/400) to our office was surprisingly low.My experience trialling linode as a paying customer was really positive (VERY competitive price, great performance), only complaint being their NodeBalancer can’t automatically handle certificates like CF and AWS can.Also, it needs to be mentioned because there’s a lot of negative in this thread: HUGE shout out to Linode for being massive community supporters and donating HEAPS of free compute to uni clubs and such, pretty much anyone with a charity certificate who asks for it. Fantastic company that’s easy to ‘just talk to people’ rather than trying to find the right support silo."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Happy linode user since 2004 when I was 13 years old. Has always been my go-to for just having a linux vps running somewhere in the cloud.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve done this a few times, some things to think about if you decide to take the plunge.1. New backs aren&#39;t always made well, often with the mounting posts not lining up as well as they should.2. New batteries are a crap shoot. Most don&#39;t last as long nor are rated as high as advertised. On the 5g and later, you can put in a much larger battery in them, but you need the thicker case.3. If you mod an iPod mini, use a higher quality sd to compact flash adapter. The cheaper ones, end up having weird issues when transferring files.4. If Rockbox seems temperamental it&#39;s not just you. It can take a bit to work out the issues it has with your iPod, from buggy themes to random crashes.5. If your music doesn&#39;t play right through Rockbox (clipped music) or playing music on rockbox seems to crash device, the issue was the file transfer. To fix, reboot the iPod to the stock Apple Firmware, delete the old files, and then transfer them again. Apple firmware handles file transfers much better than Rockbox.6. If your iPod hasn&#39;t been charged in a long time, it might not come up when first connected to power. Sometimes, leaving the iPod attached to power for a day or two will allow it to get enough charge to get into actual recharge mode. Older models re"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The big thing here is the concept of a device doing ONE thing and doing it well. Is there a name for that?I&#39;ve been rocking an iPod Video for like 15 years and it is still my go-to music device. All the stereos in my office, house and shop have a 3.5mm cable hanging from them.I&#39;ve also been using rockbox so I can play FLAC files. The ipod is on it&#39;s 4th battery at this point and I&#39;ve also upgraded to SD cards from the internal HD about 6 years ago. The screen is not working in a few places now, but the thing keeps working and I&#39;d be very sad if it ever stopped because I&#39;m not sure what would replace it.Whenever I&#39;m programming and I feel like I&#39;ve been very productive, it&#39;s often the times I&#39;m using this ipod with headphones - instead of a music playing piece of software. Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m less inclined to open up the software and spend time choosing an album/podcast/etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve debated buying another standalone portable music player for some time (about ten years after I got my first smartphone and stupidly gave my Sansa Fuze+ to a friend, who promptly lost it), but none of them really tick all the boxes for me.I want:- A high-quality DAC- A headphone jack- Expandable memory or a ridiculously large HDD (I have about a terabyte of music)- A modern connector/charging port (like USB-C)- 20+ hours of battery lifeThe problem I have is that resurrecting old devices like an iPod or a Sansa falls back onto era of proprietary chargers, which I worry about losing and not being able to find replacements.On the other hand, I periodically search for &#34;newer&#34; audiophile player devices, and a bunch of them feel like Android phones without the phone part. I don&#39;t want a smartphone OS, because then the battery life is inevitably going to be many times worse than the standalone mp3 player batteries of old. I don&#39;t need an app store, or a battery-sucking high quality display screen for watching videos. I just want it to play my music."</p>

					<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30335455">Ask HN: Why is Firefox losing marketshare and how would you save it?</a></h3>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30335455">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"They should focus on saving Firefox.- Cut out all (or at the very least, most) initiatives that don&#39;t serve the goal of promoting Firefox&#39;s market share or sustainability going forward- Donate the major money drains that aren&#39;t Firefox to the Apache Foundation or another worthy custodian- Fire all inessential staff that don&#39;t want to work on Firefox.- Get a CEO/upper management that are in it for the passion, not the money, and cut their salaries (bonuses tied directly to increase in Firefox market share).- Make sure that all donations from now on are redirected to things that support Firefox development and nothing else, period.- Make whatever partnerships are needed to have a steady stream of income, be that donation or selling out to Google or Bing.Firefox is in trouble. Firefox is also Mozilla&#39;s raison d&#39;être, and they should embrace that. We as a community, cannot afford to let Firefox languish until the only browsers in the world are Chromium derivatives. The diversity of truly independent browser engines is far too important to give up without a fight."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My thoughts on this are that every time I see a news piece about Firefox it&#39;s about &#34;social justice&#34;, some code of conduct controversy, or something else utterly unimportant to web browser selection.Being &#34;Open Source&#34; does nothing for me when Firefox engages in the same crap as other closed source browsers, like Pocket. Mozilla also allowed social issues to take precedence over retaining good engineers. Whether you like it or not, even assholes have a basic right to exist and the more recent culture of shun and cancel has had negative consequences for society as a whole. Maybe they were assholes, but I don&#39;t give a shit how nice the developers who made my web browser are.I suppose the problem with Mozilla is the CEO/people who make decisions about Firefox, replace them and maybe Firefox could be revived. But I have extraordinary doubts that Firefox is salvageable at this point. Mozilla&#39;s priorities have strayed so far from mine that I cannot see them becoming something I care about any time soon. I suspect it is similar for others.There is not one issue with Firefox, the people in charge are not competent. It&#39;s mistake after mistake after mistake. These mistakes are a direct result of prioritizing diversity over talent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would:- Prioritise getting the new extension framework fully functional. And continue innovating on the capabilities that are exposed. Especially on mobile where the new fenix engine is still limited to a small whitelist of extensions- Sort out the multi-profile story. Container tabs are great, but the chrome model is also a great fit for many workflow (e.g. different people in a house or home vs. work profiles).- Try and work on making Gecko easily embeddable again. Webkit/Blink gets all the attention because it&#39;s easy to embed into things. I suspect Gecko needs to compete in this market if it hopes to survive. It needs to have more than one company invested in it.This ship has probably sailed now as they&#39;ve fired most of their Rust and Servo teams. But IMO they ought to have created a rust-based cross-platform UI framework. They tried to do it web-based with Firefox OS but that was too slow. But with a Rust solution I think they could have owned both the mobile and desktop application spaces, which could potentially have made them a bootload of money and been a huge win for linux."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We never hear about broken and worn-out products. Pretty much all gear nowadays is baseline ok, it’s the negatives that really set things apart.For once, let&#39;s turn it all upside down:We should build a collection about how things break - review broken and worn-out products to teach how to identify cheap products. That&#39;s why I built failscout.coIt&#39;s simple: You upload your broken products and quickly describe how long you owned them, how often you used them, and where they failed.Everything breaks eventually, but when it does, can you easily repair/fix it? That&#39;s why users can suggest a fix to a broken/inconvenienced product.What could we do with all this data?- Identifying the common failure modes of product- Collect fixes for common product failures- See if a product&#39;s quality has changed or gone down at some point- Add a simple JSON API so other sites and projects can leverage our data."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a fan of the exit review.  Something that is no longer being used (for any reason) and there is now perspective.  I first saw bunnie do it at https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=242 quoting the first two paragraphs:&gt; I think it’s time to start a new kind of gadget review: the exit review.&gt; Gadgets always seem to arrive on the scene with a lot of splash and hype, but rarely do you find an article telling you how the gadget fared in Real Life. The Exit Review is something I’m going to try doing every time I retire a major gadget of mine; the idea of it is to reflect upon how the gadget performed over its duration of service. Of course, reviews like this are all hindsight, so they don’t drive sales — which probably explains why nobody does them, because there’s no money to be made doing them. However, as a design engineer I think there are lessons to be learned through reflection, and as a consumer I believe that apples don’t fall to far from the tree — a good gadget maker will get my business again, and a bad one will never see another dime from me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"i love the idea of the site but i would like to see one change.  Instead of adding a product when it breaks, let someone add it when they buy it then send a yearly reminder of the products they have added and if they want to update their status.  this would have the benefit of:
-tracking % of product failures
-finding out if they function longer then they are needed.
-finding out which products outlast others before they get to the point failure
-potentially notify/warn users of potential issues that come up to before theirs breaksI think a lot of people dont care enough to upload info just to help product designers, some will do it to help out other consumers, but if you can provide more value to the person with the product you want info on that should get you the most engagement."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You can read and write binary, including null, in pure bash, without even subshells, let alone external processes like dd and xxd.This is a driver/client for a vintage portable disk drive that has an rs232 interface. Any disk drive obviously has to handle arbitrary data including binary including 0x00.It&#39;s entirely in native bash with no external tools and not even any subshells. It does have to call stty and mkfifo once at startup, but that&#39;s just startup like to open the serial port, not part of the work.https://github.com/bkw777/pdd.shThe gimmick for reading nulls is not exactly efficient. Basically you read one character at a time and look at the errorlevel from read to detect the difference between &#34;got nothing&#34; and &#34;got 0x00&#34;It&#39;s fine for this case because the drive is so slow and small that even the entire disk is only  200k max. Making bash read one byte at a time for 200k is still nothing today but only because hardware is insane today.But it&#39;s possible. And the beginning of the post does say &#34;as a thought experiment&#34;.Similarly, you don&#39;t need xxd to convert back &amp; forth between raw binary and text encoding.My own similar thought experiment included the idea that, if I&#39;m not going to use any external process I can possibly avoid and only use internal bash features, on the flip side of that, I will squeez bash for all it&#39;s worth, allow every bashism possible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Long ago I worked tech support for a company that supported some mainframe equipment.Eventually after some incidents they introduced “special instructions” for customers who we had to gather extra troubleshooting data for because of some complex issues they had.Then a few more customers had special instructions… and a few more.Eventually these involved things like “Send the account manager an email for each call, this customer is very sensitive.”After just a year EVERY account had special instructions.Many people oriented instructions were impossible to follow “Page Jim.”  Jim didn’t carry a pager anymore and when he did he would never respond so you couldn’t do step 2.Some involved gathering loads of memory dumps for issues long solved.  Others would have you follow program pointers to memory that didn’t exist so you would start over and over until you gave up and decided failing to do your job was preferable to losing your mind at 4am….Some instructions were multi page word documents expected to be read every time the customer called.  After reading it a dozen times a week it almost became impossible to notice if it had a slight change or not.One clever account manager trying to make sure tech support “noticed” his special instructions tried using a &lt;blink&gt; tag… entirely ignoring the issue that upon noticing the instructions they would be hard to read.   Thankfully the tag failed to work.As you can imagine eventually there were exasperated executive meetings about how nobody follows the special instructions.This is the world of protecting against corner cases."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; designing a human process around pathological cases leads to processes that are themselves pathological.Very true.I remember, back when I was still interested in helping companies succeed, one “interview” I had.I mentioned that I had this ginormous portfolio, packed with dozens of highly relevant, finished, tested, well-documented, well-designed open-source projects, a decade of checkin history, of tens of thousands of lines of code, hundreds of pages of documentation, dozens of articles on various sites, where I walk through my design philosophies and processes, in detail, teaching modules, etc.The “interviewer” told me that they were not going to look at it, because “I could have faked it.”My jaw dropped.If I could fake that, then you should hire me immediately, at three times your offered salary.I’m pretty sure that the decision had already been made, not to consider me (because eld), and this was their way of chasing me off. They weren’t going to waste the half hour or so, that it would take to do a quick review of my work.It worked a treat. I couldn’t hang up, fast enough. I won’t go where I’m not wanted.The other explanation, is that they actually believed what they said, which would mean they were completely insane."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Headline on the front page of BBC News right now: &#34;Trudeau vows to freeze anti-mandate protesters&#39; bank accounts&#34; https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-60383385This feels downright dystopian, especially if the move away from cash and towards centrally-controlled electronic payment systems is anywhere near as widespread in Canada as elsewhere."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When protests were happening in India this is what Trudeau had to say:&#34;Let me remind you, Canada will always be there to defend the rights of peaceful protesters. We believe in the process of dialogue. We’ve reached out through multiple means to the Indian authorities to highlight our concerns. This is a moment for all of us to pull together,&#34;Justin Trudeau said.https://indianexpress.com/article/india/situation-is-concern..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The Emergencies Act is the modern-day replacement to the War Measures Act. It allows the federal government to force companies to provide services, it can require public protests to end, and limit mobility rights by preventing people from moving to designating areas.&gt;&gt; The act also allows for the military to be used as police, but several sources said that is not under active consideration.Not a good look for Trudeau. This definitely looks like an authoritarian response to a loss of mandate. The protestors will dig in more, the response will become harsher, and the government will be in deeper trouble."</p>
