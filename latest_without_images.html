								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great letter. Wanna bet it was completely ignored? Glad to see it here. Maybe it won&#39;t be ignored.Librarians rock. There&#39;s even a show about them[0], Starring Number One.I can&#39;t access the gMail account I set up, because I made a mistake, when setting the password, and did not save the one I used.It will not allow me to access the account I set up.After a while, I just gave up. I am satisfied that someone can&#39;t use my gMail address to impersonate me (because even I can&#39;t get it). I have plenty of other eMail accounts.[0] https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3663490/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"About a decade ago, a broken iPhone caused me to experience how bad Google&#39;s MFA reset process was — there were multiple _years_ where the “hard landing” form triggered a flow which sent an email to an internal mailbox which didn&#39;t exist! — and while I was able to use printed backup codes after I returned home the experience left me concerned enough that I went to one of their identity group&#39;s public meetings here in DC.One of the things which I was struck by was how unseriously they appeared to view their role in modern life. People were generally very casual about the need and were especially uninterested in anything which required them to work with outside parties.My suggestion was that they consider a protocol where trusted civic authorities could be allowed to confirm someone&#39;s identity, which sounds like it would be useful for this case: let the person initiate a mediated reset flow where someone like a librarian, police officer, etc. could authenticate in their official capacity and check a box saying that they&#39;ve confirmed the photo ID for the person standing in front of them. Most of the benefits from MFA are preventing things like phishing attacks which are also stymied by limiting it to people in your geographic area, although you might want to disable this for high-risk people enrolled in Google&#39;s Advanced Protection Program."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps the solution is for libraries or local authorities to setup their own email providers. An email address “for life” with your library card, with the necessary support and in-person reset verification that their patrons need. I’m not suggesting this would be an easy or inexpensive undertaking, but maybe that’s just the next step in service evolution for a public information service like a library group."</p>

Anything you can do to break the dopamine loop helps, however small it may be. I&#39;ve had success with:- setting long passwords to social media that aren&#39;t autofilled (saved in bitwarden) and logging out after each session- nerfing addicting parts of webapps (plugins which block the facebook news feed but allow messaging/groups helped a TON)- forbidding dedicated social media apps and only using &#34;worse&#34; internet sites- router DNS blockers, even if I can get around them, the act of having to bypass it raises my awareness I&#39;m doing something subpar for myself"</p>

Reading his post had a major impact on me—since then I have always thought differently about the time I spend online.It’s interesting how people, including myself, try to justify various addictions. How am I supposed to stay informed about important topics without the news? How do I know how to help people in need without knowing what’s going on? There are much, much better ways than reading CNN/NYTimes every day. Also, there really is nothing new about the human condition today compared to a hundred years ago.[1] http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/hatethenews"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well this is... eerie. I just released Stictionary[1] on Friday.It is an offline, ad free, dictionary that remembers words you look up. It gives a word of the day and provides (admittedly underfeatured atm) flashcards to review your word lists. It includes optional syncing to keep your word lists across devices. I&#39;ve been holding off posting about it while i complete the website[2].Love to see someone else had such a similar idea. Great confirmation of the unmet need in the space. Really awesome execution as well. Congrats on the launch!On a personal note, i built Stictionary after tracking all the words i looked up manually for years. Now i have an app that does it for me (and was a blast to build).1: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stictionary/id1613214660?platf...2: https://www.stictionary.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Actually, iOS already has built-in support for dictionary and thesaurus. In any native text input field, select a word and choose Define or Look Up. The choice of dictionary is customizable; I usually choose New Oxford American Dictionary and Oxford Dictionary of English (not to be confused with the venerable Oxford English Dictionary). They are high quality dictionaries. They are basically the same except that the pronunciation for the latter is in IPA which I&#39;m more used to.When I need to look up a word, I create a new note from control center, type in the word, double tap to bring up the contextual menu and then the dictionary.It pretty much checks all the boxes. For distraction-free reading, turn off &#34;Content from Apple&#34; in the Siri settings to avoid those obnoxious Siri knowledge panels."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"After a discussion with a lawyer friend (not australia, canada, so tangentially related), the &#34;presumption of innocence&#34; that would not obligate this person to have or produce a key for whatever gibberish someone sends to their devices, is what&#39;s known in legal circles as a &#34;principle of fundamental justice,&#34; and it is not a right that is either absolute or inaliable the way that american rights are set up.One doesn&#39;t need to agree with the persons cause to recognize this is another extreme overstepping of authority on the part of that government to mandate that the people who communicate with the person subject to this order may also not protect their own commuications from interception, and that the person subject to the order must somehow produce a key for whatever data gets sent to him.Given the cynical application of laws and their moderating charter exceptions in places like Australia and Canada over the last few years, I could forsee a new republican movement emerging in commonwealth countries, as it&#39;s pretty clear CAN/AUS/NZ have dispensed with notions of fundamental justice, and have a &#34;so sue me,&#34; approach to legislation and governance, as this stuff is just too stupid to be reasoned with. The language means nothing, the principles mean nothing. It&#39;s no longer about tech, it&#39;s about what our options are when the state has demonstrated official contempt for the people it ostensibly serves."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note these are bail conditions (so presumably an alternative to a much more constrained existence in prison) for a charge that indicates potential for inflicting severe economic damage after organization via communication devices.When compared to bail conditions for other charged crimes which may also be strict and context-related (eg. trackers or keeping distance from a victim of violence) it sounds tough (and right to be strictly monitored under rights laws) but not necessarily unreasonable.Is it wrong/excessive/draconian? Possibly. But I don&#39;t think a knee-jerk assumption that it is any of those things is appropriate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not unexpected from the state that banned encryption, gives the police the right to modifiy, add and remove files from your devices.And can also force its citizens to implement backdoors and basically be spies even in foreign countries and companies."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a (thankfully mild) inherited retina disorder. If you read the part about lasers and eye damage it’s basically that, but the “lasers” are faulty genes rather than anything external causing the eye damage. And I can verify that at first my brain did an incredibly good job at error-correcting over it, but in the last couple years it’s finally been able to “peek through”. One day I was hiking and suddenly had black spots in my vision. Then after that I woke up one morning and noticed large black halos in my vision that went away after a couple seconds of being awake. A couple weeks later and I started getting flashing visual artifacts in the edge of my vision.Which is/was terrifying because I didn’t know this was a multi-decade process I was just becoming aware of and instead assumed that if I just noticed this much visual degradation in a couple weeks then surely I’ll be completely blind in a couple more?  Thankfully that’s not how it works, the damage has been increasing at a slow steady constant, it’s just that the processes in place to correct for said damage do a _really_ good job at hiding it, until they don’t, so the rate of degradation seems much worse than it actually is.That said, please if you notice any new visual artifacts get them checked up on _immediately_, while my case is a slow genetic issue sometimes it’s a detached retina, which can happen for any number of reasons and can usually be reversed quite easily with surgery if caught early.  I was “lucky” mine was genetic rather than physical trauma, since I didn’t go see someone until things got noticeably worse."</p>

The Asahi team don’t have support for everything yet (notably no GPU) but what they do have support for seems to be high quality, well integrated with Linux’s conventions, and upstreamed into the mainline kernel! How much other hardware can claim that?The Asahi developers have also stated that Apple tends to keep hardware peripheral interfaces stable across generations (they speculate that this is to keep things easy for their own OS dev teams), and that this has so far proven to be true for M2 (and several iPhone generations before that), and thus once support is available , it should stay relevant for some time.Given this, it seems like MacBooks could easily end up becoming the laptop of choice for Linux developers in the years to come."</p>

There&#39;s a ton of geopolitical pressure in this direction. The US simply doesn&#39;t want to be dependent on Taiwan for chips, for obvious reasons.Intel knows this and is trying to become the TSMC of the west. And frankly they&#39;re the only ones that can pull it off. I&#39;d be surprised if 10 years from now the majority of their revenue comes from selling processors rather than fabricating them for AMD, NVIDIA, etc. Why compete when there&#39;s plenty of steak for everyone?"</p>

Unfortunately I needed money to cover my basic living expenses and had to sell all my shares about a year later. Even at the time, it was painful because I had spent a lot of time researching AMD and I was very optimistic about Lisa Su based on her background and her tenacity.I could have made maybe 20x on my investment... Still, I don&#39;t feel regret. You can only regret things if you had a choice and I know that there&#39;s no way I could have avoided selling those shares."</p>
