								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Zotero is one of those pieces of open source software that has really improved my life. I first discovered it as a teenager and it revolutionised writing papers and managing sources. Sadly I don’t find myself using it that much in my job.I always got a kick out of introducing it to my friends in the humanities and blowing their minds. I have no idea how anyone writes papers without zotero or another similar tool.
Keep up the good work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using this in beta for quite a while.  The PDF reader is really very good, and I love the fact that my highlights and notes are not added to the actual PDF file.  (I don&#39;t want to mess up the original PDF file, because I like to keep those files in pristine form so that e.g. I can share them with students.)Some people here are asking about paying for storage for the PDFs.  My solution to this is to store my PDFs using Dropbox, and to use links in Zotero.  That way, even if I give up on Zotero, I still have the files.  And I already pay for Dropbox, and just don&#39;t want one more bill to pay.And, woohoo, an iOS app!  That&#39;s very sweet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not just for scholarly reference management: Zotero is a great tool to keep track of the books you have if your personal library exceeds one or two Billies in volume. For books printed after 1970 the ISBN alone is enough to have it fetch the most relevant metadata for any book published anywhere from online catalogues. I find Zotero particularly useful when going to a book-fair; it is easy to export a list of titles and authors of books you own so you can easily reference it to see which books from a particular author or series you already have."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recently discovered VisiData and I&#39;m on a huge TUI kick right now because of it.  I know GUIs have their advantages and I use them, but opening a file in vim or VisiData at light speed feels so good compared to firing up IntelliJ or some spreadsheet program.  Good keybindings make working in the program a joy.  These tools are often made by hackers/for hackers, not some corporate structure trying to pad their resume with whatever new feature looks good but works like shit that nobody asked for.  When people developing the tool are also using the tool you get a good tool; this isn&#39;t exclusive to TUIs but it&#39;s common and it&#39;s one of the reasons that when they work they work so well.https://www.visidata.org/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the low-power aspect of TUIs, but the problem I have with using them over GUI software is there is no launcher or start menu functionality for TUI (re)discovery. I&#39;ll often find a cool TUI posted here, install it &#34;for later&#34; and then proceed to forget I ever installed it. When &#34;for later&#34; finally comes around, I have to guess the name using tab completion or open my browser, search my history and hope it&#39;s there.Is there such a thing as a TUI launcher out there? Something that allows fuzzy search of program names, tags and a short description (using something akin to .desktop files for the application metadata). Then, when I suddenly need a program for a certain task, I don&#39;t have to hope I memorized the correct command. I just open my TUI launcher, type something related to my task and get a list of some TUIs that could help."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For anyone who wants to add graphics to their TUI, notcurses is pushing the boundaries of what&#39;s possible and viable in a terminal. Still could use some bindings for higher-level languages and ergonomics. It also degrades pretty gracefully depending on terminal capabilities.Check out notcurses-demo and see what you can pull off in a terminal. My only gripe is that tmux degrades significantly. Regardless, dankamongmen is an awesome dude bringing back the demoscene vibes.https://piped.kavin.rocks/watch?v=dcjkezf1ARYhttps://github.com/dankamongmen/notcurses"</p>

					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30708505">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here. Thanks for all the feedback.I&#39;m aware that Lapce lacks lots of basic stuff. It&#39;s a personal project so the initial set of features and key bindings are tight to my personal preferences.I&#39;m currently working on the missing pieces, like multi cursor support(in master but not released yet), mouse support, sane default key bindings(probably I&#39;ll stick to an existing editor), basic UX etc.Feel free to submit a feature request or bug report in Github Issues or leave your feedback here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nowadays when I see &#34;written in Rust&#34; in the title, it reads like special pleading: &#34;It&#39;s maybe not as good as what you use, but we are really proud to have got it working at all.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just tried it, on Linux.
Pro:- a single binary you can drop in ~/bin- native Linux version- really, really fast- git branches in the top bar by defaultCons (beside being super new and lacking ecosystem):- Use a custom window border, which is also pretty ugly IMO- cannot use arrow keys in the command palette (or any file dialog). I guess it&#39;s a bug?- default key bindings are... weird? ctrl+f doesn&#39;t prompt a find box for example- cannot make syntax highlight work even on common formats like MarkDown, JSON or YAMLSo, it feels very immature but for sure it is a great starting point, if I get good syntax highlight and code completion with a LSP (although it should already work) I might see me switching from VS Code to it, at least partially."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30712215">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The court only confirmed what we already know – that &#34;open source&#34; is a term of art for software that has been licensed under a specific type of license, and whether a license is an OSI-approved license is a critically important factor in user adoption of the software.The court confirmed no such things. The decisions expressed in these two documents regarding the use of &#34;open source&#34; as a description of the product in question hinge upon the fact that someone else&#39;s software was released under a new license by Defendant, who had no authority to do so.The court did not care to define open source, except to clarify that a license used previously by the Plaintiff is an open source license, and a license used subsequently is not. The court also did not consider any license-approving practices, let alone those of the Open Source Institute, of whom I find no mention in either document used to justify OSI&#39;s claim."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the salient point of the article is this:&gt; However, the court held that it was improper for the defendants to remove the Commons Clause, and therefore the defendants’ claims in advertising that its ONgDB software was open source was false advertising.&gt; Even though the AGPL has a clause specifically allowing downstream recipients to remove &#34;further restrictions&#34; like the Commons Clause, the court stopped the defendant from doing just that.The decision of the trial court reads:&gt; Section 7 of the Sweden Software License only permits a downstream licensee to remove &#34;further restrictions&#34; added by an upstream licensee to the original work.&#34;Sweden Software License&#34; here refers to the AGPL+Commons Clause.Archive link: https://web.archive.org/web/20220317154012/https://opensourc...AGPL: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t like that OSI seems to somehow come away with this (at least as framed here) with control of the term. I agree just calling whatever nonsense open-source is problematic, but I don&#39;t agree it has to be one of their licenses to be open source at all."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Suppose you want to do something anonymously.1. Download installer from Mozilla from your home network - Mozilla now has your home IP and installer ID.2. Transfer it via USB key to a secure, anonymous computer - one not linked to you, on a network not associated with you, such as public WiFi.3. Install Firefox using that installer on said computer. It transmits the installer ID to Mozilla, which matches the one given to your home IP, thereby deanonymizing you.4. Mozilla receives a warrant for this information, or it is hacked, or the organization is infiltrated by a single government or corporate spy.Edit: It gets worse. Suppose a newspaper IT department takes care of providing Firefox and other trusted software installers to their reporters. Now Mozilla can determine who that newspaper helped with IT, such as journalists or sources. Or if you provide trusted software to your friends, Mozilla gets part of your social graph."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t understand why this is news?Spyware watchdog posted about this years ago. It&#39;s been in there at least since 2016, and every time you open Firefox (not start!) it will happily broadcast its geo position information to their geolocation backend.The same goes for the WebRTC related STUN servers, which are always connected to when Firefox starts.I mean, come on folks. Never trust any software blindly. Use MITM proxy to verify. Use a host firewall like opensnitch.For the moment the best alternative is ungoogled chromium with ublock origin, even though the CSP headers cannot influence the DNS resolver mechanics in the CEF code.I am still busy forking webkit into retrokit and it&#39;s a shitload of work to remove these tracking features. [1] But a project like this needs more privacy like minded people.I mean, even the TOR people kind of gave up on this. Just look at their codebase, trying to stub everything anew with upstream changes.There&#39;s no point in trying to race against chrome in &#34;whose browser has the most features&#34;, you can&#39;t win anyways. I don&#39;t care about WebGL or WebGPU, I don&#39;t care about WebRTC, I just want privacy back.[1] https://github.com/tholian-network/retrokit"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m posting anonymously for obvious reasons.I&#39;ve been working at Mozilla since its inception. And eventually left the company 2 years ago.And I&#39;m so mad.Mozilla is not the Mozilla that was created almost 20 years ago. It&#39;s not the same people there. After the Firefox 4 nightmare, they started hiring product managers from big corp. We started seeing some ex-twitter, ex-microsoft, ex-amazon joining the company. People with more professional ambitions. We didn&#39;t know how to react to Google Chrome and the smartphone revolution. We all trusted the upper management, but upper management was slowly becoming non-mozillians.And an absurd mechanic started: original engineer were busy writing difficult code. upper-management was morphing into some BS silicon valley gang. New young engineers were hired, and they thought the core of Mozilla values lied in these upper-management people. And slowly the original engineers started leaving, leaving behind this BS people with these young engineers.Marketing became &#34;how to show we&#39;re good people&#34;. LGBT, women right, etc etc. Who gives a shit about Mozilla standing for these values? It&#39;s all marketing. The real only value, the manifesto, burnt a long time ago.Don&#39;t get me wrong, LGBT and such are important, but that&#39;s not the job of Mozilla.The last blow: getting rid of Brendan. Maybe he didn&#39;t have the same values employees had about LGBT, but fuck this. People in the silicon valley *love* being offended. And that thing was just too good of a fight for them. Brendan was the last bastion standing.I&#39;m so so so mad.Mitchell trusted the wrong people. We were seeing all these ambitious silicon-valley-puppets taking the position of PM, director, etc etc…Got damn, all we wanted is to make Gecko amazing, light, in a lightweight simple browser. But all these stupid features that were landing on our head…I&#39;m so mad…Rant over."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the things I love about Deno is that since it implements standard web APIs, many libraries built for the browser just work. For example, I recently made a simple static site generator with Deno to make my blog, and I found that I could use Marked for markdown support simply by importing it like this:  import &#39;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/marked@3.0.7/marked.min.js&#39;;

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; You can log and style CLI output the same way you do it in the browser’s developer tools: using what you know with console.log&gt; console.log(&#34;%cHello World&#34;, &#34;color: red&#34;);TIL, neat! If anyone else did too - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console#sty... looks greatUsing alert/confirm/prompt for CLI tools is nice too, makes a lot of sense to build that in and use the web APIs for it."</p>

Check disclose.io or the company&#39;s website (look for a security.txt!) to make sure there&#39;s some sort of safe harbor provision, or a pre-existing vulnerability disclosure program or bug bounty program that allows you to do this kind of testing.If you&#39;re not going to do that, then disclose the vulnerability anonymously and cover your ass while you&#39;re testing, or just don&#39;t.Meanwhile if you&#39;re an American please write your local representative and express your displeasure with the antiquated, overly-simplistic CFAA and ask them to support initiatives to have it replaced or removed."</p>
