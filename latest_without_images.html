								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few key differences with other OSS companies that IMHO are positive:1) Element or other matrix components do not require a copy right transfer. That means Element is hard to re-license under another license than its current one.2) The license for Element is Apache 2.0. A fine choice for any OSS project looking to maintain a healthy ecosystem of contributors for decades to come.3) The ecosystem has a diversity of stakeholders and contributors outside of Element the company maintaining various components, integrations, etc. It&#39;s an ecosystem that already serves many millions of users.4) Not all the Matrix components are under the Element umbrella (see 3). Element is probably dominant in this community but it&#39;s based on merit rather than ownership. E.g. the Matrix foundation is mostly run by people outside of Element. Even the Element apps have contributions from outside Element the company (see 1).5) Decentralization is at the core of the Element sales pitch. They are unlikely to want to walk back on that; or even be able to do that without damaging their credibility. For better or worse, that&#39;s what they are selling and stuck with. And they seem successful with it too. Hence the investment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Element foundation should use some of that sweet money to:1) buy FluffyChat and some serious UI designers, because Element is probably one of the worst matrix clients in terms of UX.2) fix decryption issues that happen randomly even by just using Element on the matrix.org server: https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/issues/1721 as it&#39;s a real show-stopper once you hit it3) add support for multiple accounts and identities (too many requests to list on the issue tracker), since federation is great, but it&#39;s not always wanted.Disclaimer: I managed to convince a group of technical users to switch over to matrix. We stay for the principle, but not really for the experience so far. FluffyChat is the best client we tried on mobile. On desktop, I&#39;m glad weechat-matrix and gomuks exist, because all the other clients &#34;reek&#34; to us. And even if you like the modern chat UIs, they&#39;re really not bug-free either.Overall many clients and some severs to choose from, but I did prefer irc just for the simple-no-BS-clients alone (the protocol has nothing to do with it)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fluffychat is mentioned a lot here as a good UI/UX alternative to Element. Just wanted to bring up another that I&#39;m working on called Syphon. It&#39;s not at the stage where it can compete with Fluffychat in terms of spec parity or maturity, but I think it&#39;s worth discussing as an effort.https://syphon.orghttps://github.com/syphon-org/syphonLike I said, it&#39;s still very much in Alpha and needs quite a bit of work, but the UX flows and design have been well received by others. Though there is an opinionated default UX and design paradigm, there is a focus is to make everything customizable and the theming options are growing over every release.The goal is to eventually find a sweet spot between Discord and Signal and bridge the gap to Matrix between those communities.I have a demanding day job and other obligations that keep me busy, but I spend nearly all my free time and every vacation in the last year working on this project. We&#39;re constantly looking for other contributors and there&#39;s several other ways to help including donations. Feel free to  join the official room for updates to track progress and please feel free to reach out with feedback!https://matrix.to/#/#syphon:matrix.orgAdditionally, I just merged Multi-account support this week and it will be in the next release. Not sure of any other Matrix client that has this feature, so there&#39;s some unique features that we&#39;re focusing on to set it apart."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something about this reminds me of the &#39;Winning Ticket Hypothesis&#39; in artifical neural networks: that some &#39;random&#39; initializations prime a network far better for later faster learning. From https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635 - the abstract:Neural network pruning techniques can reduce the parameter counts of trained networks by over 90%, decreasing storage requirements and improving computational performance of inference without compromising accuracy. However, contemporary experience is that the sparse architectures produced by pruning are difficult to train from the start, which would similarly improve training performance.We find that a standard pruning technique naturally uncovers subnetworks whose initializations made them capable of training effectively. Based on these results, we articulate the &#34;lottery ticket hypothesis:&#34; dense, randomly-initialized, feed-forward networks contain subnetworks (&#34;winning tickets&#34;) that - when trained in isolation - reach test accuracy comparable to the original network in a similar number of iterations. The winning tickets we find have won the initialization lottery: their connections have initial weights that make training particularly effective.We present an algorithm to identify winning tickets and a series of experiments that support the lottery ticket hypothesis and the importance of these fortuitous initializations. We consistently find winning tickets that are less than 10-20% of the size of several fully-connected and convolutional feed-forward architectures for MNIST and CIFAR10. Above this size, the winning tickets that we find learn faster than the original network and reach higher test accuracy.Are these innate patterns of activity priming mammalian brains in a similar way?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To put this into context, retinal waves (essentially self-propagating excitations along the retina) pre-birth have been known to exist and help neural organization for what must be 20-30 years. What&#39;s new in this paper is that they additionally confirmed that the direction of the propagating waves coincided with the mouse&#39;s typical optical flow pattern, essentially helping priming motion-detection neurons in addition to the well-known edge-detection neurons early.I wouldn&#39;t compare this to dreaming really, it&#39;s a very different process where top-down connections hallucinate sensations. This is a completely bottom-up process, it&#39;s more or less like a test-bench connected to the optic nerve generating moving edges pre-birth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; A new Yale study suggests that, in a sense, mammals dream about the world they are about to experience before they are even born.&#34;In a sense&#34; ... A bit of a click-baity title for what amounts to suggesting that brain wiring is primed for sensing the world, which is not news.The study itself looks to be more about how the brain primes itself (visual systems specifically). It may or may not have anything to do with dreaming."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is amazing. I built one to help my nephew walk, and now selling commercially ( http://trexorobotics.com )I am fed-up at the lack of options available to individuals. People thought that everyone will get an exoskeleton and be able to walk with it everywhere. But the industry ran into many challenges.A big one that many dont understand is getting insurance coverage. The way the US healthcare system is designed, it will only cover restoration of mobility, not a restoration of function. So, from their perspective, a wheelchair and some pain meds can do the job easily.I believe that they key is to start with children, this is where you have families desperate for a solution, higher costs due to them growing and spending their entire life in a wheelchair, and the option to truly have a life changing impact.But things are changing, people are starting to notice the work that we are doing. We need a lot more people building exoskeletons and similar powered orthotics!!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been making my own, purely as a pipe-dream to have some hope of walking again, it&#39;s not easy but I&#39;m hoping it&#39;ll be a better fit than consumer ones, and probably cheaper.I feel like we&#39;ve made leaps and bounds in prosthetics this past decade but orthotics and exoskeletons haven&#39;t been following the trend for some reason. As an engineer I imagine there are some significant design constraints that make it hard but seeing what we&#39;re capable of doing in any other industry I can&#39;t help but feel the problem has to be something other than purely technical limitations.  
The price is also a big issue, 10k for the cheapest exoskeletons, 150k for the one in this article."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Because IE was seriously outdated, lacking support for cutting-edge web APIs and technologies enabling the modern websites and web apps we use today.This is just false, or at best only half of the story to make a false equivalence. IE was cutting edge until Firefox. The biggest problem with IE was all the insanely weird shit it did, not missing features. It would “fix” missing tags, that would then be broken on every standards compliant browser, had active x, and had an absolutely insane amount of security bugs.Mobile safari ain’t the IE of the modern day. It’s just fucking not. I’m sorry. Chrome is closer to IE than Safari because of market share AND developers developing exclusively for it forgetting anything and everything else.Does mobile safari still suck? Sure. But we don’t need to call it IE or constantly drone on with comparisons to IE. Let something suck in its own unique and shitty way, please."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple has its own opinions about what web standards it should implement. It’s as simple as that. Google has been extremely successful in convincing developers that browsers that don’t behave like Chrome are behaving wrong.Don’t get me wrong, I wish Safari had more features, fewer bugs, and an evergreen release cycle. It’s clear Apple do not see themselves as competing with Chrome, largely because of iOS, and I do want them to take it more seriously. But the people who write Chrome explicitly do not care about other browsers, and think that the world would be a better place if Chrome were the only one. Between that behavior and the whole AMP fiasco, I’m surprised so much of the blame gets thrown at Apple for destroying the web. Am I supposed to be writing PWAs now, or AMP pages? If Reddit can’t figure it out, how the fuck am I supposed to?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"  &gt;Why did developers and software engineers hate IE so much? Because IE was seriously outdated, lacking support for cutting-edge web APIs and technologies enabling the modern websites and web apps we use today.

Nonsense. The almost universal contempt for Internet Exploder amongst web developers had nothing to do with lack of support for cutting edgw APIs. It was because Internet Exploder refused to follow basic web standards and was stuffed it full of proprietary and  non-standard rendering quirks.This meant you could guarantee that any website you designed and that you ensured followed web standards and rendered perfectly on every browser known to man would either break or display completely differently on IE. So you had to then pollute your lovely clean code with countless ugly hacks and conditionals just to ensure your site rendered the same on IE as it did everywhere else.That was why every web developer not working in a Microsoft bubble loathed that browser."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you haven&#39;t read the state of California&#39;s claims here you should. It&#39;s the result of a two year investigation and the claims are.. shocking.I want to make a point about &#34;culture fit&#34;. &#34;Culture fit&#34; in a company typically comes down to &#34;we like you&#34; and the reason why people like other people is that they are like them. Similar age, background, whatever. It&#39;s why Stanford grads probably like other Stanford grads.This &#34;we like you&#34; can and does lead to discrimination.But here&#39;s the even darker side of this. Toxic cultures of sexual harassment as alleged in the complaint against Activision-Blizzard always come down to a few key individuals who then &#34;spread&#34; by hiring or promoting other people who are like then. I doubt this is ever explicit. It&#39;s more that you can sense a fellow predator (make no mistake: they are preying on vulnerable staff).So without intervention this toxicity will tend to spread. Those who oppose it will leave. Those who tow the lines get promoted.And it&#39;s leadership&#39;s responsibility to root this out and eliminate it. Heads should roll here. Maybe even J Allen Brack&#39;s and/or Bobby Kotick&#39;s. If you want to take credit for the successes you also have to take responsibility for the giant failures here.Oh and whoever wrote and sent out that statement about how the state was pursuing this was why so many businesses are leaving California needs to be fired. It was so utterly tone deaf and irrelevant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems to largely match a lot of the same things that happened with Riot Games over the last couple of years. I am hoping that these actions can help spread awareness of any issues that may be present at Blizzard and past, current, and future employees won&#39;t face the same issues. It is a long road to be traveled to get there.I hope that the current WFH situation doesn&#39;t detract from the walkout. A lot of the visibility raised when Riot went through this was outside of the Riot gates where employees were congregated.Without speculating on the claims, I do find it interesting that the DFEH has lawsuits against both Riot Games and Blizzard for similar issues. I recall reading that Riot&#39;s response was that the DFEH was not working in good faith: are both of these companies aligning their responses, is the DFEH out of line, or is the industry just that broken?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Appeal to public opinion is generally a great idea but there is a risk.  Activision gets no sympathy from me, but I also don&#39;t think the answer will come from the masses. 
 I&#39;m not sure that most gamers really care about sexism in the gaming industry.  Video games are synthetic, we don&#39;t really see the people behind them.  At least in movies we see the actors.  If push comes to shove, I think most gamers will still be lining up for the latest AAA title no matter what they hear about the company that created it.  Imho change therefore has to come from something other than public opinion.  This lawsuit is exactly that: the government enforcing a code of behavior because the market clearly cannot do it on its own.  The system is working."</p>

It&#39;s so counter intuitive that a thin column of water can cause the same pressure as a wide one.The video they link shows this in action:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some hull shapes are inherently unstable. The slightest deviation from pristine vertical balance will make the ship flip. However, even hull shapes that are initially stable at some angle reach their limits. All of these examples assume the deck is perfectly sealed and that water doesn’t get into the hull.Loosely related: here is a video of the German Maritime Search and Rescue Service (DGzRS) trying to &#39;sink&#39; one of their (then new) smaller rescue lifeboats which has self-righting capabilities:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dz_N6MG5tt0(Ofcourse it was a test if it does have these capabilities, not an attempt at actually sinking it.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Zulip&#39;s search is powered by this built-in Postgres full-text search feature, and it&#39;s been a fantastic experience. There&#39;s a few things I love about it:* One can cheaply compose full-text search with other search operators by just doing normal joins on database indexes, which means we can cheaply and performantly support tons of useful operators (https://zulip.com/help/search-for-messages).* We don&#39;t have to build a pipeline to synchronize data between the real database and the search database. Being a chat product, a lot of the things users search for are things that changed recently; so lag, races, and inconsistencies are important to avoid. With the Postgres full-text search, all one needs to do is commit database transactions as usual, and we know that all future searches will return correct results.* We don&#39;t have to operate, manage, and scale a separate service just to support search. And neither do the thousands of self-hosted Zulip installations.Responding to the &#34;Scaling bottleneck&#34; concerns in comments below, one can send search traffic (which is fundamentally read-only) to a replica, with much less complexity than a dedicated search service.Doing fancy scoring pipelines is a good reason to use a specialized search service over the Postgres feature.I should also mention that a weakness of Postgres full-text search is that it only supports doing stemming for one language. The excellent PGroonga extension (https://pgroonga.github.io/) supports search in all languages; it&#39;s a huge improvement especially for character-based languages like Japanese. We&#39;re planning to migrate Zulip to using it by default; right now it&#39;s available as an option.More details are available here: https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/full-text-..."</p>

Here&#39;s their implementation and you can see how well this works in practice.  http://blog.flowdock.com/2017/08/31/the-1-customer-request-h...Far far better than other abominations like slack - which hides streams of conversation behind a wall, making the UX terrible."</p>
