								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Why not just set $TERM to dumb or xterm without color support? Or change all color definitions in the terminal to print the same color?&gt; The terminal is capable of color and should be able to print color when instructed. NO_COLOR is a hint to the software running in the terminal to suppress addition of color, not to the terminal to prevent any color from being shown.I have to admit I don&#39;t really get this. I personally like colorized output, and I can&#39;t even think of situations where the colors chosen by a developer were so bad I wanted to disable them completely.I respect others like no color (and there&#39;s already a solution per that, above), but I don&#39;t quite get the desire to have just some color (prompts but not applications). Can someone with this opinion explain their rationale?Normally I wouldn&#39;t care,
 -- individual preferences are like opinions and everyone is entitled to their own -- but this imposes work on every developer/application.  There&#39;s certainly ways to implement this that minimize impact, but it&#39;s still a non-zero up-front and ongoing maintenance/testing cost."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m starting to be of the mind that environment variables in general are an anti-pattern. They have arbitrary scope, their lifetime is not clear, and they are not easily composable.  This was not something that bothered me so acutely until I started using declarative config with NixOS to configure my system, and found environment variables to be a big wart on this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is a fine idea but I wonder about this part:&#34;... should check for the presence of a NO_COLOR environment variable that, when present (regardless of its value), prevents the addition of ANSI color ...&#34;How common is this behavior ?That is, the presence of the env var regardless of its value trips the conditional ?That seems like asking for trouble / confusion ... especially since there is a very well understood practice of setting 0/1 false/true for settings like this.Is this commonly done and I have just never noticed it ?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieceshttps://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/I failed the interview for an internship I really wanted in my 2nd year of engineering; I did get a shit internship that summer, but being really shaken at my incompetence, I took up this book, and quite honestly, it changed everything!It truly sparked an interest in systems for me. The book helped me build a strong foundation in systems; Processes, memory, filesystems, networks, concurrency, synchronization and more. After reading OSTEP, it felt like an epiphany, and I charted a path for the rest of 2 years of college around distributed systems, systems research, and virtualization.And the best part is that all this knowledge is free! Kudos to Professor Remzi and his work!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SICP for CS and programming. That book (and its exercises) really instilled in me the thought patterns that drastically improved my programming skills and made me realize how important fundamental CS knowledge is to being a good programmer. What I learned from that book was: becoming comfortable with recursion, realizing the importance of abstractions, functional programming concepts and it gave me insights into how interpreters and the machine work.I studied math in university and the book that really improved me mathematically was baby rudin. I really struggled with this the first time I worked through it and had to also fall back on Abott&#39;s analysis book, but after my first analysis course I worked through Rudin again and it just clicked. The exercises are really well chosen and the text is just so on point. Every sentence in the book is extremely carefully chosen and of fundamental importance to what Rudin wants to teach you.It&#39;s really rare that you find textbooks that almost kind of have a certain magic to them, like you are directly taught by one of the greatest minds in that field. These two books definitely meet that criteria."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Code, by Charles Petzold. It came to me at exactly the right time, and broke through the biggest conceptual barrier I’d had until that point; how do you actually go from logic gates to general purpose computing? Having Petzold walk you up the ladder of abstraction, never missing a link, really got me over the hump of treating all that complexity as a black box. On a meta level it gave me confidence to go approach apparently impossible things with an open mind and dig deep enough that you see how the “magic” works."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As much as I enjoy reading this news. It is feels heavily sensationalized.&#34;Smashes&#34; the energy record.We&#39;re talking about a fusion generator here, that after 25 years of work, now manages to output &#39;double&#39; the energy, to 59 MJ in 5s -like 20 MW- while requiring 180 MJ input power.Somewhere hidden in the article is the news that this could mean a input/output ratio of 10 in a full scale reactor, but that&#39;s also something we&#39;ve been waiting on for decades.I find it easy to be enthusiastic about fusion, but the news and research surrounding it makes me sad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Excellent news, we need this so badly, especially now in Europe with Germany shutting down its nuclear (fission) plants and NS2 being cancelled. It&#39;s astonishing to me that the world isn&#39;t pulling out all the stops on fusion development, something like the space race or Manhattan project.Unfortunately, last I heard ITER building has halted: http://news.newenergytimes.net/2022/02/21/french-regulator-h..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Skeptical. This video by Sabine clearly explains why a lot of these fusion research claims are dubious with a focus on ITER and JET: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ4W1g-6JiY"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"How does this scale? I assume with all the unreviewed advisories today and with the oncoming PRs, it will require a full team operating on all cylinders.Will the team add more members to triage these things or bring upon better automations to ensure no exploitation happens through the process such as incentivizing trusted members of various ecosystems to help?I love the idea of a public ledger using GitHub &amp; PRs, but could more be done here to instill trust outside a single GitHub account? Perhaps even GitHub organizations could help out further of these known ecosystems.With security advisories, it seems a bit worrying to see unreviewed advisories to yet be categorized or PRs be open for more than a few days with updated details."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Project Oberon is awesome!I found the Project Oberon book in SFSU library and read it cover to cover.  Such a tight, elegant system.  Pretty much complete: Oberon OS includes compiler for Oberon language!Language was self-hosted (compiler written in itself) and Prof. Wirth had a heuristic: no feature could be added to the lang/compiler if it made compiling the compiler slower.There are several emulators, in C, JS, Java, and Python, and there&#39;s Verilog so you can burn to FPGA and make a real workstation.  People have.The system has two kinds of OOP.  There is the C++/Java/Python/etc. kind where you basically add methods to a record type, and there is the old school Smalltalk message-passing kind, where elements of the OS communicate through an extendable message bus.The GUI system, especially with the &#34;Gadgets&#34; subsystem, is mind-blowing.  It would take too long to go over it at the moment, but there are features there that still haven&#39;t made it into mainstream GUI systems.  If I get a minute later today I&#39;ll come back and add a note detailing some of the awesome if someone else hasn&#39;t already filled in the picture."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This project is still a great example of a complete computer design, starting from Niklaus Wirth&#39;s own RISC5 CPU (not a RISC-V) and very simple peripherals over the OS, runtime/garbage collector, compiler, GUI and simple example applications.One problem of the original implementation is that it was based on an old Xilinx Spartan 3 development board. This is not only no longer available, but it is one of the few FPGA boards that used 32 bit wide fast (12 ns IIRC) asynchronous SRAM chips. Wirth&#39;s hardware design relies heavily on this.Some years ago, there was a compatible board, the OberonStation. However, it seems this is no longer manufactured: https://pcper.com/2015/12/meet-the-oberonstation-kid-friendl...However, some modified designs exist that implement a cache in FPGA block RAM and an SDRAM controller. These can be used with more recent FPGA boards:- FleaFPGA &#34;Ohm&#34; board with a Lattice ECP5  FPGA and 32 MB RAM (https://fleasystems.com/fleaFPGA_Ohm.html) - https://github.com/Basman74/Oberon_SDRAM- Radiona ulx3s, another ECP5 in an open source design  (https://github.com/emard/oberon) - https://github.com/emard/oberon- PapilioPro using a Xilinx Spartan 6 LX, another open source PCB design (https://papilio.cc/index.php?n=Papilio.PapilioPro) - https://opencores.org/projects/oberon_sdramShameless plug: my student Rikke&#39;s port of Project Oberon to RV32I (this is a real RISC-V), however, we still need to find some time to build an FPGA-based SoC. Currently, it runs in emulation: https://github.com/solbjorg/oberon-riscv"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Oberon channel has several videos of Oberon in action,https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=The+Oberon+Chan...While Oberon was quite cool, people should also learn about its Xerox influence,&#34;Eric Bier Demonstrates Cedar&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_dt7NG38V4Also dive into what happened afterwards, Oberon-2, Active Oberon, Zonnon,...Active Oberon could be considered quite modern, also makes the distinction between safe and unsafe pointers, which improves the experience for low level coding.https://github.com/metacore/A2OSOne of the best things about these systems is proving what systems programming with automatic memory management were capable of.Given Oberon-2&#39;s influence on Go, maybe improving Fyne (https://fyne.io/fynedesk/) with something like gRPC for the dynamic experience, could be a possible sucessor."</p>
